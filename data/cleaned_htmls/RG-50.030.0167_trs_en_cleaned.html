<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you tell me your name please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Preben Munch-Nielsen. I think that's it's very difficult.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And where were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Snegerstein (ph) in Denmark.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What year?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Twenty-six.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me what it was like for you growing up as a child in Snegerstein.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it's a wonderful little village. A little harbor. Fishermen and uh most of our spare time - it was at the strait between Denmark and Sweden - harbor, sailing and we had a little work. It was very fresh and very good and maybe healthy life. Had a good time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What uh what were your parents like? Tell me about your family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh well, I'm grown up by my grandmother who at the year, at the age of 60 suddenly because of divorces and death got five grandchildren to bring up. And one is living here in Washington, in the Crystal town outside. Another lives in Paris and my sister and I live in Denmark. So we are spread a little bit. But we had a wonderful time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I went to school in Copenhagen. That was an old tradition. And uh on our school, uh</p><p> school in Copenhagen. That's , uh south of there in the must <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> Schoolmates. There was no distinction between a Jew and a non-Jew. They were Danes and in our society there was no, you couldn't say that's a Jew, that's not a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As you got older, uh what did you hear about uh if anything in the early thirties, uh mid- thirties, about Germany and about Hitler?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh well, the most I recall that Germany always our enemy number one, and what happened in Germany was very very bad for Denmark. You know when you have the tiger at the doorstep you have to be very careful of it. There was not the possibility to say quite a lot against him and probably - I can tell you that in Denmark, uh the highest of the three percent who voted for Nazi parti.. the Nazis. And we were neighbors so Denmark is an old country with an old democratic tradition. Every form of dictatorship whether it is fascism, communism, that's that's not Danish. So I don't think - of course we were afraid.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How as a child, as a young chi... young boy, did you feel the fear and feel the concern?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because we were foolish enough to believe when you have a non-aggression treaty with a man, he will keep it. That's the way we live.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about the German invasion, for you. What was it like? When did you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was really exciting because in the morning I saw the most aircrafts I ever saw. You know in in "40 to see an airplane - that was something. And one morning there was hundreds going from Copenhagen near us to and then going back over Copenhagen. And while I was had to go to school, and I knew nothing about the invasion, the occupation.</p><p>But when I came to Copenhagen, to the station there, the German soldiers were there and we were shocked. Really shocked because we had no idea about it. Nothing. There was no shooting you know. Uh I suppose that thirteen Danish soldiers was killed during the invasion. There was, well, we couldn't stand anything against the Hitler war machine. We had I suppose ten thousand soldiers in Denmark and well, they put ten times as much through Denmark to - his main uh goal was to conquer Norway and they did that too you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to you? The year is 1940. You're a 14 year old boy. What did you do after the - what was your life like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, there was not a big change. The only thing happening which was really, you you saw it at the same time, was the black-out. From one day to another, you had to black- out. Denmark was totally blacked-out. And maybe you'll understand how it was later to stand in the blacked-out beach in Denmark and look three miles over the straits, the water demarking Denmark from Sweden, where the lights were just like pearls on a string. It was so fantastic uh but the first thing there was the black-out. And then of course there were lack of goods and uh there was no connection with England anymore, and our biggest trade partner and uh - but in the beginning the Germans tried to act just like <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> human beings. There was what, we should be the model. We were the vikings, and we should be - I don't know what he wanted us to be - but there was not, you was not disturbed much by the Germans in the day-to-day, in the beginning.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When did that change for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, for me, you see we were shocked to lost our freedom and every resistance movement first part - I was only 15 when I started - it was to be a messenger boy. Deliver</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> for papers. Illegal papers of course. Because the first thing you really noticed is that all the news are censored. You only hear what the Germans, the Germans wanted you to hear. And therefore it was important to keep the real messages, to give the real news and that was to be duplicated and brought out by boys like me and it is of elder people but that was the way we started and it was the beginning to the resistance movement in Denmark, before the , before anything else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you get recruited?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, one of our teachers was uh became rather a famous figure in the resistance movement and uh as I went to school in Copenhagen, lived forty kilometers from there, I was a very good guy to have to put from one place to another. And then later on it was, we couldn't have all the papers with us on the train, then we duplicated our own papers and brought around.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was your teacher?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> AE . Heard about him. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: School boy. Doing what I've done all the time. I was not in the sabotage groups. We only had the papers and we thought that was enough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You have described the change in the beginning of the government. Uh how did it become for you more involved in helping the Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: When the uh Jewish New Year, about the first of October, uh we heard that the Germans would arrest the Jews and one day, it was the 2nd or 3rd of October, one of the leaders from the , uh asked me to be there and there, uh to follow, to fetch some <span class="page-break" number="3"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did secure mean?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That they were not captured. That we were able to see there were no uh on the way. Also they had to react in a special way - very silent. Uh we had a problem with children sometimes but we have Doctor . He gave them injection, the children.</p><p>But he was very afraid sometimes because he said I don't know this patient - how much can I do, but nothing happened. It was, they came over all and we never lost a passenger.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said you went on some trips. (Yes.) What was your role? What did you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's, first of all to carry some things and well, some times they ordered me to - I'ma</p><p> , I've been sailing all my life, so have an order to go from there to there and elsewhere to clean up the boats. If you can imagine how the boat is when a dozen of refugees afraid, what they leave after in the the cabin was well, I can still recall the smell.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you do when you would get to Sweden with the boat load of passengers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What I would do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Un-hum. What was your role? Did you take them any further?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No no no. I uh returned - I only went over by when we had the possibility to go two or three trips a night. Because as I told you, in the daytime the boat was was situated in in Sweden. But sometimes we were very lucky. and the German patrol boat is far away. Then we could go two and three trips because sometimes it only took twenty minutes to pass the strait between Denmark and Sweden. So then I returned back to Denmark.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you tell me, on the night of October Ist and 2nd when the , of course that <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were doing this for sometime. (Yeah.) How long did you continue this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, you must recall that uh the transport groups was not only for uh the Danish Jews. It was also for the Danish resistance movement. So I continued and and then until the end of November when I was over in Sweden and was told not to return because uh some of our groups were taken, arrested, and then I had to stay in Sweden for the rest of the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before we get to Sweden, can you describe some of your fellow resistance colleagues?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>You mentioned Thormod (ph).</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh Thormod. Well, I can tell you that they were of course grown up. They were all ten, fifteen years older than I, very responsible people, very - people who really had guts.</p><p>They dared to do things. They were very cleaver in this way that they would never do something which had too much risk. They was always in safety problems. One of them two months later shot himself (ph) but survived, is still alive and uh one was an editor. He was captured by the Gestapo and got escaped. Uh one of the very - what you call it - the starter of the whole thing in Snegerstein - the uh innkeeper, Thompson (ph) was captured, died in Copenhagen. And uh that was, of course normal people,</p><p> a police officer, one editor, one was uh uh bookbinder, Mr. , most famous of them all who saved the most of the times and later on was captured in what we called , the next boat, and was captured. The next boat was sunk by the Germans and uh was captured and sent to a concentration camp. But they were all quite normal people. You see, maybe you wouldn't recognize them when you met them on the street in the daylight. Very, was good leaders. They were people you followed and they .</p><p>They did a good job.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to you when you got to Sweden and you were told you cannot go back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, it was so nice because one of the, the _-- was there, the police officer : You know, in Sweden you say "Uncle" to an eld.. older man now. To me, he was Uncle</p><p> . So the first night I spent in the jail in , but for open doors and the next <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> happened. But after , after there was a change over there. But we were treated <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You have been instrumental in bringing to the Museum a boat with the numbers 0 - 2 on it. Uh tell us, you told me before that you uh rode on that boat in the course of this. Tell me a little bit about that would you please?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: UR, it was strange because the first boat that we had never had the possibility to go to Sweden because it was grounded the first - it was a party boat we took - really took, and it was grounded (cough) and destroyed. And then we got this boat. It was bought by (cough) uh the bookbinder from - it was a boat laying in the harbor of and uh that was a very good boat and sound boat built in the beginning of the thirties. It was of course a wooden boat with a good engine and uh it was able to go rather quick eight or nine miles, and that it fora__ boat. And when it started, . The first night I remember had two or three, no two trips to Sweden and I think we got ten to twelve passengers every time. And then later on we had in October 700 Jews and uh totally I know by this boat brought about 1,400 people from Denmark to Sweden. And as I told you before I (cough) was, my last trip to Sweden with this boat.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh before you got to stay there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh was that trip anything special? Do you remember...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I can tell you that I never had anything special in all the time, in the couple of trips that I took. Normally there was no excitement. The excitement was before and when we were able to see north and south, and so there was no German ships. OK. And it was a little boat and the radar was not so uh so uh normal on the German ships at that time and when, if there was a little bit of waves it was very difficult to to find the boat. But it was not so difficult to go from Denmark to Sweden because as I told you before, if you go from a black dock, place into the lights. That's easy to find the way. It was when we had to go back and find the right place and be met by the right people and not by the wrong people, that was the most exciting part of the of the whole thing. You can see that to go to Sweden where we were accepted and and welcomed, sometimes I know that uh sailed near the Swedish coast because there were Swedish fisher boats took over the the Jewish passengers and brought them to the sho... un to the harbors. And that gave time savings.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you describe being in the Danish Brigade in Sweden, uh would you tell me what it was like please, going home with that Brigade?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I say that's fantastic because we thought we were going home to fight, to throw out to throw out the Germans out of Denmark and the only shots from that was roses thrown on us, flowers thrown on us. It was just, you know. The Germans surrendered on the 4th and we arrived in , my hometown, on the Sth in the morning. And it was you <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> know, it was it was an excitement. It was a joy. You, I, it will be the best day I ever had you know. Free, free and freedom is something you can't describe. Everybody happy. Let us out of this world.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was Denmark like at that point?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well Denmark is my country and of course it's wonderful. That's - you must recall we have a very high in my country. We've had the same royal family more than 1,000 years. More than 1,000 years. Queen Martha II was a descendent of King who reigned Denmark about the 9th century, so we never had a revolution. It, the big uh like reforms were made by the people who owned the land, the counts. It was an absolute sovereign king who gave us the freedom of choosing. At that time the other kings were beheaded, but he was beloved. That's the difference. It's been so that they have been very cleaver. They have given the dime before the dollar was I suppose. That's uh the way. And maybe it also gives some of the explanation why it happened in Denmark in this way. If you realize that when you have a country where the tensions are rather low, and other countries in Europe - what did they use when the tension was very high - they tried to divert the tension and then was the easiest way to</p><p> , kill a few Jews here, kill a few Jews there. But we never had that. We <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 0 did you have any kind of reunion or meet with any more of the club? <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 people in need. So there's no question uh of why or why not. You just did. That's the way you're brought up. That's the way of the tradition in in my country. You help of course.</p><p>And therefore I don't think it's - 1 - could you have retained your self-respect if you, knew what these people would suffer and said no. Not likely. No. No way. So that's not a problem of of - you just have to do it. And nothing else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 2 understand why that we we are not able to understand this to try to try to separate Jews from Danes. And that that may be one of the reasons why there was not this, they were not a special group. They never lived in ghettos. And they were I think that the Jews integrated into the Danish society so quick so there was no problem. I know that in - I don't know whether it was the late 30's when we had some people from Austria and were agriculture uh scheme in Denmark, Jewish from Austria, young Jews. Even they went into the Danish society very soon. One of my wife's and I best friends, Mr. Phillips (ph), he's still speaking a little bit Austrian. He came in "38. There's one word he never learned to say in Danish. But he came in "38 as in the scheme. That was the only way to get an visa to Denmark. That was the only possibility to get into Denmark. And uh he still tells about this. He was not a farmer but OK, he started fair enough in a farm in Denmark and stayed there. Now he's just retired. He w as director for uh what you call it - book publisher. But he's Danish. He's Danish. And uh therefore there's there is no difference and that's what I want to point out. That all these things, that is nonsense to us to talk about a special group of people.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Will you take a minute as long as we have the tape and talk specifically about the boat "0 - 2" for the Museum. Um, it would be good to have it on tape. Tell me what you know of it's history.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, you see, I've heard a bit . [know that it was built in the beginning of <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 3</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, in the start of the mess you know, to put people who had never been in a in a boat before, coming with everything they could have and afraid, first to calm them down. And then yourself excited and then suddenly you go out in the sea. It's a little bit wavy there, and people are very silent, very very silent. And you smell the the fear. We knew, we were not in the cabin because we stood in the in the back, but we knew at that time when we left, however, we would return. And we were positively sure that we would go over to Sweden without problems. And, but first out, well then you have nothing else to do - just sail and be calm. But the people down there was not able to see anything because they have to stay in the cabin. They had a much worse situation than we who could see. So it was easier to stand on the open deck than sit in the cabin. But normally as I said, there was no special experiences. It was only you go from here, you go over there and you will be there in so and so long time and maybe you'll be a little bit seasick. Uh, and anyway we we hoped the weather should be rough. It was easier for us to go over because they were, people, the Germans would never see us. But there was never an, you see episodes or - it was rather smooth sailing most of the time and as I told you before, we never lost a passenger. That indicates also that it's been smooth sailing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Thank you, thank you very much. <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 4 Tape #2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Alright. Now we're back on camera. Tell me, uh this trip that was different from some of the others and your system?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We have a system and saying when we return to Denmark, if a red light go in; if there's a green light stay away. But one day there was no lights and but we took the chance and uh there was no one on the beach. There was no problem at all. OK. Sometimes it's human to fail and somebody had forgotten to put the light on, but uh everything ended happily.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was it like going in with no lights? How did you feel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Scared. But uh send a prayer upwards. At that time that was one of the last uh chance for the Jewish refugees but we were so used to uh this procedure that normally it was calm and it choose to be the same thing now. There was no problem at all. Only that one had forgotten to do what he had to do. But. . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did your captain find his way in without lights?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we have in Denmark uh pilots of course, but then we had people which we called "men who knows" and that's people who know that exactly part of the the border, of the of the shore and uh it's so in Denmark in the straits that the sand reefs, there are some sand reefs, that they are shifting every year. But if you know them you can go from one reef through a hole into another and then you should be a man who knows the way to do it all as people they would drown. And uh the captain knew the thing. He knew every inch of the uh beach and the shore outside. It's interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're going in. Your lights had failed. Your signals had failed. If you were caught, did you have guns to defend yourself?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We never had a gun. We don't think it could help anything. Uh we couldn't resist uh a German patrol and we had also the security of our passengers to think of. So we never had a gun. It was a gunless army. . | think that that shows that sometimes <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 5 better than in a, the German concentration camps. So there was really difference if you were taken with guns, explosives - then that would be a death penalty, but we had no use of them. We shouldn't catch fish with the guns.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were going in, and the signals had failed, did your passengers know about this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, there was no passengers then. We were alone. We were on the way in after coming from Sweden. No, there were no passengers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh, let's go back a minute and describe going out again from Denmark to Sweden. Can you describe for me the reactions of some of your passengers on on one of your trips?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Describe for me the people on the boat, how they reacted.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I really think they reacted what everybody can expect. Somebody are calm.</p><p>Somebody are very uneasy. Some have children with them and they had a double responsibility. They are much more afraid and but normally, and 1 know it fromuh | and Thormod Larson who have done it many many times, they said that it was remarkable peace, remarkable calm on the most, of the, from the side of the passengers most time. There was very seldom that some of the passengers would do anything.</p><p>Because they understand that's their last chance. And that was the last attempt in their uh way from Denmark to Sweden. And I really think they were very calm in the boat also when we started. And very much joy there too when when we said now we're on the right side of the strait. That was a relief and that, that was in my -I understood it. I understood it. But uh there was never the disorder or something like that. No. But some of them, they had I suppose a out. And maybe also to the boat. <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
