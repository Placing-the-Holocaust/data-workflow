So the line was going slowly, slowly, slowly, and so we stay, my father, mother, we stay all together, and my uncle, and the two little babies. And suddenly, you know, this is the worst moment in my life. I know why I was always -- use that. That particular moment, I will never forget that. I don't know from where, I don't know why, suddenly arri -- arrived four Germans on horses. White, beautiful horses. And on every horse was a general, a German general.

So, when the group was about 150 already, we moved. The other, they moved. He -- we -- he took it out of that. They basically save us, kind of, in a way. So, he say, you follow me.
