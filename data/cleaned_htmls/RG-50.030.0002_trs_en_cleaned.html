<body><dialogue class=""><p><p>RITA KERNER HILTON August 12, 1994</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I need you to start off by telling me your name, where you were born, what year you were born in, and your name as it was then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right. My name is Rita Kerner Hilton. I was born in Warsaw in 1926, July 22, 1926. I lived in Warsaw until I was six years old, seven years old, and then we moved to my mother's hometown Pomortsy. This is near Lodz, exiled city. My grandfather was a practicing dentist there and since my mother was a dentist, they decided to practice together. That's where I lived until the war broke out and the Ghettos and so on.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me a little bit about your life growing up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I was a small girl, my parents were doing very well financially. My father was a entrepreneur. My mother wasn't working at that time, and we always had a maid. I had a nanny when I was small. When we moved into Pomortsy, my grandmother was running the house, but she always had sleep-in help. Since my mother worked in the office, it was in the same apartment, I had a babysitter, or whoever it was, a part-time governess who'd come in after school hours and do homework with me and read with me, take me out to the park. So, I had kind of a pampered existence. I went to sleep-away camp. I had a bicycle which was, you know, they were expensive. So, I did have a very loving, a very pampered existence at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you particularly religious?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. My grandfather strongly believed in reformed Judaism, which did not exist in Poland as such. They never kept a kosher home. We did observe holidays. We observed Passover, and he used to go to the synagogue on high holidays, sometimes would take me, but it was different. He strongly felt that if there would be a reformed Judaism then he could probably follow it. He could not follow the orthodox, the rabbis teachings, and argue with some of them about it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How integrated were you in the larger community? Were most of your friends Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Did you go to a public school?</p><p> A Well, I went to a public school, which was hard to get in, but this was the best -- I'm talking about primary school. We lived in a so-called new section of town, not the Jewish section, a new section of town. There were maybe about few Jewish kids there, mostly from the prominent families, doctors, lawyers and stuff like this, dentists. And when I first came, I remember one of those days a kid called me a dirty Jew. I was a big girl, I was in first grade, and I gave a smack to the right and a smack to the left, and I never had any problem in that school. When the time came to go to high school, there were three high schools in town. A girls" school, a boys" school and a German school. This town was <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> very much German. There were a lot settled by the Germans. They were German textile markets. This was a textile factory town. And they were having every year there were less Jewish kids accepted there. You had to pass an exam, and you had to be the top of the top of the top to get into that school. If you couldn't get in, you had to commute to Lodz, which was a 45 minute ride by street car. You had to go to private school then which was costly. Well, I got into that school. And again the first few days someone said something about being a Jew, but the principal of the school, she was very anti-semitic, but she was very fair, and she did not stand for any discrimination. And again, I had no problem. I had a bunch of friends, but little by little, I mean, there was one girl, later on, she was in camp with me, Alena, and we used to fight like cats and dogs, but at the same time we were the only Jewish kids in the same level, Jewish girls on that level. The year before they accepted I think three or four or five. Our year they accepted three, the following year they accepted two. The boys had a harder time in school. There were a couple boys who were sons of prominent doctor and they took his penis and dipped it in ink, and also there was a doctor upstairs, a friend of my parents, they had a younger kid.</p><p>He started going to the same school that I did, but they taunted him and he started losing clumps of hair from nervousness, and they had to place him in Jewish schools. The Jewish schools were state schools, but the principals, the teachers, the kids were Jewish, and there were two schools. One was the better one, and the other one wasn't so good.</p><p>But still, in order to get to the high school, if you came from the Polish school, your chances of getting into the high school were much better than if you came from the Jewish school. You know, separated, but equal. And I had, as I said, had not too much problems.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there social and cultural activities?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At one time I know my mother used to go to all those fancy charity balls, a lot of them.</p><p>And I think closer to the war, there were a couple Jewish charity balls. I think she still used to go to the Red Cross ball and so on. But there were less social contact. My mother had a friend, a school friend, who was of a German decent, a very, very prominent family. They owned big factories, and she married a Polish boy. They were patients for years and years and years. They used to socialize, and then closer to the war, that dried out. We didn't have those contacts as such.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, let's talk a little bit about how things started to change. Were you aware of what was going on in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. My aunt lived in Germany. They came to the States before the war. They knew it was coming on. Also, there was a group of Polish people who lived in Germany, never had their German passports. They were never citizens, and in 1937, they all sent them out and we used to collect money for them. We used to give them meals and so on, because they were thrown out from Germany without anything. So, we were aware very much of what was going on. But no one believed it was going to happen, what happened, because during the first World War, the Germans were the better friends than the Russians. <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> People did not like Russians in this part of Poland. So, we were aware, but we never thought they would destroy us all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened when the Germans occupied your town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One of the first actions they put a bunch of restrictions. We couldn't use the street cars.</p><p>We couldn't use the cafe downstairs where everybody used to sit. No Jews were allowed there. We couldn't go to the park. Schools were closed. I don't know when they told us to wear the -- before the stars, I think we had to wear the yellow armbands. There were scenes downstairs, I see through the window that they would graba Jew witha and cut the and cut the beard. And usually it was young kids doing it. The Hitler Youth were like a bunch of little puppies jumping on. This was the beginning. Then they started -- see we knew we would not be able to stay in the apartment. This was a fancy section of town, and it was a very large apartment. What has happened was a crazy situation and part of the apartment someone sublet it, it was a subleased to people who owned the cafe downstairs. They were German Nationals. And they requested that section. So, we managed to get some furniture out because we were evacuated not by the Germans, but by this owner of the restaurant, the cafe. So, my mother got out some of her extra, one extra chair and a foot drill and some equipment and we got some furniture from that part of the apartment out, and we have hidden it. Some Pole took it for us. And we did manage to get some valuables out, which eventually we left with the Poles. We never saw it again. But at that time we -- and we kind of waited, when they are going to kick us out. And sure enough, the order came in 24 hours we had to leave beddings for 12 beds, all the china, all the furniture, all the equipment in the office. Everything had to be left. We were allowed only to take our personal clothing. That's when we moved. That Pole he promised us it would be out of town, a little suburban area, very quiet. Nothing will happen to us, and then he -- the Jews were not allowed to have money, "X" amount of German marks, no gold, no silver, no diamonds, and when they started talking about forming the Ghetto in he persuaded my grandfather that he's going to save <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> went and was stopped somewhere and all the smuggled goods were taken away. We didn't know what happened, but they let them out. This was a put up. They just wanted to get the goods. So, a few days later she came home, luckily for us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I'd like to get a sense of the mood when the Germans came in. Were people fearful?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Were people being abused?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. The fear was when we were all running to Lodz before the Germans came. I don't think people were so fearful. It's hard to say how they felt. We all didn't know what would happen. By 11th of November, this is a Polish holiday, and just before they arrested all the prominent people in town, not only Jews, they arrested Poles, they arrested anyone, teachers, lawyers, bankers, whoever had any prominence so they couldn't start any uprising. They wouldn't stir the population against the Germans. And we never saw them again. Some of the Poles were let out. Some Poles were let out, but --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You don't know what happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. And then, as I said, it was winter, I think it was March, maybe February, when the Ghetto was formed, the Ghetto. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Polish people. We had access to food. We had access to a lot of things. She was making money, and she was helping the whole family. She had aunts and uncles and she was supporting everybody at that time. I worked with my grandfather in an outpatient clinic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was a dental clinic?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. Grandfather before he became a dentist, he was something you called a feltcher (ph).</p><p>It's almost like a medic. My grandfather was doing it. My grandfather was doing it. So, he was very well educated in medicine basically. Never became a doctor. And there was a need for an outpatient clinic, so this was free of charge. He opened it up under the hospital of the Jewish government, and I worked with him. The afternoons I had tutors, and my mother was very anxious for me to finish my -- somehow not to lose my years of education, so in the afternoon I had a tutor and was doing the high school program as much as we could, but at least I had somewhat. I wasn't left completely wild.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about the organization of the Ghetto. Who was preventing you from coming and going?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> AS There was a so-called Jewish , originally there was one lawyer in charge of <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> A I don't think so. Not at that time, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember how you all felt about these Jewish police taking orders from the German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they were not really taking orders from the Germans. They had to do a job and there were friends among them. I mean, they were not in any way abusing people or killing people, or hitting people. They were just standing there and wouldn't let you go.</p><p>The Germans and the Poles could come into Ghetto, and they told you not to go. This is the border, this is the line, you can't cross the line, period.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they have any other responsibilities like organizational schools?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, in Ghetto, there was absolutely nothing, no schools. The only thing <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> administration, I think they had some kind of a welfare department because Mom was taking in any patient who couldn't pay, Jewish patient, would get a slip from the department and they would come in and she treated them free. She'd never take any money. I mean people had money, but that was something else. But if they didn't, they were all treated for free.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were most people in the Ghetto working, older people or not?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. I don't think so. That Ghetto lasted about two years. People still had things. People were selling things. They were selling linens. They were selling, if they had any jewelry, they were selling, so I don't think at that time, and look, I was a young girl, and I was concerned with working and meeting boys later and so on, and doing some school work, so maybe I did not delve into that too deeply.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you were still doing all of those things?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was still doing all of those things until the Ghetto was closed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, how at this point you had really lost touch with all of your non-Jewish friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All right, there was an interesting encounter I had. In high school, we had one girl who was of German decent, and as before they would taunt Jewish girls, the year before the war, they started taunting her. We would not go to the -- they had catholic classes in school. The priest would come in and teach them catholic, you know, the religion. So, we were excused for the hour and the three of us, there was another girl and we used to sit in the cafeteria and just sit and kill an hour. They used to send once a week a Jewish teacher to teach all of the Jewish girls, the Jewish religion. So, the kids would taunt her, and I was one of the few people who were friendly with her. And I met her one day in the Ghetto, she worked in the Ghetto, and I was shocked because she hugged me and kissed me on the street. Her family declared themselves Tolstoy, you know, the German Nationalist. And she gave me a big greeting, and I was very much surprised. But you see, I took her part and defended her against the Polish girls before the war. But that was the only contact I had with her. I mentioned that woman who was my mother's friend, she married a Pole. When the war broke out they were in the textile business like everybody else in town, and Mom decided to invest some money in some wool clothes. Because we figured that during the war the factories will be closed, then that will be worth more money, but she left the fabric -- I mean I don't know how many bolts of fabric she bought, she left if with that family, with him and his family. When it came the time that she wanted to sell it, he was the only one who came with the money. She sent him a message and within a few days, and this was a nice profit, because naturally that thing increased in value and we got it. We got the money. So, he was one of the few. He was good and he was honest and he didn't look to take the stuff and not to deliver.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, it sounds like in the Ghetto you were able to carry on somewhat of a normal <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> existence?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Basically.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It didn't change things, but you were still able to eat?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In my family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And there weren't too many rough restrictions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, no. We had every once in a while the Germans would come in. There were restrictions where you couldn't have certain metals and precious metals and then they started raids, and it was just wild. They would come in from all sides, line up, the ones with the brown shirts and the red armbands, they were lined up at arms lengths, they even took the boy scouts, the Hitler Youth, they lined up and they would go from apartment to apartment from room to room and looking for furs and looking for metals and naturally silver. But even cooper and pewter, whatever metals they could melt. There were several incidents like this. They were also at one time, they wanted to evacuate Jewish youngsters. They were looking -- my mother got hold of -- I mean she knew about it a few days before, and I was hidden and some Jewish woman came with the Germans and said there is a young girl. I said I'm in the hospital, I was in the hospital.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were they going to do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They took them away. We do not know what happened to them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were Jews allowed to keep businesses or anything like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Local businesses. There was a restaurant and shoemakers and things like this, but no business as such. Once they established the factory, they were making money.</p><p>They were paying them money, the operators. That brought some income to the Ghetto under . <span class="page-break" number="7"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You had mentioned that there was sort of an organizing for this. The masks --</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, the masks because they were afraid to throw down the gas bombs. We were afraid of the gas bombs. There were a few raids in town, and we used to sit when there was a raid, we used to sit I don't know what you call it -- in Poland they had the drive in like it was a drive in under to go to the yard. So, they had this one section and it was supposedly the safest place to be in case of an attack or bomb falling down. There were some dog fights around. We saw a German plane being shot down. The Polish army was a joke. We never realized that. We thought, oh they are so strong. They used to have a song about the march of the Reds. He wouldn't give anything. He wouldn't give a buck, and when we started running away from the Germans we were following the Polish army. They were with the little scrawny horses, with little cots pulling the small arms, absolutely disorganized bunch of nothing. They were like 18th century and here was the smite of German army. So, they were overrun in no time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what were these masks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were afraid of gas. They were supposed to be prevent us from being poisoned by gas.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you use them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One time we were sitting down, there was a raid, and everybody was "Oh, they threw a bomb." They were masks like surgeons wear. The whole thing was a joke, but we didn't realize it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Anything else you all did in preparation for this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, that's all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were the circumstances that you had to leave?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They announced that the Ghetto would be liquidated, and we had like two days to get ready.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was when?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: May of "42. In fact, the 15th or 16th of May because my friend, Alena had a birthday that date. They announced -- first of all there was a group of men who will be working in those factories, the coat factories. They will stay for a while. They selected a group of people who would stay in the Ghetto and clean it up. And they needed medical person also. There was a doctor and he was old and he was a bachelor, and he had a sister who was a dentist, and they volunteered to stay. Our family was ordered to go to the hospital, because there were a lot of patients. The population was told to bring all the infirm, all <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 0 the sick ones, all the very old ones to the hospital. So, on a given day, and we were allowed to just take what we had on our backs and those bundles. We wore a few layers of clothes and we went to the hospital. On the given day, when we got to the hospital, we were told that there is an old age home somewhere so we carried the patients, whoever was left, and this place was filled to the rafters because they brought everybody who was in any way infirm there. That first day, they marched the whole population to that stadium, which was actually at the other end of town. And we have been in a hospital that night, so we haven't seen what happened, but we were told what happened. As they approached the stadium there was an area which was like fenced off which was before you entered actually the stadium. They started separating the parents, the old ones, and they started taking the children away. All the children under ten years old. I was told that they threw a baby over the fence and said we don't need such . Smashed <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 1</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There were some teenagers, but not too many. I think they sent them to some work camps, but not too many. We arrived at Ghetto late at night and they put us in some place, just empty rooms. We were told that the gypsies were evacuated from that area before and that's just like a holding area. And people were crying and crying about their lost children and their grandchildren. It was just very, very sad about the old people, and some other people wanted to know about what happened to the sick and the infirm. They left them in the hospital, and what happened to them? And that same morning some friends of our starting coming in looking for us, and one couple took care of my mother and me, and one person took my grandmother, someone took my grandfather. We stayed with those people. They shared a couple of days they shared their food with us. They could hardly afford it. Then we got a room for the four of us and we started our existence.</p><p>I wouldn't call it living, in the large Ghetto.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One thing that strikes me about all of this is your mother must have been pretty strong?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She was unbelievable. She held the family together. She had tremendous resources. Later on, here, she was very unsure of herself and very vague and afraid, and even my husband who knew her younger, younger age, he couldn't understand how absolutely brave and resourceful and fighting for life.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that unusual for a woman?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To be a dentist?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not to be a dentist, but to really be taking care of everyone?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, she had to. There was no one else. She went to school when she was 18 years old.</p><p>When she finished high school she went to Warsaw to study dentistry. There were no dorms, she lived on her own. She rented a room and lived on her own. She had to. Her father paid for it, but still, she had to be resourceful.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, now you're in Lodz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We're in Lodz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Conditions, I'm sure, are a little bit different?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Conditions are horrid. We had this one room, which was our bedroom, our living room, our kitchen, our bathroom. The first few nights, Mom and I slept on a straw mattress on the floor, and mice came in and started running on our faces, so we had to give this up.</p><p>So, we shared one bed and Grandma had a cot, and Grandfather had a bed. We all worked. , who was the head of Lodz Ghetto, didn't like dentists, so she <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 2 were sorting rags and making bowls out of those colored rags, and eventually some younger women were knitting rugs for the Germans. The problem was that the rags were full of lice and they were sorting them on wire tables. So, she was bringing the lice home.</p><p>When they give us rations, you have to pick up the rations, the first day because very often they would run out of the things. I think there were 750 to 900 calories a day what we were getting at that time. And just before the winter they decided to give us rations for the whole winter. Our wood and coal and turnips and potatoes and cabbage and beets.</p><p>So, we had to go and pick it up at night. Mom and I would stand in line. The only way to pick this up was to put it on a sack and put it on your shoulders and carry it. You wouldn't let anyone carry it, because they would disappear. We had four people, so we sometimes had to do it in four installments, four nights in a row to pick up that stuff. On the one bed we had the coal and the wood, and on the other bed we had all the potatoes and cabbage and we had the inventory. We knew how many months it was supposed to last, and every couple of nights we would check which potatoes were getting rotten. And this is the potatoes we ate because we knew it had to last for the whole winter. We also got bread, a loaf of bread. So, again, we cut up the bread in sections and little slices so we had for breakfast a piece and for lunch a piece and for dinner a piece and so we were not -- we were always hungry, but some people would eat the bread on the first day or the second day and they were starving the rest of the week. And what else we did, we all got some kind of a -- we didn't make anything warm to drink in the morning but you could buy hot water or coffee, so Grandma was going later to work so she volunteered. Then she started tripping on the street and falling down. She would come with a bloody face, whether she was weak or whether she had pressure too long, we don't know. So, we gave that up. During the day we all got soup. If you worked, you got the soup. And you had to work because you would get the money, the German money. The , they were named after Mr. who was the absolute tyrant in the Ghetto. And <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 3 There was this regular order police. They watched the exits. They watch order and stuff like this. And there was so-called commando. The head of</p><p> commando was someone called Mark Kleeger (ph). Those bunch of thugs, they would get orders from Germans to deliver diamonds or deliver or find gold among the Jews, but they were nasty. They would come into someone's house looking for this stuff, and naturally they figure out the person would hide the stuff in sugar or flour. So, instead of taking a plate or a bowl, they would just dump everything out on the floor looking for the valuables. They were in charge of the fields where they distributed the vegetables. I mean, so if you knew someone and we knew someone and they were there and they put the finger on the scale a little bit or lifted the scale you could get a little bit more. They had special rations. They ate in special places. They would buy their groceries in a special store like all the others of . <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 4 brought it in and they let her go. So, they were satisfied. If she would have said she had nothing, they would have tortured her. This between the and the Jews under commando, this was pretty tight situation over there. And then they started evacuations. They were evacuating constantly people. One of the worst actions was when they took the children out. Orders came that they have to take the children, they're going to take them to better places. There will be fresh air and farms and the people put signs on it and they mobilized all the Jewish police including all the people who worked for the health department, including my mother, and they had to go and collect the children. The children were being taken voluntarily by the parents, taken down, because they couldn't hide them. The moment the family would hide a child, the rations would be taken away, so not only the child didn't have the rations, but the family wouldn't have the rations. Our next door neighbors had hidden a child and they struggled. Unfortunately she died later, but it was -- and then they were taking the old people. They would make you line up on the street and get out and just select the old people and the children Now, one of the worst actions was around the Jewish holidays, this was "44, I believe. And we lived on the corner, and the lady the one who was our so-called landlady, she was the wife of the guy who was killed. Before the war she was in Argentina. So, we started lining up on one street and she called everybody up and she said forget it. This is not our street. Our address is the next street. There were two entrances there. She said, all of you go back home and hide. Just sit quiet, don't open the window, don't stand next to windows. At that time she had hidden some children and my grandparents. We didn't know where they were, somewhere. They had all kinds of nooks and crannies in that building, and we had all hidden quietly, and at noon they rang the whistles and they stopped the action. So, they were ready to call that second street, where we were, they called it off, so we were saved. If she would have -- we walked out and somebody said to us, someone who knew us and said, where are your parents, and my mother said, hidden. He said, that's silly, they'll find them. They'll kill them. And he was not sure about mom, but when we went back, like I said, that action was closed. I mean stopped, and that's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you all sort of fatalistic about this? Was it terrifying to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was terrifying. You didn't know what's going to happen. Some friends of my mother's he was high official, she had her parents, and they went down when the street went down, and he told that he'll be able to release them because he was a very, very high position, and he could never do anything about it. They took him. They started having lists and first I knew I was not on the list. One of my grandmother's sister was on the list, and we tried to get her out, and my friend told her to go, because there was no -- you couldn't support them. You couldn't do anything with them. Once they were on the list, the rations were cancelled. So, who could afford to feed them. So, they took her, and my grandmother had one brother and two sisters in large Ghetto. One of the sister-in-laws died, two children were evacuated, one uncle was evacuated, the girl finally</p><p> , and she died there. The other aunt, they took them away and we never <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 5 were gone. I mean, there were relatives in other towns, but we never knew what happened to them, but those I knew until "43 what happened to them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, I want to know a little bit more to the organization of this Ghetto. I know there were Jewish police.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> AS Well, the organization was the head of the large Ghetto was 5 <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 6 the road. But those people really, this was like he punished them. This was worse punishment I think than being evacuated on the transports. I also had a hard time with grandfather when he was dying. We had cold water only. We had to pump the water downstairs to bring it up. And they had laundries, public laundries. You sent out your stuff, took three months, two months you got it back. Not that we had valuable things.</p><p>They gave us things out when we came to the Ghetto. Well, Grandfather was sick towards the end and he had uremia, and he had accidents, and in order to change the bed I had to pick him up and put him on another bed. We'd change the bed and finally when he died -- he wanted to commit suicide. He had some procaine (ph) and his cousin caught him and he was ready to take it, but anyway, he died. In order to bury him, one had to provide two clean sheets for a shroud. We had no clean sheets. So, I went to these friends of my mother's who lived in Lodz before the war, and there were several families there that they all lived in Lodz. And that was the one who lost their parents, and I said, could you lend me two sheets so I can bury Grandfather and we will either buy some on the Black Market later on, or we'll get our bundle and we'll give it back to you. She said, "No, I'm sorry, I don't have it." I was devastated. And finally the people next door who were new acquaintances, the ones who had lost the child, she knocked on the door. She said, "I hear you have a problem. Here are the two sheets." So, this is how we managed to bury him in clean sheets. This was towards the end of the war, and they felt that they are going to survive the war and they're going to have their linens and have everything else. They lost half of their family and they still couldn't understand that those things were not important. <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 7 Tape #2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I was mentioning that as far as I understand it, there was a lot of organization in the large Ghetto. Cultural activities, little religious programs, theater?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I have never attended any of it. I don't know anything much. There was a private library, and I used to go for books. The front was bordering the street which was closed. The main street of Lodz Ghetto had street cars going like in . No one lived in those buildings. I think they had factories, most of them. There was barbed wire. This was guarded by the Jewish policeman watching that no one should sneak out and so on.</p><p>That library, the private lending library was on that street, but I know we used to go through the back and stand in line and borrow books. That's the only thing which I had in terms of cultural events. As I said, I was there for two years, and we had to take care of the old people. We had to bring the rations, and bring the food and do the fire and bring the water, and bring the slops down. Everything was on my mother's and my back, and one time she had an infection in her finger, so she couldn't grab. She had an infection in her palm and she couldn't carry things. She would go with me to pick up the rations just to guard me and I was carrying it. I worked, and as I said, Saturdays I would go out, and I met this guy. I started going out with him on Saturdays. We would just walk, because he was taking care of his mother and sister-in-law and a child, and he was a policeman, but he was not doing anything how should I say, he didn't beat people. He was watching, I think he was a sergeant, but they call it in German " " that means people who kept the order. They were not the criminals and they were not the commander.</p><p>Those were the thugs. They are the ones who are the messy guys.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you would take walks, what would you see?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: People very often, you saw people lying on the ground. They found bodies on the street.</p><p>The children, they used to sell , and there were children, there was a little chant the little children would sell , and <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 8 they gave us some stuff, some linens, some pots and pans, because they had from other liquidated Ghettos, they would get the stuff in and when people were brought in, that was the organization. They would distribute some of the stuff. I remember we got this big grey shawl with fringes on it, full of holes. And I ripped the shawl, I took out the fringes and pieced the whole thing together. I think I made three hats for us, for mother, for grandmother and for me, because it was cold and some mittens. We grabbed things out of the Ghetto, Ghetto. Among other things there was a piece of fabric. I'll <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 9 asthma. "Why don't you release her?" Finally, I got the release from him, but when I approached him he wouldn't do it. There were many people like this. They were so self important. They felt so important, and they were nobodies nothings. All of a sudden they became heads of factory or whatever. And Ghetto was one huge factory, starting from electronic equipment, uniforms, which was the most important things, boots, supplies for the Army, going down to the brassieres, hats, artificial flowers, brooms. And even those rag rugs, braided rugs which were made out of scraps. They would take torn sheets which they would get from various cities when the other towns or cities were liquidated like in</p><p> . That group saw that the good stuff went to Germany or for the <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 0</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think there was corruption. There had to be corruption. There had to be corruption. You see, in large Ghetto I was such a low level of living that I really don't know what was going on, but we know -- the whole administration and when I read this book about Lodz Ghetto, one time he had theaters here and orphanages, he had schools, he was making the famous speech, give me your children, he felt justified in sending out <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 1 Back track, one of my friends was hung in Lodz Ghetto. He was found, he was trying to escape from camp. And this was a boy I saw him when I was 15, I gave him my photograph, and then somebody told me that he was hung, and they found my photograph with him. Since that time, I was going up the ladder. I had boyfriends who were much older than him, and I became obsessed to get that photograph back, because I felt if that boy felt that way that he had my photograph, it was taken when I was 12 or 13, before the war. I finally tracked that photograph down and had it, and I told you that the people from Ghetto some of them were hung. The ones who were in charge of the Ghetto at one time, which I mention it in my book. So, when we got -- what were we talking about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The cattle cars, going to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Yes, the cattle cars, going to Auschwitz. We arrived at Auschwitz, and it was dark in the cattle cars. All of the sudden the light was kind of blinding. They lined us all up in fives.</p><p>We had my grandmother with us. They told us to leave this stuff whatever we had. I just had like a little lunch bag, and I had my photographs there, and I had some money there, and a couple of rings and things like this. Mother, I think had probably instruments. If anything, aside from anything else she had was instruments. She had a red cross arm band, because in Ghetto everybody was identified by something. They had caps and they had bands, and they had different hats with different 1.d."s and so on.</p><p>was big on uniforms but couldn't afford uniforms, so he was giving people hats. As we were approaching , there were a lot of Polish couple, like trustees <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 2 fast, fast. You had no time to regroup, you had no time think, you had no time to do anything. Get off the trains, line up, fast. That's all you could hear "Shnell, shnell,"</p><p> When they finally regrouped us on the other side of the table, again they formed us in fives. There were groups of prisoner girls, and they started driving us, practically driving us, fast, running, and while we were running, we encountered a group of subhumans, to us at that time they were subhumans, they wore tops of men's pajamas, but they were not the regular prison garb. They all had their hair shaved. They had the wooden lace shoes on. Their doppers (ph) were plastic or fabric or whatever, or no, they were wood sabits (ph) like Dutch shoes, because it was muddy around. There were sent in another direction, and they started yelling give me your bread, give me something, they'll take it away it from you. Give it to us, and they were supervised by the Germans, but basically they were smacking them, and we were shocked seeing that group, and naturally wouldn't give them the bread. I mean, God forbid, we had to hide the bread for us. We'll need it.</p><p>And finally they brought us into an area where the baths were. This was a real legitimate bath, a processing area. By that time it was getting dark, and they warned us to turn in all the gold and all the diamonds and all the valuables that we have because they'll be taken away. And rumors were going that they were going to do very personal inspections. Well, Mom had a bridge with two diamonds in. She had it made in such a way that she could take it out. The diamonds were taken out of the things and she had it in her mouth. This was like a final ration in case we need anything. And I was very upset. I got panicky and I said I don't want to give these Germans absolutely nothing. Let's bury them. And I also had a couple of rings, old rings. And in the dark, my mother says "Are you sure?" And I said Mom, I don't want you to give it to them and they are going to look in your mouth and they will find it and they will get, and I don't want them to have it. And there we put into the ground, ground it with our heels, and got rid of the diamonds and got rid of the gold. There were a couple of other things they took, but this, it's like a feeling, like great we didn't give it to them. Anyway, they took us to this shed --.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to the diamonds?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: She ground them into the ground.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that the end of the story with the diamonds?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Yes, but we wouldn't give it to the Germans. That was fun --, when I think about it now, this was fun, because they didn't get it. Maybe somebody eventually found it, maybe not.</p><p>I don't care. They were sewed in a little plastic thing -- well, we didn't have plastic.</p><p>Anyway, they took us to the shed. We had to get undressed, get the clothes off. They took everything away from us and they sent us to the sauna and lucky for me, I don't know why, they didn't cut my hair. They did shave our hair and they give us tattoos. It was very late at night by that time. They were getting a lot of transports. Rumor was that they wanted us to -- eventually would have gassed us, but they were so busy, the crematorium was so busy that they felt maybe they can do something with us, the able bodied people.</p><p>And, they gave us some clothes. I wound up with a skirt, my mother wound up with a <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 3 mini, so we switched and the wooden shoes. Then the last act was they painted a stripe, a red stripe down our backs and that broke me up. Talking about panic, and we walked naked in front of the guys, in front of the Germans and in front of Polish copos.</p><p>Somehow, I took this whole thing without shedding a tear, but when they painted that stripe on my back, I started crying. Again, one of the Poles walked over to me, hugged me and said, "Don't worry, you'll survive. You'll be okay." I mean, I spoke Polish at that time fluently, and I was a pretty girl at that time, and he felt sorry for me so he said, "Don't worry, you'll make it, just don't cry." So, they sent us out, by now it's late at night.</p><p>They didn't have a barrack for us. They'll send us to the latrine. I don't know if you know what the latrine in Auschwitz looked. They were concrete benches with holes that could accommodate 500 people at once. There were benches on both sides and then in the middle there was a long bench from back to back there were holes with a pit underneath.</p><p>And that's how we were using as toilets. Well, that's where we spent the night, in the toilets. Well, I don't have to repeat Auschwitz stories. We stood up from 5:00 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning and then they put us in the barracks and we had 14 people, 12 to 14 people to one six by six or seven by seven bed. They gave us a can of whatever they gave us was in a metal can, no spoon, no nothing, and five people had to eat out of it, so everybody's watching how many swallows you did of that. And one of the first nights there, once we got into the barrack, they were burning, the crematorium was going night and day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You knew what it was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't. But someone woke up and those barracks, like you see in the Museum how they look, they had little windows on top and someone must have woken up and saw this red glow in the sky and someone started crying all of a sudden 1,000 women started crying and people who were in charge of it, group of Hungarian girls, they started yelling to be quiet because the Germans would come in and so forth. We still didn't know what happened. We knew something bad had happened, but we didn't know about the crematoriums, what's happening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't know what the crematoriums were? How many people were in your barrack?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About a thousand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: From all over?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was probably mostly Polish group run by the Hungarians. The girls who were in charge had short skirts and they for some reason they all like polka dotted blouses and they had their hair. They cut my hair some more. They didn't like my having hair, so they shaved it a little -- they didn't shave it, but they cut it completely. And Mom developed, we were afraid, because she developed from the wooden shoes a wound on her ankle and that was festering, and two weeks later they had the selection, luckily they put us through a shower again, and the paper bandage fell off, so when they selected her, they didn't see <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 4 her with the bandage. As much as that was festering and messy, they didn't do anything.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was your day fairly controlled?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Extremely. We had to get up, I don't know, 5:00 or 6:00. It was cold in the morning. You stood on that for hours. They counted, and counted first from the <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> 5</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see anything strange when you'd walk out at night?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nothing, it was just dead. Nothing was seen, no one was walking, except as I said, figures taking the slop bucket. That's about all. No one was allowed to go to the bathroom. But, I was waiting for that occasion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It just sounds sort of eerie.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very hot in the afternoon. This was still August. So during the day, it got hot, and in our camp they would send us out again for another count, and by that time it was hot, and we stood there for hours until they tallied. It was a way of torture. They were just cruel and people were fainting and people were dying in the lines and you were not allowed to help them. You had to leave them the way they were. If someone passed out, they passed out. That's it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You went out a night, did you see the crematorium flames or smell them?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a small and there was dust, but we didn't -- there was some white stuff floating, but we didn't know what it was. The first night the glow was unbelievable. And we were afraid, I don't know, we were afraid to do anything. You were not allowed to.</p><p>Once I was in the bathroom, maybe I wasn't moving fast enough, there was this famous</p><p> Erma , she later came to Bergen-Belsen, blonde, gorgeous cool <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> 6 roof and I'll make you a stick for the soup. It's like a tongue depressor and he dropped that stick for me, so I could dig into the soup. They didn't like it. So, the following day, they called me down to the bottom of the thing and said, "We have to cut the hair." So, they cut some more. I had no choice. Because except for the block elders and their assistants the rest of them had shaved heads. How they got there, how they became them, I don't know. There was a woman who came along, she was a dentist from Poland, and she kind of asked my mother and said, you know, I can get you a job and so on and she was hinting that my mother has anything she should give it to her and she could arrange for her to get a job as a dentist. At that time we didn't have anything, and my mother was upset. She said, if I had the diamond, I could have given her the diamond. I could have gotten a job. Lucky for us, we didn't have the diamonds and they sent us out to Bergen- Belsen.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why don't you tell me how that came about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: About two weeks after we were in Auschwitz, they lined up, had another selection. They took us to the showers, gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes. I mean if I had a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away. The tank top was so short, I had a ribbon in the tank top and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my whole behind was showing. And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they were supposed to send us out. Then something happened, the trains were not there, and they put us in some temporary barrack. The following day, they ran another selection.</p><p>They gave us a bath, and they put us on the train. This was the time I really don't know if Auschwitz had two stations or not because this is the only time and I went back to Auschwitz, I remember, we went through the main camp of Auschwitz, because we were in and this was, I saw the red buildings, the permanent buildings. I saw the <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> 7 climb up. We could see the bombed out cities and we were very happy to see those bombed out cities. I think it must have been the third day. We felt that another night on the train we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing. We were getting confused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing where we were going, what we're doing. Anyway, they took us, we came to Bergen- Belsen, and until that time Bergen-Belsen was not a concentration camp. They had various camps of various entities, prisoner of war camp, but there was no camp concentration camp as such. Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to go by truck, and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went. Otherwise, my mother with the bad leg, she would not go on the truck. She was afraid, because we knew by now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you. We finally got into the main camp. It was a long, long street. The front of the street, the beginning of the street, there was administration places, there was a bath, there was a little crematorium which they could burn two bodies. But this was done for bodies. It was never done to use it for killing people. If people died, they would use it. They gave us a bath and we put our clothes in a little basket, and when we walked out from the other side of the bath, we got the clothes. They marched us down to the end of the street of the town, the very end of the camp, and there was this big tent that could accommodate about 1,000 people. It was clean. We all got a blanket each. On the floor of the tent was wooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used. There as a latrine in the back right under the guards tower, big pits and there was a couple pieces of wood where you could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted. There was a wooden trough with pipe. We could use the water any time we wanted. They nominated one lady, she was from Germany, she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant, she was originally from Germany, so they spoke fluently German. They counted us once a day. This camp is located on the , so it's like heather. At that time there was <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> 8 Hungarian women another tent up. So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that compound, because there were other groups.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: All coming from Auschwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. I think they were coming from Auschwitz because the other ones were Hungarians. Can I tell you something interesting about -- by that time, we didn't have a doctor and they brought a bunch of women from the Warsaw uprising, gentile women.</p><p>They were not with us, but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one of the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people were coming in with various ailments, there was one lady who was from Germany, had lost her husband and child. She was not Jewish. Her husband was Jewish, and she kind of started becoming administrator to the very end. She was the administrator of the hospital.</p><p>As a matter of fact, we saw her in the United States. She survived. So, we would sleep -- it was so cold, but we would sleep, this Polish doctor, and Lisa and my mother and I would take one blanket and put it underneath us on the shavings and would cover ourselves with the three other blankets. It was much warmer. And the body head kept us going. It was getting cold. By that time, I think my mother started looking at some teeth. I mean, checking, also everything on the floor, we had no place to do but, one day we got notified and some people approached Mom and the other women and a few other ones that this is Yom Kippur and the Hungarians are going to have a service and we are invited. After dark come in one by one and come in, sneak in. So, one by one, it was very dark, and you know they closed the camp. Except for the towers, there was no one in camp. They would close it up, all the Germans would just disappear at darkness.</p><p>And we all hide under the blankets. We wrapped ourselves in blankets and quietly walked into the tent. They lined up the shavings in such a way they were like benches. In the very front they made a out of the shavings covered with blanket. How they got a candle, I do not know, but they had a tiny little candle. There as a young girl and an elderly woman and they sang the whole out of memory. And <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> 9 famous cantors home so I have heard I don't think I ever went to services, <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> 0 During the war, the beginning of a war, she was run over by a truck, so her face -- she was never a pretty women, but her face was damaged, crooked and stuff like this. Well, she became a doctor, and they sent another one, Doctor Annie. She was a woman born in Russian, went to medical school in Russia, married a French diplomat and she lived in Germany. She was Jewish, but she lived in Germany before Hitler, because he was a French diplomat. She was a socialite. She never practiced medicine, but this was our other doctor. By that time they moved us again. They build some barracks and they built a so-called hospital. We were moved like three times. So, this was when Schnabbles (ph) started coming in. We had one big room where the patients stayed in the bunk, and one corner we had the staff, and by that time they brought more nurses, must have been about six nurses, seven nurses and two doctors, my girlfriend Alena was a nurse. My mother was there. On the one window we had this out patient clinic and in the back was a little tiny room and it was a dental office.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me, this is completely separate from the barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They had access to it. It was part of the camp, but this was a separate little building.</p><p>That's when we started seeing the two I don't know what you call it, the German -- they were like medial corps men, or something. One was a decent guy, his name was Fisher.</p><p>And he liked to grab the girls" boobs. So, we gave him a name of Fisher Tapper. Tapper in Jewish is to tap, to grab it, and he liked to grab whenever he could when no one else was looking. The other one was obnoxious. He was a young fellow and we called him the pig, so I don't know his name. And Doctor Schnabbles started coming in. He was an elderly man, according to rumors again, he was a nose and ear man. He was checking what patients and what cases we have. One of the first patients which he started doing something with, was a woman came on the transport, had a compound fracture of her tibia. The skin was broken, the bone was sticking out. It was a horror. They put some kind of a metal frame around it and she had to be operated on. So, he decided -- first of all, it was cool. He never would take off his coat. He did all his surgeries in his coat. He decided to set the leg. Well, he was not very successful. So, the pediatrician opened up her mouth and said, "Doctor, don't you think you should do this and that?" Well, that was the end of her. She was ugly as it is, he didn't like it with the scars and all on her face, but that put her in disfavor. We had two guys were watching, he tried to set the leg.</p><p>He never did. The woman was crippled. She survived the war, I think, but she was in the hospital with us all the time. <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> 1 Tape #3</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So, the first time he started setting that leg, it never took. Well, Schnabble was looking always for patients, what he could operate on. He was always checking what we have. At that time, our staff consisted of Lisa, who the director of the hospital. We had a scribe because they wanted reports. How many patients were admitted, what they were coming in for, what sicknesses we had and stuff like this. There must have been six or seven nurses, and then we had two orderly ladies. We even had like a little toilet in the back.</p><p>Those two women had to take the stuff out, but we had like a little outhouse attached to the hospital. I don't remember what we had later, but that one I knew we had.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many doctors were there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At that time, they took the Polish woman away, there was my friend Alena, Doctor</p><p> and Doctor Annie, the Russian woman, who didn't know much about medicine, but she was there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How many of the nurses really had any medical training?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very few. What I had was like a practical nurse whatever I picked up, so did my girlfriend Alena. There were one or two, there was one Dutch, she came and there was another one, a Belgium that really had training or not, but we did what we could do. Let's put it this way. It was more than the other people could do. And then I had a little dental office. We had also all kinds of patients and they were there forever. Some of them died, some of them we let out. Basically, a lot of surgical things. I remember there was one young girl who claimed she could never get up and we tried to get her up, and we could never get her up. Sometimes we climbed up and to get her out of the bed to straighten out that mess, and never knew what was wrong with her. One day she just died, so evidently there was something wrong with her. There was another young girl she had a groin abscess which was draining for weeks and months. I mean the woman with the leg, I remember once I wanted to wash my famous dress, I mean we had nothing. So, if you wanted to wash a dress you borrowed something from a patient and wore that for a day and washed the dress and the patient was lying naked. Conditions were pretty horrid, but as I said, they were still feeding us. We got the bread in the morning, and we, the personnel didn't have to stay and it was getting cold. We also had a young girl who was a mental patient, whether she was manic-depressant, I don't know. One day, Schnabble came in and decided to do some kind of a surgery, and we didn't have electricity so they brought carbide lights. She got frantic. Something was going on in the other room and the lights. This was a scene like . She went wild. We <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> 2 her about two or three days in the tent. My mother was petrified that she's going to kill me, but she kept calm. I mean, you could talk to her a little bit, you couldn't get the story out of her. After that outburst, that place where we give her the injection, that festered and eventually she died. She had an infection. When we knew Schnabble was coming, we used to put the straight jacket on her, because she was so petrified. When he walked in, we all had to stand at attention. We couldn't move. The only person who ever moved was one of the little orderlies. She was a little woman, blonde nose, no teeth. She was a young woman, bow legged, and she wanted to show him that she was working, so she would sweep the floor, including his feet. It was a riot, and he used to say, "The only one who works here is this one, the little one. She's the only one who's working." As I said, she would sweep over his books, and he liked her. He never did anything in any way to stop her. Well, one of the first opportunities he had to send Doctor out, they <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> 3 separate room for the staff. I think we were doing the outpatient in the same room. I finally beg hospital beds a small little room which was my mother's office. In the back, at that time, they brought in a group of women from Slovakia. I don't know if they were Jewish or not, with children. They had little children with them, and they built like an annex to our hospital, at the end of our hospital they were getting more firewood to warm up the place. They were getting some special soups, and they had some little possessions with them. They had pillows, they had some tea. Every once in a while we could get when the transport came in, they would bring us a box of junk, medical supplies and all kinds of odds and ends. I was in charge of all the medical supplies. Whenever I got any vitamins I would take it to the children, because I felt that this was very important for the mothers, so I became very friendly with them. Anything with baby powder, whatever they found and the Germans wouldn't use I started packages and so on. A little cough medicine for children, pediatrics, so I would take it to those women. Later on they helped me. Anyway, it was getting cold, it was getting very, very nasty. The weather was getting nasty. One day a young woman came with pain -- and you see by that time we had a couple of other doctors, I think. We tried to avoid telling Schnabble what was wrong with the patient. We didn't have the means to diagnose. We had no blood tests. We had no x- rays, it was just feel and think.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were people coming in for all kinds of conditions?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Everything, and I can tell you, describe the conditions. There was one thing, dental condition, which I think it's called , where pieces of gums and lips would rot, <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> 4</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and drained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever we had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if it wasn't too advanced case of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have enough supplies?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I'll tell you about that later. Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid stories I ever saw. A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix inflamed. It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on.</p><p>What do you have. See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical guy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the stairs. When he comes in in the morning to pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the bicycle. You had to hand him that while he was on the run. He was awful, screaming, yelling. Anyway, Schnabble came in and found out that girl is complaining about appendix. He decided he is going to operate.</p><p>Felt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he wearing his coat. We set up the surgery in the dental office. He ordered his help, the Russian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood. It was raining. It was sleeting, so I started a fire in that little wooden stove. He assigned my mother to the anesthesia. She was his favorite anesthetist. The anesthesia consisted of a little mask, a little cage that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the bottle. No other support, nothing. Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one other girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time. He opened her up, couldn't find her appendix. He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks suspicious, he was ready to cut this out. This was the bladder. It looks like a fish bladder.</p><p>He poked around. He decided he can't find the appendix. He took all the intestines out.</p><p>And the conditions are not sterile exactly. I mean the fire which was going there, it's full of soot and he can't find it. Put everything back together, took everything out again. He still can't find her appendix. At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring Alenluf (ph). Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main compound or where he was, but he was in the men's camp, and I understand he was a very known surgeon. Well, a guy went on the bicycle and Doctor Alenluf was running after him. In the meantime, we kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep. I grab Alenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him. That's what I manage because by now he's very impatient. Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not infected at all, and closed her up. She developed peritonitis. For three days that woman was in a coma screaming and he was coming in. He sent morphine. He sent painkillers.</p><p>He also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything. It lasted three days, and she died. But this was a horror. And you can't say anything, and he's pulling out all of her intestines out on the table and back into the cavity and back on the table and back in the cavity. It was a horror. And you have to stand there with a poker face and don't say a word, nothing. You can't react. And even this Doctor Alenluf, very gingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong, nothing. He just did his job and that's it. This was one of the worst things which I witnessed. Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women. We had a bunch of <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> 5 syringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that we need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would cut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff. And we had some pain killers and we had something if someone had an attack of something. We also had babies. There were babies born. We had one woman once who knocked on the door in the middle of the night and said she's in labor, and our administrator went over, Doctor Annie went over to the tower and said, look we have a woman in labor. None of us is a midwife. So, they came in. The two guys, and they went from barrack to barrack and they found a midwife and the baby was delivered. I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von Jordan, because there was a ditch over there and he said this is River Jordan. And the following day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the baby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not survive. But, they didn't take away the babies. They didn't kill the babies. They didn't do any harm to them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: There were a number of babies in the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were they family camps?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was later that we got into. At that time there were just a few newborn, we had a few of them and those slovak women who had their children with them. Anyway, one day I needed my syringes to be sterilized and walked through and the Slovaks had a fire going, and I said, "Would you let me do the syringes here?" She said, "Oh, you're so busy. Why don't you let me do it. I'll watch it for you, and I'll do it." I said "Fine." I came back. She burnt every one of them. Now, this could be considered sabotage. I mean you know you had to really be so careful because here you are burning eight syringes. I was beside myself. I was afraid that Schnabble would come in and want to do something, give them an injection, whatever if he said something we had to do it. Well, I didn't know what to do. Finally I got this guy Fisher on the side and he was from Northern Poland originally, and we were afraid to speak in front of him because we were afraid he understand Polish and I told him. I told him what happened. I said, look I was busy and I took it to them and they burned it and they didn't pay attention. He started bringing, the same day he came in the afternoon, he brought one syringe. Whether he stole them, how he got them within a week I had the whole set of syringes back and he never denounced me. He never said anything to Schnabble, nothing. So, even in those conditions there were people who were a little compassionate. By that time things were getting bad, more transports. I believe this was the time they brought the commandant from Auschwitz and he was cruel.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was his name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think Horss. And that she's the head and she was blonde and some <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> 6</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know about what time, what year that was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was in "44, had to be around winter of "44, because it was getting cold when we lived in Auschwitz, when we had those surgeries. Also, when they were bringing the soups to the hospital, there were a bunch of wild women running around and trying to take the soups, the kettles, so we had to with sticks and stand guard, to escort the people who brought the soup, because they would just eat them and run with them. We needed them for the patients. The camp was getting bigger and bigger, and one day they said they were going to move all of our patients, and the whole camp first, on the other side of main street. This was originally a prisoner of war camp, and they had some permanent buildings which were hospital buildings, and they moved first the camp and then they moved the hospital. Our group was assigned to main building number one. It had an operating room. It had a dental office. It had some wards. We had like an outpatient room. So, the first order of business was that the operating room had white tile floors and walls. So, the first thing they did, they removed all the tiles, the ceramic tiles, because the commandant wanted that for his bathroom. I believe we had electricity. I can't even remember. They must have had electricity because my mother had this sterilizer that was an electric sterilizer or she had spirit or something to sterilize the instruments. The dental office was so beautifully equipped that when the Red Cross would come in an examine the camp, that's where they would take them, because there was all the equipment you wanted to have. No x-rays, but everything else. There was enough novocain that we were afraid if we used up the novocain, the war would never end. Then there must have been a room for the nurses, and then there was room where the doctors lived and Mom took me with her and I shared a bed with her because they wouldn't give me a bed. I was a nurse and they wouldn't give me a bed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, all along you were living in the hospital?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right, right. And that room was Doctor Annie and a couple of other doctors, Lisa was the administrator, Theresa who was the scribe, then they sent in another dentist, the Russian dentist, Larissa. One day, the commandant children governor who was a Seventh Day Adventist, was German, they were arrested. She came down with typhus. This was much later, so she was put in with the doctors in that room. That was his orders that she should be kept in that room. We had one surgical ward where people had all kinds of wounds, surgical wounds. Sometimes we had to cut something, and we were getting very little supplies, and I took it upon myself -- because I was working always with Doctor Annie in the outpatient clinic. I very seldom worked the wards. I did very well with the outpatients in whatever had to be done. Whenever we got supplies I used to go in to change the dressings and you almost needed a gas mask for it. This was stinky, festering thing and we didn't have enough bandages. We didn't get them enough. We couldn't change them every day. Maybe once a week, once in ten days they would bring us the supplies and there was some peroxide and maybe some ointment, maybe some powder to dust on the wounds, and I used to get so many blessings when I used to change the dressings. This <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> 7 was the main hospital building. The next one was the nicest building. That's where the children were. By that time, they took away or send them out or whatever happened to the parents of the Dutch and Belgium children, so they formed an orphanage there, and the Slovak women lived there with their children, and then the few mothers as long as the babies were alive, they lived there. That's were Doctor lived. That place <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> 8 to handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those bodies were. Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the prisoners. This was horrid. Anyway, the camp was getting bigger. There were transports coming in every few days, and they needed help with the transports. When the transports came in, the able bodies would get a shower and they would place them in camp, but there were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is not, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved. A few were nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, "I'm going. I have to help them. I just can't let them work both nights." So, we went out. By the time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed. There was this big room with all kinds of bundles. They made the people leave the bundles and there were sick people. Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their clothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would kill the vermin, and they could go on the other side and find their own clothes. There was one woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, "Throwing her out. She's half dead, she's dead." I kept on shoving her around that place behind some things because I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive. Whether she was in a diabetic coma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said "Come on take her out. Let's take her out. Let the guys take her out." So, I was hiding her behind bundles, behind anything. Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do anything but slap her face. I tried to give her some water. Whatever we tried to do it couldn't revive her, so they took her out. That transport was so full of lice. We got so bitten by lice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where were most of these transports from?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were from Hungary. I think Poland by that time was clean. They finished with those.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They weren't necessarily coming from Auschwitz?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no those people were coming with their own clothes and whatever the camp wore.</p><p>They were not from Auschwitz. They were not from camps. They were wherever they lived in. Anyway, then it was getting almost light and they said all right we're finished with you. We can take you back to the barracks. And we said, "You know, you bathed everybody, you deloused them, and here we are crawling with insects. We are bitten all over the place and why don't you let us have a shower and delouse us, our clothes, otherwise we'll bring the whole stuff back to camp." They said that's a good idea and they even stoked the fires and we had a nice warm shower.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How often did you shower?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We never showered. The first time when they brought you to camp. This was the second one. Maybe once they took us out. I don't remember. <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> 9</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, you never washed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we washed. Maybe once they took us to shower, maybe when we're changing camps, I think they marched us. This was a pleasure, this shower, and they took our clothes and they deloused them. Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever. I came back and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as I said, to the day, I came down with it. At first they didn't know what was wrong with me.</p><p>So, by this time we didn't have Schnabble. We had a young doctor who was wounded at the Russian front. His arm was injured and he was working in camp. They heard that I might have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have never seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it. By that time, the doctors in the room that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so they kicked me out on the ward. But I had my own bed, and I was lying next to a girl who used to be a patient of mine. She had t.b. but I tried to keep her on calcium. The theory was that calcium was good for t.b. and we had calcium, she would get it. Again, she was a young woman. You tried to help people who were not too far gone. We felt if we could help them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going. By that time, the epidemic started. The typhus epidemic. It was by the end of the war, this must have been February or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus. My fever was building up about three weeks. It's like with pneumonia. It build up, if the patient can survive the crisis. Well, Mom would warm up water in the sterilizer and wash me and bring water and wet my lips. And those Slovak ladies made me a little pillow. I'll never forget it. This tiny little pillow. They collected some feathers because they thought I was so nice to them, and they brought me this. And I kept on saying "Get the train out of my head, get the train out of my head. I can't stand the train." And when they would bring the turnip soup into the room, it was wretched. I couldn't stand it. Finally one night, I must have reached the crisis, and called this woman next door and said "Get me my mother." So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and there was a doctor and again we had some supplies. We had something to support the heart, just a stimulator heart, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know. I think I was dying. Then I got better. In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference between two doctors. I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick. This young German doctor performed some surgeries. Again, he wanted to learn. He did them in the operating room under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him.</p><p>Sometimes he would I mean people told me about it. Sometimes he would hesitate what to do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, "Well, don't you think you should do this," but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until the guy looked at him. He didn't know where he was going. So, they did perform some surgeries on those people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So there was actually a somewhat serious effort to cure people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know if it was serious to cure people of if this was a way for him to learn. I mean <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> 0 they never had the chance to -- if he is a very known professor and he is a young doctor and maybe he should learn. And he and his pal, the dentist, used to sit in the dental office most of the day. He also had some massages done. First one masseuse and then the other friend of mine, the one who was the head of that very sick ward. She would come in because he needed physical therapy on his arm. The first time we had the inkling that things were going bad for Germans they were discussing it very quietly. The Russians are so and so many kilometers from Berlin and they were afraid of Russians. My mother overheard a conversation. Whether that was done to let us know, or they just forgot about her working because she ignored them, that's when we knew things were happening. By the time, close to the liberation, there was cholera there. There was a raging epidemic of typhus. There was all kinds of sickness and less supplies and less food. One day this other doctor, I think it was called up over lined us up -- we didn't have <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> 1</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before we get to the end, I just want to ask you a couple questions. It sounds like you had contact with people, prisoners from a lot of different surroundings, is that true?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Not so much from the other camps, but just with transports?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The transports were coming in and this woman became the main camp. They would break out the fences between some other camps and that became a huge, huge, huge camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, then a lot of the subcamps got combined?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. The Dutch and the Belgium camp, that was combined with ours. The Indonesia, no. What happened to the prisoner of wars or whatever, we took over those parts of the building, I don't know what happened to them. I know the Russians were there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you were more integrated were the conditions and relationship also integrated or did certain people just stay with their own.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think they stayed more or less within their own barracks. They had to stay <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> 2 why they placed me there and she kept an eye on me. If I needed anything, the sicker I was getting, she would take a sip of water and put it in my lips or wet something and put it on my lips and she was in a way taking care of me. She didn't do physically anything, she was in bed, but she was kind of keeping an eye -- she was the one who alerted them that I was coming down with the crisis, so she did help me. Mom got typhus later. I mean all the doctors got sick. 1 mean everybody was sick. The sign was if you spilled your water like we had this French doctor, she had a bed above us, and the sign was that if you started taking water at night to bed and then spill it over head she had typhus. We knew that she had. There were certain symptoms. I could recognize someone with the typhus just looking at them. Later on, the British doctors, they had no idea what's wrong with a patient. I said the trembling, the lip trembling, people didn't even have the spots, there were certain symptoms you could just recognize they had typhus.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Certainly you've read stories and heard stories in camps about people that the need for survival --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was stories about it that there were. I never witnessed it but there were stories about cannibals.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: People would steal from each other?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yes. It was known. If someone was unconscious they put a piece of bread in front of them so they would steal it. This was, as I said, the will to survive. But it got so bad that they were walking to camp, they were walking to the hospital and they were just defecating.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was another interesting thing I read in your testimony. When I read about Bergen- Belsen I guess towards the end it sounded as if, not from your testimony, but from elsewhere, that nobody really took care of anybody?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Basically, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The authorities of the camp really didn't make any provisions to feed, to clothe, to house?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Well, they were housed. There were barracks. Clothes, whatever they came with, and there were some people working. As I said, when the people came in with their own clothes, the good stuff was taken away. They had big warehouses when the war ended.</p><p>The prisoners broke into those warehouses and everybody was carrying all kinds of clothing. One of the funniest thing this Russian dentist with his boyfriend and my mother didn't know what happened, she was just recuperating from typhus and this guy walked in in a top hat, tuxedo with tails and a white scarf around his neck. He was one of the Russians. They were the first ones to break into the warehouses and he thought he looked very snazzy in that outfit, this was after the war. But the war was a field of dead. There were people dying by the thousands every day and they would just dump them out and <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> 3 there was no way no matter what the Germans tried to do to bury them, and they would bring crews to the prisoners. They fed them extra, they forced them to work. There was tasks that they could not keep up. I think there were two graves when they finally cleaned out the camp, one I don't know how many thousands of people buried in those graves, mass graves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What percentage of people do you think came through the hospital at one time or another? You were treating women, correct?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. I don't know. I don't know. We had lines every day. As a matter of fact, after we were liberated they took everybody to Bergen, but in the meantime the British helped us clean up some of -- they whitewashed some of the buildings, and I stayed another month or so, maybe another few weeks. No, we liberated the 15th of April, the 8th of May I was still in the old place and they gave us new blankets and we were still admitting people and still taking care of it because the healthy ones they could process and take to Bergen, which was a military camp, and they placed them there. The sick ones, they had a whole procedure they had to -- and they were magnificent. They would take them in and they would bathe them on stretches and they would shower them and they cleaned their heads.</p><p>And they were basically British soldiers and dress the wounds and place them in hospital barracks. This was a very slow process. In the meantime, people were coming in. They needed help now, and by that time we had some supplies. So, we were admitting some of them and we were treating some of them on an outpatient basis, but at least we had some bandages and supplies. We had some medications. If they had a headache, we could give them aspirin. I mean things like this, and they were still getting sick. They were still getting typhus. That thing was still raging, and the British soldiers were all inoculated and toward the end there was a rumor they were going to evacuate the camp, like they did in Auschwitz. There was a march. There was a group that went on trains, and I think the trains were bombed, and I think some of the Dutch Jews perished that way. Anyway, there was a rumor that the camp is mine and they are going to evacuate the camp and whoever can walk and the rest of the people will go, and the girls came over to me, the nurses that wanted to distribute some of the medicine what you have and the syringes and everything and they said, "Are you going to walk?" I said, "No, I'm not leaving Mom, and she can't walk. I'm staying no matter what happened." Well, that night we had bombs and they bombed this was Lindenberg, the Allies bombed a nearby town and a day or two later we saw all the Germans walking -- the British didn't come in yet, but they were walking with the white arm bands and for some reason I was sent out to either get the soup or get some supplies and I was passing the baths, the sauna and our favorite the guy, the pig, this German, he was burning paper in this sauna, in the furnace. They were very nice. They were still in charge, and they came in and they wore the arm bands, didn't discuss anything, but at the same time the day the British came in there was a cook, a German cook in one of the kitchens, and they were supposed to be working. He said, I have another few bullets and I'm going to shoot all the Jews. He killed a girl, wounded one, and the British were not in, the Germans were half way in and out. By that time we were guarded by Hungarians. The guards were all released, outside guards. And there <span class="page-break" number="35"></span> 4 was a group of Hungarians and they were guarding the camp with the guns. This was a German, and they felt, they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews. One of the girls was brought in. She walked out, she said, "We are free. We are liberated." Bang, and she was gone. What has happened, when the British came in the 15th of April the tank went through, waved the flag, everybody say hooray and they went out and we are still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking. Well, it was in the afternoon, they just went in until they could organize themselves. Then they discovered the bodies so they called all the officers and the soldiers and they had to remove the bodies. Some of the girls were nuts. They were distributing the food in metal cans and they were rusting. One of the girls saved the rations which was pretty awful and rotten and become spoiled and she wanted one of the Germans to eat it. And the Germans were guarded by the British because otherwise the mob would have torn them apart. There was a language problem, but this one somehow managed to convey to the British soldier that she doesn't want to do any harm. She just wants that German to eat that food, and he made him eat it. The funny thing is, I went once to see this removal of the bodies. It was a frantic scene. The girls were screaming and yelling and hollering and they wanted to pull on the Germans. I went once to see it, but I just couldn't do it. I also went out, I think one day after they liberated us and I went out -- the gates between the compounds were open. The main street was open. That's where you saw this unbelievable mob of people walking with all kinds of clothing because they broke into the depots and whatever they could wear, the funniest outfits and funny things, and people were milling, looking for friends and that's how I went to the men's place, the men's camp to look for people from my town and people who I knew, and I found this one boy who had a very bad eye infection and got him doctors and got him to a hospital. He lost his eye but he survived.</p><p>He's alive. He lives in California. <span class="page-break" number="36"></span> 5 Tape #4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We started talking about liberation. I wondering if the Germans were sensing what was happening and if there treatment of you changed, if you could feel their fear?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, once the bombing took place nearby, a couple of days before the British came in, and that's where the German headquarters surrendered and therefore the Germans were wearing the white armbands. They were ready for take over and by that time, except the crazy shooters, the ones we were in contact with, they were okay. Even the one that was screaming, he was always quiet. I saw him burn the papers and I don't remember why I went out, either to pick up some supplies because we still could not walk between the compounds on the main street, but for some reason I was sent for something, I think we were sent to the kitchen for soups. By that time they were not delivering and that's why I went with a group of girls, and that's when I saw him burning those papers frantically.</p><p>They were packing and he didn't even see us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: They weren't trying to convince you how nice they were or anything like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think so. I understand that the dentist somehow got some testimony of various prisoners. They never approached us. This was one person I would have given him a clean bill of health. He was arrested, but then he was released because he really didn't do anything ever.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember how you felt when the British arrived?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Unbelievable feeling of relief. Just went out to see them and we all went out to see them.</p><p>First the people came in and said the British tank went in. I think I've seen the British tank. They were shooting, so we were afraid to walk around. The Germans were still shooting and the Hungarians were still watching. You couldn't go outside of the camp and after they finally took all the guns from those Germans, then you went out. That's when I went to the main, on the main street and I saw this unbelievable motley crew of people. Some of them were still dying. Some of them were hardly moving. There were bodies around, but whoever could move, they were moving. They were walking, and they were smiling. And unfortunately, there were so many people who died still after the liberation. It was incredible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did the British treat you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The liberators treated us very nice. The first day they decided we are starving so they brought soup, and the soup was very rich, and we all ate the soup and all got deathly ill.</p><p>Our bodies could not absorb this fat, so everybody got sick. We overate that soup. It was a thick, I remember, with a coat of fat on top. They were very anxious to help us. The British would as I aid the British soldiers as such they were beautiful towards the patients. The British officers they were just -- later on they were funny, we had to fight <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> 6 them, but in the beginning they were just very compassionate it. Then they realized that the food they were giving us we can not take this very rich food, so they started giving us like a diet food for a while until we could adjust. They were giving us those little K rations. They were giving us cigarettes and chewing gum and some lemonade and some cookies and were giving some tins of those cookies. I decided to smoke a cigarette. Mom said, I don't want you to smoke until after the war. The war was still on, so the 8th of May and I was sitting and the cannons and you could hear the war was over and there were announcements and stuff like this. I took a package of those -- I had a whole bunch of those little player cigarettes and I was smoking one after another. She said, I told you not to smoke. She was so sick, she said I told you not to smoke. I said, "Mom, the war is over. I'm smoking." This was like an act of rebellion.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How come you remained in the camp for a while after the British liberated you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They needed some people to be still there because as I said, the transfer of the patients was such a slow one they needed us. It took them a while, maybe a week, ten days, two weeks. I don't know. And she was so sick, so I stayed. I couldn't move her. By the time we got to Bergen, they didn't have any more room, so there was this huge officers" casino and they converted this to a hospital. This was the end of everybody in Bergen. And they had this huge ballroom, it held about 170 beds. The place was gorgeous. It was a round building. They called it the round house. Out of the ballroom, there was a magnificent terrace. And Rhododendron blooming around, it was just gorgeous. There were a couple rooms where they had the casino, but they removed all the tables and they patients there.</p><p>I think the paper I gave you was signed by this doctor who became the head of this thing.</p><p>At that time our staff consisted of British doctors. They were volunteers, second or third year medical students.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your hospital was transferred to the town of Bergen?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, there were a lot of buildings to the hospital, but this was the very, very end of it, because they were transferring people all the time, but this was the very end. There must have been about 250, 300 patients at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did they burn down or do anything with the old quarters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I'll tell you that. So, we had rooms there. Mom started working a little bit there was a dental office there, but she had swollen legs. She was just working a few hours a day.</p><p>They had the most beautifully equipped kitchen I have ever seen. I don't know if many fancy restaurants here have kitchens, fully electric, they could cook a few hundred eggs at the same time. They had frying pans they could turn upside down by touching a button.</p><p>It was just unbelievable. There were naturally, a couple of elderly Germans running that kitchen for us. They claimed that they never knew anything about it. As I started telling you there was the British doctor who was the head. A few British nurses, we had British volunteer students at that time. A bunch of us, a few French nuns came from France and <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> 7 they brought in a bunch of German nurses, and there was one ward with people with t.b., diarrhea, as sick as they come. The British assigned our girls to that room, and the room that had 170 beds they were basically convalescing, and they gave the German nurses this. And we went on strike. The rationale was that since some of the very sick people cannot don't know what's going on and the Germans may harm them and we will be much more compassionate to them. Our argument was that we all went through typhus. We are all very weak, and there's no reason for us to be exposed at this point to t.b. and diarrhea and we should be assigned the convalescent, which was a much lighter load and let the Germans work there. So, we went on strike. We had a translator girl who spoke English and finally got through his head that this was the right thing to do. But he was very much afraid what will happen. We said we will supervise. We'll check, and the nurses were busting because they were all registered nurses. We were all a motley crew. We didn't have uniforms, I mean, like a butcher's apron. We had nothing, and we were watching what they were doing. Another thing I was very happy to do, they would send the women from the town from Bergen to clean the hospital and we had this was the ballroom, it had a gorgeous parquet floor and we made them wash the floor twice a day. They would come in the morning to clean, and they would come in the afternoon to clean, and God forbid that they left a dry spot. Wash it, the German word was . Lcouldn't <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> 8</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They wanted to burn off the disease. They were burning them as soon as they were empty. They were afraid. I mean the whole German population.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, your life started becoming a bit more normal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. We were there until July and they had a movie and the survivors could go to the movies during the day. The British soldiers it was there for the British soldiers at night, but I was working during the day, so I was invited by the Belgs -- the Belgs could go at night, so they would invite me to go to the movies. I was a young girl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember what the first movie is you saw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think with Esther Williams. A funny thing happened. One day they said they are going to hand someone, some Nazi somewhere nearby. Let's go, let's go see it. So, I said to Mom, I'm going. Where are you going? I don't know, to Ludenberg. So one of the girls said oh we have a truck. There was one woman and three or four of us that went. There was no hanging. We couldn't get a way back. There was no way of getting back. Finally we found there was some camp under the Poles and four or five women invited us. They had some food. They gave us their beds and we stayed with them at night. They gave us food, and the following day we are trying to get in the worst way to go back to Bergen.</p><p>We are standing on the corner and there is a mob of people looking for transport and we tried to get anything you can. At that time, there was who became <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> 9</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Free, that's exactly what it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you get to Sweden? Why did you decided to go there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, what has happened at that time, Swedish government invited "x" amount of people to go and they needed doctors and nurses and dentists to go along to take care of the patients, so we signed up. They took us to , and that was also funny. <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> 0 knew one of them in New York. They were in the advertising business. He came to Poland before the war, and we wrote a letter to David Glicksman in New York. Well, David Glicksman changed his name to David Gipson. His brothers didn't, but he changed it. He lived in Manhattan and there must have been some kind of a dead letter office in New York, and after the war they must have been opening those letters and tracing people down. The letter was written in German. He got the letter. My aunt lived in Washington. He called her up. A few days before I had an uncle, my mother had an brother in France who survived, and he contacted the family so we got established a contact and in a few days money was coming in and packages were coming in and telegrams were coming in and May 1946 we came here.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let me just ask you a few general questions. We just a have a couple more minutes. It seems like your early days, your affluence, your family education, all of that really helped you survive the war years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. I think so. The fact that Mom was a dentist so she always either made money or later on we were in the position to be sheltered a little bit more. The fact that I worked with Grandfather during the years in Ghetto, I really was very good at outpatient. I wanted to be a surgeon. I was very interested in medicine, and I was good at it, but when I came here I found out that I had to go back to school for a couple of years and by that time, I didn't have the means to go to medical school, and I really didn't want to go to be a nurse.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When things were really, really difficult during those years, and there was a lot of depravation, what do you think sustained you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think the family unit. The fact that we had the grandparents. We had to take care of them. The first few years in Ghetto, we had to take care of the older people, no matter what. I mean we took care of my grandfather and he was such an unusual person. He was a felcher and then he was grown up and then he went to dental school and became a dentist. He was extremely educated, self, well read and self educated extremely wise man, very much a head of his time. He believed in all kinds of inventions. He believed in all modern gadgets. The first modern gadget came in , I think my grandmother had one of the first electrical irons. Things like this, he was very much. He said there are ships waiting in America. Any moment they'll liberate us. They'll come in with food. They'll invent a pill that you won't have to eat anything. You'll just be able to take a pill and it will keep you going for a day. Little did he realize the to eat was very pleasant.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the family unit sustained you because you lived with your mother?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I lived with my mother. As I said, when the times she was sick, I would take care of her, when I was sick, she would take care of me. We watched each other.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did that sort of help you not to feel so isolated from the world? <span class="page-break" number="41"></span> 1</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think so. I had her. I was very close to her.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you think back, fifty years ago, your experiences, is there one haunting image? Is there something you think?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There is anger. I get angry. I watch something and I said how dare they do that to us.</p><p>How dare they made us subhumans. I mean we're human beings and what audacity to treat us the way they treated us. What nerve they had to kill us. I mean it's such it doesn't mean if I meet a German I'm nasty to them, but I have a deep burning anger of why they did it. What human being has a right to do to other human beings. I mean we watch those things and we see those children. What right do people have to do it. But he was such a systematic deliberate and also the question of dehumanizing us. People say why did you subject yourself. They did it little by little. Layers, they took layers, they took our apartment, they took the house, they took the privileges. They kicked us out from the house. They put us in the Ghetto. From the good conditions we wound up pour and no way of taking a bath and no way to shower yourself, living in that one room and gradually worse and worse and worse. It wasn't like they took someone from a very fancy house and put them in camp. Those people didn't survive, for the most part. They broke down immediately. They did it deliberately and gradually. One step at a time, one humiliation. The fact when we got to Auschwitz and they undressed us and we had to march in front of men. And the women, there were religious women, elderly women, young girls, and I was a young girl. I never undressed myself in front of any one. Here I had to march naked in front of a bunch of men. This is all humiliation. This is all making people subhuman. This is slowly and slowly and slowly so you had no we didn't have the strength to fight them. There was no way of fighting them. I mean sure there was uprising in Warsaw Ghetto, but there was no movement in Lodz Ghetto like this and</p><p> saw to it. There was no such thing as revolution and I get angry. I get <span class="page-break" number="42"></span> 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you must have felt you helped people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, you tried. As I said the question was if someone wasn't very sick we could help them.</p><p>If we had the means, if we had the dressing, we had the pill we could give it them, maybe they'll survive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you very much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You're welcome. <span class="page-break" number="43"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
