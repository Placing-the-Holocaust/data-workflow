<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Would you tell me your name please?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. My name is Isaac Bitton.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where and when were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, March 31st, 1926. I was born in the hospital at Hiletia in Lisbon.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell me about your family and about what it was like growing up in your family.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My...my mother was born and raised in Farouh in the south of Portugal. And...uh...most of the Jewish people that came to Portugal towards the end of the 1700s and beginning of the 1800s...uh...settled down in Farouh. And there was a very large community lodged and relatives over 126 families within approximately 100 years. By the 1900s they all disappeared so that Portugal...uh...Farouh today is...there is no Jewish life. But my mother was born there. She moved to Lisbon with my grandparents which originally came from...uh...uh... Morocco, Spanish Morocco and French Morocco. Therefore, my name Bitton which is a French, actually a French broken name. Uh...And of course my mother was married in Lisbon and...uh...we were five brothers and five sisters, 5 boys and 5 girls and...uh...I attended...the uh...the...uh...the schools in...in Lisbon...and...uh...the Jewish school...was a private Jewish school...uh...where we were taught Hebrew so we could...uh...we could read...uh...the prayer books. Because my family came from a reasonable religious...uh...family. Not orthodox, but...uh...religious.</p><p>And we all had to learn Hebrew and...uh...we did so. At home my...my grandparents, primarily mv srandmother snoke some Snanish and...uh...Lidino actuallv. and some of <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> impressed by the various languages spoken. Uh...At the time I spoke Portuguese and a little bit of Spanish, but when you begin to hear Yiddish...lot of...lots of Yiddish...uh...lots of German...uh...Hungarian, Czech. I remember families from Czechoslovakia. Uh...I was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and uh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangement. There were probably within the dozen tables...uh...each table would care approximately hundred...10... 10...uh..._people so the dining room for the refugees was within...uh...150 persons sitting capacity. And there was another small dining room which was for the Portuguese...uh...the Portuguese community. And next to the kitchen, soup kitchen was a Jewish hospital. I was born in a Jewish hospital. So was my entire family. It was a very small hospital, but nevertheless they took care of...uh...of the Jewish community.</p><p>So...uh...and...uh...it was during this period in history that...uh...one day while I was at the soup kitchen I hear...one family walks in...several children, father and mother...very well dressed, not dressed like a refugee as such...uh...with crumbly clothing, but really very nice and neat...uh...and L.. asked the gentleman. I said...I fact I told him, "Excuse me. This...this is for the refugees...this dining room." And he said...uh..-uh... ... in Portuguese...he said, "But we too are refugees." And...uh...1 couldn't quite understand it. I was a teenager at the time, but still...uh...[ asked him, "Why is that you are refugee.</p><p>You...you are Portuguese. How can you be a refugee." And...uh...he asked me to sit down. And it was then that I...I met the very famous...uh...humanitarian, Dr. -</p><p> _ who told me that he was the ex-consul of Portugal in Bordeaux, France. And he went on to tell me that he had been expelled by the Portuguese government simply because he had refused...he...he was asked to refuse to give...uh...uh...visas to the...to the Jewish refugees. And...uh...as a result, of course, he was removed from his position. He was disbarred because he was a lawyer by trade also, and removed from the diplomatic corps.</p><p>And...uh..I met him in Lisbon at the soup kitchen within...I do not remember exactly if he was 4 or a half a dozen. We spoke briefly. He was there in line standing with...uh...family to get his hot meal and...and to date I couldn't...I...I never got out of my mind simply that the..the men of his stature...of his caliber...uh...that had ...had really helped saved lives, was punished in such manner by being removed from...from his...doing his job.</p><p>And...uh...1 was very impressed and these image always stayed with me. Uh...L...L..I don't believe I can really tell you a great deal more about Dr. because I met him such a short few times. But I remember portions of the family. And...uh...uh...I remember the...the refugees primarily more so that were there in most cases because they were the fortunate ones that had received visas by Dr. in Bordeaux, France. Uh...I remember a family by the name of Deutsch, father, mother and two children who...they set up a shop in the most busy street in Lisbon which is called the Sheadu. In fact, it was burned out recently. Was on the portions of the city that was burned...ancient part of the Lisbon. And...uh... Mr.</p><p>Deutsch used to put...uh...a table about maybe 3 by 3 and used to sell razor blades and other little things. And I help him bring them to the areas. I used to help also to bring the refugees to some...some new residences since they were not quite familiar with Lisbon and I was quite familiar with Lisbon. Uh...There was another family...uh...by the name of Goostave Zumich...Zumich. He was from Czechoslovakia. Uh...Uh...He was a shoemaker, and he set up shop...uh...at the soup kitchen, one of the corners. And there he <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> would repair the shoes from the refugees. And...uh...l remember Mr. Brown who was also a German Jew who...uh...was the liaison between the refugees and the Jewish...uh...Portuguese community. He was in charge of... uh...uh...helping them to...uh...go and...uh...he was the one that would ask me at times, why...why don't you show this person where such and such a street is and so forth and so on. And...uh...1 remember a family by the name of, I believe Grallman, who...uh...uh...whose lady had...uh...uh... a very small little girl, a child, but she became quite ill. She was hospitalized in Lisbon....uh... for I believe was mental stress. And my Aunt Esther, God bless her soul, took care of her daughter for a given period of time and for as long as she was hospitalized prior to moving to Israel. Later on, since we traveled on the same ship to Israel...uh...the family asked me to join their own family in Nahariyya in a little farm, which I did. That's how come I arrived in Nahariyya. It was through the Grallman family.</p><p>And...uh...basically...uh...sometimes when I remember of the...uh...the...uh...the incidences...you know, you are a young man and...uh...up to that point in time in history, life in Portugal as such and Lisbon was quite uneventful for a young man.</p><p>And...uh...suddenly when all these refugees start to come in...uh...it was very exciting. I could not understand what they were saying in most cases, but they would...uh...they would come to this soup kitchen a little before noon. If it was an hour before, and they would._in erouns... vou could sit them right in the...uh... the and in Lishon is <span class="page-break" number="2"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, since you asked...since you asked...uh...uh... (clearing throat), there was a time during the war that in the north of Portugal, they had found wolfrum. And that's some type of a metal. I do not know that much about it. But it's sometime of a metal that you must mix...uh... with other metals...uh...specifically for armory. And, of course...uh...that became very, very exciting all over Portugal. And many people just left the town and went to the north to try to work on the wolfrum mines. And, of course, being an adventurer myself...uh...me and a few friends, we decided that it was the time for us to go and dig wolfrum too. So...uh...we...we went there, but we were very...most unsuccessful.</p><p>No sooner than we were there, we turned around and came back to Lisbon because, of course, we had no...no...no means...no...no money. And...uh...however little money we had...uh...didn't last that long, and I came back, of course...uh...very, very broken-hearted that I did not make a million escudos on the wolfrum mines. But...uh...that was an exciting thing. And as much as life generally speaking in Lisbon at the time for as far as I can remember...uh...other than going to school at the time, L...uh...being a member of a large family and my father, at the time...uh....God bless his soul, was working for the Portuguese printing department of the Portuguese government. And he certainly did not earn that much money either. So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help the family. So, other than school, we would pick up whatever job we could, me and my brothers. And...uh... I was involved in the dismantling, believe it or not, of World War I mines and...uh...we had a little wrench. There must have been a million bolts and nuts in these mines, and we spent all day unknotting these...these things. Uh...Another job that I took was...uh...working on ships by derusting the ballast of the ships. You know, if you're familiar with the ship ballasts, they're little oval holes at the bottom of the ship, and you go in with a little swimming suit and you go with your feet and your head and your...your arms and you stay there all day with a little hammer, and all you do is knock down the rust that accumulates in these little cubicles, You know, they're very small cubicles.</p><p>Uh... That was another part of a job. And I did other minuscule jobs and working on...uh...helping to manufacture of...uh...bicycle, painting, etc. And...uh...by and large, the...uh...there was an exciting period in Lisbon. I remember the...uh...uh...there would be a...practically every day in the newspapers some story about someone being killed. A spy or...or some activity...foreign activities...uh...in Lisbon. And there is another thing that I used to do with my friends. We used to go to the German Consulate. And they had always literature. Tons of literature! They would give away propaganda about Germany.</p><p>So we, of course, very diligently used to take as much as we could, and the moment we were out we used to toss it out in the garbage. So...uh...this was one of the things that we did...uh...for some obvious reasons...uh...actually. Another one function that I had...uh...was a neighbor of ours had a little shoe...uh...horse shoe shop. He was a big, big man and...uh...he couldn't read or write. And...uh...he always...whenever I came back from school, it was my function to come to him and read to him the newspaper and what was happening in the world. Because I used to like to read a lot. And...uh...and somehow or another we...we became very good friends, you know. And here was this big fellow.</p><p>He couldn't read. I could never understand why he couldn't read either. But he was an older gentleman. And he was still doing the horse shoes...uh... in his shop. Blacksmith? I <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> don't know how you call exactly, but...uh... So, by and large...uh...other than our going every...we had to go every night to the temple because my father...uh...my father insisted that we go to the temple every day...every night. You cannot come home unless you've been to the temple to the services. And...uh...every Friday night obviously...Saturdays, we used to go to temple. So we conducted a reasonably...uh... 1 would say a moderate Jewish life. And...uh...our house was...was, of course...uh...kosher. My father was quite kosher. And ...uh...we had a very large family, as I said...uh...uh... five boys and five girls. Although two of them were born...I...one girl... my youngest sister, Rachel, was born after I left Portugal. And I did not meet her until 17... when she was 17. And my brother, Jacob, was...uh... few months old when I left for...for __, Israel. So...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel...how did you feel being a Jew in Portugal once the war...once the war had broken out?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My only memories in this case is...uh...I didn't feel any...uh...truthfully...from the part of the Portuguese, I had no...no feelings that there were anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or anything like that. Never had that feeling while I was in Lisbon. That's the truth.</p><p>Uh...But..-uh...by being in...uh...on a...almost on a daily basis, mixed with the Jewish refugees for a given period of time, that in itself inspired in me more so the desire really to go to Israel. Number one, to go to Palestine and to join the British Army, and go and fight the Nazis, which I did as a matter of fact.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about that. You started to say...you had started to tell us about the Sofnut. Tell us about the refugees and _Sofnut. What happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Certainly. Well, once we...uh..we...uh...we left Portugal, our first stop was...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Excuse me. We have to back up. If you would please, tell us why...you were now in Lisbon.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the Sofnut came to Lisbon.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us what they did and tell us what you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, basically, the...uh...uh...as far as I can remember, they came in to...uh...help number one, to bring all the children...refugees children primarily were the number one to go on..uh...on the registration to go to Israel. And then came grown-ups. So families with children, of course, were the first ones. And they asked the Jewish community also if there were any members of the Jewish community in Lisbon that wished to immigrate to...uh...to ..to __, Israel. And I...1 and my brother were the first ones to...uh...join. Uh...In <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> fact...uh...I must say that my father at the time did not like the idea that we were going to leave Portugal. But I told him that I wanted to go to Israel. There was no Jewish life in Portugal, no Jewish youth. There was no girlfriends. At 16 a young man wants to have a girlfriend. And...uh...there was no such thing. And...uh...there were...there were, of course, many girls, but not...not Jewish. And...uh...L...L..I had very, very strong...uh...will that I wanted to marry within the Jewish faith and have Jewish children as well, and continue my Jewish life. That was really something that I always had since childhood.</p><p>And I think as I mentioned before, I was very much impressed by the...uh...photographs from the...from __.,, Israel, the wailing wall, etc. And Musrabano and other pictures that the teacher had on the wall. So we then registered with the government of Portugal. We had to pay some fees to...uh...so that we wouldn't have to go to the military, etc., and...uh...we left for Palestine. I do not remember the exact date, sometimes end of 43 aboard the ship Niasa...was a steamship, a Portuguese steamship. And...uh...there was several hundred children and adults, refugees. And...uh...our first stop was about a day...within a day, we stopped in Cadiz, Spain. In Cadiz, Spain, the ship picked up several hundred Jewish children again. And it was there that I met...uh...a fellow from the Jewish community in Tishon. His name was who with his brother Samuel. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> she called the father which was a little further below the steps. And...uh...he came in a hurry too and to help me, and we brought, you know. This...This takes a few seconds because here comes the wave and...and...and just came through the deck and there he was. And I grabbed him and so we came down there and there was no water any more or anything. And the father....I will never forget it. Uh...He jumped at my feet, and he wanted to kiss my feet because I saved...I saved his child. Now, you know, it's one of these things. You know, he could...maybe he would never gone overboard, but he could have gone overboard as well. So...uh...I do not remember their names. I do not know...once we landed in Israel, I don't know whatever happened to them because they went in different directions and...uh...uh... But nevertheless, life on board ship for the approximately | week that we spent that normally would take within 3 to 4 days, but it took a little longer because of that...those deviations that...uh...the ship had to make in the Mediterranean...Mediterranean. But we...uh...landed in Haifa. Life was not that exciting on board. You know, it...uh...people would sit again in corners talking about what happened, wishing, willing, what happened to the families, etc. in...uh...in...uh...in...uh...</p><p>Also, sort of type of permanent...permanent...uh...anxiety. That's the only way I can describe it, you know. There was I would say...uh...many sighs of relief when...when the word Israel, the land of Israel. I remember that when all of a sudden they say land, land, land. And there was Haifa __ Israel. That was a word that was very, very striking to everybody. Because everybody...all you hear at that time was Israel, Israel, and I could not understand what they were talking about. It was Polish or Yiddish or German. But you could hear all the time Israel, the word Israel. That I remember. We were unloaded into a...uh...buses and immediately brought to...uh...it was some sort, if you wish, of a concentration camp in Atleit. I don't know within 10 to 15 miles from Haifa, south of Haifa. And...uh...I asked, "What are we doing in here?" It's like a concentration camp.</p><p>Barbed wire with security police everywhere...uh...Arabs, Jews, British. And...uh...the camp was divided into two sections for...one for men and one for women. And later on we found out that...uh...because or due to strong activity from the Fifth Column...the German Fifth Column they had to do a series of interviews and they asked everyone and they checked the papers, etc. So we stayed in that Atleit within...uh...a couple of weeks.</p><p>The conditions were not the best, but they were fair. The Sofnut was there to help us.</p><p>And...uh...from there on, most of us were moved to a little...uh...a little quarters outside Haifa by the name of . And there was worse because the conditions there were...everybody was mixed, men, women, children. There was no beds. We...uh...they didn't expect apparently that large number of people at the time and they were not prepared. And...uh...as a result we slept for a few days on...on the floor with blankets, etc.</p><p>Then...uh...the...the youth were moved to a camp in Carmel in Haifa, the . And it was there that...uh...] had the great privilege and the honor of meeting the great lady of the Youth Alijah Movement, Henrietta Solt. And she was a lovely lady, God bless her soul, who...uh... I talked to her personally too. She talked to each one of us, welcoming us to ___ Israel. And...uh...some of us we were already above desirable age to stay in the Youth...with the Youth Movement. And I was one of them. So I then was moved from the to Kibbutz BitAlfa. And here I must sav that...uh...T could <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> action, you know. And...uh...I wanted to join the British Army. I wanted to join the war, not...I didn't come over here to be in a kibbutz, you know. So my brother, Abraham, staved in the kibbutz and mv cousin. _ God bless him. He also nassed away in <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> used to do a lot of duty at...uh...train station that the group of dispersed persons came in.</p><p>They came out of the train, and I don't know if they came from Germany or from where they came from, but...uh...it was several of us...MPs, military police....and when they saw the Star of David, there was one of the most __ things I ever experienced in my life. They came to you, and they kissed the Star of David. And they was saying in Yiddish,</p><p> _.. They didn't believe that. And it was very, very touching. So I spent some time in...uh...in Antwerp, and...uh...then we went to Eindhoven in Holland to a...uh...R and R camp. We spent some time there. And...uh...of course, this is after the war.</p><p>Uh...And...uh...the Jewish Brigade at the time was not doing much of anything officially.</p><p>Unofficially, the Jewish Brigade group or part of it or portion of it were very, very...uh...diligently working in moving...uh...dispersed persons from one place to another place. It reminds, perhaps, of the story of...uh...the Jewish Brigade group was like a duck that...uh...you only see the smooth sailing on...on above the water, but below water they peddle like Hell so to speak. And that's what was happening. The...uh...the Jewish Brigade group...uh...I'm assuming in conjunction with the Haganah and...uh...the Aliyah Bet and I'm sure you know the meaning of Alijah Bet. Uh...There was the convention immigration and the unconvention immigration. And the unconvention immigration was what we call today or we called then Alijah Bet. Uh...so that it would be distinguished from the convention immigration. Because the British mandate, at the time, in Palestine did not wish...did not want to allow any more Jews to come to Palestine on a variety of grounds that they believed in. But...uh...but, of course, the Jewish agency believed in...in otherwise. And the Jewish agency, of course, had other ideas. And as a result, the Alijah Bet was created. So...uh...there were many a times that...uh...in our camp, for instance, there was a time that over night there was several...uh...several...uh...tents that overnight had been erected in our...in...inside the camp. So for anyone on the outside looking at...at the army camp, another half a dozen tents wouldn't mean much of anything. Uh...Certainly, we were advised at the time that, you know, leave them along so to speak. They are dispersed persons in these tents. The reason is, of course, that the British mandate at the time...the British government...uh...with the assistance of the...uh...their various intelligence units...with the assistance of the British Royal Air Force, the British Navy, they had a blockade of Palestine not to allow any Jews to enter. And...uh...the Jewish Agency had no choice, but to try to evade their...their investigations. Where are the Jews coming from? Where are they being loaded? On what ships, etc., etc.? What ports, etc., etc.? So...uh...that's when the Jewish Brigade was of much help by using the military vehicles in transporting the refugees from one town to another town or if it's from another country, from...if it's from...from Holland to Belgium or to Italy or...or France, etc. So this involvement actually was...uh...ultimately was found out somehow, and the British government, of course, dismissed the entire Jewish Brigade.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you involved in any of this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. I...I was not directly involved. No. Not at all. No. I was only by...by virtue of being...of serving with the Corps of Military Police of the Jewish Brigade. I do know that...uh...there was...uh...every...every vehicle...army vehicle had a log. And in this log, <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 0 of course, you have to write the moment you leave your camp, where you going, who is for, dut dut dut da. So...uh...they used to..to write in their logs when they were moving refugees three letters in English. T-T-G. And actually the meaning...uh...is...uh... Hebrew, Arabic. and Yiddish. which means ~ Which means if. if vou nardon me. un vour <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 because the word at the time was that...uh...things did not go that good for...in Palestine.</p><p>The...uh... (clearing throat)...when it came to...was the beginning of the...uh...the problems...the...uh...the...the war, of course, if you did not travel in a convoy, then the chances of going from a place A to place B alive was...was very difficult. And...and it was here that I came quite involved in the...in the underground...in the Haganah between...uh... primarily between Haifa and Nahariyya and the Western Galilee. We used to meet convoys going south in Shavatsion, a few kilometers south of Nahariyya and....uh...and take as many cars as possible and...uh...in each one of the vehicles was at least one person, one member of the Haganah which was armed. Now if it was a girl...it was many of the girls that...that were also armed or if it was a boy...either if he were sitting on top of the truck or in the bus or in the car or in a motorcycle, etc....uh...that was a safe way for us to travel at the time. And coming back in the late afternoon...early evening during the daylight, we would...uh...we would all congregate in the ., you know. next to Haifa. and because between and Haifa was reasonably safe with <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 2 another occasion coming back when...when just shortly before the war really started and things were getting a little tougher...uh...several people had been killed in Akko...that...one by a...in a motorcycle. They tried to cross Akko alone, so to speak, by car, by bicycle, and they never made it. So one time I arrived...uh...a little late, and my wife, at the time, was pregnant and I...1...I had to go, get home. And...uh...certainly, I always had a gun with me, a 45 pistol liberata, Italian hand gun. But...uh...since I was driving at the time a Volvo...it was an old truck, and I had on...on my truck I had...uh...flour for the bakery, and a variety of other products. So I took my Arabic...uh...</p><p>head dress which I used to carry with me because since I'm quite dark featured, I could pass very easily as an Arab. I put my head Cafia on and...uh...when I arrived at the gates, they had this...we called this Spanish donkeys...is barbed wire on...uh...cross...uh...horses you know. And we used to call it Spanish donkeys. And...uh...when I came to the city of Akko, the entrance to this...to this gate, I just put my head of the...my cab, and I shouted in Arabic. " ? NOnen the sate. Onen the vate." And the... the suv looked at me and <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 3 successful in illuding the enemy at the time...uh...from advancing, because they did not know what was expected from...from them. And...uh...but...uh...at this point in time...uh...I'd like also to talk to you about an experience just very, very shortly before this...the war started, there was a convoy going to Yesshiam, Kibbutz Yesshiam.</p><p>Yesshiam was the name of a young man by the name of Yesshiam Vis, who was a meter of the PALMA, special forces of the Israeli...uh... Haganah. And...uh...Yesshiam Vis was amongst the detachment of...uh...PALMA that involved in operation bridges. In 1947, the Haganah decided to build, to blow up every bridge...every bridge that was connecting at the time the land of Israel so to speak and all the other Arab countries.</p><p>And...uh...so...uh...it was very effective. The main purpose, I understand, was...uh...uh...just to show that...uh... we can take care of ourselves, and also some sort of a warning also toward the Arabs, you know, that..."Don't attack." It didn't maybe work, but said don't attack us. Leave us alone. Let us be. Unfortunately, there is a legend about the...the... Yeeheim Vis. The bridge they were supposed to blow up was in...uh...was called Asiv, which goes back to the Finnishian times. It's a little bridge.</p><p>And...uh...uh...the legend is that...uh... the...uh...from some Arabs later on we found out that there was a group of British army...uh...soldiers. There was a British army camp not too far away from Asiv, that...uh... was...apparently, they were doing some sort of manuevers in the middle of the night unbeknown to the group. And as a result, they were ambushed. Since every...and each of one these young men carried the...the dynamite, explosives with them. Uh...There was...not a thing was found from them. Absolutely nothing! They just disappeared. Was about 8 if I remember correctly. And today there is a memorial to...uh...Yeeheim Vis in Asiv by the bridge. And...uh..before the war, there was an American...as a matter of fact, an American group of young men and women that built a kibbutz in Asiv, by the name of Asiv...American...I was there on the commemoration with General Adror at the time. But in the meantime the...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We need to stop at this point and change tapes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In...in the meantime, actually, the Jewish Agency decided...uh...to honor the name of Yeeheim Vis. His father was at the time, I believe, a high official in the Jewish Agency.</p><p>So...uh...in the Western Galilee, there was too much openness actually, especially coming in from the mountains...uh.. So they decided...the Jewish Agency decided to build two kibbultzes. It was just shortly before the war started. And one of them is named, today, of course, Yeehim. I'm quite familiar with the area because Yeehim if you go back to... uh... to several vears aco. used to he called in Arabic. And there was an <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 4 remember that I was there at the time. And this kibbutz was built already under fire...under Arabic fire because...uh...you could...it was a very...it was a very excitable day because here were the Haganah putting up little sheds and so forth, girls making food, and here these guys were shooting down from...from the...from a spot called the Mountain of the...the Tree Mountain. Because was in above the higher level. And...uh...1 can't remember exactly all the names in Hebrew any more, but it's...was like a tree because there was a large tree there. And...uh...that's basically how come that this kibbutz Yeeheim came about, to honor Yeeheim Vis, basically. And we used to go...uh...prior to the war...uh...the Haganah used to train and we used to bring arms, ammunitions, and food to kibbutz Yeeheim . We used to walk for 4 and a half hours from Nahariyya to Yeeheim because vou 20 un to the mountains and vou have to walk to --~ and vou <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 5 away through a...his own __ road that he made to the Western Galilee. But nevertheless ....uh...the attack on the convoy to ____ was quite successful simply because there was a serious of tragedies. Uh...Number one, the officer commanding the...uh...the convoy was...by name of...uh...uh...Ben Aame if you heard about him. And...uh...my best friend, Moses Shinerman was a lieutenant at the time in the unit. This was my unit. I was spared simply because my wife was giving birth to my daughter at that...a few hours before that.</p><p>And because she was quite ill with a..-with a bone...some type of...uh... deficiency, that the doctor at the time...we did not have a hospital at that time there..he said, "Isaac, you must stay here." And in fact he even talked to our commanding officer, that I must stay there because they expected the worst from birth. Fortunately enough, nothing happened.</p><p>But...uh...Alisa Shiner, which was like my sister, came to see the baby at...before she left even to the convoy. And...uh...I said, "Gee, I wish I could go, but the doctor did not allow me to go." I had to stay there. So the convoy left...uh...uh...a few...1t was a few minutes after the left Nahariyya, they were all ambushed. Because they...they ...they waited until the...the...uh...last truck had passed this zig zag and then they started to put some rocks and they put some rocks at the other end of the zig zag so that they first car unbeknown to them was able...was able to break the barricade. The second car in line was the bus.</p><p>The bus had armor. The Israeli, at the time, they put armor and they welded these heavy metal plates in the cabin so that the driver would not be hurt. Unfortunately, as the driver of the bus was trying to turn around, they threw apparently some of a molotov cocktail.</p><p>And both of the tires were shot so the truck then became paralyzed in...in closing the road. So all the other 6 or 7 other trucks...they were behind them...okay...we...we felt the same...the same thing. They couldn't move. And as a result the...uh...the people were given the word apparently to...uh...save yourself. And... uh...very, very few were to...to survive this incident. Uh...they were able to escape by hiding on the water that flows from the Western Galilee to Nahariyya to the ocean...to the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean. There was a little bit creek, and they were able to survive by hiding there because in the meantime it was beginning to be dark, you see. Had the convoy had left earlier although it was 20 in the afternoon, 20 to 3...uh...March...uh...uh...it wasn't quite full summer yet. And...uh...they survived by staying there in the dark, and maneuvering.</p><p>Some of them arrived in Nahariyya and they...what...the next thing what happened was the British mandate was...the army was and the police were still at the time in Palestine, they did not allow the Haganah to...whoever the forces that we wanted to go out and try to help, but they would not allow it. Could not live Nahariyya. And it was one of the ereatest disasters that we suffered...uh...in...uh...in the Haifaam.. the convov to Haifaam. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 6 personally. And I have never seen a thing like this in my life. For several days, the entire all the houses alono the main road Haifa Beirut were emntied. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 7 garbage into the truck. But they did it. It was very, very cold...cold. And...uh...so we afterwards, we had to wait several hours. We were allowed in when they cleaned up on the roads, etc., and the mess...we were allowed to go to Nahariyya in our convoy when we met.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well I (clearing throat) after the war I...1 became a tourist driver guide, licensed by the government and...uh...I had one of the blue license. There was a red and a blue. I was not a biblical scholar, but I did have and I do have a basic knowledge of the western Galilee, and I was familiar so I drove many, many....uh...tourists... dignitaries. Uh...1 drove...uh...Polish...uh...commission. They were making a film in the western Galilee. I drove...uh...I drove the Turkish Consul-General to Jerusalem...uh...the new one that came to...to Israel at the time. I drove...uh...a....uh...Jewish Parliamentary Commissions that came to visit also the western Galilee. Uh...I was assigned at one time, and I drove...uh...Isaac Bensfee, the President of Israel at the time, and his wife. They sat in the back of my car, and in the front...uh...we picked up in Auspina on the way to...uh...the excavations of Hotsora at the time...uh...we picked up the very famous archaeologist,</p><p> wh...God bless their... their souls. Uh... He was the leadine...uh.. archaeologist in the <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 8 very exciting man. He was a Polish Jewish fellow...uh...namely Abe Rockland was his name, God bless his soul. And he told me in his broken English, he said, "You should come to America yesterday." And..uh...kind of I...1 start to think a little bit more in that.</p><p>Now | always liked United States. As a child in Portugal, I used to love to read.</p><p>Books...the little booklets about Buffalo Bill. That was my number one hero was Buffalo Bill. And the buffalo and the...and the things...fights with the Indians and all that sort of things. I used to read a lot. And that's how I...I read a lot of it in...in...1 couldn't quite understand English at that time, but I forced myself and taught myself some English. And so I always had the good vision that the United States, of course, is...is the greatest in the world. And it is. And...uh...and we decided then to immigrate, to come to the United States, and we left Israel...uh...in 1959, and we came to the United States in 1959. My wife, Miriam, and my daughter, Tamara, my son, Daniel, and my son, Michael. Uh...My daughter, Tamara, went to Switzerland to live with the rest of the family after she graduated from high school. My son, Daniel, of course...uh... stayed in...with us, and...uh...he joined the army without my knowledge...uh...joined the Vietnam war. He volunteered to...uh...to...to go to Vietnam. And...uh...although (clearing throat) I am very, very proud of him because...uh...he served with great honors...the...uh...with the Green Berets, and also with the Ninth Armed Calvary. And he was shot down four times...uh...from the helicopters. He used to be with the...uh...the...uh...the small...uh...OV helicopters, the observations helicopters. And fortunately enough, he was always fell in some rice paddies or within the area that he was not...never injured.</p><p>Uh....he jumped out of the choppers actually, when the choppers were...were attacked.</p><p>And...uh...he's very heavily (clearing throat) honored ...uh...Presidential citations and bronze stars. He has three bronze stars and many other medals, and I'm very, very proud of him. And Michael, my younger son, works with me in the business.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. Can you tell us a little more about your impressions of the refugee community that filled the Jewish soup kitchen? More about the people, and about the numbers of people that came there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Alright. It's...uh... <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 9</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you repeat the question? Just repeat it a little. The microphone will pick it up.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. L...uh...uh...I understand that you would like to know a little bit more about the situation in the soup kitchen...uh...perhaps some numbers of refugees that came by and what was the...the situation, the atmosphere. Uh...It's...uh...sometimes difficult..-uh...to go back so many years and...and be able to precisely memorize on what happen then.</p><p>Uh...But something of very interest that I should have and I did not mention earlier, was...uh...by a sheer coincidence, as I told you before, I happened to be a cousin to Senator from Minnesota, Rudy Boshwitz, through my wife because of the marriage. And his wife, Ellen Boshwitz, was one of the refugees that passed through Lisbon at that point in time in history. But I don't remember meeting her then, because she was much younger. She was a younger person than me. And I do not remember...I don't she was necessarily at the soup kitchen because not all the refugees that came to Portugal were at the soup kitchen. Some of the refugees...they...they were persons of means that were able to somehow manage to bring some money with them, some...and they were able to stay in...in hotels and...uh...for a given period of time. And...uh...and I understand that Ellen and her family...they left Lisbon by boat to Brazil, and then from Brazil, they came to the United States. But...uh...most of the other refugees that really had no means and were waiting for visas to...uh...to... uh...immigrate to the Unites States, to Israel, to South America, etc., etc...uh...there was a time in...uh...Portugal when...uh...many of these refugees" visas had expired, and they are allowed to stay a given period of time, if it was 3 months, 6 months, etc. And as a result the...uh...the Portuguese, if I may say so, are verv...the Portusuese laneuage is a verv complete laneuage. Thev sav 7 <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 0 Uh... That Jews were persecuted by the Portuguese government, I can't say that either.</p><p>Either than the fact that _____ was removed from his position, that it is true of the Portuguese people, not the government, that they were very helpful to the Jewish refugees. In many instances! And many stores even, I understand, even giving them clothing. Although I have tendency to disagree with some of the statistics that are coming out from the Portuguese government side stating that over 40,000 Jewish refugees came to Lisbon. I...I know...I'm quite certain that...that as many refugees as I saw in the soup kitchen, I did not see 40,000 refugees come to the soup kitchen. If indeed there were refugees that came to Portugal and somehow they...those that you never knew about...they...they came in; they stayed a few days in a hotel; they got a visa; they kept on going to South America or...or...or North America or...or...or Palestine or Israel or other countries for that matter, I do not know. I do not know. And...uh...in as much as the atmosphere itself in the soup kitchen, it was..uh...I tried to bring back my...my mental memory...uh...and look at these families sitting on the table and...uh...and...uh...they were not happy faces to say the least. You could always see sad faces. Okay? Faces of when...when a person is concerned, when you are worried about...uh...whatever happened to...to your mother, your father, your uncle, your aunt, your niece, your brother, your sister? You don't know. You didn't know. You were the lucky one. You were able to make it. You run away fast. You..you were lucky to do it. You saved your life. What happened to the other ones? And it was very difficult. And it was a concern because as you well know, Jewish are so very emotional, and...uh...there were many a tears in the kitchen soup, many a tears and you could see...you could observe that. Uh...And yet there was...uh...as I told you before about this fellow, Gustof Zumick, repairing the shoes of other refugees. That was the least he could have done to help his fellow...fellow...fellow in...in...in this instance you know. So there was a...a...a still a little bit of a sense .of...uh...of, "I am your...my brother's keeper," you know. That's a atmosphere that I can best describe. Helping someone with the nothing that you have, you know. And I think it was very typical of the...of the Jews at the time, helping each other with the least that they had, with the nothing that they had. So I don't know if I answered your question.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You did indeed. Is there anything you want to add.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: (Sigh) Yes. I...I'm having a hard time keeping my tears inside me. Because every time when I think about these things, you know...uh...I happen to be Jewish too and very emotional too. It's hard to keep them down. Really. It's...uh...my friends that were killed during the war and....uh...even some of the what I saw in Europe with the dispersed persons and...uh... Later on in Israel, if I may add that too, as I became a tourist driver ouide. there was a kibbutz bv the name of Tn Enelish. it's called the schetto of <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 1 people that were able to...to get out of the Warsaw....Warsaw ghetto alive. I guess most of the leaders were all killed by the...by the ...by the Germans, by the Nazis armies. But they survived. And...uh...as the kibbutz was being from...from the very beginning...uh...which was built near a Roman aqueduct in.. about 5 kilometers south of Naharivva. ag it <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
