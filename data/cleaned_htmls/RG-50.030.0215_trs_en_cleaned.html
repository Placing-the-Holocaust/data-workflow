<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Jerry Slivka.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where and when were you born?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was born July 11, 1915 in the Western Ukraine, which was at that time Czarist Russia.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Jerry, can you tell me something about your family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, uh I...my father was born same town. My mother was born in the same town and I had uh two sisters and two brothers. My father was a uh I don't know if you know what it means...kind of a muscue (ph)...it was a modern, self-taught Hebrew scholar. He also had like myself had the affinity for languages, uh nat...nat...natural ability I should say, and he, before the war, before the 1st World War, he used to teach uh the Polish children of Polish nobility who lived in the Ukraine, were the the owners of the large estates, the Poles, and he used to teach their children Polish. Self-taught...himself...taught himself Polish and German, and he also was a Hebrew teacher. In those days it was a very rare thing to teach modern Hebrew, because most of Jewish education was the 5 <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> Semitic uh armies. There was Batura (ph), and there was Bela and there were many others and whoever went by uh the Jews were their victims. The pogroms there were...you know...uh but somehow we survived and in 1920 the Soviets were pushed backed from Warsaw...the the Poles call it to this day the miracle of the , and uh we became, Poland became a normal so-called democratic country. It turned out afterwards it was not democratic for everybody but was semi-democratic, and we lived there until 1939. Uh in the beginning it was not as bad a country as being built. Uh my father went into business. He was not a good businessman (laughter) (cough). He supplemented his income by doing some bookkeeping and writing petitions to the Polish courts in Polish because the majority of the population were Ukrainians, of course, and Jews where we lived and they needed somebody to...there were a few Polish people that knew Polish, so he used to supplement his income by writing petitions to the to the courts or any other Polish authorities. I grew up uh in this town till about...when my father lost his job before that he he went...he became a teacher in the neighboring town where I, we, where I was where I was born, and for several...for about a year or so I stayed. I was three years old and I already started learning something and my father was a stickler for for education. And uh I stayed there for a year or two. I missed my...it was only twelve kilometers away but it might have been (laughter) you know the the moon. That's that's while, you know, didn't have any cars or we went by train which then you had to walk six kilometers or went by horse and wagon, so it was tough and I missed my family though my father was there. One day I remember my father went for , went home, and he left me there and my...and and he took by horse and went to the nearest railroad station which was about six kilometers away and I I was probably four or five years old and I ran after the realize it that he sneaked out I guess. He didn't want...it was expensive to go by train, see, but he didn't realize...to this day I remember it. I I resented it very much, and I ran after him into the forest. They had to go through a big forest. There were wolves in the forest but he...I was yelling, you know, and and he he heard me and he turned back and he took me with him. (Laughter) So I grew up in that town. Then my father went to as I told you before, and he didn't do badly. It was...he had a uh military garrison. The the the terrain around our town was swampy and and lot lots of forests, lots of woods and it was used for training the Polish army, so we used to do business with the Polish army. Uh my father used to have a uh beer parlor like, you know, which Poles used to come and drink. He also had a kind of a so-called department store-like which was probably twelve by twelve (laughter), but it had everything and we used to make a living from the...the Ukrainian peasants used to come and buy from us.</p><p>Uh later on it was very difficult because in 1936 I think, died, the leader of Poland who established a semi-dictatorship and since then the life for Jews in Poland was very tough.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: we've talked a lot about Poland. I would like to know about you as a <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> influenced my life very greatly. His name was Moshi . He was a modern Hebrew teacher. He taught me everything, you know, all...my my rounded education all in Hebrew, so I learned Hebrew quite well. Uh but it was compulsa...this was...this was schools were not recognized by the Polish government. They were uh...we, we ourselves organized them. You know, we used to hire our teacher and this was a small town, probably about forty Jewish families, so we we were compelled to to attend the Polish grammar school, which in our town went only to the fourth grade. In bigger cities it went to the seventh grade. And and and I was very advanced for that kind of education, you see, except in Polish, which I learned, but I mean uh math and all the other subjects I learned already when I was five years old. I had to learn ,SoI1L...I went up through the fourth grade and later on my parents enrolled me into a uh gymnasium which is high school. Uh it was operated by the network of Hebrew schools, Zionist Hebrew...Hebrew language teaching Hebrew uh teaching Hebrew in " which is uh about thirty kilometers from my town, and I stayed there. And again I stayed with a family which was uh very crowded. They had two rooms with four kids and I was with them and my uh mother used to send me every week uh freshly baked , pastry and butter and all this stuff and I managed by myself as so. I entered...I took an exam and entered the third class. This was a uh...well, this was high school up to the eighth...you graduated uh matriculated uh in eight eight classes. I entered in the third, but they were very expensive and at that time my father's business went down and he could not afford to pay and after a year my younger brother was ready to go to school. He wanted him to get a little bit of education, so I was... went home and my younger brother, second brother, went to school. So my formal education ended there. I still had the same teacher we had before for about a year and a half, till about my thirteenth year, thirteen, fourteen years old and that was it. That that's where my formal education ended.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>I tried of course all the time to upgrade my education. I I taught myself. I read a lot and this teacher helped me a great deal. Uh at that time it was a very difficult... what do when you are fourteen or fifteen? And we had some, I had friends...well, my age probably we had a group of about ten kids, boys and girls, and we organized a uh group. Originally it was , a leftist Zionist organization. Later on the majority thought that this <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> interested too much in it. I don't know why and I couldn't get established so I went to Lodz (ph). Lodz was the industrial capital of Poland. Had a great textile industry and Jews were uh dominated the small textile businesses, uh manufacturing sweaters, uh socks, uh gloves, these kind of...the large textile mills, even though some of them were owned by Jews, had no Jewish employees. They had non-Jewish employees. It was so- called which was owned by a Jew named Cohen (ph) who was, by the way, a <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> local authorities and uh I saw a lot of wagons there. There was not even a yet.</p><p>This was still still uh privately owned. They called them all . They were sitting there was a some people from the NKBD in charge of this and they told us...uh first of all they screened everyone of us and said can you, can you spend the night, can you spend the morning and so forth, and when they came to me I told them I can't...I have to be in the morning in the store because I have to distribute bread and there was...aga...again a military garrison there which we supplied with bread, their families would buy bread, and [had to be there in the morning. I I smelled there was something wrong there. I didn't know what. In the morning when I woke up I saw hundreds of wagons taking away these Polish families from all around, from the whole region, uh loading them into into uh freight cars. Uh they had, these freight cars had little stoves to heat...not like the German.</p><p>By by the way, I think that Hitler learned from Stalin how to how to do these things. Of course he improved on it using German technology and German, you know, ___ but originally it was tough. And in one night they re-settled hundreds of families in our region, Poles, and sent them to Siberia. Also some of the former Communist leaders were arrested and you know, it was kind of uh the same thing I think that is going on Israel. They they...( ) I know, but but there is there is a common thread there. Uh whoever had some grudge against somebody else, they denounced them and they were taken away. I know a very good friend of mine was...a Ukrainian, not a Jew, Ukrainian...leader of the , Spent probably about four or five years in Polish jails for being a Communist. The Communist Party was illegal in Poland, and he was sent away to Siberia, together with these Poles, the same night. But we didn't have...there weren't very many rich Jews in town. sent away, most of...in the big cities they sent away <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> government jobs were closed to Jews. And here the Soviet Union came in and to calling somebody a dirty, you know, Jew or kike (ph)...it was fifteen years in Siberia.</p><p>This was Stalinism, and so so uh it was kind of...we didn't realize then what was going on in the Soviet Union. Of course there were millions already sent away. Millions dying. There was there was cannibalism. But we didn't know that... to us this was ideal. It took us some time. In 1941, when the war started between...the the Germans...the the...Hitler's forces attacked the Soviet Union. We were about uh forty kilometers from the border. I was mobilized into the Soviet army. I was too old already to go in the regular army... was called to reserve training, for about four or six weeks I was already at that time twenty-six. They took me for a few weeks into a unit which watched enemy war...uh enemy aircraft, in training, of course, because nobody expected a war. This was about the middle of June, June 10th or 12th, somewhere along there</p><p> . | was stationed at the same in town. These people would go home for meals and uh one day, on June 22nd, I happened to be on watch in a tall tower. I was standing there with binoculars watching for enemy craft, and sure enough I saw enemy craft...I saw the German Mescherschmidts (ph). They were flying on their way back from Kiev.</p><p>They had already bombed Kiev, the last city in the Ukraine, and on the way back they dropped a few bombs in our...at the railroad station, not aiming at anything, just to create a little bit of panic. And when I called the center to tell them ...it was an old fashioned field telephone...you crank it...and I called that this wasn't the uh headquarters. It was _here, and I called them and told them that I think I saw (laughter) I saw enemy craft and that they bombed our railroad station. (Laughter) He says is that so.</p><p> . They knew already , and so he asked me what kind of it <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> further, but somehow we got out and we came to Kiev (ph), and in Kiev they assigned me and a few others to to another unit. It was a uh machine gun unit in in bunkers.</p><p>The...about twenty, thirty kilometers from Kiev. It was called the Kiev defense line all along heavily built cement uh blocks cement un cement bunkers with machine guns in them, and they they had a garrison of about ten thousand people in it, with a commissioned officer and non-commissioned officers. We were supposed to It was camouflaged with a barn, so when they looked from the other side, they saw the barn. The Germans were just across the river, about half a mile away, so then they saw us...and they're not supposed to see us. We had trenches built from the barn but one day they uh a few artillery shells they demolished the barn. There was the bunker (laughter) in its full glory standing. And uh we stayed there for a few weeks. I happened to be elected the uh the editor of the unit newspaper. The Soviet Union has every every every establishment uh the commercial or military uh etiquette, used to have a war paper, paper that was, you know, the praise those who did good work and criticize those who did bad work, and so on and so on. I didn't know in the beginning what it was, so I wrote articles about the glorious Soviet army and Stalin and so on. Finally, they called me and told me this, this is not...Pravda will take care of that. You write who in the unit learned to shoot better than _, who has been falling asleep on the...one day I did fall asleep, but . Uhso they...every so often I used to be called to conferences that the</p><p> , the political uh comman..the political officer of the units, which was in, near Kiev. One day they called me in. They told me to take my rifle, whatever I had...I didn't have much...and report to the headquarters of this...it was a...called...it was the nineteen, twenty-ninth uh independent battalion, machine gun battalion, to report to headquarters in the rear and I did report there and they took me in to a place there and there I found some uh neighboring...uh one fellow I knew which was not , was a Jewish fellow from a town near us and I found there many others, Jews and Ukrainians who were from the so- called western Ukraine, that were born, or lived...not just born...lived in in the Soviet...the territory that was Poland before the war, and they took us on the front, with the purpose of putting us in work battalion, because they trust us. . The irony of the thing <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> you know. There was no no and I lost my watch because we came to a <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> side and there we landed in a village.... The minute we we we crossed, we swam over that river, I decided to have a cigarette. Not food but a cigarette, smoke it, and I took a puff</p><p> and at this.... I wouldn't be there, I probably would have stayed there, but he , and he survived. So we went to the village and the village was burning so we <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 0 work battalions. That's a whole long story. Took us...they took us to uh Stalingrad, Stalingrad uh and we dug anti...anti-tank ditches. It was already winter. Uh the ground was frozen probably six feet and there was six feet cover of snow and we cleared the snow, dug the ditches. The the Germans never crossed them. They went all around. Was a waste of time. Uh with very little food. We stayed in peasants" houses worked together all the time. We stayed there for a few months till spring and in the spring they took us to another town and there they were building a railroad between...uh started between...on the other side of the _, from , from the Caspian Sea, all the way past...I can't remember now the name of the city. Four hundred kilometers of railroad.</p><p>There was no railroad on the other side of the Balkan. The Germans already occupied the territory, uh the west side. This was the eastern side of the Balkan. And then they built a railroad and this was administered by the MKBD, the uh prison authorities. And the workers were prisoners. We were not. We were work battalions but under their jurisdiction. So my friend and I were picked to guard headquarters, which was a very cushey job. rifle watch this would be free in the village not too many men, mostly women, but you got some food __. Then one day there was a quarrel between the MKBD and the military uh don't make the _ by building that railroad and we stayed __ guards. . This was a very difficult job because it was all done by hand. Uh the territory there, the the topography, it's flat so we had to dig, you know, on the side of the road there and make a...how do you call it when you make a railroad...a trestle...the the high mountain like...all by hand, yes, we did it by hand. There was one of the uh KPDB colonels used to come and inspect it. Happened to be Jewish.</p><p>His name was___ and | | remember the name because it was in Hebrew, it was the name of , White Russian uh shirt, navy blue pants with shiny boots and he used to</p><p> . And . And he used to the rations the prisoners get, so if if you made the norm...it was twelve cubic feet, whatever you had to by wheelbarrow <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1 all those who were surrounded by Germans, and again those who they seemed uh they deemed not worthy or not trustworthy and the sent us away to the Euro (ph) Mountains.</p><p>Uh part way by foot we walked and then by trains till we came...I think it was wel.</p><p>can't remember the name...but I think it's Euro Mountains. It it was early fall but there was already snow and a thick pine forest in tents, and they said they were...they dig out of a a uh hole in the ground, put a tent over it, put a little uh wood-burning stove which had to be fed twenty-four hours a day. There was no shortage of wood around there, so we used to sit and you know feed that stove and sit around the thing to keep warm. And we stayed there for a few weeks. It was administered KBD, surrounded by barbed wire and that was it. We didn't know what's happening to us. After a few weeks they put us and took us under guard already, under guard, to the railroad station and they put us in...they used to call them the wagons. was the uh Minister of the Interior under the czarist the czarists uh government. And he designed these prisoners, these prisoner's uh wagons. They were like from the outside you saw passenger uh train un you know, railroad wagon, but inside it was the bars, specially designed for prisoners.</p><p>Even though each car, each uh section was supposed to hold four or eight prisoners, they put sixteen and uh they gave us rations of about two hundred grams of uh dry bread used to get about ten grams of sugar,</p><p> . And for two weeks we were in that train. Hungry, dirty...uh <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 2 Tape #2</p><p> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: We're back. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 3 used to stand around you in sheep...sheepskin uh coats with the kelp (ph) boots and dogs...___. We were standing shivering and the dogs...you got if you turned right or left they jumped you. Was the worst thing. And then we stand in fours and they take you into the coal mine. One day a a wagon with bread, a horse-drawn wagon, turned over. It was on the road to the uh to the mine. And, you know, it was snow, and it turned over. I don't remember if it was a sleigh or or or a wagon, but it was like a box, you know, for delivery. It turned over...a few hundred loaves of bread and it disappeared in two minutes. (Laughter) I I couldn't get any but a friend of mine...if you lived there, very, you know, very close to each other, regardless. I was the only Jew. Later on I saw another Jew, and there were three...then I found out there were three more Jews toward another part...but that bread disappeared. He gave me a piece of that bread and ___ and we stood at the mine and worked and the norm was twelve uh tons in eight hours. Uh I was...I used to dig the coal. Later on we we got uh some explosives to explode it before we dig it, and [had girls load it on the conveyer belt, metal conveyor belt. That was it. So we stayed there for about a year and a half. Then again, after Stalingrad they started taking uh German prisoners. They needed the place for them. They let us free. But not to move.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>You had to stay and work in the mine as a free coal miner. By the way, the coal miners are the elite of Soviet workers, you know. They get the highest uh pay...at that time we didn't...the highest pay. They have access to cars now and at that time it was...we had access to a higher ration of bread. Then they transferred us to another mine, a few kilometers away, and there we were free already. Again, we we lived in barracks but I mean no no guards. It was like uh workers" quarters. And there it was a little easier. You know, a lot of girls and young men...you know, it was...uh I have some good memories of that time, even though __ we always hungry a little bit, a little bit... not too bad and we used to get...if you made the norm used to get a hundred grams of vodka or a hundred grams of uh uh pork, and I used to...(laughter)...suck ___ with the skin on it. To the last drop, delicious. I think I couldn't touch it...we ate it. And we had enough...well, not enough...always hungry a little bit. We had two meals a day, the bread...and and I never had, I have...a lot to eat and I never could save up my bread for an extra meal. I had to finish it from the beginning to the end, but we ate in a in a cafeteria. They served us meals there. Uh this lasted till "45. The war ended and we celebrated. We got beer. We had...there was another camp near us, next to ours, which was the same as we had before.</p><p>Guarded, but they...up to...they had to be there to sleep in the camp, but I mean they had freedom to move around uh after work, and to work they went by themselves, without guards, you know. This was this was Soviet Germans, not German prisoners of war. They were Soviet Germans. Some of them didn't even know German. They came from they, a lot of them from the Vulga (ph), near the Vulga. There was a German uh autonomic region which had...I I happened to walk by by the way through my wanderings I happened to go by there when they were resettled, in 1941, when the war started. The</p><p> . There were about a million and a half of them. They were resettled. Never came back. And I saw the difference between their villages and the the Russian villages. They were laid off, even streets were laid out, you know. Each one named Karl Marx Straussen (ph), uh Straussen and so on and so on and they had each house was the same, <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 4 laid out. They had autonomy. They had schools taught in German. I met these people in in in the coal mine, in the next coal mine, so they...and and and we celebrated the end of the war. It was May 5th I think it ended, Russian date . And we picked <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 5 And I wrote that I already found out that my family perished. I got a letter when I was in the first mine. I...when the front approached my town, uh they were probably fifty to a hundred miles uh kilometers away...I wrote a letter to my home town, to whoever may...whoever, you know, uh got it and the and the local Soviet there, they'll know who I am. They'll know the family, because it was a small town. I figured whoever will get it, I will find out something. So I wrote and the town was not yet liberated, but the next town east was liberated, and a friend of mine worked in the post office. There were already established post offices and he worked in the post office and he intercepted that letter.</p><p>And he wrote to my brother who was already, who was in the partisans and he told me about _. In 19...when when the Germans occupied our town in 1941 uh there was a uh big oil dump in our town that the Soviets built and when they retreated in 1941, from "39 to "41 they built it...n'41 when the Germans occupied it, they exploded it and a lot of this...it was aviation oil, aviation uh fuel...uh leaked into the soil, sandy soil, so they used the Jews to squeeze out that oil, that fuel from from the soil and turn it over to the Germans. Now the Jews had the opportunity to steal some of it and trade it with the peasants for food, so for a year they lived not bad. Although here and there they would kill a Jew or beat up...my brother was beaten up, my father was beaten up, but it was not so bad. They didn't know what's going on in the whole world, or the next town even, but there was no ghetto. They could move ___ and they lived not bad with this, you know, relatively not bad. Uh 1940, until 19...till 1942, for a whole year and then in "42 uh they heard rumors that the nearby city of ___, which had a population of about twenty thousand Jews, was burned in the synagogue. And other towns, here and there somebody will escape and you know, word gets around, so a group of young people decided to leave the town and to go into the forest. They knew that something will happen. So they made some make-shift arms...uh board uh which uh spring that would fire a bullet if you could find one. Probably would kill you first, and uh they prepared to escape, a few youngsters, probably about twenty of them between the age of twelve, fourteen to twenty-four. My brother...my brother was...a friend of mine went into __ that came and and I got him settled in my town and he then couldn't escape. So they organized a group to go to the forest, uh get some arms so they can go to the peasants and terrorize them into giving them some food, , get some food and about...over twenty left. Half of them <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 6 And my father, when he tried to convince them not to let let us...we are young...maybe we will survive somehow. So my mother went and two of my brothers...we also had a cousin that came from Warsaw, to the next guard a peasant of our village that she knew...you knew, you know everybody. And she gave him some uh warm clothes that we still have left, you know, fur-lined jackets...not not mink but sheepskin uh and he he let them through. He let them through. He could have uh he could have killed them all. Now take away everything and that's it, but he didn't do it. So these boys left. My mother went back home. Uh they went out...they had a point in the forest where to meet and my mother went back, of course, and the next day they rounded them all up, shot them to __ exploded . Uh my brothers left and went to the forest and went to terrorize some peasants, got some food and organized a partisan group to fight the Germans, with what, how I don't know. Uh a little bit later some escaped Soviet prisoners of war joined them and a lot of...all the people came. It was a civilian camp. And some of them uh craftsmen, you know, uh blacksmiths, uh uh they built, built stoves and uh stone masons, uh tailors...because there were a lot of Jews in the little towns did these things, you know, most of them. Some had a small trade see, and they they were needed, you know, because they built uh the stoves and the the uh they called it, uh they dug a hole and lined it with wood and slept in it. And they accumulated some stores of food and they were ready to do some damage to the Germans. The uh this territory where we lived had some unexploded artillery shells from the 1st World War yet, and the young kids, twelve, fourteen years old...some of them survived</p><p> ..used to take out the explosives from there, put in a detonator and make a mine to put under the railroad lines where the Germans shipped, you know, war supplies and and troops to the front, but it was way back already behind the German lines, so they used to uh...they got in touch with Soviet, you know, Soviet army. They dropped by parachute more arms and they were uh really an effective fighting force. Uh my old...my younger brother...I was the oldest...one day they they had their own uh spy network among the peasants. They found out they're going to be attacked by the Germans. Uh sure enough within a short time they were attacked, but before before...but they really were attacked they decided to move the camp deeper into the forest. They had to forge a river and uh but they had some stores of food and didn't want to abandon it, so they left some guards to guard it and among them was my brother. Uh so when they came with this force attacked...the force consisted of Germans, lots of troops...Russian, the Ukrainian police, my brother was standing guard and when he saw it was too late already</p><p> . To do anything he shot in the air and the others that were were supposed to replace him...there were about five sets of them boys...one of them was my cousin...my brother was away already at the new camp, the other brother... . Some were wounded but the majority survived the attack. They moved further and got stronger, stronger, stronger. German troop movements . That's a story <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 7</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I received a letter...this was in the middle...we were, I was still in the camp under guard. I received a letter from my brother. UhIamin___. This is a city in the Ukraine and uh I find that he is OK, and so not to worry about fact. Later I received a letter from my friend, the one that intercepted my letter, his brother...I received a letter describing in detail what happened. So they were not far away. (Pause - crying) Funny thing...at that time I did not cry. Nothing. They uh...anyway uh this was... 1 was in touch with my brother for a while. Later on I got a letter from...he left. He is somewhere. Couldn't tell me where. Left for Poland and later on for Italy and he says uh...(pause)...I didn't meet him until 1946 in Italy, so I didn't get any more from him. | didn't hear any more. He sent me some money. You know, he was in in Rome...he joined...he was guarding an MKBD village, a farm. They put him...as a former partisan he was still armed and they put him to guard this, and while guarding this this farm there was some group in these former partisans who started dealing in the black market. They were going to arrest him, so he escaped. He didn't do it, but some of his uh friends did it, so he escaped and he went to</p><p> where again they put him in the army and a friend of his and then they sent him, they sent him to Poland escorting a group of Polish deserters from the Polish army, so he took a group to Warsaw, turned them over, came back, and then they sent him the next, second time. Second time we knew already the Brichah (ph) is working in Poland and he and his...there were two of them, two boys. One of them still lives in New York...they left...turned over...they did not leave these prisoners...(laughter)...you know, they turned them over to the proper authorities and then disappeared. From there they went to Romania and from Romania they went somehow to Italy. So he was in Italy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q:</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was in in still in the mine. In 1946 I got my permission to leave. I'll never forget that day. I was walking...you know uh everyone of us has a little bit of uh superstition, like cat crosses your way, a peasant with empty pails going to the for water...that's a very bad sign, but full pails is a very good sign. That's an old Ukrainian proverb, and living among them you acquire these uh traits, and when I was walking...1, they called me about five times during that year trying to dissuade me not to go. My uh...what was my argument I I lost my family. I don't know...uh maybe somebody survived. Maybe somebody is in Poland. I wanted...I want to try to find them. Nothing against the Soviet uh Union because Poland now is also a republic, you know, you are the same people, so finally I came in and I was walking through the mines of the district uh town...was about eight kilometers, and I come into the town. It was uh April already or March...things were melting . Lcame in and there is a woman with two empty pails crossing my (laughter) path. that's it. I'll never get home. I come into there, come into the office and there's a city dressed woman sitting there with a stack of papers with pictures on it that I could read it, you know, in Russian and in Polish, and the uh captain or major says well Slivka, what do you think? Still don't want to change your mind? Still want to go to Poland? I don't know what to answer. I say if possible I would like to go. <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 8 OK.

So I went back to my</p><p> and I had to do all the formalities, get myself off the roster of the army,</p><p> (laughter). I wasn't in the army for years. Uh I went to this uh director and asked him for at least a little clothes. He gave me a little jacket to put on and I uh went uh I have a pair of uh canvas boots. They have an army pants dyed blue and I had this uh shirt and I have a pair of underwear with long and I had this hat and with that I went to Moscow.</p><p>I come to Moscow and there was a union of Polish patriots. So now since I'm going to Poland, I'm a Polish patriot. All of a sudden I'm I'm a Pole. (laughter) I was...I was telling the story when I come to Israel because they call us Anglo-Saxons. (Laughter) When I lived in Poland I was a dirty Jew. In Russia I was a dirty Polish Jew. And then I come to America (laughter) I am Russian. When I go to Israel I am Anglo-Saxon. (Laughter) Anyway now I am a Pole, see, and I go into the a union of Polish patriots.</p><p>Was organized by a Polish writer by the name of . [knew her from...very liberal Polish writer.

And they gave me a pair of ski pants. (Laughter) Ski pants. That's what they had. Ski pants. So everything was worth anything there in Poland or in Russia you couldn't get any.</p><p>So I thanked them and then I went to the Polish uh consulate and they ordered a railway ticket, railroad ticket for me in a sleeper, no less, to Warsaw, to Poland.

And I knew Lodz, Lodz the city, and I had many friends there before the war but who knows where or what. Lodz was more beautiful than ...Lodz was likea__ city. Uh it was no industrial city and there was big buildings, not too clean, but they cleaned it up before the war. Poland had a...while while they were threatened by war they had to call an action urbaniza...urbanization (ph)...to make the cities and towns look great. They had to paint them. They had to clean them, so even the the the the streetcars in in Lodz had that drab green color on it before the war, were painted two colors and they looked pretty except the. _ the ghetto because it was all destroyed . After the Jewish left, the Poles uh tore out all the good...the the doors and the windows for kindling wood and uh ninety percent of those were destroyed except so it was a very the <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 0 I...we had...I remember used to get a little meat and cook a soup for everybody, and some of the people that cooked, the cooks, . Everybody was hungry. I I just couldn't... uh ate what everybody else ate. I could take some bread _ there was some milk for children, pregnant women. Pregnant women were transported through the uh Jewish Brigade of the British Army, dressed in British uniforms. (Laughter) They they did a marvelous job. Brichah was . A friend of mine worked in it.

And uh you found yourself there and while there I got...the Joint Distribution Committee gave...delivered to me a telegram from my brother that had been waiting there for months. He was in Italy. He knew I would (laughter) have to wind up somewhere there, so he he addressed it to me and through the my name on the list, I got this telegram, with his address. Uh we...the the group...all of a sudden, all all the crossing points were closed from from Austria to Italy. They they...the police and the French authorities...I used to have a warm feeling for French...not since then. So they decided they'll try...they most obvious of the . Maybe __ Hungarian guards. So they sent a group to try it, between twenty and thirty people...I was in this group...and sure enough we took them on a train uh on a truck uh with an Israeli British soldier. He had some money to transfer there...which he threw away when we we were caught. We were caught by the Austrian border guards under the British, you know, command and they arrested us and put us in jail there and beat us up...not too much...a little bit. Not so much the Austrians. And the next morning they took us to Innsbruck. Beautiful city. And they...by rail, the railroad station, and they told us to go into a train. They'll send us to a camp, uh DP camp. We didn't know where. We didn't want to go. We wanted to go to our camp. So they trained a machine gun on us and says, if you don't go, I'll kill you. We didn't know whether he was bluffing or not, but . While standing there the the Austrians around us beat us up. ___--stthe ___ would come from the side and hit us from the side. you know, people that were waiting for trains _ after the war.</p><p>Anyway we stood for about an hour.
