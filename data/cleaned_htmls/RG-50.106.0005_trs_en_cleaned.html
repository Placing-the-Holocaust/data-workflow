<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, it was all the European battles.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We just followed General Patton from the start of after he took over, and went through Europe.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Until we got to Germany.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay. And then you arrived in Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was your first what's your first recollection, your first memory?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ubhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I mean, here you were a Jewish soldier coming to Germany. Do you remember what your feelings were at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, everything we didn't know too much about what was happening. And that was one of the things that was so shocking when we arrived in Buchenwald. But we weren't told in those days really what was happening.</p><p>Now, we had heard rumors of what was happening; that they were killing Jews and so forth. Even before I went into the Army, we had gotten rumors of that, things like that happening, but nobody was really sure, you know. There was no everything was kept quiet. So when we got into Germany, of course, it was a matter of just getting through and fighting and going through these battles. There was no time to think of things like that until we until we got to the camp of Buchenwald.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was first impression? What's the first thing you saw</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In Buchenwald?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: when you got there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, I guess we were one of the first units into Buchenwald. And I remember standing just inside the entrance, and having the feeling of not only horror, but utter desolation. What I saw was on my left, was a mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet high, and stretching out maybe 30 or 40 yards. The bodies had been soaked kerosene, ready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too soon for them to do it. On my right, there were several people that were lying there, and some of them were crawling. Some weighed 80 pounds. Some looked half dead to me. One of them was crawling towards</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p><p> me, and I said something in Yiddish. I can't remember for sure, but "Vus Kenneth Tuin Zick Sehelthen, (ph)" and one of them came up and tried to kiss my feet. The feeling of helplessness and not believing was very prevalent. The gentile soldiers who were with me were almost in tears and shaking their heads. And I remember one of the survivors coming up and telling me that the Polish SS had run out the back of the camp, and they were getting away. And then later, one of the our soldiers, who had gone back there, said that two of them had been caught by some of the inmates and killed. The scene that I described to you has never left my memory. And when I hear some of these groups that are now prevalent in the United States, around the world, that say that this never happened, this really prevailed on me to tell what I saw, because I will never forget it.</p><p>We left this area soon after. I guess we had another assignment. And it was a long time ago, 50 years or so. I don't remember what that assignment was between you and me.</p><p>But that scene that I saw at the entrance will never be forgotten, and I felt that I had to describe it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know what day you arrived there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wouldn't know the date, but I know that Patton was 20 or 30 miles ahead of us. He had come through, and then gone on. He was always ahead of the other units.</p><p>And so that was really probably the exact date that Buchenwald was liberated. Because the fact that the SS troops that were still there, and they had tried to, you know, get rid of that evidence, so it was not more than one or two days difference.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you said you had no preparation for what you would be seeing here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No preparation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were a young man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No preparation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were in your early 20s</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: with no preparation?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No preparation of this at all.</p><p>And not it was a situation that we really didn't believe. Not only me, but everybody that walked in with me, you know, at that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you with other Jewish soldiers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. There were Jewish soldiers in our outfit, but I think I was the only one at that point that had walked into this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How big a group were you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, there must have been 10 or 12 of us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you walked into the camp?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We went into that camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Are there any other experiences that you had besides talking in Yiddish to the one survivor?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, because after we did survey this area, we were told we have to get out; that other people were coming in to do something to</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Would</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: work with the survivors, and</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How long were you actually inside Buchenwald?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Maybe not more than a half hour.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what was the purpose of you going? What did they tell you the purpose was for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They just wanted to...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Witness it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Witness, as witnesses, right, to see what was going on. And then we our whole outfit moved out after that, and then that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you had described one young man's reaction. Any other reactions that you remember from the other soldiers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Just disbelief. I think nobody ever would have thought of seeing things like that.</p><p>Now, I remember our outfit had gone through five battles, so we had seen many things.</p><p>But this was the horror of it and the immensity of it, you know, was hard to understand.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How much of the camp did you see? Did you walk around?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not maybe we went in 40 or 50 yards, and then returned, went back.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And do you feel that because you were Jewish, that your reaction was different than your fellow soldiers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't think so. I think that they were also in shock; that they didn't believe this could happen. Man's inhumanity to man.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see any of the living quarters, the barracks?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: We saw barracks. We didn't go into them, but they were</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Can you describe what you saw; what you remember?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were like wooden barracks, but they were run down if I remember correctly, and it was small areas where they were living. I did see that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Tiny, tiny areas where they had lived, little probably not even beds, you know, but probably on the floor.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you just walked around on your own?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. We walked in on our own, and then we were told let's go, we're moving out, and that was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you talk about what you saw with the other men that you were with, the ten other men?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We went into another assignment, and we had we were spread out, so I didn't get to talk to too many people. Later, we talked about it, you know, and really, what I'm telling you, we talked among ourselves, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you discuss any of this with any of the officers in the camp, in the Army?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One of the officers, if I remember, was with us when we went in, but we didn't discuss that afterwards, because things were still popping, as you know, because that wasn't the end of the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And you said you spoke Yiddish to one of the</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: survivors?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you speak to any of the other survivors, or just that one?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. It seemed to me if I remember correctly, that was the one. The others were couldn't speak. They were mostly I was thinking afterwards, I wonder if they really survived, because they looked in such bad shape that probably many of them didn't.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you then left, and can you just briefly tell us what happened after?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we would we had to go on. And after that, it's hard to remember what happened. I remember carrying one message to a Russian general in Lavesig that, and forgetting to shake his hand, and he was left hanging there as I left the room.</p><p>And finally, after a few months, the war was did finish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And then you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But I did write about this.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, let's</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So then you how much longer were you in the service?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Probably not more than a few more months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Before I left.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then you came back?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Came back to</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Michigan?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To Michigan.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did you do then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Then I went to I decided that I would go and really take music more seriously, and I went to college, and became a music teacher and a music performer. Met my wife, Betty, who is also a musician, and that's what we've been doing since.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhbhuh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To this day.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about how this experience that you went through in Buchenwald as a young man, a young soldier affected you. Does it still affect you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hmm. I would imagine it does, "cause the immensity of what I saw, and the fact that I was there, of course. And I had been telling not only my family, but other people, whoever I saw, or whoever was interested of these things that I had that it was hard to talk about. But when I first came back, people wanted to know. I remember writing to my family even from Europe of what I saw.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Describing</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Describing what I saw. And I did that.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you still have those letters?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. What happened was my mother used to read those letters, and finally and cry whenever she read them. So finally, I decided that get rid of them. And now I realize that was a mistake. I shouldn't have. But I did. I got rid of them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you take any photographs of what you saw when you</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. We had some photographs.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That you yourself</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But those photographs were included in some of the letters, and so I got rid of those, too.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uhhuh. But you yourself had a camera?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. We had I had a camera, but I didn't take all those. There were other soldiers that did take photographs, and they gave me some of the prints that they got. That's where I got them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You had said you had written or was that the letter you're talking about, the letters that you wrote home?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You didn't write anything formal?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, no, I didn't write anything formal.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Formally?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did that experience that you went through affect your feelings about being Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did it change the way you feel?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I don't think it changed. Our family has you know, is a family that had many Jewish clergy in it. My mother's family, on her side, there were Rabbis that went back as far as four generations. I think we came from Spain, and then to Poland, and so I</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> </p><p> remember stories about, you know, great, great, great grandfather being Rabbis and so on.</p><p>So I've always felt Jewish. I don't think it had any affect on it. But it sure opened my eyes about what had been going on, and why, and why this happened was a big question; why it was allowed to happen. Because I think now as we read books and go back into history that many people knew what was going on, and nothing not enough was done to save these people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did the Army have any mechanism for the soldiers to talk out their experiences of what they saw</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: at places like Buchenwald?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not not that I know of. Perhaps, you know, other units that moved in to try to work with these people may have had that, but we were not given that, you know, responsibility; or nobody ever talked to us about it after that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were most of the other men that you came to the camp with young like you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, just about my age, maybe a little bit older.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you said that you did talk about it with them a little bit after?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you remember any of the exchanges that you've had; any of their comments?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Same thing that I that I talked told you. First of all, there was disbelief. And nobody ever said that they would have imagined the immensity of this terrible horror that we saw.</p><p>And to think that these people and in every contact that we had with German people, they always said that it wasn't us that did these horrible things. We were not Nazis. But it turns</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you say contact, when was this contact?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, if we talked to a German person.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Over you're talking about when you were</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, as we went from, you know</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Towns?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Citytocity, towntotown, and we naturally would say did you know about what was happening. Your town was right next to this; the ovens there. They all said, oh, no, we</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="9"></span>  didn't know. We were not Nazis. But it turned out [many|am] times, they were. We found evidence of Nazi materials in their attics and so on. Everybody denied it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What kind of what did you do after you left Buchenwald? You said you went to different towns and cities. What was your role?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Since I was a Jewish soldier, I knew a little Yiddish, I sort of became the billeting person. In other words, I would go around talking to people to allow soldiers to stay in different places. And that's what I mean when I had contact with the regular persons in these towns.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what was their reception to you knowing</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, fine.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: that you were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it didn't matter. They were just glad to see Americans, you know. Oh, we're glad to see you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And they knew you were Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Sure, because I talked Jewish. I'm sure German people</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right, right.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The German people could tell the difference between German and</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You were speaking Yiddish and</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was speaking Yiddish, and they were answering in German, right. And usually I would go to the Biirgermeister, because he was the one that went, tell us, tell us where we could find a billeting, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, is there anything else that you wanted to add; that you wanted to say</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: about your experiences?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: it was heartrending, as you can hear, and I just I hope that I what I've said, you know, can verify what, you know, what has what happened over there. And as an eyewitness, I thought that I should have some evidence, you know, to that effect, and tell that this did happen, and it wasn't a hoax. And it was horrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, thank you very much for telling us your story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I'm happy I'm able to do that. It wasn't easy, but I felt we felt it was important.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: As you said, this is something that has stayed with you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right. Especially the scene in the entrance of the camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were there any special signs that you saw?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: There was a sign above the camp, but you know, I can't remember what it said now.</p><p>Some of the movies I've seen, there had been different slogans, Arbeit? You know about that. Means what was it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Arbeitsdorf?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, right. But I don't really remember if it said that in Buchenwald. It might have.</p><p>It might have.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And that was the only camp that you went to?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was the only camp we went to. We were near I had heard that we were passing by different ones, or there were, you know, as we went through, because we had just followed the line of the tanks, but we didn't we didn't go to another camp. That was it.</p><p>So I don't know what happened in Dachau, for example, or others. Just what I saw in Buchenwald. One thing I do remember is that upon entrance into Buchenwald, not only was it the visual horror, but we had that terrible odor of dead bodies and kerosene, and it was it was an odor that made us all nauseous. A terrible feeling of nauseousness and utter desolation. And this happened, again, at the entrance of this camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the other soldiers felt the way you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. The other soldiers felt the way I did. And as a matter of fact, now that I think back, I remember one of the other soldiers not being able to stay there. He had to leave immediately. But I did not do that, because I wanted to see as much as I could.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Because I'm Jewish, and I didn't want to, you know, forget what I was seeing. I thought maybe some day in the future, I'll be able to describe this, or I would have to describe it, which I am now doing. Another experience that I had later in our area, area of Southfield, Michigan at the time, is we met a survivor of that camp. He happened to be a jeweler who came to our house to show a small, little charm bracelet that we were trying thinking of getting for our twoyear old daughter at the time. Now, this was over 30 years ago.</p><p>But when he had heard that I went into the camp and was a liberator, he said you know, I was a survivor of Buchenwald, too. And the only way I survived was I finally cut off some toes in order to get to a hospital. And he was very emotional. We hugged, and he cried. And he said you, you saved us. And this happened, the meeting happened 30, over</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span>  30 years ago. And we see each other once in a while, and memories come back, of course.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And this was</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: On both sides.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was an emotional experience for you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as you can tell, it was very emotional, because he started to talk a little bit about his experiences in the camp, although not much. So I met in other words, I did meet a one of those people who was there when I walked into that camp.</p></p></dialogue>
