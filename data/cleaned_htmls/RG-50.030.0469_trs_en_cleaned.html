So and there was a girl and they played around with her joking, and said -- oh, somebody said, oh my Dieter. Dieter, yeah. And I ask her, "Are you Dieter Rishter?" She said, ""Yes, I am Dieter Rishter." So -- because he told me her name is Dieter Rishter. So I said, my uncle is whoever. She said, oh, I remember him very well.</p><p>And then I stayed with them, and she said, come with me, come with me, we will be together.</p><p>Because we could move our bunks, yes, and in this barrack where we were, there were beds, everybody had one bed, not this bunk.

Between that time we went back to the other barrack, we had -- we slept on these bunks and so -- and so it was a big selection, very big, first they took one, then five left, and so on and so on and so. So I asked myself someday, how come that they never selected me, that they never pointed on me. So I came to the conclusion, maybe it's true, because I never looked at them. [indecipherable] like this. I was straight, and I never looked up there. I says, and maybe they pointed and I didn't see.

They didn't take her to the gas chamber, she passed by. I was so happy, thanks God. Dieter went through sick. And then we had to line up again and then they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped, sO, so, so -- so I lost her, no. She went somewhere else. And the next day in the morning, I don't remember if we didn't go to work or so, or maybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the other one to call her name. Dieter Rishter, Dieter Rishter. No answer. So I went to the next barrack, and to next barrack. And somebody said, "Dieter Rishter died." She survived the selection, but she died, sick and exhausted. So what happened?
