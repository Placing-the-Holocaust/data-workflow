He started with a store, they opened a little store, it didn't work. Then he met a man, a baker, so his father gave him some money and they built a little bakery, because that was a family house, my grand- grandfather's house where they lived. And so they struggled the whole [indecipherable] the whole life, they worked very, very hard. My parents were very honest and very, very hardworking people. My father got up in the morning very early like in a bakery. Later on my mother, and they worked. Then when it went a little bit better, they did took somebody to work there. Since -- I come from a poor -- quite poor family. Since my parent didn't have money to send my brother to school, so they let him to learn some trade. So he was a glasser. And --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

Unfortunately, too nice. And the money which he made, the bi -- bigger part he gave to his -- to my mother. And then he usually worked extra. Besides the store he framed pictures during the weekends, he should earn for himself. And that was a little bit easier, because my brother made money, the bakery was a little -- the best business was when the Germans came. The Germans invaded Slovakia. That was the best business in the bakery, because --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well let -- let's -- let's go back just a little bit.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was a very quiet girl, very, very quiet. They liked me, and I appreciated them very much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Many times in the evenings, when they slept already, I was looking at them, and I thought, oh my God. Somehow I had a feeling, something wrong. But not like that. Only that they worked so hard, that my God, where will all this lead, that they work so hard? I'm so very sorry for them.</p><p>And they're very nice, very nice. Very, very nice.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you were a very sensitive child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. And my brother, I said that unfortunately he was too nice. He makes me the most sad, because my -- when they took the parents, my parents, he was at work, and he was hidden in the basement, there where worked. And when he heard that they took my parents, he ran away from his hidden pla -- place, came home to help my parents, to go with them, and therefore he went with them. And there -- I met once in a train, one of his friends who was in the same lager that he -- he says they worked in a forest with my brother, many people went in, and the young men, in Deblin -- in Deblin, it's somewhere near to Lublin. I didn't say -- I didn't see mention these lager, this concentration lager, but it must have been a small lager. They worked in the forest and they [indecipherable] they did take the older people, older. My father was 53, my mother was 51.</p><p>But that was older then. Th-They take them from the lager, they take them away. My brother wanted again to help them, so he ran away from the forest to help them. And so they took them -- took him also with my parents. That's where they died, all three of them. My mother, she worked in a bakery, and she worked at home. She had many friends in the bakery, many, many friends, people liked her. She liked to talk. A real woman. And so I was a quiet child, working very, very hard, I studied hard because I promised myself that I don't want to be poor. I have to make it.</p><p>And therefore I studied for a decent future. And like a girl, a young girl, I hoped that I will be happy sometimes. That's approximate the same. Maybe [indecipherable] will -- lived in a big house from my great-grandfather, yes? Apartment was small, but there were tenants there. It was</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> </p><p> an aun -- no, it was a -- an grand-aunt. Was my mother's brother there, my mother's sister there living. My mother's two cousins, and then some tenants, all [indecipherable]. They were I think 12 relatives in the same house all [indecipherable]. Only one cousin returned from some or other, not from Auschwitz, I don't remember. I never asked him where he was. He died in Montreal, we think.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not cruelty. But some of misery. People were poor, people didn't understand each other.</p><p>People didn't try to help, they didn't care about each other. It's a like -- like here.

He said, "Stay here, I want to talk to you." Soldier, this Slovak. And then he mentioned some names, Jewish names, boys from PreSov. I didn't know all of them, but I knew the names. And he said then -- suddenly he said, "Do you know where you go?" I said, "No. Is it Bata? Is it Svit?" He said, "No. You are going to Poland, and your families</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> </p><p> will go after you, and you will never return from there." So I was shocked. He didn't say anything. I turned away and I left. I didn't say to the girls nothing because I didn't want to create some panic, and I don't -- didn't want for him make some problems, so I didn't say anything.</p><p>Only in the lager, when I was in Auschwitz, so I thought about him many times, I thought, well maybe this soldier wanted to help me, because we were somehow only alone there when they [indecipherable] only him and me. And so went by time, I returned. I was working in a store. I was married that time. I became a manager in the store. I was sitting in the [indecipherable] and this Slovak soldier arrived into the store, a uniform, an officer. I looked at him, I said, oh that's him. And I ask him, "Tell me, where have you been in March 1942?" He said, "In Poprad." I said, "I remember you, and I was thinking about you many times. And I thought that you were willing to help me. Do you remember me?" He said, "Yes, I remember you." He said, "Yes, I wanted to help you." Maybe he wanted, maybe he said it after the war, I don't know, but that's what he said. He left, and I never met him again, he never entered the store. Was interesting.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Later on I made friends there. I had a very, very close friend who became like a sister to me. I still didn't forget her. I never had a sister and she was like my sister.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was her name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Dieter Rishter, from Bratislava. Was a story -- I have so many stories.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's great.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: When I was home, at home, my uncle the teacher, he was not much older than me because he was from the second husband of my grandmother, yeah. He wasn't much older. Even I liked him like [indecipherable] boy, and so -- so I went once in his room, and I saw there a letter lying on the table, I was looking at it. And there was a little picture, little picture of a girl, and it was signed like, eira Dieter, eira Dieter, yeah. I didn't ask anybody. I always had the nature not to ask, I don't ask people anything. When they s -- you say something to me, you say [indecipherable]. So I was -- and I remembered this name Dieter, yes, and I knew that was from Bratislava, because he went, this cousin, to visit. That's it. And went to [indecipherable] in the lager, and there -- you see, when people cannot fight enemies, yeah, Americans with the Canadians, with Mexicans and so they turn against groups, yeah. So was in lager also. The first day, the girls started. Oh you western girls, be ashamed, all you eastern girls, yes. I was from west Slovakia, or east Slovakia -- my direction is always [indecipherable] -- east Slovakia, Bratislava was from west Slovakia. So -- and once, in 1942, we were in Birkenau right aw -- right away, yes, was maybe in -- in -- no, I don't ri -- in winter after we came there. We were standing the whole Sunday outside, was cold, very cold. We are standing there. And that time I think we didn't have more these uniforms, we were somehow in civil dresses, and we had the line. [indecipherable]. There was a group of girls and they played around and talked and so, and</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="48"></span> </p><p> they were from the other part of Slovakia, and they asked me where I am from. I said from this part of slo -- said, oh, you are the same like we are. You are -- you don't belong there [indecipherable]. I was very honored, yes. Bigger group. So and there was a girl and they played around with her joking, and said -- oh, somebody said, oh my Dieter. Dieter, yeah. And I ask her, "Are you Dieter Rishter?" She said, ""Yes, I am Dieter Rishter." So -- because he told me her name is Dieter Rishter. So I said, my uncle is whoever. She said, oh, I remember him very well.</p><p>And then I stayed with them, and she said, come with me, come with me, we will be together.</p><p>Because we could move our bunks, yes, and in this barrack where we were, there were beds, everybody had one bed, not this bunk. [indecipherable]. But two -- two girls slept together because these beds were -- come, come with me, we will be together. She has a -- she had the older sister there. So then I stayed with her, and we became very, very good friends. We worked together, we were in the same commando and we were together. But she became sick. And when we had our biggest, biggest selection, 1943, so she had swollen legs. We were sitting in the sauna the whole night on benches and so, so she had up her legs and I was massaging her legs, she was very, very sick. I took care of her. And then in the -- the whole night we were sitting there in the sauna, and during the morning we had to line up, and it was a selection, and that was the biggest, biggest selection, because always when the lager was full, it wasn't place where to sleep, then they made the selection. Between that time we went back to the other barrack, we had -- we slept on these bunks and so -- and so it was a big selection, very big, first they took one, then five left, and so on and so on and so. So I asked myself someday, how come that they never selected me, that they never pointed on me. So I came to the conclusion, maybe it's true, because I never looked at them. [indecipherable] like this. I was straight, and I never looked up there. I says, and maybe they pointed and I didn't see. But I think [indecipherable] maybe  <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> </p><p> [indecipherable]. Anyhow, so I put Dieter in front of me, Dieter do -- she spoke German, you go in front of me, and I will follow you on the selection, because I was so sure that I will make it, that time. So she pointed like that, and she went, and I was praying, oh my God, help me, Dieter should pass by. [indecipherable]. So -- and she went, she passed. They didn't take her to the gas chamber, she passed by. I was so happy, thanks God. Dieter went through sick. And then we had to line up again and then they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped, sO, so, so -- so I lost her, no. She went somewhere else. And the next day in the morning, I don't remember if we didn't go to work or so, or maybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the other one to call her name. Dieter Rishter, Dieter Rishter. No answer. So I went to the next barrack, and to next barrack. And somebody said, "Dieter Rishter died." She survived the selection, but she died, sick and exhausted. So what happened? She went down from the [indecipherable] from the bank [indecipherable] she had to go down. She went down, she fell down. And she wasn't [indecipherable] they took her to the -- through to -- to the other [indecipherable] and I lost Dieter. I cannot still forget her, such a nice girl. So -- and before -- excuse me -- before her, her sister died, before her, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you were together for a -- a year --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A few months --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: A few months.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- or maybe longer, I don't know, maybe longer. We made even business together, because she was [indecipherable] work -- working on a place with clothing, you know, from the gas chamber when the people arrived. They had to drop there the things, they didn't arrive to the lager to leave them. And then they carried the things to our company and we had to -- to -- to fold them, to bundle them, and they send it, probably to Germany. And people had some  <span class="page-break" number="50"></span> </p><p> jewelries, diamonds, and -- in their clothing, yeah. So it was there a pile of this clothing and they have to sortir it, and she was on the pile and I was folding, yeah. So she said once, when I will call summerkleider, summer dresses, so you come, that means that I found something, some jewelry, something. So once she found ducats -- ducats, golden ducats, golden [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Mm-hm.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So I took it a few ounce, I think eight or so.

I used to see him to come in -- into work place, so -- and I noticed that he takes something from girls and then he brings something. So I stopped him, I said I have ducats, I have golden ducats, I gave him.

So I don't know which month it could have been, yes. Maybe between -- between the naishtuber, laundry, maybe between the laundry, because from laundry I went to the naishtuber between -- before. So we had to wear impossible thing, our shoes on our shoulders. You tied the shoes to put on the shoulder, and barefoot in to walk to a forest where there were little stones like gravel, yeah? And we have to walk, so -- and [indecipherable] little gravels, they were cold, and they were wet. And first of all my -- my soles, they became hard and -- and painful, yes, you mention, like that. Later on the soles, they became hard, trained well, no problem. But my eyes, probably from an infa -- an inflammation from these cold stones. So on my eyelashes, they were some kind of glue. You know, when I woke up in the morning, I couldn't open my eyes, cause they were so dry on the eyelashes, got dry glue. So I had to take off little by little, little by little. And then next night again happened, yes, so I was -- I was f -- quite for a few -- for a time with this -- my eyes, and --</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="62"></span> </p><p> and one morning, I w -- yeah, so we -- we had to walk barefooten, we worked with the shoes, and then we had to take off the shoes, and to come back again barefooten, again this -- to this -- through this -- was so bad, thank God, I still feel chilly when I think about it. So one day I was standing on zaeh -- zaehlappell, and I used to stand in the -- I don't know why, in the front, first one. And suddenly was quie -- very quiet, very quiet, and I heard this name Himmler. I knew who was him, who was Himmler. I looked around, not frar -- far from me was standing Himmler, with his fancy gla -- eyeglasses. Oh my God, I was so scared that Himmler will look at me, and he'll see my -- my -- my eyes, I thought this [indecipherable] I heard the Gypsies, they used to have [indecipherable] too. I was so scared he would send me for death. I didn't know that time gas chambers was in Auschwitz. So I moved slowly, slowly in the back, he shouldn't see me, I should save myself from Himmler. He was standing there looking.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You weren't given a spoon, you were given the bowl.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The bowl, but I don't remember we carried the -- with us when we went to work far, where we were serve. I don't think -- I cannot see the -- the move around, I know we have only this little sack, and a little bread, and if we had a little plate, this is to cut our bread and [indecipherable] I don't remember that, this I don't. I know only a little bread, and on the way to work, always a bite. It was easy, because we didn't have to think too much, we -- our thinking went so far as into the [indecipherable] I have still a slice of bread, I get still a little bit.</p></p></dialogue>

Maybe they got there, th-that they put it there, and they washed it there, but it wasn't dirty because if you didn't wash it -- in Birkenau, we didn't have water. So couldn't be so dirty that [indecipherable] after food. So probably they carried from -- probably. I don't know -- know, I speculate on it. Probably they got from the sauna, water, the sauna in a bucket or so, and they washed it there and they left it and then we took it from there. A little room at the end of the barrack -- of the block. I -- I don't remember how it was.</p></p></dialogue>

So I took a risk and I stayed in the barrack, in the block, I didn't go to work. And I knew that I take a risk because when -- sometimes, once in awhile the SS, somebody from the SS came through, they went through the barrack, the blocks. And when they found somebody who didn't go to work, they took to block 25. And I took this risk. I said, I cannot. I have to take risk that they will come today and they will take me to block 25.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this was where you were sorting clothes?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, because there was [indecipherable], in -- in Birkenau was a commando sc -- which they wore red scarves, so they were red scarves and that was the Canada called. So they were the red scarves and we were the white scarves.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what was the difference between the work that you were doing sorting clothes and the work that Canada commando was doing sorting clothes, do you know?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I couldn't say exactly. I think that we had from the gas chamber, things in the gas chamber, and people arrived straight there. And those I don't know. We had that. Maybe they had also from the gas chamber, but it was so much that they divided there, [indecipherable] that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And -- and your commando wasn't connected with Canada commando?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="80"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you like working in that commando?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Canada, no.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was so relaxing there, relaxing. We relaxing in [indecipherable]. The commander, the SS, Scharfuehrer, was very nice, a nice man. He was very helpful when it was longer -- for longer at zaehlappell, yes, roll call, and during that time was sometimes a selection after this roll call, so -- or when the commanders arrived, then he kept us longer there to work. We didn't work, but he kept us longer and he phoned into the lager that we are very busy, that we have to stay longer, and so probably he saved many people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And we had to cross only from one -- from one ba -- not barrack, from one part to the other part through a big door, so we -- we avoided the main door also, by coming home and selection we avoided. And then when it was -- it was typhus epidemic there, so he let many girls to sit on, and not to work. And he asked for tea, for enough tea to drink. So he carried in a lot of tea we should have enough, fever -- feverish and who couldn't work, didn't have to work. He was a ma</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="81"></span> </p><p> -- ma -- nice man. That was very important. And the other one, maybe he was also nice, but I didn't like him, he was so noisy. During the first lunch when I was there -- during lunch, as we ate, he said lie down all of you. We had to put the food down an-and to lie down in the mud. And then when -- after work, the girls -- not always, I wasn't there for a -- for a few days, but sometimes we had to undress and so he looked through ours if we didn't take something. He was so s -- crazy. Didn't like it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember the name of this nice man [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, I think it Ambrose.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Ambrose.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think that Ambrose was his name, I think so. Or something similar, because we called him Scharfuehrer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Were you surprised that there would be somebody who was so nice in that position?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>It's an odd position to be in and then --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I wasn't surprised, I was pleased.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Mm. So how did it happen that you moved from this commando? It was closed?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was closed. He -- it was closed, but in the meantime he wasn't more there, the other one, somebody else came. I don't know what -- sometimes they placed to other places. Maybe he was too nice, I don't know, but -- what the reason.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And the other one, he wasn't for long there, but he suggested me there for, because one day he came and he asked, who knows the difference between pure silk and artificial material. I say, I know it, cause I learned at school. So then I was, from the bundles I had to find a pure silk lingerie to take out and to bundle it differently. So he knew that I am not stupid.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="82"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

We were standing at the entrance, and in front of us, like you -- no, further, let's say, opened the wagons, cattle wagons and stepped out people from there, and they were hurrying like [indecipherable], and they holding tight to their belongings. They were holding tight to their families, and they were hungry and they were thirsty and it was hot. Nearly, when they -- when the Hungarian came, this was the 16" of May, hot. They didn't have enough air, they're smelling an-and shiny. Water was -- was running from the [indecipherable] that religious men were in these black caftans with beards and with hats. And two of them came to  <span class="page-break" number="102"></span> </p><p> us, we were two at the entrance and said in Yiddish, that you are Jewish children, give to us water. They left everybody and they came to us. What could we have done? I went to the Ausen, and she was -- her name was Grese, Ausen Grese, a beautiful lady -- girl, a little bit crazy, but she wasn't so mean. I went, I said -- and I had to report why they came to us, yes, was dangerous. So I said, these two men came and they ask for water. What can we do? We didn't have even water. She said, don't bother with them, because it could happen that they will take you also with them. So we were standing, looking at them, and didn't say even anything. It was very sad, very sad to see so many people. And they had to leave their belongings, they had to leave the families because the SS said line up, line up. They were their prisoners also in these uniforms. They had to help with the belongings, their suitcases. But they ran all over among them, among the newcomers and they said -- they suggested, mothers with children, give over the children to the grandmothers. Men, you say that you are younger. Boys, when you are told, you say that you are older. When they ask you about your profession, you say that you have a trade in -- not in German I don't know [indecipherable] they could understand each other. And the SS, they yelled los, los, and line up. So suddenly in five minutes they didn't have their belongings, they didn't have their families. Some mothers, they give over to their grandmothers, some kept them. They had to line up again, men to me -- with men, women with women. Women -- mothers hold the children, and then came the doctor, and selected with one finger. He didn't bother too much, he didn't think too much. And so they came with a little wand, they took the sick ones first, yes, and then they took them. They didn't know what happened to them. It was so sudden that they didn't know what happened to them. And they were carried away. And some of them then came to the lager, but not right away, not right away, they took them some [indecipherable] place and then they came into. And in a short time you saw the flames. So that</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="103"></span> </p><p> was very often a st -- we were so close, the crematory wasn't far from the entrance. So often was there a strong smell of burned flesh and burned bones, very often, more often than not, from the burning people. Was very sad. They came, they came, it was time and they came and came.</p><p>Never stopped. Was time and for weeks nobody came, maybe for a month, I don't know, don't remember.

Nobody was there, and from the -- as I said, from the office they -- somebody came, I don't remember who, and said, you will stand today between A and B lager, that is your post in the evening. I didn't know the reason why I will stand there, so I went. I would have gone also [indecipherable] cause I had to when they send me. They're sending -- standing, and as I said, nobody was in the lager, it was not permitted, because the guards stay there on the towers, and suddenly I heard a cry, and -- and -- and -- and running around, and so -- and that was the time when they took the people from Terezin lager, or the family lager it was called. Because it was like that that this famil -- those families from Theresienstadt, they were together, and that was called family lager. And later on only when I am here, so I read somewhere that it was written on the -- on the wagons, SB, Sonder Behandlung, and that meant -- that what they write in the book, that meant that six -- for six months, or -- I think six months, they had to stay there as a family, and then they sent them. And that time, that evening, or that night when I was late night there, they -- in the morning I heard -- in the morning somebody said that they put them on -- on the -- on tracks, on tracks they put them, on car -- on tracks, they took them to the city of Auschwitz, and they  <span class="page-break" number="106"></span> </p><p> carried them the whole night all over, to -- to -- to mix them up, that they don't know where they are going, and then they put them in the warehouse, or somewhere into a place, I don't know, I wasn't there, and then they gassed them there, in some warehouse, or somewhere, a place. That was -- I wasn't there --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Not in Auschwitz, that's the pl --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: In Auschwitz, but outside of the -- not in the gas chamber.

So she said her name and I said, we have here a relative, who work there and there and there. She said that's my so -- my brother-in- law. She was my cousin's wife. And she told me -- I didn't say anything to her but she told me about this girl that she lives in -- she has this cousin or something in California, and she mentioned her, described her, so she lived in -- in California, in America after the war.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So tell me the story about Vera Isen.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, you didn't. What happened, yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I came to the -- came to the barrack and they were sending a nice looking girl, young, maybe 20 or so. I said -- and I knew that she's not from the barrack, because I would know her. I said, "What are you -- are you looking for somebody?" She said "Yes, I am looking for Aliska Roth," or for -- yeah. So I said, "Why are you looking for Aliska Roth?" She said, "Because she's my cousin." I said, "Your cousin, what's your name?" Vera Isen. I said, "Oh, so what's the problem?" I didn't say anything to her, what's the problem [indecipherable] wasn't interest to talk too much. I said, ""What's the problem?" Said, "I am on 20 -- on block 25." So I said -- I didn't ask why, I didn't know why she's there. I said [indecipherable] afternoon, I cannot do anything, I will try tomorrow to do something. Come with me, I go with you to 25. Since I was -- before Laeuferin, I was Schreiberin, so I -- people knew me, so I had some position. So I went there, there was a Slovak lady, older than -- she was a mother of a girl [indecipherable]. I said [indecipherable] didn't ask who we are, what -- what [indecipherable], no, nothing nothing. I said, "Now this is my cousin and she's here in your block." It was impossible to take out from there. ""She's in this block, I want to help her, but today is no time because late. So I-I -- I will come tomorrow, so please hide her," and I looked up there where the dished, and some storage. I said, "If something would happen during the night, place her there, send her there, she should hide there. In the morning I will be here." She said okay. And I am wondering how she could do that, because she had her on the list, yeah. She says okay. So -- and I went in the morning there. I said, I came for my cousin. She says okay, so I took her. I took my cousin and I went with her to the sauna, because I knew that that time they were sending the haftlings to -- to Germany to work, you know, Philips and so on and so. They went there. And there was an SS,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="121"></span> </p><p> [indecipherable] and these SS people they knew me, because I was standing there. Her name was Ziatz, and I knew she's a simple woman, older woman, in her 40's, somehow, I never heard her voice, she must be a nice woman. So I went to her and I said [indecipherable], I said this is my cousin, look how beautiful she is, she is nicer looking than I am, I gave her some [indecipherable]. And she's in -- the problem with -- with her that she's in block 25. She has to go to the gas chamber. And she can go as a nice looking girl, then I can go also. I am not so nice looking than her. Please help me. Send her away with the -- with these people to Germany to work. And she looked, and she said, leave her here. And I left her there, and I believed her, this [indecipherable] I left her there. And that's it. And I had the feeling, that's a good feeling, the girl is safe. After the wer -- war, when I came to PreSov, I met a girl from Hungary, from there, and we were so [indecipherable] saw me, knew the name. She said, I was in [indecipherable] with the -- they had a -- a grape garden. So I met there Vera Isen, and she said you should come there to pick up grapes. So I said, well I don't know. But I knew that I will not go, I wasn't the mood to travel with grapes, forget about it. And then I said, are you go back, tell her that I thank, that I'm here and I thank, and -- but I will not be here, I will be in Humenne, I go to my uncle. So then I received from her a letter. I'm not sure if I wrote her or she wrote me, that I don't know.</p><p>[indecipherable] was a little place, Humenne was also a little place, was enough to know the name, okay, [indecipherable]. So I received a letter that she's with her brother there and they want to go to the States, to New York. But that time wasn't permitted from Hungary to write to New York, wasn't permitted somehow connection [indecipherable] I should write -- she wrote me the address to New York, I should wr-write in Hungarian [indecipherable]. So I wrote there, and that's it. I never heard about her, never, never, never. After years and years my cousin from Koshitza, from Slovakia wrote to me that she -- she received a letter from Israel -- from Israel</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="122"></span> </p><p> from my other cousin, that this cousin from Israel was in New York to visit a other cousin and that Vera wi -- Vera Isen was there and she's in this book about Auschwitz, and she said the story that the -- she was select -- she was selected to -- for -- for Germany to work, and I didn't know that time that she had a sister and she had a mother there. And the other blockalteste came there, and managed -- because she was the last one, that they took her out from the line, and she put her sister or her cousin or somebody, this blockalte -- somebody instead her, and they took her from there to block 25, ye -- and that I took her out, and -- and so -- and sh -- and this cousin from Israel said that she wanted my [indecipherable] wanted my address where I live now, to tell me that she's alive. So I wrote to her, but she didn't write for a long time. So I said, when she doesn't write, ask from Israel her address. [indecipherable] I -- I never said to her -- she doesn't know the story of my father, that my father had her -- I don't know what -- what kind of reli -- relative was his mother and so -- so as was -- so a few -- then she in -- then she invited me to Florida, I should come, I knew that I will not go. I said maybe. And then she called I shouldn't go for January because her children are there, sh -- I should come for February. And I said, I will go rather to -- to New York. Then I had my hip operation, I said [indecipherable] called me, I said I -- I cannot go because I have a hip operation. Then she called me again, I said I want to go to -- to Washington first, and I will come from Washington, maybe I will come to visit you. I never went and she never called or never --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you've never seen her since that day?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, I saw her only once. But then I wrote to the [indecipherable] my new cousin, my new cousin.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. Did you tell her when you brought her to -- to the sauna, did you say I am your cousin, or you never told her?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And so I met a few ones. Some of my roots. A few ones [indecipherable] few ones.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So how do you understand yourself doing all of this?</p></p></dialogue>

Who cares, nobody cares. If it is worthwhile to be a [indecipherable]. Then but sometimes maybe. Nobody said ever, thanks.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Nobody?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nobody. Nobody. So they were thankful it's -- my aunt and the other lady, but I don't know if it is worthwhile to risk your life, as I risked my life. I risked also [indecipherable] Polish -- I wrote it, Polish women. They wanted to take them to Visla to [indecipherable]. I mean, the SS came and he said where are -- I had to line up. It was a rec -- convalescent barrack where they didn't go to work, they stayed there. And he came, where are they. Polish women. I said, we  <span class="page-break" number="124"></span> </p><p> don't have here Polish women. He left, but I had statistics, I had -- I wrote every day stat -- and they would say, show me your statistics. I finished [indecipherable]. He turned and he left.</p></p></dialogue>

Yes. Give me a smile. It was always my reaction. Yeah, it was very risky. Once somebody saw me from the sauna, was also a -- some relative that I knew her before. And I went to the Schreiberin that time, I said, take her a -- take out her name, yeah. She said, find me a razor -- an eraser. So I went all over, I found the eraser, so she wrote through and erased, it should be so mixed up that she made the mistake. When I took her out, was evening. Then one Polish lady who was then my blockalteste when I was Schreiberin with her in the last barrack.

But again, I didn't place back. [indecipherable] I knew when I was Laeuferin, he was there in this -- that was his office.

And I came to this blockalteste, who saw me that evening that I took somebody from this road that was outside there, standing, here they were standing, and then -- but that's interesting, that this girl became a woman, and she committed in Israel suicide. Whom I took from the sauna, you know it?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="137"></span> </p></p></dialogue>

She told me, the blockalte -- probably not [indecipherable] that I have to take -- she didn't know me, I didn't know her, we saw each other only this evening, yeah. She said that Aliska has to be her Schreiberin, because when Aliska was good to -- to save the Polish women, you know, from the Visla that she sent to the latrine, go to the latrine, then she's got to be Schreiberin here. So I became the Schreiberin there, and it was the a-assistant blockalteste a Polish woman, a other one, they were sitting together, two Polish women. And I was with them, the Schreiber. It was -- I think it was late -- yeah, in October we came there, I think maybe in October, could have been winter or -- or so, it was cold, I know it -- we didn't have a calendar there. I didn't know the date, I didn't know the day. Sunday we knew because we didn't go to work. So, open the door and an SS man came into [indecipherable] room, because blockalteste, Schreiberin and assistant, we had a little room, yeah.

I don't leave from here, I will stay with you here. An SS. And this other -- the -- the assistant -- the assistant blockalteste, she was so strict to him, she started to spit on his head, and so -- and then he said -- but he was very, very drunk, and he said, I don't want to live. And there -- therefore, I don't want to go from here, I -- therefore, I want to stay here, because I am not worthwhile to live. I killed so many girls from Holland, Dutch girls. They were so beautiful, and I went up the gas chamber, and I threw inside Zyklon B, Zyklon B, and I threw and I killed them, and they were so beautiful, and therefore I don't want to live. Now we were scared. A drunk SS and talk like that, and she spitting on his head. That was tragic, yeah? So it -- what to do? So I didn't say anything, and I left. I left them, and I went at the end of the lager was a office for the SS men. They stayed always there, I saw them to go into there, yeah. Never had anything to do with them. I saw them there. So I went into that office, to the SS office, and I said, we have in our block an SS who is drunk, and he has a gun, and we are scared of his gun, and of his -- could you please come to pick him up? I didn't say what he said, only that. And one of -- I don't know, there were two or three there, I don't remember. Maybe I didn't notice, even. So he got up and he followed me again, came into our little room, took him, didn't say anything -- he was scared when he saw him. He took him, and -- he took him.</p></p></dialogue>

And maybe I understand better people. I look for a reasons when somebody is not as I want to. So I try to find the reason why is he not,</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="169"></span> </p><p> because I believe that everybody has some reason for his way, how he thinks, yes. And everybody is right, in his way, and that perception is different, but is a big value to you. Doesn't have to be to me, or to others.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It's interesting.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't try to understand people, because I didn't have to understand them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. Didn't have to evaluate them because I was a young girl, could I evaluate older people, for politics or something like that, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right, right. But you did realize a dream that you had when you were a child, and that was to become a teacher.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I wanted to become a teacher.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, and after the war I wanted double to be a teacher. Not [indecipherable] so much to teach, but how to behave and didn't succeed always, not all the students were good, but I tried, I tried.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what did you teach? What was the subject for which you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My main subject was home economics.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That is family living, that is what -- housing and design, that is nutrition and cooking and sewing and material. That's my -- yeah. But in Canada is like that, that you don't -- sorry -- that you don't stick only to one subject, you teach everything what you need to teach, okay? You teach it. So I taught many things. I studied mathematics, which I am not so good in mathematics, I couldn't say, but I didn't know [indecipherable] taught me, and even physics one time I had to teach, lot more. I taught many things, what they needed, yeah, so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But what you were really teaching was [indecipherable]  <span class="page-break" number="172"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well [indecipherable] that was family living, that means -- I studied human relations and family living see, for eight years at Magill to -- to make up my -- my -- my studies, yeah, for update my studies [indecipherable] what did I stu -- yeah, I had special education [indecipherable] and then I had there a teacher certificate and here I made the [indecipherable] three diplomas here.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: To understand people, that was my first thing. And I think I master this one, to understand people. I try evaluate people, and then to understand them. That is my main thing in life, toward people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what did you enjoy most about teaching?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Mostly check. I used to say, you don't like your -- your -- your day, think about the check. Or -- or think about the -- some people work also in a mental hospital. But I -- I used to say really was -- I was joking, that if one -- if only one student understood me, if I changed only one student, then it was worthwhile everything to study, to teach and so -- to change them, to change them, to -- to -- to give them self confidence -- first of all self confidence, that's very important.</p><p>And self reliance and -- and things like that to -- to help them to -- to make a living, to help them to make something about themselves. But then I saw that, that as soon changed, he didn't believe in himself. Sometimes I gave him a better mark, and I implanted into him that he is good. And sometimes it worked that he believed in himself. That is the most -- that was the most important part to me. And they should respect people and so, but mainly self respect. I used to say, and you don't respect yourself, nobody will respect you. That was [indecipherable] I believe that's the main thing.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="173"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Courage, self respect, self confidence.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was a good teacher.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="174"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: People liked me, yeah. Not everybody was -- had discipline in my class, no, because on the other side they counted on the that I am soft, maybe, right?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Right. Yeah, well --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh that's right, yes, I couldn't say for sure I was so respected and so, but they liked me, and they trusted me, yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Maybe about this lady, it's amazing, the German lady whom I met. She was lageralteste. This was lagerfuehrer, an SS, and a haftling was lageralteste. She came, I met her, and she said that she was a lagerfuehrerin. In a lager she was an SS, and that she opened the door and she let out the prisoners and so she became a haftling. I mentioned her in my thing. And she -- and so she became a prisoner. Then I didn't see -- see her too much. And we discussed with her -- I suppose I spoke to her, discussed about human relations, among human feelings, about beha -- humanly to behave. And she said, it's very easy outside to behave humanly, according to etiquette, and according to -- to -- to rules, human rules. But here it's very difficult, because first of all, we have to think about ourselves, yes. Was difficult. So that outside I am very -- she said, outside in the world, people move with masks on their faces. They smile, they speak nicely, it seems that they care about themselves. But here you have to talk, you have to think about yourself. So it is not so difficult that here you see the human being as it is -- as he is, as he is. There it is a mask.</p><p>It's a play. Outside, the world is a play, in lager --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's not like that.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="175"></span> </p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- is the real human being. Y-You show yourself -- you present yourself as you really are.</p><p>You don't try to cover up yourself. However, who -- how is -- whoever -- how he is, so he -- he presents himself. That's the real life, that's school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you think that's true?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So -- so, if that's true, then was, in some sense, living outside the lager difficult, even though it was horrible in Auschwitz, there was something about it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, nothing [indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: There you learn how to face people, how to understand people, you search in them how they are and you take them how they are. You understand them how they are. Not difficult.</p><p>[indecipherable]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But outside, it's harder.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Outside, well, there are people which they -- which they try to -- to -- to present themselves better than they are.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It's hard for them to change, they should be really as they think that they have to be, or they want to be seen. Understand that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
