Mr. Segalewitz, thank you very much for agreeing to speak with us.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it's my pleasure, you know, I want to convey as much information as possible, so you know, future generations would at least know about what happened to the -- the people like me.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, we're grateful for that. Can you -- can we start the story, like they've always does, at the beginning? Can you tell us a little bit about your history, where you were born, what -- in what family, in what town and so on. And when.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay, okay. I was born in Sarny, Poland in the year 1936. My mother's family was -- was known as the Bagg(ph) family, and they were quite a large family in -- in Sarny. And actually, they came from a town nearby, which was Dambrowicz(ph).</p><p>And my mother was one of 11 children, and so it was quite a large family. And when I was born, my mother, you know, I-lived with her family close by. And when I was about three and a half years old, you know, the war started, you know, and the German occupation of Poland began. And at -- as most of us -- most people know, there was an agreement in the Ribbentrop-Molotov Act, which kind of divided up Poland, you know, be-before the war even started. And so, soon as the Nazis  <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion</p><p> occupied Poland, the Russians moved their borders as well, and consequently we came under Russian occupation.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me a little -- let's back up a little bit, before we get to that part.</p></p></dialogue>

My mother and I kind of never talked about that. And consequently I just don't know. I-- you know, I -- and I've tried very hard, you know, to try and find out more about his family and I've been unsuccessful at this point.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have memories of him?</p></p></dialogue>

And that image of him is the only image that I have, you know. The rest I -- I just don't remember. But that's the only image that I seem to be ingrained in my mind, and I'm not quite sure if that's a true memory, or something my mother said to me, you know, at one point when I was -- was young or what, you know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were you when that -- when you were on that train?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very small child, right. And that is my only memory. I mean, I've --1--I have some pictures of my mother and -- and my father together. And I have a picture that we found here in the United States of him, you know, that my mother had sent to his sisters here in -- in the United States. But I, you know, don't have any independent memories other than that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell -- the -- then let's go back a little bit. I mean, one of the reasons I ask this question is particularly when people were children, really small children during the war, we're talking about fragmented memories.</p></p></dialogue>

What her life before any --all of this was like, and then during those two years?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I'm afraid not. You know, we never -- never really discussed that period at all, you know. As a matter of fact, we talked very little about the war or the Holocaust.</p><p>My mother was -- you know, every once in awhile she'd say something, but very seldom that -- that discussion. Th -- really, I began to realize that what I'd missed, is after my mother passed away, you know, that I didn't have a history, I didn't have the information of my father, and I didn't have -- know at all -- don't know at all what my father's family -- anything about my father.

Really haven't found out anything about my father, you know, I mean I just haven't been able to make that connection. And all the people that I get ahold of nowadays, you know, seem to be second generation or third generation, and they don't know what happened, you know, so when you try to find out well, are we cousins, distant cousins or something like that, are you -- how is the family tree over here? What is the -- it just -- it just --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It -- somewhere it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- doesn't -- it doesn't come true, it doesn't happen, you know.

And we kept going from -- from one office to another, where was the camp, etcetera, an-and -- and I -- nobody knew, you know. And finally I went to this one travel agent, you know, travel bureau, and went to them, you know, and then kept talking to the people in -- at the desk, you know, and somebody in the back, a young lady in the back heard our discussion.</p><p>And she finally says, oh yes, yeah, it was an Juden camp. You know, she -- she knew about the -- Grandfather had told me about this Jew camp -- Jewish camp that used to be here.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything from this that you would like to add from what I've -- you know, from what we've talked about? Is there anything I haven't asked that you think is important to be a part of this interview?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Can't think of anything specific. The -- you know, the thing that is -- is -- is -- that the hatred, you know, to overcome all that hatred is just, you know, I-I -- that people would do that to -- to each other is just unbelievable, you know, and it's just hard --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Is it something you had inside for a long time?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know, I guess, you know, I mean th-the -- the -- th-the thing from the -- from Ryevka(ph), the thing that still stands out in my mind is that incident with the kids, you know, of them taunting me and -- and -- and calling me, you know, evra(ph) -- zhid, you know, and -- and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Which is a terrible -- in -- in Russian it's a terrible epithet.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, you know, so th -- that kind of hatred -- and I -- and I knew the kids were -- didn't know what they were doing, you know, but somehow that was passed on to them, you know? Because I don't think they've had that much in -- in -- those young kids of -- that had that much exposure to -- to Jews for them to know what to -- to  <span class="page-break" number="49"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> even know that they should hate me, or why they hated me, you know, or why they kept calling me names. And I think that's why it dissipated, because they didn't really know, didn't have the hatred, it was something that was passed onto them from -- from their parents or -- or -- you know, from adults, that it's -- it's all right to pick on Jews, you know, and that thing. So that's why I think it stopped after a period of time, because it wasn't something that came from them, it was passed on to them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But still, the circumstances couldn't have been -- you know, you're five and a half, six years old, something like that. Your mother was powerless to try and help you, she's barely keeping alive.</p></p></dialogue>

So -- so, yeah. Yeah, and -- and one of our --I guess, you know, some things ya -- are kind of passed on whether you like it or not, you know. I-I remember -- I have four sons, you know, and I remember Eric, my th -- my third son, one day, you know, we were going out to buy a --a car, and he was a young child yet, you know. And I remember we -- we were looking at Volkswagens, and he said, Dad, you're not gonna buy a German car, are you? He was so upset about that, you know.
