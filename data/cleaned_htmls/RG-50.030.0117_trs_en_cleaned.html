<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh, can you please tell us your name and when you born and where?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Paul Kovac. It uh is pronounced Kovach, in my mother tongue. I was born in Slovakia, in a small city of Tren_in on the 6th of December, 1938.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh can you tell us your earliest recollections of, from your childhood about your town and your home, your family?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We used to live in a small city of Martin (ph). I was born in Tren_in but my father was a professor at a small agricultural college in Martin. My grandparents used to live in Tren_in and that's where my mother went when I was to be born. I used to attend the kindergarten in Martin and that's where we used to live until September of 1944. Since my father was a professor at this college he was sort of indispensable and uh he was exempt from having to wear the David Star in the Slovak state where it was otherwise compulsive for everybody of Jewish origin. This uh privilege was also given to the whole family, uh that is for my mother and also for my grandparents, who who came to live with us uh in the mid-forties, probably in "43 and uh that's when they left Tren_in and came to Martin to live with us, because it was safer for them to stay with the breadwinner who was actually exempt.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell us about your birth certificate? There was something unusual.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh, yes. As a matter of fact I, shortly after I was born, simply because it was safer, my parents had me convert to to Roman Catholicism. I became Roman Catholic and actually this shows on my birth certificate where the religion from Israeli was changed to Roman Catholic. On the old piece of paper it is still obvious that the change was made. It shows on the aged piece of paper where on the line which shows religion, there's a sort of faint uh piece of, faint piece which shows that the the change was made there. Uh I was not brought up in a very religious way but uh after the war I attended uh religious classes with the other Roman Catholic kids in the public school, and this uh was the case until 1949, when uh religious classes were no longer compulsory at public schools because of the change in the government.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you know of being Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I knew I was Jewish. But uh my family was a family of non-practicing Jews. We were never very religious and therefore I was not brought in brought up in that way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What do you recall of the Germans coming to your town, and how did that change your life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, actually I didn't actually see the German soldiers come into the town. The way our life changed was that uh in late August of 1944, when there was a time of Slovak national</p><p><span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> uprising, my father was notified somehow by his friends that the situation is becoming more dangerous for Jewish people, and he was uh advised to leave the city and leave the school.</p><p>Uh there was a small agricultural uh farm associated with the college where my father used to teach, and he was able to steal a horse and a cart, and he put the whole family on this with very few belongings and we went to one of his former acquaintances who was a farmer and who used to come to my father for advice and they somehow became friendly and my father considered this to be a safe place to hide, at least in the beginning. And this farmer, I don't recall his name, but this farmer had he had again some other friends, farmers further in the country, and that's where we were directed. I don't really recall how we got there but this was ina small village called Klenowitz. The farmers in the in the village of Klenowitz used to <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> and some girls, but we were about the same age, so we spent our days in a in a very common way as probably any other families would would spend. Occasionally my father had to leave because there was some news uh coming from the village that Germans were about to go to the mountains to look for partisans, and at that time it would be dangerous for any man to be found because they would be uh either sent to labor camps or if they were they would be found that they are Jewish then obviously they would be either shot on the spot or would be send to concentration camps. In this way actually uh my cousin's father was shot in in front of his mother's and his own eyes because they were hiding somewhere and were caught by by Germans and he as a man found being Jewish was shot on the spot, and uh my cousin and my his mother was sent to Theresienstadt to the concentration camp, so you know in order for this not to happen to us, my father always left somewhere when we were notified that the Germans were coming. I remember one one occasion like this when I remember there was a heavy snow before, night night before, and uh he left to hide himself in the snow in the in the forest and when he came back several hours later, he was almost completely frozen. We had to somehow tub his uh body and uh try to somehow revive him. He must have had very a very strong constitution because I don't remember his getting sick or anything but I know that it was it was terrible.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you have contact with other villagers?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, yes. As a matter of fact uh it was a large family, these Vancik people people. We came into direct contact also with some other members of the family but I don't recall our going down to the village actually. We stayed most of most of the time in these mountains, so there was not much much contact with other people but some members of his family, of family, Vancik family occasionally showed up and we spent some time with them, but well there was not much social life. I can tell you that. (Pause)</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What else do you recall about hiding? (Pause) Do you remember any particular person especially who influenced you during that time? (Pause)</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't seem don't seem to recall anything. (Pause)</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened after that period of time in the mountains? What did you do? Where did you go from there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You mean after the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes, after after, right. What was the liberation like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were liberated in uh in 1945 uh in the Spring by the Russian Army; and I remember that uh with this army of Russians also a lot of Romanian troops came. They were probably supporting the Russians after...after the Romanian government uh turned against the Russians, uh against the Germans because it was pretty obvious that obvious and also convenient because uh it was obvious that the Germans are going to loose the war. After,</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That is after the August occupation by the Russians. Uh of course uh coming back was a big disappointment for me then. What the country looked like and how the life changed and everything, and it took me thirteen years to eventually get an exit visa to visit some relatives in Austria and that was when I made my decision to eventually immigrate to the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did you get married, and uh was Judaism a factor in your marriage?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Absolutely not. Uh I got married in 1962. The...the marriage ceremony was a was a civil ceremony, neither ...neither Jewish or Catholic or anything. And uh actually we have brought up our son in a very similar, non-religious way. He knows who he is, what his heritage is, but uh we have never emphasized the religion very much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When and how did you come to the United States?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We came in 1981, in September. We didn't really jump the fence, but in a way we escaped anyway. Uh we got permission to visit my wife's sisters who happened to live in Vienna, Austria. And uh we simply packed whatever we could and left everything else behind.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And then from Vienna you came here?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: From Vienna, we were we immediately as we arrived in Vienna, we first uh tried to, I tried to get a job either in Austria or in Switzerland. This didn't work out because 1981 was a very bad year economically both in the United States and in Europe, and since I was in this country before, that was my next choice. I have a distant cousin in California, and uh with his sponsorship it was rather easy uh to get here within a relatively short time. We first went to HIAS in Vienna, and with their help we were able to take care of the formalities in a rather uneventful way. It took us only six weeks and we had our visas and were flown to the United States. I remember that with my with my cousin's friend uh help it took me only two weeks to get a job. It was not the best job, but it was a job and I could start working again as a chemist. I had a job with a small chemical company in Torrence, California. It was a very good experience for me, and this is how I first encountered private industry in this country.</p><p>But uh | always wanted to work in research because this is how I was trained. And uh luckily I managed to obtain this position at the National Institutes of Health; first as a visiting scientist, and later I was tenured. We became citizens of the United States in 1986. We applied five years to the day when we landed in this country, and it took about three or four months to get a citizenship then.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your experiences during the Nazi era?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, to make these things a little bit easier to understand why...why uh it happened only in 1944 that we had to leave our homes, probably it would be good to mention that, in a way, we owe our survival until "44... It's...it's an irony, but we owe it to the Munich Pact. Because</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> during that time - I mean, this was the...this was the way for the Slovaks to get their autonomy. When Czechoslovak Republic was first cut into pieces, then the eastern part of the country became an independent Slovak state; and this is what the Slovaks always wanted. They always felt oppressed by either Hungarians or the Austrians. And throughout several hundred years, they have never been independent. And uh they accepted, actually, this tragedy--the Munich Pact-- because this gave them the the opportunity to become independent. Hitler actually used Slovak state as a showcase. He showed the rest of the world that a country which is actually under their command can be prosperous. And many educated people of Jewish origin were able to survive, because they were sort of indispensable. So they were exempt from, for example, wearing their David Stars-- which was normally an obligation for everybody who was Jewish. I was able to attend public kindergarten. My father was able to keep his job until 1944--September. Until after the Slovak National Uprising, when the things became more dangerous.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you had mentioned something about Jews fighting in the Slovak...the Slovak Army, even.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, this was another privilege sort of which the citizens of Slovakia of Jewish origin were granted, to serve in Slovak Army against the Russians. Actually my uncle, my father's brother, younger brother, died on the Russian front as a member of Slovak Army. This is how the Germans wanted to show the rest of the world that they are treating everybody equal in that country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Thank you very much for the interesting story.</p></p></dialogue>
