So that was a family together. And so we had selling papers in the corners, delivering papers to houses. And we walk from [indecipherable] it was called, a little barrio. We head down Correro(ph) Street, to Hill Street, then get ready for the N-New Year's day, and sell papers for everybody to -- and so they use the paper, newspapers for pillows, or cover up while the Rose parade was able to start.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: At the time, well, it was all strange, that my mother started to -- or my stepmother, that I call her mother, I noticed that she started to have somebody pack her furniture, and all our furniture, and -- and then the truck came by and picked up all that furniture, and then as -- well, we asked her, we says, what's happened, where are you going? She said no, we are all going. And I says, where are we going? She <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Anthony Acevedo deg October 13, 2010 says, we're going to Mexico. And I says why? He says, because we were told to leave the United States. And si -- but, does my father know about it? He knows about it. My father was in Mexico, and -- and he had a good job, he had graduated from engineering, and became a -- an architectural engineer, and -- and all things that we didn't even know, while we were growing. Every door -- everything was incognito. And so, at that time, was -- by that time, I was about around nine and a half years old, close to 10, and -- and where are we heading, I asked my mother. She said, we're heading toward Durango, Durango, Mexico. And so, when we arrived in Durango, I remember that my father had a house rented out for us to live, just a few days before they get a house. And so I remember sleeping on top of the -- one of those big suitcases, that you used to travel in a big ships, at one time. And was funny how we had to just sleep on top of that, and fall down. And kid's stuff, that we [indecipherable]. So that -- then I started to grow up then, and my father begin to increase his title, his engineering, his business. He became well-known. And it was altogether a different custom of life, living in Mexico, compared to in the United States.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How so?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, they call me the gringo, because I was born in United States, and that I know half English and half Spanish. And that was kind of difficult, but before I <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Anthony Acevedo deg October 13, 2010 knew it, I had a teacher tell me, he says, I want you to help me to teach these ch- children to speak English. And she was an English teacher, so I tag along.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And what was -- so you were going to school, and your father was now working -- where was your father working now?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father became a director of public works for the state of Durango. And -- and so, at that time as I -- as I started to grow up, he -- it was time when the Olympics was supposed to start. Mexico was the named nation to -- for the Olympics, world Olympics. And so my father decided to build a big Olympic swimming pool, which was a hundred meters long, by 50 meters wide, with all the decorations, as a--a-- an Olympic swimming pool would look like, and with a--a transmitter along the side of that swimming pool so that people could listen to the music, and -- and promenade. So, while I was going to school, we all got excited about the Olympics, but then there was two other fellows and myself, we al -- they all -- always called us the -- the three musketeers. And I liked to make -- do exercise, and so I -- I trained re -- by looking at the books my father had of Charles Atlas, well-known then. And every morning we used to -- well, these fellows would come over and pick me up, and we'd go swimming at the swimming pool, five in the morning. And then about seven, we'd head back to s -- to school. This time it was about -- the war had started, the 40s, 1940. And Corolla(ph), Antonio Corolla(ph) <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Anthony Acevedo deg October 13, 2010 was my friend. He was a -- a -- the son of a--a diplomat, congressman. Jose Blanco -- Pepe Blanco(ph) they call him, Pepe, he was the nephew of a railroad conductor.</p><p>Which he knew the Morse code very well. So we went out swimming, and Pepe Blanco(ph) says, Atlas, Atlas, there's a spy going on. I said, why, what do you know? We are very low voice, because we hear music in the distance, and I was from the transmitter. He says that there's a Morse code going on, and -- and -- and there -- there are submarines in Baja, California connected with -- with these people. I says, but how? How do you know? Yeah, I hear, dara de dara dara de dara dara dara -- so they said that we better get to your father. So we decided -- we dashed out that swimming pool, we headed back to school. And they went to school, and I went to his office, my father's office, and I knocked quick at the door of his office, and I told him about the situation. And soon he -- before you knew it, he had them arrested. And sure enough, they were spying for the Nazis, the Germany. Well, I didn't realize then that we had a-- a German colony in -- in Mexico. And here I was associated well with the groups of fellas, Boy Scouts. We had formed a Boy Scout group, and our scoutmaster, Boy Scout master was the Schraeder(ph), a Schraeder(ph) family that owned a hardwood store there in Durango. And so, by that time I was 17 and a half years old, and an amer -- the consul general of the United States was after me because of my age, and get ready <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Anthony Acevedo " October 13, 2010 to go back in United States and serve your country. Yes, sir. He was very good friend of -- he was a very nice friend of ours. And so I said goodbye to my parents, and my mother pre -- my mother prepared me, meaning that she -- she took my coat pocket, 200 dollars, put it -- a safety pin on it. She says, this is nobody steal it from you. Use it when you can. Yeah, but how am I gonna take it out of there, it's -- it's -- it's secured. All these funny things get -- one asks. But anyway, I had it -- I said goodbye to my parents and -- and I took the train from Durango to the city of Torreon, we transferred over -- I transferred over to another train. And at that time I didn't know the traveling situation, because I had never traveled. And -- and I-- I had my little satchel with me, and little suitcase. And I heard somebody say, psst, psst, psst, just a -- like a whistling at me through the window of the other coach train. And I went up, and he says, give it to me, he say, I have a seat here for you.</p><p>So we met fre -- made friends, and we became friends until a year later. But I'll tell the story about that. I -- I said goodbye to him, because he was supposed to meet his sister there, in Juarez. I crossed the border, and I headed to Pasadena, back to my cousin's. And that's where I headed for induction, the following day. And then the -- the head of the induction center said that I needed another semester of school.</p><p>And I said, why? He says, well, we don't evaluate the sc -- the -- what you went through in your school, is not enough. I says, I went to school seven in the morning <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Anthony Acevedo " October 13, 2010 til six in the evening. Isn't that enough? And, I says, they teach us very much over there. More than they teach you here. I couldn't say any more, he says, but you need -- you need a one semester. So I went to Pasadena City College, I took a course, and I passed by three months in that vacation. And I wa -- I got my diploma, and -- and I'm in the army. So before I knew it, I was in Oregon, in Camp Adair, Oregon. We call it Swamp Adair, because it was full of swamps. And then I was transferred, and I had special letters that my father had given me, as a duc -- introduction, showing that my efforts was to -- wanted to be a doctor. And so, before I knew it, I was transferred from the infantry to the -- to go to medical school.</p></p></dialogue>

You should pray, have faith. No, no, no, I have a feeling I'm gonna die. I said, Murray, don't say that. But anyway, I changed his mind by talking other things. Then that -- two days later we headed for -- for Lyon, France. And we were delighted, he was assigned to a group, and I was assigned to another group of Company B, and he was assigned to Company A something. But anyway, we went to battle, and on my assignment I headed with Company B, on a special assignment, and I just followed.

Drop all that stuff [indecipherable] they gonna kill you, you're a sore thumb, you -- I said, no, I says, that's gonna save my life. And so, we had it to their assignment, what they had to do, and I just followed, and as we were heading back, they finished what they had to do, the battalion. And -- and we were marching towards a ridge, and there was a dike down below, and I heard an echo, medic, medic, cause there were machine guns going on back and forth. And I was carrying my stuff with me, and then -- and then it's -- so finally I picked up the sound, and I started to head downhill. And as I was heading down the hill, I tripped on some branches. And when I tripped over those branches, then I saw up ahead, a cave with Germans. Well, there were about six Germans in there, with machine guns.

First aid sutures and sewing thumbs. Cutting a leg off, and putting a tourniquet, and sewing up that leg, the stump. Doing this and that, so--as a medic. So finally, we all started to head back and they helped me with the wounded. And as we were heading back, our scout said that we couldn't get to -- back to Philippsbourg, and so we decided -- he said, move over to the hill. And so we went up to the hill, and there I saw Murray Pruzan, that he had been killed. He tried to save the -- well, he did save the -- our captain -- commander's life. He had severe wounds, and he was unconscious. But Murray was -- was cut in half by machine guns. I lost my friend.

In other words, you shoot a person from a distance, okay, you gonna hit him in the back. So, the German asked me, I want you to check and to see that he is being -- he was shot trying to escape. I says, can I turn him over? Can I look at him? And they're saying okay. And the Germans was shooting in the forehead, with a wooden bullet.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the conditions were obviously much worse in Berga?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they started t-to -- force us to take our clothes off, and just sleep with their underwear, and they would force me to take all the clothes into a shack, just a little bit outside the barracks, to prevent anyone from escaping. So this got worse, because the sleeping without the clothes, it was dangerous for your health. Getting worse pneumonia, and all the qua -- the effects, the side effects that you would get, without being able to eat at all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Did they -- I mean, what kind of food were you provided with?

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, what was an average day at Berga for all of you? Was there anything as an average day? Was there any typical day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. And it -- stuff --tea to drink was nothing but just grass, boiled it into tea.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there any interaction with the other prisoners? The other political prisoners, in the other part of the camp?</p></p></dialogue>

We found out later that -- that those tunnels were being made because the Germans were developing secret equipment, missiles, buzz bombs, and other equipment that they had in mind, that they were hiding in those tunnels.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And the physical conditions were atrocious. What were the Germans who ran the camp like? How did they treat you guys?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They treated us very bad, because the fact that they beat them. They beat them with the butt of their rifle, and poke them -- would force, say, to geta--ati-a railroad tie, and carry it into the tunnels, to repair the railroad ties. And they could barely ha -- carry the weight th-they had for themselves, because the fact that -- the weakness that they felt. Not eating, you're not going to be able to lift anything so heavy.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And did you receive any news of the war? Did you -- was -- did you guys know what was going on outside of Berga?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Wow.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They would bomb the sites. And you could feel when it bombed the areas, they -- the windows would -- the -- the glass would crack, the vibration of the bombing. But things like that. Another thing what we found out, we were -- got a hundred grams of bread per week. Now a hundred bread -- grams of bread is not much for every -- but it was a mix of barley with sawdust, ground glass, and ground sand. And the barley to camouflage -- and they make that black bread black because they -- the Germans loved the black bread. And it -- that caused damage in your stomach.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it give you -- how did you feel when you would see the Americans flying overhead?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The day came when the germ -- when the Germans started to feel the -- the heat.</p><p>And the German started to feel the heat when they found out that the English were coming from one side, the Russians from the other side, the French from the other, and the Americans.

What was the --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Men -- th-the fellows were starting to -- to get the effects of the -- of the -- or the eating, and -- and the work, exhaustion, because of the -- I mean, th-they -- they couldn't move their muscles, they had their -- they were exhausted. And that was practically from the beginning of -- at the time when we got into Berga to -- to live -- one thing that just went by me is when we got to Berga, well, they took us to the -- the cremation center of the -- of the Buchenwald, to gi -- bathe us. Well, we didn't know that there -- that was a bathing, we thought they were -- they were going to cremate us.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I tried to keep my, as close as possible, as the information related to the condition of my fellow men, because the fact that, more or less, I knew that maybe someday, it would be a valuable thing for -- for us, to know that -- that there was important -- I was concerned at the condition, knowing that maybe I was at risk carrying that diary, because a couple of times, it dropped out of my pants. I carried it right -- right inside of my b-belt. And on one occasion, one of the guards picked it up. It happened to be one of the good guards, it was the Austrian fella that -- he said, what are you writing? I said, just my memoirs of the ca -- the beautiful country. Just faked it, to let him know that I wasn't writing anything wrong. And so, he believed me.

There must not be no feeling.

We res -- we expect dignity, and -- and the true fact of -- the feeling of -- of love. Not double talk. [break] Q2: Tony, you just spoke so eloquently just now, of what it felt like when your country turned its back on you, and told you that you couldn't talk about what you'd been through, and denied you the benefits.

The American flag is due to respect, and the dignity of the United States, remains a love. But yet, you would think that there's still something way back over there, that they're trying to almost implement a law that there's no such thing as in God we trust, or nothing like that. Which I think it's nothing but a bunch of double talk that they're trying to do, to implement. We're trying to f-- it is the fact, give our countries more strength. If the people would open up and be more dignified, to maintain the firmness, then we'd show we respect that flag as the strength of the country. And in God we trust. We love. And He protect us, which they don't believe in that, but they're a bunch of atheists.</p><p>Q2: Today you're giving, as Christina said, a set of your most precious documents, that talked about what you went through, to the Holocaust Museum.
