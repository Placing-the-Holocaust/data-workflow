<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When did things begin to change?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: For me personally, you know, some time after the holidays, our Passover holidays in 1939, my aunt came from Warsaw. And my father sent me to live with her for a while, you know. I finished elementary school. There was no question about going to college because there was no money, so I lived...I went sometimes in May to Warsaw in 1939. In September the war started. Then, you know, lasted the whole month until, you know, until the Germans really came in Warsaw. The family four months. In that apart...in that apartment, you know, uh we all lived in the basement and every morning you had to, you know, go up and every evening go down into the basement until the bombardment was over, and I stayed with them until in the "40's. In the fall in the "40's.</p><p>And there was a janitor in that house who offered, you know, that I should move in with their family and live with them. In the meantime, you know, they started...other people started moving in. It's up in the in the district where later on the ghetto was. The street was called . And when they started really giving a very hard time to all the Jews and beating and and resettling, the people started moving in. My aunt bought me a ticket on the train and said go home. So I was on the train traveling from Warsaw to : Sometime...half-way they stopped the train. They said all the Jews off. And they gathered us all in the station...it was a railway station. A tall guy, a Polish railway worker, came over to me, took my hand to walk me out, and and maybe about half-mile from the station there was three big buildings like apartment buildings where railway workers probably lived, you know. And he took me to the apartment. In the apartment there were maybe twenty other Jews, so he kept us over there like some of them he kept like a week, two, two days, five days and slowly he and his wife took them through the fields and tried to help them go on, get out of there. He kept me six weeks I was over there, and one day he said it's time to move on, and he took me through the fields and I walked like miles and miles...I don't even know what direction, you know. Some people gave me a ride, you know, and I told them where I want to go and finally I came to the city where I wanted to go home to . Lcame over there. There were no Jews. I knew I had an <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> aunt, my mother's sister, in . So I walked to . You know, on on the way I asked where to go and since I was little blonde girl and uh nobody really suspected that I'm Jewish you know. Because nobody in all these people who gave me a ride, you know, asked me where you want to go, and I said I want to go there, to . They took me.</p><p>They they...nobody suspected I was Jewish. I came to . Was nobody there anymore. My aunt was, you know, was a wealthy woman. She had businesses. It's a small town. She had a big...and for that time a brick house was a big thing, you know.

It was...the Russian Tiger (ph) is is unbelievable because the only thing you have over there is trees and was not a house. We had to build our own barracks, and they had...____ couple of day commandant and some others who overseed us. We could not leave the place. It was not fenced in or anything.</p><p>But where would you go? There was a village about five or ten miles away, but you couldn't leave without having a permission to leave and at the...what we had to do over there is get up every morning and cut down trees, cut the trees down into one meter blocks and pile it up in the forest. And for this you got the ration bread, just bread. Was hunger. The families built like a barrack and each barrack was divided into tiny little places. You lived on the floor. It was cold. The winters were horri...winter was...we were one winter there...absolutely horrible. The snows went up six, seven feet and uh was was bad. It was bad, you know. And we thought that when we came...if we're ever liberated of these these miserable forests, we'll have stories to tell, and fortunately when we came back after, you know, the war ended...they let us go back to Poland. On the way back, you know, once we crossed Ger...the Polish border, the Russian-Polish border, the Poles started, you know, wanted to dynamite the train. And, you know, everybody had to get off the train. The train was escorted by Russian military. We had to get off the train.

And from there, we put them on trucks into and tried to smuggle <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> once...many times, so next day we used to take some on trucks and drive them down to the border. Normally there were Russians on one side and Germans on the other side.</p><p>Means to either pay off uh with money, bribe the borders, guards, you know, to let you through. On the other side there were Brichah from Germany who took them over and they took over...they continued on the other side and we went back.
