One million; not military, civil population. And he said that the history doesn't know a second such case that 900 days you don't give up, and Hitler can't take Leningrad. The marshals of Hitler came close the gates of the city, and they brought even stones to build a monument for Hitler, for their fuehrer. And we did, 20 years old guys, we said no. No. Ended.
