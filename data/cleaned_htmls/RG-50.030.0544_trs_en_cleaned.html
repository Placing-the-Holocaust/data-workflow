<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That would mean your aunt as well.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And among them was my mother's sister, the massage-ist, Mina(ph). In Nesvizh my mother had a brother, Zahar(ph). Zahar(ph) was killed in Nesvizh very fast, because the Germans had the impression that his son has sympathies for leftist. So he was executed almost immediately, maybe the second or third day in Nesvizh. He was a composer, and I have probably here some notes that he composed.

You are walking through the streets and you are seeing dozens of dying people. This author said that in the hunger in Leningrad died one million population. One million; not military, civil population. And he said that the history doesn't know a second such case that 900 days you don't give up, and Hitler can't take Leningrad. The marshals of Hitler came close the gates of the city, and they brought even stones to build a monument for Hitler, for their fuehrer. And we did, 20 years old guys, we said no. No. Ended.

It is between Finland and between Russia.</p><p>The Finnish said that all Ladoga has to belong to them, and the Russians say that all Ladoga has to belong to the Russians. On the Ladoga were points where trucks winter were going through the snow and the ice, through the Ladoga, through the -- with some food.

I feel so, that they threw less shells on the Russian territora -- territory than the Germans. I have a such feeling, because in Leningrad was inscriptions on the walls, where is safer to -- to walk. So, if you look what is written, it is written so, like most of the shells would come from the dort -- from the Finns. Less from the Finns and more from the south.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you -- I guess my larger question is, did you go back to any of the places, whether it was Wilno, whether it was Nesvizh, whether it was the various towns you had been with your mother, after the war, to see what they looked like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In general, not. But I was close to Ponary, and Ponary is a station close to Landwarow.</p></p></dialogue>

On the street Mickiewicza is -- on the wall of the court before the war in -- in Vilnius, the Polish court, are names of young people who were killed. By whom they were killed, what is it? And the Jewish guy explained me, that the Lithuanians said that the Jews were criminals. That they killed the Lithuanians because the Lithuanians were Soviet spies. But I imagine that when the Polish Jewish Jews in Vilnius came back to their houses, and they knew from the population, from -- from many other sources, who was the real spies for Hitler, they came to the Soviets, and the Soviets do what with the young, what they could do with somebody else. Or they could do with -- with Russians, who were under such suspicion, you know. So, in Vilnius in [indecipherable] city on the street Mickiewicza is a such monument.
