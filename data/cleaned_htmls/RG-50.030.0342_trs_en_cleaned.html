<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Good afternoon, Flory. Can you please tell me your full name and where you were born.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My name is Flory Jagoda, and I was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia. You want to know when? I don't think I should tell you -- December 21st, 1923. A lot of years. Actually, most of the survivors are this age, maybe a little younger, a little older. But this is more or less around 70s and so. And they have one thing in common -- silence. They sort of don't like to talk.</p><p>We don't like to -- it is almost like a wound that, you know, you heal. And you don't want to scratch it. It bleeds. And also, a lot of them do not want to burden their families, especially their children, with sadness. They want to forget. And it works for a while. You have children, and you have weddings, and grandchildren, and music lessons, and piano lessons.</p><p>And I was teaching music myself for 25 years. So I was quite a busy lady. Then all of a sudden, children leave, and marry, and get a little older. And you know, you don't sleep.</p><p>You sort of start dreaming, and seeing some images and faces of your family -- and, uh, you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless. And, uh, then you read these horrible stories -- there was no holocaust -- never happened -- and you know what that means to a survivor -- no holocaust? Your whole inner starts screaming. I think the age -- and I also think the story of the holocaust never happened -- is -- I think it broke the silence of a lot of holocaust survivors. Age definitely had something to do with it. So here Iam. I'm going to take you to a small little town in Bosnia, and share with you my childhood.</p><p> Actually, I'm not going to start in Sarajevo. We will go about 98 kilometers up northeast</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It's know for its pine trees. My whole family lived there. Their name was Altarac, the Altarac family. And they were very proud of their name. It meant , the high place -- very proud of that. And, you <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Now the life in Vlasenica -- it was a very simple life. The family was very close nit, about 15 families, 15, 16, families -- most of them, Altarac families. And in my family, definitely, the leader was my nona (ph.), my grandmother. My nona was a kind of a grandmother that a child dreams of having, not because only -- I mean, her voice was something that was unbelievable. She sang beautifully. But she was a midwife, a well known midwife, in all the neighboring villages, she knew herbs. Her house was always full of women with babies and children -- "What do I give to this one?" -- "What do I" -- "What herb do I use?". She was the one to put the first pair of earrings through the babies" ears. And naturally, she was the leader of her own band, as we say in America -- leader of the band. She had her own singing family, which was well known as the Altarac family, the singing Altarac family, five daughters and three sons. She was the teacher of religion in the house. Women did not go to the synagogue as much as we see here. The men usually went to synagogue, took their sons, taught them Hebrew. And the woman stayed at home, and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition, religion, heritage. All that she learned from her nona, and her bis- nona, the great grandmother, just went on from generation to generation.</p><p> They lived there for about four centuries, and the old peacefully died, and the young were born and married, and there was harmony in Vlasenica -- the Moslems and Serbs and Jews lived in harmony there. I never remember hate or quarrels. The women visited and the children went to school together. I would never, never, never, believe that the madness of the Second World War would bring something.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> So, uh, the life didn't have too much change. And more or less, everybody was quite satisfied, went along with the life as it was. But my nona's family -- there was one daughter -- she just couldn't take it -- that was my mother, Rosa (ph.). And she was actually considered as a rebel. I mean, she always dreamt of far-away places, she read books that she was not supposed to read. If there was something in the family -- or the girls wanted to try something new, let Rosa do it first -- to eat something -- let Rosa taste it first. She was just very, very different. So finally, she talked her family to send her to Sarajevo, which was a thriving -- I mean, big city at that time, huh? And she went to stay with my tia esperansa (ph.). Tia is aunt. And I will be adding some of these Ladino words, because they just fit in with the words that I'm saying. It's, as we call it, Lingua De la Madri (ph.), the language of the mother.</p><p> This was the language in the home. You passed the door, and you did not hear Serb or Croatian words. It was only in Ladino, as we call it, Judeo-Spanish. Sometimes, we would come home and -- with non-Jewish friends -- and I would sort of be a little embarrassed, I would say nona-- can't you speak so -- they'll think maybe we're talking something, you know, behind their back. She would look at me very seriously. She'd say <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> family.</p><p> Anyway, going back to my mother, Rosa -- she finally managed to go to Sarajevo. And she falls in love. She falls in love with a musician. And what did he play? Accordion and guitar. And he had a gorgeous voice. The moment the family heard a musician -- I mean, it was something you should never even consider. A nice Jewish family -- I mean, a girl, a Sephardic girl, to marry a musician who plays for money? I mean, you are blessed with a voice. That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other people -- not to take the money. But you know, nothing would help. And as much as they really respected the father -- you never questioned grandfather -- whatever he said, that was it. She decided to marry -- Samuel Poppel (ph.) was his name -- very handsome Samuel Poppel.</p><p>And she found out very, very early that it was no big deal, because Samuel Poppel played all night and slept all day -- and at night, he was out singing , which is a Bosnian <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> about. I never saw him. I don't even know what he looks like.</p><p> But my grandfather went right away to work to find a husband for Rosa. The marriages were, really, arranged. The father, the grandfather, would call you, you would kiss his hand, and he would say, "I have a husband for you." You would kiss his hand again, and you were very happy. In one way, it was just -- it was very simple. You didn't have to worry about the singles, or "Where am I going to meet a man?". And usually, the father knew what the -- you know, what kind of man their daughter needs. So every little town from the Srebenica to Travnik as I told you before -- the families kept in touch, they visited each other, and they knew exactly who had daughters, who had sons, their ages. And in between the cities, there were such people as Casmententeros, the matchmakers. They usually -- it was a side job, besides what they were doing -- and they would get 20 percent here, and 20 percent on the other side. They would match, give parties. So they found a match. And it was a salesman who was traveling from city to city. They only spoke in Judeo, in Ladino. The salesman too. Everything was done in this Ladino language in between them. So his name was Mikaiel (ph.) Poppel -- no -- sorry -- Mikaiel Cabeelio (ph.). Poppel was my father who I never met. And Mikaiel Cabeelio comes to Vlasenica, and meets Rosa. And by golly, she liked him. She was very picky, you know? She was a very pretty, pretty girl, pretty woman.</p><p>I'll show you a picture later -- very pretty. And they arranged a wedding. Naturally, I was not at the wedding. I was sent to play with the cousins. It was something that was not part of me, which -- it hurt, you know, later on -- when you get older, you think back, "Well, how could they do that to me?". You know. Anyway, she gets married, and they go to the city of Zagreb, a big city. This is what she wanted to do, to go live in a big city. And they left. To</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I adored that woman -- just adored. I think all the feeling that I have for this Sephardic culture, for stories, for songs -- it's all really a gift from her to me that I will have for the rest of my life. It was -- I considered her as my mother. I didn't miss Rosa. It's sad. But that's just the way it was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were you when they got married and left for Zagreb?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, before nine. I was about seven, or maybe even younger, because I -- no -- seven, because I stayed with nona two years, until they got settled. And then, one day, my grandfather comes in with a hat on, a real hat. You know, I was used to seeing my grandfather dressed with a . All the Jews in Vlasencia and all these little towns -- they were dressed the same as the Moslems. You wouldn't know which one's which. They all had , and shuck sheers (ph.) -- that's pantaloon pants. And he put a hat on because, I guess, he wanted to look a little more modern. He was going to a big city. And, oh, it was tough on me. I hated that day. I'll never forget it as long as I live.</p><p> My nona gives me an orange bag with the pictures of my family, all my aunts. And she said</p><p> , don't ever forget your Mishpachah (ph.), which is, really, a Hebrew word. But <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> Coming to Zagreb is like day and night, a difference of life and people and -- my mother -- I mean, I couldn't recognize my mother before anything else. She was very dressed up in very beautiful clothes. And my stepfather, my new father, who adopted me -- and I became Floritza Cabeelio -- he started a necktie business, and she was in business with him, very active, very -- this is what she wanted. This is the kind of life she wanted. She could not take that small, village existence. And she mingled with -- socially, with the Ashkenazi Jews, who are a little different than the Sephardim in that part of the world. They were modern. They were from Austrian background and they spoke German at home. And socially, this is where she felt more important. The kosher that was completely gone. I don't remember anything that was connected to Vlasencica that I could see in her. We did not speak Ladino. It was all SerbaCroation. And not only that. She had so many things prepared for me -- I think all the things she wanted for herself that she could never get -- had music lessons, piano lessons, ballet, and drawing, and went to Maccabi (ph.) -- that's like, a health club -- three times a week -- had tickets for the operetta on Sunday afternoon -- Lahar, I knew all the Lahar pieces by heart at the time. It was too much to take actually. She had a maid who spoke to me only in German because that was the language, you know, a fine language.</p><p> I couldn't -- I -- the only thing I would like to do is go back to nona and her Sephardi cooking, and her , and , and , all that Sephardi <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> to buy a harmonica today." A harmonica we called an accordion. And it was my dream to</p><p> have an accordion. If you have a harmonica, you are usually very popular. Everybody</p><p> wants to be with you. You can start a party -- but just the dream that I would never believe it</p><p> would happen to me -- and we go to this -- the store in Zagreb, right near the park, called</p><p> -- I'll show you that picture too -- and, uh, we went to the music store, and he <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0</p><p> Then "41, and the war started, and everything went down, just from one thing. Every day was a new day of new pain, and new fright, and new disappointment, and waiting for something terrible to happen everyday. The first thing that really killed me is we went to school, the teacher gets up, and she says, "Pinto (ph.), Abuhari (ph.), Stein (ph.), Schiller (ph.), Cabeelio, leave and don't come back." That was -- kicked you out of school, so you couldn't go back to school. Then the second day, you were all called to a place, and they put yellow badges on you, badges too, with a "Z". Zidov means Jew. Then everybody had to bring their radios in. I mean, every day was something frightening. Then comes Wednesday day it was my music day -- music -- and that was, to me, a day I lived for, because I always had my lessons all ready for Edat. And I come to her door, and she opens the door, and there were two German soldiers in the back visiting with her. This was early "41. The Germans have come and occupied Zagreb. She saw me, and she saw my "Z", and she froze. She said, "Floritza, I can't teach you anymore. Don't come back." And that was tough and that was hard. That was tough. And I just turned around, and me and my harmonica, my friend, just walked home broken-hearted, just broken-hearted. Since that day, I play only by ear because that was my salvation.</p><p> Everyday was worse and worse. My father had a friend in Split -- that's a Dalmation Coast that was under Italy -- and arranged with him successfully to receive some tickets with Gentile names, so we would get away. I hear my father talk to my mother next -- in the next room -- "This is getting worse. We have to get out of here. All three of us can not go to the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We'll have to send Floritza first, and then the two of us will follow." And I couldn't -- couldn't believe what I hear. Me? To go alone? And this is what we had to do.</p><p>"What do I take with me? What do I take with me?" My mother said, "Take a couple best dress that you have, put it in an old suitcase and, naturally, your harmonica." And I picked up my nona's orange bag, and a little piece of gold, and I was ready to go. Our Gentile neighbor was kind enough to take me. And my father said, "Floritza, the moment you come to that station, to that compartment, don't talk, gavoriti" -- in SerbaCroatian -- <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 Anyway, we did come to Split and arrived , I found the family waiting for us, <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did the same thing happen to you with your friends who were now Jewish?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I didn't see my friends anymore. Nobody came around anymore. Not that they were bad people. They were afraid. They were afraid. The moment and the -- every knock on the door was something that -- you would freeze -- "Uh oh, now what?" -- and they were already taking people to the camps, see.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: What did I know the Nazis were doing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --All I knew is that they are conquering, going from country to country, and killing Jews.</p><p>That's all I knew. A teenager is not so much into politics. They're with school and friends -- and maybe go to a dance or learn a new song -- a teenager, a young teenager. I knew there was danger. I knew that they didn't like me. I also knew to get away from them as fast as you can.</p></p></dialogue>

Oh yes. So we knew that they don't want us alive. I did not hear of Auschwitz. I didn't hear of these places yet, no. It was too early. But the rumor was "Get away.</p><p>Otherwise, you will not be alive." This was right from the beginning and this was why my father worked so hard to get out of Zagreb and thanks to him we did.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And this friend of his, was he somebody who was in business?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The friend of his, Sylvia, was a friend of his. He also came from Sarajevo. They were friends as children. Then he moved to Split, the City of Split and luckily was able enough to send us tickets with gentile names. All three of us were gentiles. And it worked. For hundreds of them it didn't work because then it became a regular thing, that they knew--"let me look--is this the right paper"--this was the beginning in "41. So in Split, we found a room, started a new life, my mother found a music teacher right away and I continued my lessons.</p><p>It lasted a couple months, not too much because refugees were coming from all over the place to Split. The City couldn't take so many new people. So instead of sending them to Germany, which they were supposed to do, they sent them to different islands on the Adriatic Sea.</p></p></dialogue>

And they to me were the most wonderful people in the world. I still--I hear an Italian language, I hear an Italian song, I meet an Italian--I melt because they gave us life.</p><p>So they send about 300 Jews to Korcula Island. That is about three or four hours by boat-- beautiful Adriatic Sea. And we started a new life on this island--nothing to do. The men were going absolutely crazy. The worst was that they were not in contact with the world, to what was going on. We didn't have a radio. You didn't have news. Once a day a boat would come in, a ship, from Split. And everybody would be there-- "What's new, what's new?". I became a harmonica player on the island, walked around -- and anybody who was celebrating anything would call Floritza. And I became a teacher. My students were all older, but I was a teacher. They had big accordions. I had a small Honer. My student was a butcher's daughter, she would bring a piece of meat, a baker's daughter--I got a piece of bread. And I had olive oil, and bread, and meat, and cheese--we were rich. We had a house full of food. We ate. It was wonderful. The diet on the island was sardines. That was it.</p><p>We ate sardines two and one half years. But you know, thinking now, now that we're into a fish diet--we ate sardines and big long leaves like kale a lot of it grew all over the island, and bread -- good diet.</p><p> Life was tough on parents. We children -- we had no worries -- you know, we swam all day.</p><p>But the men organized sort of a school among themselves to teach because we didn't go to school. So, we had language lessons. We studied English, and we studied Italian, and we studied stenography. We studied anything that anybody was able to teach. And that came in later very handy, very, very handy. We lived there for two and a half years.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Where did you live on the island?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We lived in different houses, whoever had a room to give us. With the natives. We went from room to room, from house to house, seeing who has a room to let.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So what is the relationship between you and the Italians who were occupying--</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: These were Yugoslavs.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: These were Yugoslav?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: These were Yugoslav islands, former Yugoslav. Speaking SerbaCroatia with a dialect of Italy, but -- and they were occupied by Italy. But they were Yugoslav, spoke the language and generous-- how would you like somebody to come to your house tomorrow, a bunch of refugees-- and says "here, have a room", not so easy. Every house, more or less, had a refugee family and we had a room and a half, starting from scratch, from nothing, you know one box or something--a barrel to use as a table, 1 mean nothing. Two and a half years we lived--I made a lot of friendships with the local friends, boys and girls--we sang and we swam had a good time. until one day my father says Floritza the captain of <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 he did. That same day the most horrible news came to the island. The Germans are retreating, going up north, coming through the islands. Well, I was very much frightened.</p><p>The decision I had to make is do I go with all the local friends to the forest to become a partisan, because that's what they decided to do. Or to stay with mother who was going crazy "My Mikaiel. My Mikaiel. My Mikaiel." I naturally stayed with my mother. And that night, late at night, very stormy horrible night, we all got in a tug boat and went over to Italy. Again, what do I take with me--hurry, hurry, hurry. My orange bag, my harmonica was gone, which was the worst, and my nona's little gold piece--and we were on our way.</p><p>The most horrible, horrible trip toward the mainland of Italy. We traveled nights.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why was it so horrible?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the weather was very, very bad and the Germans--You could hear planes overhead bombarding everything before leaving. It was frightening. And we were afraid to travel during the day. So we, you know, hid during the day, traveled at night. Finally arrived to the main land of Italy, two days later. It was like arriving to a promised land. I mean it, when we saw that land, You know. And there were boats all over the place. People coming from all over the place to Italy. And the scene that I will never forget was the Italian women dressed in black with big, big, big baskets of grapes, black grapes. And we were hungry.</p><p>That was great. Anyway, all the refugees came to the Piazza, the middle of the city, and a couple of the organizations, humanitarian organizations, had big tables full of clothes and they took care of our daily needs of bread, but they couldn't find places for you to live. So it became the same situation as when we arrived to Korcula--door to door. The worst was my</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I mean she cried about her Mikaiel. It was impossible. So at the Piazza I would say "You sit with this one and that one"--there were so many refugees there. I would go from house to house from apartment house door to door and see if we can find a place to stay. And after walking about six hours, you know, a lot of them had a way of "No, gratzi" and close the door, you know. I come to a door, knocked on the door and here comes this big heavy set lady dressed up pretty. And I explained to her my situation. Thank god I had learned Italian. And, uh, that I need a room, just my mother and I. "I have a room for you. Bring your mother." So I ran to get my mother to come in. She had a, what you calla" "A little room. That was just for <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 See, it was so human and so, uh, unbelievable. So -- so everybody stood and everybody cried. And he says--"You're alive. They told me everyone in Corsila is gone. You're alive." Well, it was the most wonderful reunion and new way to start. Where do we go to sleep.</p><p>Again, door to door. Door to door. We found a small little apartment, Cassa Popalari. It was a place that Mussolini built for the underprivileged and the poor. A whole unit, unit of little apartments. And we end up very--we were very lucky. And a new life started. And thank god for the lessons, I found myself a job. American army, they were hiring civilians, their offices. And I come in and say I'm a typist. They were hiring civilians. And there was a very friendly Lieutenant Evans from Indiana and he says "well sure come in and, here type this." And I started this (type with two fingers) and the poor guy knew right away I'm not a very good typist. He says Signorina-- they all called us Signorina. We were all Signorinas.-- You know Signorina I have a better job for you.-- He really had a heart. And uh, he takes me to the next office and he says--You see, this is a salvage depot were they bring all the material that is left and brought into Bali-- American army material. So he says, uh, -- "Every morning there's a big black board, write what's the day, the date, and then a young Corporal is going to bring you a piece of paper with numbers. And you take these numbers and copy them in this book .". That was my job, perfect. And every lunch hour he would teach me English and he would bring peanut butter sandwiches and when I saw peanut butter first time, "ewe", you know, it was not a very pretty sight, until I got used to the taste. And one day this very handsome Sergeant walks in. I mean handsome. His name was Sergeant Harry Jagoda and he comes from Youngsten, Ohio--and very devilish. All the girls went with him. Full of jokes. And I -- I also was thought his name was BTO. And later I found out it was Big Time Operator. And if you needed a jeep you would go to Sergeant Jagoda.</p><p>If you needed eggs he would fly to Africa and bring back eggs. I mean he really was a big time operator. he walks to my desk and he says " Would you like to go to a Sergeant's This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

See, you couldn't get out of the house after six o'clock they call it at war time. He come to our house he really does, full of presents. He had a blanket and all kind of good things, you know.

He brought a half a parachute so I could make my gown and all the lingerie.</p><p>He brought a piece of leather and we made the shoes. The whole company came to the wedding and hamburgers to order, hours of making hamburgers and the cook made a big cake and we had a big orchestra. And everybody kissed the bride. You know how many kisses I had. Anyway, beautiful memory. Uh, Sergeant Jagoda had to go back to America, it was the end of the war. I stayed behind and left after. One day coming from work my father, is sitting next to Rosa and she is, I mean a stage again in that I would never imagine her to be in. She received a letter from her brother. It was a day before I left for America and the brother, Lezo (ph.), writing to her that he is the only survivor of the whole Altarc Family. I left the next day. It wasn't fair to her but my ticket and Red Cross Papers from Naples, everything was ready to go. And I left. I arrived to America and it was almost like reading a book and saying "I'll never go back." I'll never this way. Let me start a <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 Covering up what I didn't want to think about. Kept always very busy. And when I went back with Andy and Lori the first time, my son Andy tells me "Mom, you act so American.</p><p>You dress in pants." And I didn't even want to even know what happened, I talked to nobody. And then the second time I went with my whole family it was for my 40th anniversary present from Harry to give concerts. We went from Belgrade to Zagreb to Novisca to Sarajevo. Bringing all these songs back to all these communities that have not heard these Sephardic Songs for years. I, myself, could not sing these songs in front of my mother. My mother arrived three years later -- two years later to America and Rosa was a, really a holocaust victim . She was never the Rosa that I knew. I wish my -- I wish my children would have met Rosa the way she was vivacious and romantic and full of spark.</p><p>She was always very depressed and what hurt her the most was she was very a proud Jewish and the communities that we lived in --it was only Yiddish her generation. One day she asked me "What is shiksah (ph.)? What is shiksah?" That hurt a lot. That hurt her a lot.</p><p>She couldn't take this uh, the whole life around her that was Jewish life and it was not her kind of Judaism. The language was tough and you couldn't sing in front of her, the Ladino songs. She would say "My harmony died." See her sisters and her brothers, they had an unbelievable sense of harmony. You would start a melody, they would harmonize it either way. No notes. And if you hear, if you would sing in front of her, her face would go like this, you know. She developed a policy. So there was no Ladino singing till after her death.</p><p>Then people approached me, "You are Sephardic, do you know anything about Sephardic Music?" Well, do I know enough about Sephardic Music. It was just sort of inside. And the first time was when the Rockville Jewish Community Center had a Sephardic Music Festival and that was "77. And I performed that day. And since that day it just poured out. And here Lam, still doing it full time. Not just myself, but with two daughters and a son, and we just do the same thing--I think what my nona did in Vlasenica.

So the second trip was just to go and give concerts which again, I had nothing to do with questioning or asking, but came in as a performer. And all of a sudden again we go back, the children leave and marry and, again you start dreaming. It's terrible. And I had this overwhelming need, I don't know, growing in me somewhere to go back. And that was -- I talk to myself. I say "Its crazy. This is 43 years after, it's forgotten." But I couldn't fight it. I had to go back and see what happened to this family that I loved, with my own eyes. Maybe Uncle Lazo didn't have the story straight.</p><p>Maybe my mother -- I mean, I found -- I started looking for excuses that I had to go back to find out for myself. And I did. I have a wonderful husband who puts up with all this. Very supportive. And we went back to Vlasenica 43 years later.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And in Ladino and -- would you like to hear a prayer? I have one that is La Bendision Di Madre -- that is, Mother's Benediction -- which you usually sing -- a woman sings as her husband, or her sons, or her sons-in-law, went to the synagogue to pray for her and the whole Mishpacha (ph.), the family. So she's thanking God for giving her children to continue. So she sings in this very -- I mean, the style is very Bosnia, because the language -- yes, it's 15th Century, Castillian (ph.). We know that. Today it's a mixture of many languages. Because wherever they settled, they picked up the words from that country, because they forgot the real Castillian Spanish. So the Ladino that we know today has a lot of Turkish words, has a lot of Slavish words, Italian -- like nona, in real Spanish language, is abuella. So nona is Italian. And we all called our grandmothers nona. And the thythms have changed. They adopted the rhythms of the region where they settled. So the Ladino, as we know today, is a mixture of rhythms from different countries and many words that were added to the real -- so she is thanking to God for giving her children.</p><p> Padre Santo</p><p> En Esta Klara I Solemna Ora</p><p> Ke Esto Despuesta Para</p><p> Bendizir A Miz Fizos</p><p> Segun El Dezeo De Madre</p><p> Ke Konsiento</p><p> Se, O Djo Siempre Pronto</p><p> A Eskucar De Loz Alto Sielos</p><p> Mi Orasion I Bendision Ke Jo</p><p> Bendigo A Miz Fizos</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A lot of sense of humor. She had sense of humor, and she was very generous. On Friday, every Friday, at 2:00, we all had to come home from school. At 2:00, she had all the baskets ready. She called it "la tsedaka," (ph.) the good deed. And she would have prepared food for the poor. And we, the children, would deliver the baskets of food. And she would always say. . "Don't wait that they should tell you thank you." . <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 7 "You are lucky that you can give." That is what ties us to nona.</p><p> On Saturday morning, all the daughters las fijas, las nietas, the granddaughters, the daughter-in-laws -- they would all come "a besar le mano de nona", to kiss her hand, and wish her Bueno Shabbat, a good sabbath. And she would be sitting there with her , the little hat, that is -- hat covering that all the Sephardic women wore. And her pockets were always full of the , the candy. In the afternoon, the men would come -- all afternoon to study the Torah with the grandfather. He was a very important man in that household. He was the king. I mean, to have him -- if you don't feel good, if my nonu (ph.) would come, and just put his hand on your forehead you'd feel better. That's so much power, see, of a family leader. So the whole afternoon, they would be reading and studying. Toward the evening, my nona, as I remember -- for years, she always had , a headache. So she <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8</p><p> have written all the holiday songs. Thinking of this wonderful family, wonderful aunts, and going from house to house -- that that this is what childhood was all about to me that tied me to this little town that I could not -- I mean, Zagreb-- the big-city life could never make it up to me, you know. I missed this closeness of the Mishpacha a lot. She used to sing songs like, oh, from -- not only religious songs -- but she was full of long stories, like 20, 25, verses. And evenings -- how were evenings spent? I mean, no television, no radio. You sang and you tell stories. All her stories were told cappella singing, real old Bosnian style. One of the songs that she really was good at, because we loved it -- it was a song of a slave whose name was Andeletto (ph.). And Andeletto was a slave who the Queen was in love with. And, actually, the Queen had two sons with Andeletto, and she had two sons with the King too. So she's singing to Andeletto, "Mi Andeletto," "My Andeletto, I love you more than the King and his Kingdom. And your sons are always in my arms. And sons of the King have gold and horses."</p><p> Andeletto, Mi Andeletto</p><p> Mi que (ph.) ditu en amourado I(ph.)</p><p> Mi que ditu (ph.) en amourado</p><p> Mas de kill (ph.) y mas diamour (ph.)</p><p> Que le de e con amourado I</p><p> Que le de e con surdanadu (ph.) And this goes for 25 verses. But this was her style of telling stories. So naturally, once I left this nona, the life was never the same.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was terrible. I knew that was my mom. But I had no closeness only because of the not being able to know about who Samuel Poppel was. I was not part of her life. There must have been something closed, where I did not fit, I guess, at that time in her life, see? And I think that was the reason of being far away, one from the other. She gave me all of the beautiful things. I have really benefited out of things she gave me in Zagreb. I mean, I'm a musician today, I go do aerobics like everybody else, and I play golf, and I do many things, because she opened the world to me, see? If I would have lived in Vlasenica, I would just do what nona told me, and I would teach my child, and just go on. So I benefited a lot from her culturally. But I didn't get the love that a child needs from a mother, see? It was very foreign. The whole life in Zagreb was foreign for me at the beginning.</p></p></dialogue>

And she ended up in a nursing home because she developed -- she had arteriolar sclerosis. He had strokes. They were young and they were very old. They were hurt and they suffered all the time. They both ended up in a Hebrew home. She would not let him go alone. He had to go. I mean, he was really, completely paralyzed. But she would not let him go alone. She wanted to go to.

And she spoke to him only in the language that she wanted to get away from. She went right back to it. That was tough. It was tough to see, see?</p><p> The meantime, when I did go back to Vlasenica, my cousin there -- I had a cousin -- actually, we will go back and forth a little bit, until we come sort of in the middle. She was the last survivor of the Altarac family in Vlasenica, the only Jewish girl in Vlasenica. And, uh, she lived in her father's house, my mother's brother, Layzo (ph.), and she was a professor in a local high school. And when my husband -- my husband said, "Okay, we'll go," I said, "Let's go and spend our Rosh Hashana with her. So we went to Vlasenica and -- to my Uncle Layzo's house -- she had a friend, Soyanovanovich (ph.), who was the Vlasenica newspaper -- was a journalist. He knew what I came for. He knew what I was searching for. He also made his business to research, a little bit, the Jewish Bosnian community, of Altarac. So he said to me, "Flory, I will meet you tomorrow and we will cover the whole Vlasenica." He was there 9:00 in the morning with his camera. And naturally, we went from house to house.</p><p>But I've seen these houses before, when I went with my children.</p><p> Something else I was searching for. I was looking for the roses in the windows of my aunts.</p><p>Carnations-- They loved flowers. I went to the cemetery.

So we -- finally, he said, "Well, I don't have a car. But we'll take a little trip. It's about six to seven kilometers from Vlasenica." And we rented a -- there were two taxis in all of Vlasenica. We took one, which unfortunately broke down half way. So we walked up. It was quite a walk up. And we stopped at a farm, and he called the farmer out. He had his wife there, and the cow, and the -- real farm look -- and he said, "Could we go down to the valley. I would like to show them the place." And the farmer in his little Bosnian accent said " s"""Why not? Go." <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 Jew had gold, which was not the truth. They had stores-- were ordinary people. Store in front. The family works in the back, or upstairs. Every-day living, nobody had gold. After they dug all the backyards women had to dig, they took all the women, and their nonas, and the grandchildren, to the same barn where the men were closed, and they had a great reunion, not seeing each other for a long time. Father hugged son. The son hugged his son.</p><p>And after they had this happiness for a moment, then they killed each one of them, separate, one in front of the other one, and through them in this big, big hole, a mass funeral.</p><p> Can you imagine a father seeing his son being beaten in the head, and the grandchildren being beaten, half alive, thrown in a hole? It's hard to believe that one human can do this to another human. And today, you see the same things being done, this mass grave. I don't know if it's a Balkan mentality, or -- it is -- again, I said, like the last time, when my father met us, there are no words that I can use. Maybe, I don't know enough of these words, that I could really give you the picture. But that is the end of the Altarac family from Vlasenica.</p><p> Now, one member, my mother's brother, Layzo (ph.), the night before he loosened a board and ran away. And when he saw what happened to his family the next night, he ended up as a lunatic himself, never forgot this. Even after the war, he tried to marry, he had a little girl, Berta (ph.), Berta Altarac, like his mother. But he never survived this. He finally went to Israel and died. He couldn't live with it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. This is a story. I would not say an Auschwitz story. I don't have a number. This is an experience of a survivor. And all of us have a different story. Each one of these stories are filled with a lot of pain -- and as we find out -- the kind of a pain that does not leave you. I mean, you can be busy, and you can do all of these beautiful things, but it's there. So to carry it for as many years as I did, there must have been a reason, okay? And I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish -- of raising an American family. That was very important to me. I didn't want them to be had. Now, some survivors say it's wrong, they should know, they should grow with this. And I would always say, "What for? They'll be old enough. They'll understand later. Then, grow as happy." My family is a very happy family. You should see my daughters. I mean, they take over when they walk in. And when get on that stage -- I mean, they're stage people. My son, too. So all four are very, very -- I mean, a pride and joy to me. So I think, through that, I have accomplished -- I've done right, see? And a time came when it had to come out, that also I'm happy that I've done right and gone back. The timing to me was right. It worked for me. The pain will be always there. I don't think I'll ever get rid of that. I don't think I even want to get rid of it. That's the way it is. This is the reality. I live with it, see.</p><p> But at least I know who I am, where I come from, what happened, and why am I what I am today. People come see me on the stage.

As you see, they're dressed very much like the Muslims. But she already has her head covering, because she's a bride. And from that day on, she will be wearing a that you see on your right-hand side. And this is maybe, let's say, 1938. This is the last picture of nona. She's older. They are dressed in the modern clothes of today. But they had never abandoned the and that my grandfather is wearing. <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 their instruments -- which I'm so upset and so sorry. But my mother, Rosa, has her guitar, the one to the left -- actually, to the right from where I'm sitting -- and her sister, Luna (ph.), has her guitar. As I said before, they were known as the singing Altarac family. There's my mother, Rosa. Always very pretty.</p><p> Now, this is my mother, Rosa, with her brother Layzo. I think this was taken right before she left, after she married Mikaiel Cabeelio. They were very, very close. And the way that history brings things together, they were the only two survivors. Can you believe that? The only two survivors of the whole Altarac family.</p><p> And this is Mikaiel Cabeelio. He's handsome, isn't he? He's blonde, has blue eyes, blonde hair, not as usual Sephardic men looked. They were more on a dark side. This one was very, very handsome.</p><p> This is one of the streets in Zagreb. We are actually going to the kazaliste, to the theater.</p><p>One of the afternoon outings that was in our program almost every week. These were my very dear friends. and . Who knows where they are? Who knows if they're alive? <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3</p><p> This is it. This is my friend harmonica. She has survived it all, she traveled, and she is right here in my music room.</p><p> Now, the picture next to it is -- it's her sister. This is not the little Honer, because I have gone to a bigger accordion. But I'm still doing the same thing, I'm walking around, playing, playing mostly to nursing homes, and playing the songs of our people, from their country.</p><p>And I would usually ask them always, "What country do you come from?". And if it's an Italian lady, I would play some Italian music. For a Polish lady, I would do a polka. So she is still with me. And I love her.</p><p> This is Corsila, a beautiful, beautiful island. As you see, the piece of blue water in front, that's where the ships would dock daily. And we would all stand there and wait to get any kind of news, anything; that is, what's going around the world. Also from there, we took that tugboat at night and -- when we ran away toward Italy. Also, the children -- if you see that whole island -- we'd swim around it all day, every day. And it's a beautiful place to go, even for a vacation, today. It brings bad memories to me. But it's a beautiful place.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

All of my students were a little older. But this was the butcher's daughter and the baker's daughter.</p><p>And that's where my meat and bread and olive oil came from. So they were really very important people in my life. And this harmonica, actually, is not mine, because my father went to the City of Split to change for a bigger one. So this one is borrowed. But these are my students on the isle of Corsila.</p><p> Well, this was June 24th, 1945, the wedding day. Take a look at that Sergeant Jagoda. Isn't he a handsome man? The wedding was really first class America from the cake to the hamburgers to my dress made out of parachute. I mean, everything was just first class. And I love this picture.</p><p> Well, this is the farmer who started talking to us and telling us the story of the stormy night.</p><p>And we are standing, actually, on the spot where he was telling us that that is where my family is, both of these places. And this is where we were standing, just frozen. This is really when I heard the whole story about the Altarac family. And the little tree -- that's where they are. One day, I hope to be able to go back and put something there, a stone, a music lesson, anything that is sort of connected with this Altarac family who gave me so much and left so much behind.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It brings a lot of memories, a lot of pain, actually. This was issued to every Jewish person in Zagreb -- and I'm sure in many other cities -- and you would not ever leave the house without the badge. Because, God forbid, if they catch you without it, you are really in jail. So miraculously, it just traveled with me. I would make sure that this goes with me, plus my nona's bag with family pictures, and the little gold piece that you will see very soon.</p><p> There it is. This is the locket that she gave me after I left Vlasenica -- and "Keep it with you anywhere you go" -- and I sure did. It's very old. It's broken up. But it's very, very dear to me.</p><p> , keys from Spain. Most of the Sephardic communities know the legend of the key. <span class="page-break" number="37"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6</p><p> This is my Uncle Layzo's watch. Actually, my grandfather gave it to him for his good grades in school, when Vlasenica had all that trouble and all the Jews were taken to that forest mountain. After that -- the reason, I guess, that the City was such in silence -- everybody had something -- because all of a sudden, 15 families -- all their houses were empty.</p><p>Somebody had to have all these things that were in their houses. My Uncle Layzo, after coming to Vlasenica, looked, searched, all over the place for something to remember his family. He found nothing. Finally, he went to Sarajevo. In one of the pawn shops, he bought this watch. And this watch -- his father gave to him. And in fact, when you open it, you can see his handwriting, "To my son, Layzo, for the good grades in school." Education was always very important.</p><p> Again, a story of -- this, Berta gave me the first time I went to visit. One of the neighbors was dying. And she called Berta and she wanted to give her something. It was on her conscience. And she gave her this buckle that belonged to the Altarac family. As you see in the middle, it's a Magen David, and it was worn by one of my uncles, or -- I don't know whom -- but it belonged to the Altarac family. It bothered the lady a lot. So she gave it to Berta.</p><p> You know, a very talented musician of Sephardic music -- the group is called the Voice of</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He called one day. He said, "Flory, I would like to commission you to write a song for my group." And he gave me two words, "You return what you find." Well, what did I think of about? I thought about going back to Vlasenica, and "What am I looking for, the houses?". And this is what <span class="page-break" number="38"></span> </p></p></dialogue>
