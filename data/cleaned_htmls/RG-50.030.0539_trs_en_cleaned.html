<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Professor Saul Merin, on April 19", 2009. We are very, very pleased that you have agreed to come and speak with us today. The interview is about your life story, and we" ll start, as we always do, at the beginning. Can you tell us some details about your birth, about your family, about the world that you were born into?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And, thank you very much. I-I was born in a township, what they called shtetl, the small towns where most Jewish people lived in Eastern Europe. This township was called Bendzin. It had a-- between 50 and 60,000 people -- population. And it was similar to so many other places like this. It was in southwest Poland, very close to the German border, of more than maybe five miles.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was it a contested territory with Germany?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, it was, always they were fighting about it. It was in Silesia, Silesia.</p><p>Schilesia in -- in German. And the Germans thought that this is their country. The Poles thought that this is their country. Before the war, all of Lower Silesia was next to Germany, and Upper Silesia, most of it belonged to Germany. A small part rem-remained Polish.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Saul Merin , April 19, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In Bendzin, was it a multi-cultural town? Were there Germans living there, and Poles living there and Jews living there?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That's right, but really, the majority were Jewish people, in the town itself.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How large was --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: About 60 percent. About 60 percent of the people living in Bendzin were -- were Jewish people. And they -- their language mostly was Jewish.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yiddish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Was Yiddish. While a -- in addition, they learned Polish, and knew Polish, but Yiddish was the major language. And there were people who lived there and spoke German.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We spoke Yiddish. And -- at home, it was Yiddish. I knew, of course, very well, Polish. And I knew a little of German, not much. But I learned German during the war, and after the war, as a child.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how is it -- how was the town's structure in social classes, for example?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Were -- were Jews in a certain merchant class, or a certain class and Poles in another and Germans in another? How was that split up?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> Interview with Saul Merin deg April 19, 2009</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The whole town was poor. Poverty was probably the characteristic finding in town. Poverty among all classes. It was among Germans and among -- among Poles, and among the Jewish people. The -- the poverty was manifested by -- by the houses, which were terrible dwellings. Many of them, there were no washrooms in the house, they have to go out to the courtyard. Sometimes this was seen even in -- in houses which had four floors, and 20 - 30 families lived there. They had to go down and -- life was not easy, not nice. Jewish people lived there probably for longer than many other places, because in Bendzin there was a castle, which was built by King Casimir. Casimir, or Kazimierz in Polish. Kazimierz the Great. He was the Polish king in the 14" century who united Poland. This is why they called him the Great.</p><p>After he united it, usually by fighting, okay, in combat --</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. This was -- a-and he -- he really thought -- he ruled over Poland. This was unusual in Poland, because Poland was -- the noblemen rule -- ruled the country, not the king. But he was strong; he was the one who ruled at that time, in the 14" century, must have been about 1345. He invited the Jews of Germany to come over and live in Poland.

The Jews heard it and they just couldn't come at a better time for the Poles, and for the Jews, cause this was the time after the plague, after the plague, disease, the plague epidemic, the Black Plague. While the Germans, which -- which maybe -- nobody knows how much, but it probably was not less than a quarter of the -- of European population who perished at that time from the disease, from the epidemic, and they possibly wa -- it came up from 50 percent a -- of the jew -- of the European population. The plague was brought by an Italian ship from the east, from somewhere in the east.

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Saul Merin deg April 19, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: This was just 600 years --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- from that time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and I'm wondering whether -- whether these were stories and this was history that you grew up with in a -- in order to explain how the Jews came to Bendzin, or is this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- information that you learned later, history that you learned later?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, it was -- no, I th--I think I knew about it already as a child. I knew about it, because it's very important for the life of Jewish people in Bendzin. You see, when the plague broke out, the Germans accused the Jews, that they brought in the plague, that they caused the plague, they caused the death of at least one-quarter of the European population, and thousands of Jews were massacred as a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Result.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- result of this. And when he invited the Jews to come, tens of thousands left Germany into Poland. Poland, til then, had one small community in Kalish(ph), a town more to the north [indecipherable].

This wa -- this was what we knew about it. This was one of the oldest -- because Jews settled near the king they loved. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is the other point I wanted to bring up, th -- and again, excuse me for interrupting, but it sounds from what you're saying, is that there are traces of a Polish patriot in you, in your telling, because of -- now, I could be wrong, I'm -- this is why I'm testing this out, because it sounds like the story was a favorable story to Poland, that it was a refuge, that it was a country where one could live. It was a country that offered survival and reprieve. And the reason I -- I -- I bring this up is that just recently there was a Professor Polonsky who was the chair of Judaic studies at Brandeis, gave a presentation where he said, until World War 2, many Jews believed that about Poland.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Many Jews believed that about where they lived. And so that's why I'm asking you, is that --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- is there something to this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> Interview with Saul Merin " April 19, 2009</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Lagree fully with this. Many Jews believe that they are -- they are Jewish, but they -- that the Poles can be depended upon, and we should live with the Poles.</p><p>Th-This happened at the time of Tadeusz Kosciuszko, when Berek Yoselevich(ph), a Jew from Warsaw, from the other side of Warsaw, Fraha -- Fraga(ph). He put up a battalion that fought in the mutiny of Kosciuszko, as a separate battalion under -- under the order of -- of yos -- of Berek Yoselevich(ph), Berek Yoselovich. And Poles that remember this, will find his name anywhere oret -- of how he fought. He fell in -- in combat. He died in combat. But he dus --anyhow, in-- in Bendzin, most Jews went to Krakow. Krakow was the place where the king lived, and they put up a town near Krakow and called it Kazimierz, which is this still today, after the king. But in this place, the castle which he built, on the shores of a river, he -- this town was built, Bendzin, and Jews lived there, I think for centuries. I lived in the place where I was born, and I lived on the street corner called the Street of the Castle. And I could throw a stone and hit the castle, it was in the same --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was that close?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was very close, yes. It was on the same street.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you live di-- were you born into one of those houses that had four stories high, and a courtyard below?</p></p></dialogue>

For there were three, like buildings around a courtyard, and I lived on the third floor in one of them, on the -- the site where there was no building like this, there was a small building of three stores only, or what do -- what -- shops in the lower floor, and then two floors of apartments, which belonged to my grandfather.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So, it was extended family who lived together?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's turn a little bit to your own family, within this context, within this community and within this history. When were you born? What was the date of your birth?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: My father was Itzhak, Itzhak, and he belonged to the family Merin, that lived in this place, at least documented, I know, 200 years.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a long time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, 200 -- 1820, I could see the name of Merin written down in the Jewish community, where they had the list of all newborns, you know, and saw his name, the name Merin came back -- back several times.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And your mother's name?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In this -- in Bendzin, if there was such poverty, what did people do to make their -- earn their living? How did they earn their living?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think it was lot different from other places in Poland. They lived there as owners of small shops. This was -- my father had a small shop given to him by his father, by my grandfather. And he became very religious, and -- and my mother was really running it. And I --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What did you sell? What --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They were selling all kinds of -- they called it galanteria in Polish.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah, hats.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's right. So this was one owners, shop owners. Then there were various professions, like tailors and [indecipherable] and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you think that that would have been your future, had there been no war, that you would have taken over the shop?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, that's a difficult question. I was too young to -- to even -- to think about it. I believe my father would like me to go to the yeshiva and become a rabbi, or like this, but it will -- there was no chance for it, I would never agree to it. Already as a child five year old, I knew that that will not be my way.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's interesting that at age five --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. At the age of three, I was sent to a chayder, so I learned with all these ren -- religious way, I learned from the age of three. I hated. This I remember well. I did not like it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why? What -- what is in your memory?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I didn't like the attitude of the rabbi. The rabbi was the teacher over there [indecipherable] on many occasion he would hit you with a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Ruler?</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Saul Merin " April 19, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --a ruler, you know, which he had there, in his hand. A -- and I hated it. And I did not like the way they were learning it, you know, to repeat after the rabbi what he said, and this was the way of learning. I didn't like it. This I know very well.</p><p>And on any occasion I had, I wou -- I run away from them.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Well, three years old is a very young -- for a small child to be so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, I probably started to run away at the age of four or so, after one year there.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p>Not at the beginning, but already at the age of four I was definitely running away.</p><p>My --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Did you get in trouble from this?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well, I tried to -- not to let my parents know about it. But my mother would certainly support me if I would -- if she would know, she would say, well, let him do what he likes. And my father wouldn't forgive me, no way. And so --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: That's kind of tough on a little child.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. But, it was -- my friend was the -- there was a man who lived in the same house, he had a cart and a horse to carry things. And he became -- we became very good friends, and he tried to take me always when he was going to work, and I was with him on the cart there, going like this. The other people -- so there there were all these professions, there were -- was a bakery, and people worked in the bakery.</p><p>There was a mikveh, and a synagogue, a shul, where they -- and so many people are  <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Saul Merin 6 April 19, 2009 -- were all in this. The most -- the most common, I would say, and the most Jewish profession -- you probably don't know it, but the most Jewish profession at that time, my opinion, was porters.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Really?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes. These people were taking things on their shoulders and carry them from -- they were Jewish, almost exclusively Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Like loaders, people who would take heavy sacks on their shoulders and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, heavy loads and these were Jewish. Almost exclusively. We knew it --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you explain it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, th-the problem was that the Poles didn't like Jews, and you know, if we liked King Kazimierz, there were not many like him. And he -- he -- he was exceptional. And the Poles tried to make, for Jews, life difficult. And one of things they did was not to -- too much to work with them. Now, if you were a doctor, if you were a --a tailor, and you were good at it, and really they came to you, most Jews and Poles, and -- and they worked with you, because it was good for them to do it. But if you didn't have any education, if you didn't have any professional education, you were not a tailor, you were not a [indecipherable] you didn't learn anything, then the only thing that was left for you was to work as a porter.</p></p></dialogue>

I knew -- I knew children of the porters who were my age. I remember them. They had the very difficult time.</p><p>Their income was low. They hardly could have shoes to walk around with them.</p><p>And I-- I'm not sure how mu -- what they were doing about it, you know, and certainly their parents, uneducated. They couldn't do anything else, except this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there mandatory schooling for children, all children?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No. Schooling is another interesting fact about the place, because there was one secondary school, one high school, and the one high school was -- my father learned in it. Was called Yavener(ph) at the time, and the language of teaching was Hebrew. This was the only secondary school, high school in town. So the Poles --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So the Poles didn't have their own?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: There was no education --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I--I'm not sure they have now, but they didn't have at that time.

And before we do that, I'd like to get a sense of what your family was like, what memories do you have of your family, of your sister, of your mother. You know, some people report that their pre-war lives were pretty idyllic, and that they grew up in warm, happy families. Some report that it wasn't quite so, and their relations were more, how shall I say? Complicated. How would you describe your own?</p></p></dialogue>

They would eat more bread if they would be given. But they knew that in another 10 days, Pesach comes, Passover. And then they will eat as much as they want. Or another holiday, or the Sabbath. Was no way, even the poorest people, that on the Sabbath they would not -- the whole family would not sit down and eat, really as one should. You know, no way. They would be ashamed of it.

Did you hear anything from what was going on down the street?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It was a noise there. We heard that it's burning. I heard them talking about it, that they burned down the synagogue. We didn't think that this happens with the people inside. And there were s-some survivors from it, succeeded to run away, and they went to a nearby church. And the priest of the church really hid them, he was hiding them.

You know, there was nothing going on. Well, here and there some, I would say, things not on the level of the whole town. Like, for instance, I learned at home. I never went to school. And in 1940, my parents brought a Jewish young woman, was teaching me Polish. How to write, how to read, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Is she the one who taught you history?

And I asked my parents what happened, they didn't want to tell me. And then I heard that, one day a talk between them, and one of them saying that her parents are accusing my parents about what happened. And then I understood what happened. When she left our house after teaching me, she went back to her home. She had to cross a lawn which was on the way, quite a large lawn, and when she went through it a German soldier went by and just shot her, killed her on the way. I-I -- I remember, when I heard this, I was shocked by it. First time in my life that I really started to understand what's going on with the Germans in that time. All schools were of course closed, and there was no way, even religious schools, like I learned in the chayder, so I could like, continue, up to a certain time when the -- the rabbi was taken to Auschwitz. And I start in another place and the rabbi also was taken away a short time later, and there was no way to learn. I started my school only a-after the war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened with your mother's galanteria? Obviously, even before the war, it must have suffered. Did you have Polish customers before the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: One -- and, yes, undoubtedly, most customers were Polish.

But my grandfather rented it  <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> Interview with Saul Merin " April 19, 2009</p><p> for -- to -- to him, and he -- he m -- he was bankrupt. And this was the way they lived until the war broke out in -- at the end of 1939, beginning of 1940, we were informed that the house of my grandfather is [indecipherable] too much into the street. And so they had to leave it in 24 hours, and they demolished it, the German -- not the Germans, but the people who worked for them, and -- including the Jewish.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that meant that in this -- was this house owned by your grandfa-father? In other words, it was his asset, it was his property?</p></p></dialogue>

And the truth is that I think they -- they were clever to do it, not to tell me anything, because it certainly frightened me, there's no doubt about this. But they knew what's going on in my head, you know. They knew that I live a -- in an imaginary world. And all this just kind of doesn't belong to me, and they knew it. And I remember my father saying to me, we're going down to try to open the sukkah. The sukkah for -- a sukkah. And they said to me, you know, and I was trying to explain to him, because there -- there were several things he couldn't do.</p><p>He was not allowed to go at [indecipherable] outside, he had to put it in this -- which is not according to the religious laws and the -- there's several things, also with the sukkah, he couldn't put this way, he had to put it in another way, and he said that's not the way it should be done, it should be -- and then he looked at me and he said, you know, I envy you. It's good to be a child at this time. You know, when -- he knew I am living in an imaginary world, which is not the world of [indecipherable] during the war. And I think this was the way, really, you could keep yourself normally.</p></p></dialogue>

Deportation was Auschwitz. Auschwitz was not more than about an hour by train from our place. And so, at that time, we learned something. And we learned this, that they -- they are taking away larger families, because it's easier for them. If they have to take, they come over in there to bring a thousand Jews, they take larger families, then they do it quicker and it's for them much easier. We survived this because what happened is that a Jewish policeman was there, they were helping the -- the Germans. And they were policemen of the Judenrat. And the Jewish policeman was a distant relative of ours. So he said, you don't take -- stay here. Went out and locked the outer lock on the door. So it was clear to everybody who came over there, there is nobody inside, they left already and locked the door.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: A-And -- yes, I do remember it, very well.

Now, they changed the law, and the rules, and now you have to come yourself and be there. Takes half a day. I didn't have time for it. So I was angry about it, well, you cannot do anything. I came over there, it was four months ago. And I come in there and they -- I was waiting with the others, and I come to a large hall where I've seen people waiting, they said, this takes the most time.

It cannot be that this is happening. It's really -- it's a pity that he is saying things like this, which are not true, he's frightening everybody. This was the attitude. There were a few people like him, but they didn't believe it. I think that this is probably the basis for not doing more to defend themselves, of the Jews, because it seemed so unreal, so impossible, that anybody, any country, they may not like Jews, but th -- they -- nobody would think about it, that there may be an [indecipherable] arrangement of -- of massacre of Jews.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We moved into the ghetto end of "42, and the main problem there was starvation, the -- we didn't have enough to eat.</p></p></dialogue>

Now, there were -- it was impossible, because they put heavy guards around the ghetto. It was impossible to leave. We went down into what we called the bunker. The bunker, many families arranged some way out, to escape, because, if it was not the Judenrein and they were coming and taking, then they took anybody whom they found. They -- they didn't look too much for it, but yes. So we went down into the bunker, and the bunker was a very good one.

Very difficult, nobody could really -- when you open the cupboard, you wouldn't see anything. So we went down. This was prepared for exactly such a case. It was prepared for four people. In a short time we found ourselves with 16 other people, and you couldn't say anything, I mean, all our family came, cause they knew that our bunker is the best.

So, we -- we stayed there and came back to [indecipherable]. When -- already in 1945, we understood that our parents will not come back. You know, at the beginning, the first few months, e-every -- everybody who knocking on the door, maybe they are coming back, or one of them is coming back. But towards April or May, it was clear that nobody would come back. In fact, I tried to find out what happened with them. I went to Auschwitz, cause that time I was 11, I went to Auschwitz with my cousin, tried to look there over this, the only thing I could find is in -- in the gas chambers that was written the kemar(ph) -- revenge, which they have written with their blood.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they were on to Berlin?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they went on. This was the south, I believe, to Berlin, where Zhukov and his army was more to the north.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's right, that's right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: This was a southern army that moved out. The Poles didn't behave too well after the war, you know. I remember first time that I really went out, to the square of the city center, pole -- position where a man stood at one of the windows and gave a speech about new Poland, and the communist Poland. They called it the socialist party, and the socialist Poland. And they said that the Russian promised that if they will behave really like true communists, they will change the name of the party from the socialist part of Poland to the communist party of Poland. Very like today that they say that. And I was standing there listening to him, together with thousands of Poles, when the woman said to me, you are Jewish? I said yes. She said, how do you survive? So I told her, a Polish woman helped us. She said oh God, she said, oh God. And a boy much older than I was, you know, heard it from [indecipherable] what Jew, you are a Jew? Ga -- gave me a fist in my head, in my face. And you know, to me, then I understood that they don't like us too much.

Nobody wanted to take me, when he understood that I am Jewish, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's an awful lot for an 11 year old to have to look at, to deal with -- 12 year old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yeah. It was not nice. You know, at that time it was really -- later on -- I went to Poland again. I left in 1949 for Israel, when -- when it was allowed, when the Polish government allowed the people to go out to Israel, only to Israel. But many years later I've been in Poland, just like eight or 10 years ago. So now they accepted me, now in a different way, because I came, they knew at the time a professor of ophthalmology and I immediately also invited a Polish ophthalmologist to come to Israel and I will help him for a couple of weeks to see the country, but maybe to learn about ophthalmology in Israel. And they were very happy about it.</p><p>Made a dinner for me and so this was very nice. And I tried to think all the time, is there still anti-Semitism in Poland? And you know what? It changed completely. It became ridiculous. It's not that there is no anti-Semitism, but it's an anti-Semitism of -- of a ridiculous sort. You could only laugh at it, you know? I remember my -- a --a cousin of mine in Israel went to the town, to Bendzin, and he took pictures, video pictures, he had a--a team which [indecipherable] for him. And then he  <span class="page-break" number="62"></span> ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Saul Merin degdeg April 19, 2009 asked people, he went to the school. The school exists, but it's not called Furstenberg.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened to Furstenberg?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Fursten(ph) was killed by the Germans, like anybody else. It was -- you know, they didn't kill people because they were poor or rich, they killed people because they were Jewish. He was Jewish, that was enough. He spoke at the school. They asked him to speak, which -- so he spoke with them, and si -- before I start my talk, who knows what was the name of the school before the war? Not one of them knew. Said, did you hear the name of Furstenberg? Not one of them knew. So he told them the history of the school and about. Then he went into a place that looked very similar to our house. So it's three buildings around a large courtyard. It was in another part of the city. I knew that there were two places like this. Ours was destroyed later, cause they put the -- a road there. They built a road there. And the other place, he went there. And in both places there were Jewish -- there only Jewish people living. And he went around, first in the main street of the city and asked people, remember the Jews who lived here? Nobody know. He went into this house, where only Jews lived, in all of the three buildings. And when they came out and they were standing around him, and he says to them, remember the Jews who lived here? Not one. You look at the people, he took pictures. Old people that certainly  <span class="page-break" number="63"></span> </p><p> 67 Interview with Saul Merin April 19, 2009 lived there, you know, in the second World War. Nobody remembers. Then a dog passed by, and he looks at the dog, and the woman sticks out her head from one of the windows and calls, Aaron, Aaron. So he says to her, that's the name of the dog? She says yes. Why Aaron? So she says, Aaron, that's so that we remember the Jews who lived here. This was the first time that he found somebody who remembered the Jews, you know, through the dog. This is ridiculous. That's not the same anti-Semitism that frightened my parents and the Jews before the war, or even after the war, in the first years after the war. It -- it was just same like before the war, in Kielce, the pogrom in Kielce where more than 40 Jews were killed in 1946.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you explain that? How do you explain it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You know, I'm not sure that I tried to think even about it. It certainly changed, there's no -- today, it stopped at -- it's something on a personal level, it's not -- certainly not that [indecipherable] of a country.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you feel when you were -- when you were meeting with people, and they had this dinner, that there was a lack of sincerity? That there was a lack of understanding, of genuineness, that somehow or other you couldn't trust what it was that you were seeing?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That they could not trust?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, that you could not.</p></p></dialogue>

That -- that I couldn't trust everything that was said to me. You know, after I invited the ophthalmologist, I got maybe three or four calls from the mayors of the townships of -- which belonged to this area, and they were all at the dinner, five mayors, cause these were the places where Jews -- Jewish people lived around, including Sztemaszitsa(ph), the -- the village of my mother. And after I left, and I left the invitation for one of the [indecipherable] from Dombrowa, one of the fi -- five townships. I got later maybe three or four calls from the mayors. Look, maybe you take them for three weeks instead of two weeks. And another one calls me, maybe you know, I have somebody else who may be better, maybe we'll take two ones, you know. [indecipherable] the Poles, one must understand it. I don't know if you read the book, it was Michener, was [indecipherable] Poland.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No, but I heard of it, I know of it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know, when you read it, you -- you read the history of a tragedy. The Poles suffered always, from the beginning. The Jews suffered more, but it was a tragedy for the Poles, what was going on there. The Swedes attacked them, I think it was the 17 century, 17" or 18", I believe 17" century, and massacred the Poles. You know, they killed thousands, thousands of Poles. And if it wasn't the Swedes, then it was the Russians or the Germans, the Prussians, you know, all of the time. They  <span class="page-break" number="65"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Saul Merin degdeg April 19, 2009 suffered a lot. And on the -- on the personal level, they suffered from the system, it was a feudal system. Why are there so many Polish jokes, the Polack jokes in -- in -- in the United States, you know, because they came when the [indecipherable] was -- was annihilated at the beginning of the 20" century, after the second World War, the end of the second World War, suddenly they could trave -- they could g -- and many of them traveled to the United States, they had relatives here or so -- they came over here, most of them settled in Chicago, and it's not only they didn't know English, cause Ukraines also didn't know English when they came over, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You're talking probably the first World War, yes?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, first war.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: First World War, mm-hm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Did I say second? No, first World War. And the Ukraines when they came over, they also didn't know English. They didn't know English, but they didn't know anything, they were uneducated. They didn't know to read and to write, most of them. It -- and -- because in the feudal system they couldn't go to school without permission to go to school was not given by the noblemen. [indecipherable] want the educated people here, I need workers here. And so, they [indecipherable] people like this, I think, always start trying to find the scapegoat. The scapegoat for that -- you know, it was a good feeling that there is somebody who is inferior to  <span class="page-break" number="66"></span> </p><p> 70 Interview with Saul Merin April 19, 2009 them. And for this they have to show that the Jews are inferior. And if they can kill the Jews, or you know, curse them or show their inferiority, then it gives them the superiority complex. I think that's the main reason for [indecipherable] anti- Semitism. That's it. I--</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Thank you.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --I have five minutes more? No.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: You know, if I divide my history, my story into four periods, the fourth period was different. That's th -- that's the time when I came to Israel, and for the first time in my life I felt like equal with equals. There was no problem any more. I knew that when I go to school, I will not be chased up like in the Polish school where I remember very well. In mathematics, I'm very good in mathematics. I knew it, there was no doubt about it. But always I was given a very low --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Grade.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- grade. And I couldn't understand it in that -- in the last class when I was, I knew that I can get a grade which will not be enough to pass into the next class.</p></p></dialogue>

A young woman, anti-Semitic.</p><p>One day she came, and she said, whoever will -- I'm giving here some exercises to do. Whoever will finish it the first will get a very good grade. A grade of very good.</p><p>And she was -- I knew, that's mine. I filled it out for it, I came much before the second one, to give it to her. And she didn't take it, she was sitting there, she didn't take it, she waited. Then another boy came after me, and she took his. I said, I was the first. No, no, he was the first. What can I do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Of course not.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And this happen -- on the same day she gave another exercise and another exercise, and in all of them I was the first one of the whole class, by far, you know.</p><p>And then she had no choice, so she gave me good, but not very good. She couldn't -- you know, all this changed, of course. In Israel I was even. And maybe that's the best. I went to school of medicine, became a doctor, became an ophthalmologist, professor of ophthalmology, so I could devote a lot to teaching. I became a professor also here at the University of Illinois, where from time to time I have been there and I work there. And in [indecipherable] I did many things for humanity, I would say, you know. Like I went to Africa to work two years, with my family.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In what country?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Malawi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Malawi.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Malawi is southeast. And then I came back maybe 10 times to Africa, each time for periods of between three months to one month. And I liked it. It's only mi -- maybe five years ago when I went back to Rwanda to operate, to operate people.</p><p>And so there are, at least, 2,000 Africans who are walking around, who are walking around there seeing, just because I operated them, you know? So it gives you a good feeling. Maybe that's the -- the revenge on the Nazis -- Nazis. They not only didn't succeed to kill you, but also they couldn't prevent me, you know, doing things for --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Others.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- humanity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes. They didn't take away your humanity.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. Didn't stop me from doing it. I'm in the last nine years. I am in -- a doctor, a specialist in Saint John Eye Hospital, which is an eye hospital in eastern Jerusalem that serves the Arab population of the West Bank and Gaza. Mainly it  <span class="page-break" number="69"></span> </p><p> 73 Interview with Saul Merin April 19, 2009 serves the Arab population of Jerusalem, but also of all the complicated cases are sent over to me. So I see there a lot of complicated cases from the West Bank and from Gaza as well. And I continue with this, I like it, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you -- do you have more interaction beyond -- beyond being a doctor to them?</p><p>Is there any way of -- of --I don't even know how to put the question. Do your Palestinian patients get to know you, do you get to know them in some ways?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, they know me and they like me, I've no doubt about it. You cannot get through a certain level. A couple -- also because of different attitude and different way of thinking, you know? It was maybe three or four months ago, where I gave an injection into the eye of an Arab patient. It's a thing which I do a lot, I give at least 10 injections every week. That's the modern, new way to treat some eye diseases. And I gave him this injection. And he stands up and says, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. After four or five times I say to my nurse, look, he knows two words in English, thank and you. So tell him to speak Arabic, and you'll translate for me. So she said all right. And he say something in Arabic, and she translates it to me. He wants to bless you. And he wants to tell you -- to wish that you will have four wives. So, you know, this was -- so it is a different way of thinking.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Professor Merin, the last question I have before we end, unless there is something else that you would like to add to what we have talked about, is that my impression is that you didn't -- you didn't have a chance to really be a child, except in very stolen moments, when you were growing up. That you had to grow up and be pretty strong, very early on. That's my impression. Is that true?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That's certainly very true. I -- in fact, the only thing that -- the only thing that I behaved like a child is the place in -- in -- in the hiding place, there, wa -- how I played with my sister. And this was all about imaginary things with the -- we put up.</p><p>So this was one and a half years that we played around with this, lucky, because I think that allowed me to live normally, almost, at least from th-the -- the point of view of my soul, you know, about -- which was a chil -- child's soul at that time, you know, at the -- this was only one and a half years, just at the time when it was the worst time for me. You know, li-living without my parents, living in a place like this, in a closed place like this, and living on very poor food. Just in that time, I think I felt a child at that time. Just playing around with all this, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: In -- in these circumstances --  <span class="page-break" number="71"></span> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Saul Merin * April 19, 2009</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: --I think this was lucky, yes, this was lucky. I think it happened also with the other children, who survived at that time, that they -- they survived because they played the imaginary plays, you know? And this kept them alive.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: When you had your own children, did you play with them more because -- because of that? Did you -- did -- was there anything from this entire history that showed up when your children were the same ages that you --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I never -- I never made such decisions, but yes, the truth is that it was like this.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>You know, you are all the time -- I was already a doctor. I -- I married when I was a student, and I was a doctor when I had children already. And in Africa when they came to -- with me to Africa, and there was not a night, unless I was busy in the hospital in the evening, was not a now -- a night that I didn't sit down with them for half an hour at least, and tell them a story. All imaginary stories, you know. But they still remember it day -- today. My son here, well, I think he told to his children already, some of the stories I was telling them at the time.
