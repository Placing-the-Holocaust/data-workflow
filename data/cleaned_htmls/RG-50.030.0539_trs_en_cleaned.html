I-I was born in a township, what they called shtetl, the small towns where most Jewish people lived in Eastern Europe. This township was called Bendzin. It had a-- between 50 and 60,000 people -- population. And it was similar to so many other places like this. It was in southwest Poland, very close to the German border, of more than maybe five miles.</p></p></dialogue>

Poverty was probably the characteristic finding in town. Poverty among all classes. It was among Germans and among -- among Poles, and among the Jewish people. The -- the poverty was manifested by -- by the houses, which were terrible dwellings. Many of them, there were no washrooms in the house, they have to go out to the courtyard. Sometimes this was seen even in -- in houses which had four floors, and 20 - 30 families lived there. They had to go down and -- life was not easy, not nice. Jewish people lived there probably for longer than many other places, because in Bendzin there was a castle, which was built by King Casimir. Casimir, or Kazimierz in Polish. Kazimierz the Great. He was the Polish king in the 14" century who united Poland. This is why they called him the Great.</p><p>After he united it, usually by fighting, okay, in combat --</p></p></dialogue>

This was unusual in Poland, because Poland was -- the noblemen rule -- ruled the country, not the king. But he was strong; he was the one who ruled at that time, in the 14" century, must have been about 1345. He invited the Jews of Germany to come over and live in Poland.

The Jews heard it and they just couldn't come at a better time for the Poles, and for the Jews, cause this was the time after the plague, after the plague, disease, the plague epidemic, the Black Plague.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And -- and I'm wondering whether -- whether these were stories and this was history that you grew up with in a -- in order to explain how the Jews came to Bendzin, or is this --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: -- information that you learned later, history that you learned later?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, it was -- no, I th--I think I knew about it already as a child. I knew about it, because it's very important for the life of Jewish people in Bendzin. You see, when the plague broke out, the Germans accused the Jews, that they brought in the plague, that they caused the plague, they caused the death of at least one-quarter of the European population, and thousands of Jews were massacred as a --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Result.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- result of this.

This wa -- this was what we knew about it. This was one of the oldest -- because Jews settled near the king they loved. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This is the other point I wanted to bring up, th -- and again, excuse me for interrupting, but it sounds from what you're saying, is that there are traces of a Polish patriot in you, in your telling, because of -- now, I could be wrong, I'm -- this is why I'm testing this out, because it sounds like the story was a favorable story to Poland, that it was a refuge, that it was a country where one could live. It was a country that offered survival and reprieve. And the reason I -- I -- I bring this up is that just recently there was a Professor Polonsky who was the chair of Judaic studies at Brandeis, gave a presentation where he said, until World War 2, many Jews believed that about Poland.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Many Jews believed that about where they lived.

Many Jews believe that they are -- they are Jewish, but they -- that the Poles can be depended upon, and we should live with the Poles.</p><p>Th-This happened at the time of Tadeusz Kosciuszko, when Berek Yoselevich(ph), a Jew from Warsaw, from the other side of Warsaw, Fraha -- Fraga(ph). He put up a battalion that fought in the mutiny of Kosciuszko, as a separate battalion under -- under the order of -- of yos -- of Berek Yoselevich(ph), Berek Yoselovich. And Poles that remember this, will find his name anywhere oret -- of how he fought. He fell in -- in combat. He died in combat. But he dus --anyhow, in-- in Bendzin, most Jews went to Krakow. Krakow was the place where the king lived, and they put up a town near Krakow and called it Kazimierz, which is this still today, after the king. But in this place, the castle which he built, on the shores of a river, he -- this town was built, Bendzin, and Jews lived there, I think for centuries. I lived in the place where I was born, and I lived on the street corner called the Street of the Castle. And I could throw a stone and hit the castle, it was in the same --</p></p></dialogue>

For there were three, like buildings around a courtyard, and I lived on the third floor in one of them, on the -- the site where there was no building like this, there was a small building of three stores only, or what do -- what -- shops in the lower floor, and then two floors of apartments, which belonged to my grandfather.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, th-the problem was that the Poles didn't like Jews, and you know, if we liked King Kazimierz, there were not many like him. And he -- he -- he was exceptional. And the Poles tried to make, for Jews, life difficult. And one of things they did was not to -- too much to work with them. Now, if you were a doctor, if you were a --a tailor, and you were good at it, and really they came to you, most Jews and Poles, and -- and they worked with you, because it was good for them to do it. But if you didn't have any education, if you didn't have any professional education, you were not a tailor, you were not a [indecipherable] you didn't learn anything, then the only thing that was left for you was to work as a porter.</p></p></dialogue>

Deportation was Auschwitz. Auschwitz was not more than about an hour by train from our place. And so, at that time, we learned something. And we learned this, that they -- they are taking away larger families, because it's easier for them. If they have to take, they come over in there to bring a thousand Jews, they take larger families, then they do it quicker and it's for them much easier. We survived this because what happened is that a Jewish policeman was there, they were helping the -- the Germans. And they were policemen of the Judenrat. And the Jewish policeman was a distant relative of ours. So he said, you don't take -- stay here. Went out and locked the outer lock on the door.

They called it the socialist party, and the socialist Poland. And they said that the Russian promised that if they will behave really like true communists, they will change the name of the party from the socialist part of Poland to the communist party of Poland. Very like today that they say that. And I was standing there listening to him, together with thousands of Poles, when the woman said to me, you are Jewish? I said yes. She said, how do you survive? So I told her, a Polish woman helped us. She said oh God, she said, oh God. And a boy much older than I was, you know, heard it from [indecipherable] what Jew, you are a Jew?

I left in 1949 for Israel, when -- when it was allowed, when the Polish government allowed the people to go out to Israel, only to Israel. But many years later I've been in Poland, just like eight or 10 years ago. So now they accepted me, now in a different way, because I came, they knew at the time a professor of ophthalmology and I immediately also invited a Polish ophthalmologist to come to Israel and I will help him for a couple of weeks to see the country, but maybe to learn about ophthalmology in Israel. And they were very happy about it.</p><p>Made a dinner for me and so this was very nice. And I tried to think all the time, is there still anti-Semitism in Poland? And you know what? It changed completely. It became ridiculous. It's not that there is no anti-Semitism, but it's an anti-Semitism of -- of a ridiculous sort. You could only laugh at it, you know?

They asked him to speak, which -- so he spoke with them, and si -- before I start my talk, who knows what was the name of the school before the war? Not one of them knew. Said, did you hear the name of Furstenberg? Not one of them knew. So he told them the history of the school and about. Then he went into a place that looked very similar to our house. So it's three buildings around a large courtyard. It was in another part of the city. I knew that there were two places like this. Ours was destroyed later, cause they put the -- a road there. They built a road there. And the other place, he went there. And in both places there were Jewish -- there only Jewish people living. And he went around, first in the main street of the city and asked people, remember the Jews who lived here? Nobody know.

She says yes. Why Aaron? So she says, Aaron, that's so that we remember the Jews who lived here. This was the first time that he found somebody who remembered the Jews, you know, through the dog. This is ridiculous. That's not the same anti-Semitism that frightened my parents and the Jews before the war, or even after the war, in the first years after the war. It -- it was just same like before the war, in Kielce, the pogrom in Kielce where more than 40 Jews were killed in 1946.</p></p></dialogue>
