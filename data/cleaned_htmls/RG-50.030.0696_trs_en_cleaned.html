I'd like to know where you saw him when you were in Russia.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, Isaw God everywhere. I could have get killed and He did help me. I went out and for every event I was the highest of them all. In the cohouse(ph), in there, the head of the cohouse(ph) didn't know how to write. Whoever came there, they came to me and I had to give hima thing. So there in the woods I was also one of the bestcutters there and Iwas respected. So that what it was. Why?</p><p>Because He help me. I'll tell you something, when God _ -- I don't know, but always I did believe in God. Especially when they say it was one God, one God.

Did you ever hear of Abraham and Sarah?Sarah, when she was young, she couldn't have any children. She was crying and begging. But when she was 90-years old, when she could not have children, then God gave herthat she had one son, Yitzchok. So Yitzchok was the creation. Because by 90 years she couldn't have it. He was a creation. Now, what happened to Yitzchok? After being 37 years old God told Abraham to take Yitzchok and give to God as aqurban. You know what means a qurban?</p></p></dialogue>

Abraham did not believe that God wanted to killhim. So what then he</p><p> saw that nothing around. He lift up this knife and said to God, "Now you have</p><p> him." God stopped him and said, "No, I don't want him to be killed." He didn't</p><p> say, "Don't touch your son," but "Don't touch this boy." Why? Because as a son</p><p> you gave him to me, so he's my son and to you he's just a boy.Do you</p><p> understand? So what did God do? He gave him -- he gave him a animal, a kosher</p><p> animal. There -- this animal couldn't walk any farther because _ stopped it. And he</p><p> took Avram and killed the animal. He gave it to God instead Yitzchok, and</p><p> Yitzchok was already God's son.
