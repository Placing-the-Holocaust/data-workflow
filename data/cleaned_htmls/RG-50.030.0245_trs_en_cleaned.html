<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh can you tell me uh how your life changed once the Germans came to uh to Poland?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, uh change uh dramatically because uh I want to go to school and I couldn't go to school, so uh I study at home and I study uh with uh professor uh private privately because uh German uh take out, uh throw out professor from university, from Krackow, from __ and uh send some to concentration camp and some sent to our place and uh we have to uh take care of them. Was two professor in my father's place, so we have to give them food and uh shelter, cause there was all this two men, so I have an advantage that they teach me uh during uh 1939 and during "40, because I was prepare for uh higher education, so they teach me. Then after the the German take them anyway in 1940. And there was uh first few months when German take over, was uh was quiet. Uh they put, posted all over be calm, go back to work, uh everything be OK. Then then uh everybody have to go register, have to have an have an ID card. Then after that the German advertising, uh 19...beginning of 1940, they advertising to work in Germany. Mass uh advertising that they needed...they say they have a good pay and so so but nobody want to go. Only people work in the Tarnow wherever there was industry, in the Tarnow...in some...the German opened the industry and make the people was before, but other people, they have no no work. There was no any other care uh only go to Germany to work, no other living. So some people go to underground to 5 <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> and against the German...1940. But there was uh not...they was organized but it was hard because it was a cold winter and uh and uh German was powerful, have a motorized car and and motorcycle and go all over, so people escape. Go to woods and uh and that way survive. Uh and the farmer would feed them but uh that was 1940. Then they start arresting uh people. First uh they put in the city hall all the name, because they have it from ID cards, they have the name who you are and they wanted so many people uh report and go to Germany to work who have no way to live to go, uh to go by themselves.</p><p>They go register because they have no way to live, like in the city have no no food or nothing so so they go...some people went and went to Germany to work. But not so many, so after they start arresting on the street uh just...Gestapo have uh on truck a dozen. Then the car stop on any of the street. Two two trucks, uh pick-up truck when it was with the Gestapo...one on the beginning of the street, on another. Stop the traffic and take all the people on the street. Uh young young young most of them...they look for them that be work for...and they put on the truck and sent to uh sent where there were examination and they sent to Germany to work for uh slave labor, forced labor labor camp in Germany, and during uh this uh 1940, the occupation, uh we have a flier that was come from England or uh or through underground all situation how is work German are and uh the people organize underground a a campaign against German, and uh all the...because a printing shop was all closed when the German take over, put people do by by uh called small, hand...uh by hand printed, so and uh we have a message what's going on from already the underground who already have. Then they print some note and we give a message to people, but if uh if they catch you, German, then uh then you sometime they kill you on the spot or send you...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you personally involved or were any of your brothers or your your your parents involved in with what the partisans were doing or in handing out these leaflets?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh yes, my brother was involved in the Tarnow and I don't...still don't know how he got involved because there was always was secret and even never told me where he get it, how he get it...just told...he give me a few uh bundle of them and uh take down to to down where...and give people at the church, on on the village or wherever wherever he sent me, but I was uh...he give me a basket. There was a bundle of of the leaflets in a small basket like a fruit basket and on the top is hay and I put rabbits, and that's how I transport uh message, because if...excuse me...(pause)...uh that way I transferred the message in the basket with rabbits because when the when the Germans stop me on the...always was a patrol on the street...when they stop me, they look the rabbits and kick me and and I just hold it that they don't fall out...it was tight...because they don't like the rabbit. That way I went through and I was always dressed ragged uh there be...there be no suspicion that I something, you know. Also that way uh in another city, like in Tarnow, there was short on food. There was ration of food and so we, from the farm, we bring to my brother food that way uh just on the bicycle or I walk with the basket...put bread and uh salt pork and uh butter...also same way. Uh have a big basket, put on the bottom and put hay on the top and rabbits on the top, because if you have open and and uh German look uh they'll take it, so uh we transferred the food uh to to my brother and uh my <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> brother live in Tarnow, two of them. Neighbor was Jew, people where he was before work, before war he was work with them...also that they was still make the dress uh but for the store also, but the the Jew was uh persecuting and uh and uh buying...they can't go out. They have to have a a Star of David uh on their uh clothes and uh in Tarnow...that's beginning of 1940 and "41, so 1940. And uh my brother helped them uh with the with the food, because he also...my brother come, two of them, they come uh to my father and they transport the food to to town. Many time uh when they have a bigger amount, like potatoes or something, when uh when they got to the house, the German uh Gestapo spotted and uh they got beaten because they they know the Jew was live over there next door, so my bro...I was beaten a couple of times too, because they they saw me come out from the building where Jew was and uh somehow they know it and say are you a Jew. I say no, I have ID. So so uh they kick me, say what you do over there, you know. I say nothing, you know. Uh I I want buy some thread because I always had some little item for excuse what I what I was doing, because if you have nothing uh then then you're suspicious, so I have a little thread or some small item that uh to or even button, you know, because they have a store or or no...only small item, so that way uh that way I go away with this partisan you know...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Can you tell me what happened next to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, then...that was 1940. I was twice arrested on the street because uh many time when I saw what's going on I...when uh was arresting...we we can see how they stop so I know which which way to run away to one one house and go outside on another street, but uh twice the the block so tight I cannot escape so I was arrested, put on the on the truck...usually the Gestapo. The Gestapo was special uh German police. They have a...on the front...they black uniform some and some they are grey uh and have a big under like a SS underneath, under Polish sign...special po...police. They have the power to kill you on the spot. You can do nothing, so uh they put on the truck, a pick-up truck, uh how many they can fitted...young people, then they go to the railway station...that was not far...and put on the wagon uh wherever was wagon. Usually was uh cattle but they usually...they don't do uh no more they usually do for concentration camp. They put on...they call third- class wagon, and lock personal (ph) and uh about a hundred people and then uh train go to Krackow and over there also we have to walk with the Gestapo to check point. Check point in the Krackow was in a big school because all school was closed. There was no no teaching during the occupation. Only...they only allowed first grade, first couple grades of public school and not not high school. There was...high school was empty. They using for transportation checkpoint, so there was hundred people and with no room to sleep or nothing. They will stand up in in each hall or class and uh have a kitchen, so they have something to eat, and they go through examination...doctor, German doctor examine each one and if alright go to next room and uh shave close all, everything, uh arm and all over, and uh put back clothes, get in and go another room and put on a train again. Another trip, you know, twenty or a hundred...it depends how many they selected and sent to Germany to work. So twice I was arrested. Twice I was...once I was shaved uh but he say you no have no...you have clean hair so you'll be alright...the barber said. Then I escaped <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> twice in Krackow because there was so many people so I was able to escape and my brother would know it and help me. He know what happened in Tarnow so he went uh and he helped me, so I come back home, but uh third time there was uh...it was so strictly uh tight uh guards I couldn't escape and uh then uh they send me to with other about twenty all just men...young all, not...well, healthy men...about twenty, to...uh all we traveled on the train all through Germany to a place named Hanover (ph) _ and uh we landing in a in a place they called . It was industry, uh German industry that <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> window and you get little bread. And you eat this and after one hour you're hungry and you have nothing in the morning. In the morning you get coffee, but the coffee was made of hickory, sour like uh...something how. And lunch time nothing, only the evening.</p><p>That's what uh that's what it was, day after day and uh uh the food was from beginning was a little bit more but uh 1943, "44, "45 was they cut the bread ration so was very, very hungry. Uh all the time...hunger is the worst thing for a human being.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did uh...now you say worked six days a week. What would you do on the seventh day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Uh Sunday...uh sometime we have to work Sunday, but usually it was in uh we stay in the barrack. We clean. We clean up the uh...sometime...it's a big washroom, so we wash clothes. Uh but there was no no detergent, so they don't clean the _, so...because we get uh only three months we get some clothes, like like underwear. Not regular like normal people. Just some funny uh special-make for us. You know, they would...because we wouldn't escape and go outside the camp. Beside that, when I get...uh everyone, when we get to Germany, we have a a the company take so many guys, you know, people uh men or woman, separate woman uh men separate, and every Pole like me they give us a little cloth like two, three inch square with name P and you have to put on the right uh side of your jacket, jacket and on the shirt and you have to sew yourself and you have to have all the time. If you don't have this, you get beaten very uh very strong and this was P for marked for Polish and I was one of the two million Polish citizens that was taken by force to Germany to forced labor camp and uh was all over in Germany, our people was stay over there work. Like me...I was...happened that I land in a construction company, what I say before. Uh now they call worker. <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Uh, well uh in uh when we was working, there was so many uh people, Poles and other nationality, Italian, French, and the...we don't talk much because uh German was like bosses and watchmen...was few watchmen with uh with weapons that you don't escape, and uh we we just have...we can't talk uh much. If you talk right away they see you and uh you get you get hit, so uh we we just have to uh work. We talk to each other very low...we we talked...we Polish...yeah, but not not hear, the German hear. And they always uh they watch us what we do good job and if we do something wrong, then you get uh you get very bad beaten with the shovel or with the rifle. Sometime...uh one day I have to bring uh cement from uh uh train...the two guy take it, a bag of cement and put on your shoulder and you go to the to storage. You have to run. Uh when it was rained, it was mess. Then if the bag of cement break then you get beaten, so...it is not your fault but you have to be careful, so they they was very strictly about uh sabotage. We couldn't do sabotage in in Germany, because uh even if you try, it cost your life and was not in Poland it was...yeah, it was different. It was organized and it was underground but here was uh constantly watched by by Germans.</p></p></dialogue>
