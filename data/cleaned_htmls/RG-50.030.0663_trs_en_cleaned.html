Not dollars, but marks. Whatever that means at that particular time, it's still a lot of money. Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go to school there?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did I what?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you go to school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Did I go to school there? Absolutely. I went to first the normal -- what they call it, the -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Elementary school.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- elementary school for four years. We were only boys, which was the norm over there. We were approximately 45 young boys. And I stayed there for four years. Now, in Germany, if you don't want to go to high school, you don't have to, but you have to go eight years for public school. My father and mother thought I should get a better education, so at the fifth grade, which would be here, I started my first year of high school. High school in Germany was six years. So when I graduated high school, and I must say I was the only Jewish boy in the whole town who graduated high school because the other ones were all taken out of the high school before because of Hitler. But I lived on the other side of the track. Not only that, I might as well get this straight, there's no sense lying about it. My mother was a converted Jew. My father went into the war in 1914, "14 to "18, World War I. He has a business already. And my mother was his top sales girl and they also fell in love. When he was in the service, she went to the rabbi -- and I have the papers home -- and took Hebrew lessons and converted Judaism. Now, this I mention because it -- later on, it comes out that that gave my father and mother a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Hamberg 6 tremendous plus because she was in Hitler's sight an Aryan no matter what the religion was. Just like the opposite side, if you were Jewish and converted to Christianity and Hitler came, you were a Jew no matter what. So that's where we were. And in high school, our high school happened to be the same school that Chancellor Kohl went to, who was the Reich's chancellor. My claim to fame. And we were 50 boys. I was the only Jewish boy in the whole high school.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So did you have non-Jewish friends in high school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, if you want to know the truth, in my class we had about 10 or 11 -- I'm not sure anymore, I think it was 10 -- 10 fellows who were like the gang.</p><p>When I say gang, it's not like a gang here. We did all kinds of stupid things like, you know, if it was a real hot day and we wanted to get the afternoon off, we put a fire underneath the baskets in the school yard. Was made out of metal, you know, so they said, "Get home, alright." And I was one of them. I was never called upon to be anything different but a student and a buddy. In my class of 50 students, I had no enemy but one, if you want to call itan enemy. There was one fellow in the class, I remember blond hair and glasses, he looked like a real future priest. I mean, you know, that holiness about him. And ever so often, he would say, "I hate you, Eric, I hate you." I says, "Why do you hate me?" "Because you killed my Jesus." I said, "Hans, I didn't kill your Jesus.</p><p>That happened thousands of years ago." "Your people killed my Jesus and you're a Jew, so you killed my Jesus." Naturally, this is all in German. You want to hear it in German?</p><p>No.</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> Interview with Eric J. Hamberg 7</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I finally got sick and tired of him and I said, "Look, Hans." I said, "You want to make a fight out of it? I'll fight you." I'm a little guy. I was only about four -- four -- 5'2". I grew up a little more later on. And he says, "No, I don't want to fight you, but you killed my Jesus." It came to a point where I asked my Hebrew schoolteacher, who also was the cantor of our organi- -- of our temple, "What am I going to do with this kid?" He says, "Well, just tell him Jesus Christ was a Jew." I was floored. I was stunned. I had no idea. And I went to Hebrew school since I was six years old. I says, "Are you sure?" He says, "Absolutely." So the next time I was told, Eric, I hate you because you killed my Jesus, I says, "Do you hate all the Jews?" He says, "Yes." I said, "Then you must hate Jesus Christ." "What are you saying?" I says, "Jesus Christ was a Jew." "You're out of your mind."I says, "Go and ask your father, your priest or anybody you want." That was the last time I heard from him. This was just a little episode that I like to tell because it was, to me, very satisfying to find out that Jesus Christ was a Jew.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Certainly.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I graduated there in 1937. Hitler came into power in "33. And my other friends -- I had a lot of Jewish friends from the temple. We used to go to temple in the morning.</p><p>And then in the afternoon, the children would come and we have like a children's service which I used to lead quite often.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How -- was your family observant?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We had a kosher household, but we were not orthodox. We had milchig and fleishig, pieces of cutlery. And we had for Pesach special things. And milchig and fleishig was separate. As a matter of fact, I always pointed out we had an ice box. At that time there's This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We had a double ice box for milchig and fleishig. You understand milchig and fleishig, yes? Thank you.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> [Laughter]</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. And used to put blocks of ice underneath into, and that kept it cold. But I don't -- it had -- I don't know anybody else that had the combination of these two different things. Our -- what shall I say, when -- when you -- when you dry the dishes, your hand - - hand things, blue was for milchig and red was for fleishig. So, I mean, we kept all this, but we were not orthodox.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let me continue. The other children, yeah, Jewish children -- Ludwigshafen, my home town, was cut in half by the railroad. The railroad was only one block of the apartment house where we lived in. The other apartment house that my father owned had 16 apartments. They were smaller apartments. And it was also the apartment where the ground floor, my father's store was located. It was a big store. Yeah. The other part of the children lived on the other side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: My father supplied a factory, which was located in my home town, and is called -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: IG Farben?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A-- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: IG Farben?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, no, no.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Hamberg 9 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: No, BASF?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, yeah.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: BASF.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik, BASF. Have it here in the United States, all over the place. Allright. Tremendous place. And what they specialized in was colors, dyes, and any kind of liquid medication. And my father supplied the uniforms. This factory is probably half the size of my town of Union where I live. It was like a city. We -- I was once there and they took us for a ride around. Took us four hours. And so he -- he made good money.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your family have non-Jewish friends as well in the area?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Those nine kids in the gang were all my friends.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But did your parents have non-Jewish friends? Family friends?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Not many, no, no, no, no. Very few. My father was a very generous man. We had a lot of people coming from Poland, Jewish people. And they came to my father and they said, "Can you give us some of your clothes that you sell here and give us a little discount and then we can go and peddle it and charge like three or four marks," you know. And my father said, "I'll help you." And he did. And they paid him slow but sure, but then when Hitler came, he lost thousands and thousands of dollars.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you remember --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: But --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sorry. Go ahead.</p></p></dialogue>

It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> Interview with Eric J. Hamberg 10</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah. While I was the only one on my side, there was others in the school before me, but not since I went to high school. Except one time my cousin came to live with us for a year, so he went to the same school. But otherwise, I was the only Jewish boy. Talking about non-Jewish friends, when we graduated in the high school, we wore for six years caps with a brim. Not like here. They were more like military caps. And in the first year, they were red. Red. And there was a band around it and it was red and green and white. In the second year, it was the same red cap, but it was red and blue and white.</p><p>Okay? Third and fourth years, the caps became green, also with a change of things. And in the fifth year, it was blue with it. When you graduated, for one day only you got a white cap. Halleluiah. We made it. All right? And what you did on that day that you -- after you had your white hat, you got a cane, you know, like a heavier cane like the men used to do. And you wore your white cap and you marched through town. And I marched through town with nine of my gang friends. And we came to a, what shall I say, like a bar, like a -- well, a drink, drink place, you know.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Pub. Pub.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: A pub, sort of like it, but you could get food there too. And on the pub, on the outside, it says Juden nicht erwunscht. "Jews are not wanted here."So they said, "Come on, let's go. We're going to drink a little bit." I was never a drinker. I says, "I don't want to go in there because they don't want me." "What do you mean? This?" They ripped it off the wall. "You go on." So I went. And when we were chugalugging, you know, somebody says, "Eric, come on, you and me." Well, I was -- I was half soused by the time I got out of there and I never -- never was a drinker. It was ridiculous. So then they said, "All</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We had a beautiful big movies house. UFA, I remember. United -- it wouldn't be united. Whatever. And they said, "Okay, we going to see the movie." I says, "I can't go." "Why? It doesn't say anything." I said, "I don't have money." So this was in 1937. So they said, "Okay, okay, so you don't go, it's okay." I says, "At least go there and buy some tickets." So they gave me money and they said, "That's just enough for all the tickets. All right?" And I get up the money to go there.</p><p>She gave me ten tickets. They paid for me to go with them. This was my gang. I can't say anything else. They were all my friends to the day that I came back to Germany years and years later. They announced in the local paper that three Jewish people -- one was a woman, myself, and another fellow who happened to be my best friend, but he lived on the other side of the track. And I have to think. One second.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When you went back, these same --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was announced in the paper that I was coming. When we landed there, we were invited by the mayor of the town. It's a pretty big town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Now, actually, I want to, if you don't mind, hold this story until later on because I wanted -- I want to hold this story until later in the interview.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Because I want to jump back to 1933.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Just so we can stay in chrono- -- in chronological order. And I want to hear that later on. But do you remember when Hitler came to power in 1933?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> ontectnstonancedjusietneey for ther biormatoerabouttfisenecion</p><p> Interview with Eric J. Hamberg 12</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And what was the mood in your community at that point in --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very happy, because if you weren't happy, you could have been dead. I mean, Hitler came to power by -- I mean, he started really way before that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Uh-huh.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But by that time, you saw practically every day the stormtroopers marching through town with the flags and with their sabers on their side. Not sabers exactly, only a -- a knife like that. And we were on one of the main streets in town, so we saw it all.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And, wait, one minute.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And I remember that -- I think it was in 1933 that he used, like the chancellor, we had at that time a man in power in Germany, was an ex-general. He was still a general, but only by name, Hindenburg, von Hindenburg. All right. Von Hindenburg was more or less forced to appoint him, but he had to be put into power by the people. And everybody knew you better vote for Hitler because if you vote against them, they'll know. You may think you fold the paper and put it in, they'll know. Well, he was elected 99 percent of the people. And after that, things slowly began to change. They started the Hitler Youth, all with uniforms and the bars across and very nice uniforms. At the end of my stay in high school, every one of my student friends, including my gang friends, were in the Hitler Youth. Didn't affect anybody, not even me. And then the girls started coming along, which was called BDM. BDM. Stands for Bund Deutsche Matrone. Organization of German girls. And then it came around, you know, like the edict, the boys and the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Hamberg 13 girls, they can go to camp together and they can sleep together because we want to have pure Aryan people coming around and having children. And then the communists slowly but surely were either killed off or sent to concentration camps. I remember coming home from school and there was a big sign on one of the walls. And it must have had about 60 pictures of dead Nazis, only they weren't called Nazis. All these people were killed by the communists. It was really -- I mean, you looked at this, and if you weren't German for Hitler, your blood started to boil. You know, the faces were all smashed in and all kinds of things. Now, the concentration camp of Dachau, which is in Bavaria, near Munich, at first the only people in there were communists and Jews. Not Jews because they were Jewish, but Jews because they were also communists or against Hitler. In 1937 when I graduated high school, Hitler at that time was in a position where I knew and my father knew and every Jewish person knew that there was going to be a war because you had to save everything that had metal. Like toothpaste came in a metal, you know, thing.</p><p>You squeezed it out and you had to put it on the side. Anything that contained metal you had to save and you had to turn it in. By "37, my mother sent me to the headquarters. I had to turn in all the gold and silver we had. By "37, I realized I'd better get out of Germany fast. I was 16 years old. And what am I going to do? So I was advised by the Jewish people and the offices there to learn a trade. Naturally, I was supposed to take over my father's store, would have been a wonderful thing, but that was out. Already the SA men were standing in front of the store. Don't buy from the Jew. Nobody was let in.</p><p>So my father had to close up.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p>My brother was buried in a cemetery in Ludwigshafen. In the regular cemetery, the Jewish people had a special section. It had a gate. You could either get a key to go and see your beloved one who was buried there or you could ask somebody, the office. And I knew exactly where my brother was buried. And my mother -- and in Germany, if you go to a cemetery, every grave is a display garden. If you've never seen it, you just stand there, oh, my God. Planted -- naturally, it's -- I'm talking about summertime. Planted with the most gorgeous flowers and little bushes and everything else. Pictures of -- of beauty, really. And my mother one day -- and we used to go there like once a month or every other -- every other week or something. And she says, "I bought some flowers yesterday." She says, "Eric, please take it to Werner." My brother was Werner. "Take it to the cemetery and plant them." I said, "Okay, Ma." I took my little package with the flowers over into the cemetery, I planted the flowers and I'm coming back. Now, the street that I'm usually taking to coming back was full of people. Wasn't there when I went down there. I says, "What's going on?" "Hitler's coming. Hitler's coming." I says, "Oh, my God. What I am going to do? Am I going to run backwards? Forwards?"

Suspenders?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: -- suspenders and this across with an edelweiss on here, you know. I had blue eyes, I had blond hair. I was a typical German boy you want to see. And I'm trying to squeeze there -- this was like six deep, and a motorcade was coming. I just stood there and I looked around. Then somebody saw me and somebody said, "Wait a minute, you stay right here." I says, "Oh, my God. What they going to do me now?" And he said, "Hey, send somebody back here for that kid, he'll be able to see Hitler." An SA man came back and put me on his shoulder, took me to the front line. And I'm sitting there and everybody's hollering, "Heil Hitler, heil Hitler.". And my father taught me when that happens, anytime at all, say, "Freie leiter, freie leiter." It sounds almost the same, but it means free leaders, you know. I'm hollering there, "heil -- freie leiter, freie leiter, freie leiter." And all I kept thinking is if somebody across the street sees me sitting on top of - - top of that man in his SA uniform, this little Jewish boy, they're going to tear me apart.</p><p>But then I said I'm having a good time. So finally, they let me out. I went home, I told my mother, she almost died. But nothing happened. But it was very funny in the end.</p></p></dialogue>

And two persons came, two men came in. They are journalists for the local paper. And they said to our professor, who by the way spoke very funny. We always used to imitate him. They said, "You know, what are you guys doing here?" So we told them. He says, I'm professor so- and-so from the realschule in Ludwigshafen and we came here to see the museum and, you know, spend a little time here. He says, "Wonderful." He says, "Now, I got a -- I got something for you," he says. "We are having in our local paper a competition, you might say, the most Aryan looking boy."

Hamberg 17 like I said, that's across the river, the Rhein River. Mannheim has about 300,000 people.</p><p>Well, almost twice as big as my home town. And there we had, you know, Jewish organizations. And they advised me, we had two things in the town where you could learn a trade, all put together by a Jewish -- what do you say? Not a firm, not a company, but organization like you here, something. And one was to be a locksmith, which didn't really interest me. And the other one was furniture making. Now, that already was something I could have done because even as a child, I was artistic. I used to draw, I used to paint. Nothing important, but, I mean, you know, it was usually quite good. And I said if I make furniture, I could make some fancy things on there and all this sort of thing. That might work out. Then I heard that the only Jewish restaurant in town was looking for a cook apprentice. I always used to watch my mother in the kitchen, and at that time watching meant a lot of things, like pulling the feathers out of chicken. You don't know from that. You do? And then you open up the back and you go in and you take everything out, including the eggs, which are not born yet. It was fun. You don't like that? I loved it. My mother made cookies, you know, and I used to stamp the different forms out. When my father caught me, I'd get a smack. "Boys don't belong in the kitchen." Okay. So when that came up, I said to my mother, "I'm going to try for this, you know, the cooking thing." My father said, "Well, go ahead." I mean, you know, this could be my life or death. I went over there and I met the man and the woman. Their name was Schloss (ph).</p></p></dialogue>

I didn't know -- I didn't know how yet, but, I mean, I felt if I got out, because at that time already there was a quota system from America for German Jews. And you had to apply at the consulate in Frankfurt to go to America, but you had to wait till your number was called. My sister they registered right away, and she left about a year and a - - almost a year before I did. Now, my number was 13,000 something. I should know that by heart, but I don't. And when my -- I had relatives in the -- in America. They weren't relatives like you might say. My father had three brothers and one sister. Four boys.</p><p>They were all in the German army. I got a picture home, the four of them lined up, you should see them. Mustache every one of them, you know. And two of the brothers had married two sisters. And the sisters had brothers. One was in America quite early. He was a chemist. And he got a job here in America. He was a doctor of chemistry, working for Houten Company. Does that name mean anything to you? Is it Houten?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Chocolates, yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Houten, yeah. Houten made chocolates. And they usually had peppermint patties covered with chocolate. Now, at that time if you made that and you put chocolate over it, it would crumble, it wouldn't stay. He found a chemical process where the chocolate and the peppermint would stay together and keep for God knows how long. His brother, who was much younger, worked for my father in the store. My father taught him to -- how to be salesman. And then he went to America to his brother. So the relatives they had here after a while were the two other brothers who had married the two sisters of these two boys. You have to make a family tree. And my father told them, he says, "I registered Eric." And they send a telegram, and it says, "Don't be stupid, go get your own number."</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Now, they were -- had -- they used to be very, very good friends, but this was years ago. And I remember the only time they used to be in contact was Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, they used to send a letter, you know, card or something. So he wrote a letter to his friend and he says here's the situation, I have a son, he's now 16 years old, going on 17, which is almost army age, you know, and he's been working as a cook apprentice. Is there anything you can do that maybe somebody over there would hire him or something? Because if you had a job promise by an English company, you had to deposit a hundred pounds with the English government so you wouldn't be a burden to them, and then you would get a German -- from Germany an affidavit. I have the book right here. And so he wrote. He got a letter back from his wife, "Your friend has passed away.

And we -- across the street from we lived, this was already now in Mannheim because once my father lost the store, we had to give up our two apartment houses. They paid him bupkis. And so we moved to Mannheim. We had a small apartment, but it had three bedrooms and that was good.

He says, "We're in a war here. You can't stay in those holes all day." Okay. And then that's -- I asked him, I says, "What are you going to do with us?" I was a PFC, Private First Class. And I said, "Sir, I don't know where we're going to go." "Well, what is going on," he says. "Well," he says, "we don't belong to any company here, not to any battalion, not to any division." He says, "Our people are in Africa. They didn't make the invasion." He says, "You know what." He says, "Go down here." He says, "There's the medical place, you know, where all the wounded are being This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And we said to the doctor or the captain in charge there, he says, "Sir, we're supposed to -- supposed to help you with any way we can." And he says, "Well, who are you? I don't recognize your insignia." I says, "We belong to the 84th Chemical Mortar Battalion, but our outfit is not here." "Where is it?" "In Africa." "Then what are you doing here?" I says, "I don't know, sir." And he says, "Okay." He says, "Why are you here?" I says, "Because we are enemy aliens, we are not citizens." "You are not citizens and you are up here when the shelling is going on?" I says, "That's right, sir." He says, "Well, get the hell out of here." He says, "Take this man" -- he was on a litter, badly wounded -- "and carry him down there, don't come back up." So four of us picked up one litter. We walked about 200 yards and the shelling started again. So we put the litter behind a tree and we were all huddled around and finally it stopped. And when we were ready to pick up that litter and I said to them, I says to guys he ain't going nowhere.</p><p>He was dead, not from the shelling, but he was badly wounded. So we brought him back to the camp and they says, "You got a live one?" I mean, he was trying to be -- you're trying to be funny because, you know, it says -- he says, "Yeah, I got a live one." Then we took a guy -- it took us approximately two and a half hours for the mules to go up that hill. Took us two days to carry this guy down. Was like 200 and some pounds. That's a lot, and if you're holding onto that and then you're going around boulders and all kinds of stuff. So finally we delivered him to the Red Cross station down there. And they said, "That's enough, you're not going up anymore." So then Sicily fell.</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And you just couldn't understand it. Well, we finally found out that in order for you to be a citizen, somebody has to come from America and from the Immigration Department and he has to interrogate you and if he gives the okay, then you are sworn in as a citizen. I says, okay. They took us back to this hill, but before we got to the hill, we're on the boat, right? Now I'm standing on the boat, it's early in the morning about 8 o'clock. We had gotten on the ship around 6 o'clock and I see Sicily, you know, in the distance, very clear, and we got torpedoed. Nothing should come easy.</p><p>This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Hamberg 44 But we were lucky again; it was a liberty ship. You know what a liberty ship is? No. A liberty ship was built by a fellow whose company was Kaiser. He was Kaiser. K-A-I-S-E- R. And he built ships with the middle separate from the back. From the front, I should say. If you get hit in the back, the front stays up. Very clever idea. Saved our lives. We made it back to Africa. Nobody was killed. But we got torpedoed. When we were back in Africa, we were back up on the hill, we were selling prophylactics again and everything else, and then one day he says, today is your day. They took us all to a big tent and there was a screen in between where you couldn't see and hardly hear anything. We were sitting on chairs on the open side. And now we're called Mr. so-and-so, sergeant so, whatever it was, we go in, one guy goes in at a time and we hear talking, but we can't understand anything. And then we hear loud laughter. And this goes on every time somebody goes in. When I went in there, I gave him my name, my serial number, everything. Thirty-two, 5-6-0-9-6-2. Right. And he said, well, he said, I have to go over a few questions here, he says, you were born here, this and this and this. Yes. Do you have any connection with Germany? I said no, my parents are still there, I says, I hope they're alive. And he says now comes the important question. What's the important question? He says, now listen carefully, do you mind fighting against the country of your birth? And I got hysterical, I says, are you kidding me. I already fought against the country of my birth. He says, I know, I know, every time one of you guys comes in, everybody breaks out in laughter. I says, yeah, I don't mind. I don't mind at all. And then I got my citizen papers. My citizen papers say Africa, Iran, everything else. And from there on, I was sent back to my outfit. My outfit in the meantime had made the invasion of Italy.

Hamberg 45 there, but I made the invasion of Anzio. Anzio was a very, very long and bitter battle. It was flat land, all farmers there. They took the farmers away, but luckily they left the animals there. And the Germans were sitting on top of the hill. So when we got there after the invasion, they gave my particular platoon a farmer's house. And we were in the back where the cows used to be. Other parts of the company were in different houses, we were spread out all over this perimeter, and we did nothing but, you know, make sure -- I used to sleep in the manger where the cows eat the grass from. In the meantime, our information, or our officers were such complete idiots, they never even thought about, you made the invasion, now let's see how far you can go. No, they drew a line. We're not gonna go further than this because they're probably sitting on top. But they weren't. They werent sitting there at all. The company, the battalion, or the division actually that made the invasion of Anzio, or a lot of them, they went in, they lost half of their men after a while, because all of a sudden, it started raining. Senator Dole was there. All right, that's where he got that wound there and you know who else was there? Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier. My buddy, because we were supporting the 3rd Division, which they were in. But anyway, we spent three-and-a-half months there. And the only thing good I can tell you is that my outfit ate pigeons, chickens, rabbits, pigs, calf, veal, and cow meat. I killed them one at a time because in the Army, if you're ina place like this, all you get is cans of C-rations or boxes of K-rations. Either one of them, if you live on them for more than a week, you just feel like, it's not worth it. So I cooked.</p><p>And my captain, one night, he couldn't believe it, I made stuffed breast of veal. And I told him, this is a real nice Jewish dish.

He says wait a minute, wait a minute, you're not going anywhere, the only one that can cook. I says, that's right sir, but exactly my background, I want to go to the front. And he was a captain whose</p><p> ancestry comes from Puerto Rico. As a matter of fact, his father was a general and he had gone to West Point, but he still talked, still had a very, very heavy accent. When he said to me, Hamburg, you want to go the front? I said, yes, sir. Okay, I went to the front. I knew what to do with the mortar and I very good with math and when you have a mortar, you have something sitting on the barrel of the mortar and you have sticks there. So you put your mortar side on that one stick in the middle and the man who's at the map will tell you, so many clicks over here, or so many clicks over here depending where the enemy is and I was very good at it. I was there for four weeks and I got a promotion. I never was a corporal. I was a sergeant. And I stayed as a sergeant until almost the end of the war, then I became a platoon leader, I had 50 men under me, and I became a staff sergeant.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. This was after we got out of Anzio and we were going towards Rome. And at one point, we still were getting some German shells coming in, so we moved the trucks, so we had to stop the truck and find someplace to hide. And we found a cave, we were supposed to go over an area that was wide open, but that was like trees and little mountain part here and further down. And in that mountain part, there was a hole, a big, big hole like a big cave and that's where we all went in. My 50 guys. And we had our mortar set up in the open, naturally, you can't shoot through a mountain, and ever so often we would shoot and then we would run back to the cave and then they would shoot back. One of my boys who was also a mortar sergeant got hit. And he got hit in the lung.</p><p>And he was lying there, I didn't know if he was dead or not, but I said to the medical man, the, what do they call them?</p><p>MRS.

Joe Weiler and I became very good friends even in America and Joe, I was at that time, in 1942, I was 21 years old, Joe was 8 years older, so he was 29. We became like real close buddies, I called him Uncle Joe.</p><p>Why did I call him Uncle Joe? He showed me a picture of his niece. She was gorgeous, most gorgeous Jewish girl in America, maybe? So I started writing to her and we corresponded for over two years. And that's how he became Uncle Joe because if I married his niece, he would be my uncle. The sad thing is that on the last day of the war, we were near a lake -- there's three lakes, I always get them mixed up -- MRS. HAMBURG: Garda.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Garda. Lake Garda. The Germans had bombed out the tunnels that went through the mountains near the lake, so we went through there, but we couldn't go far, too far enough, so we had to come back out, we had to take a boat or something, bring our mortars way up there. We finally came to the end of the lake there and they said, okay, set your mortars up out there where the grapevines are and all that. And I had just come back from the hospital because three of our boys were killed in an accident with a Jeep, not from anybody shooting them, and I came back and the rations just came in and it was my job to make these rations for this guys, no, for this group and this group and this</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We always did that, you have something to do, I'll find your mortar, I know where your mortar is. And we did that all the time, whoever was available- a mortar is a mortar. And he went down and I heard an explosion and I knew what it was. He was gone. I ran down, one hole here. And I held him in my arms for about two hours. Uncle Joe.

I mean, when they came in power, like in 1933, when Hitler became in power, what was I, 12 years-old. I still had a wonderful time because I was not harassed by anyone in the school. As a matter of fact, I remember the day that we graduated, I was 16. And when you graduate, the class goes to the director's office. He's the principal of the whole school, high school. And he congratulates everyone separately. All right? You're standing there, yeah? So-and-so good, good, good, and he came to me and he said, in German, Hamburger, fur Juden, bist es so Schleicht.

But they say here in the orders, anybody that has more than 85 points does not have to go to Japan, he goes home. Now, in order to get 85 points, every month that you serve, that you were in the Army counts as a point, all right?</p><p>Every medal that you have, counts as five points. Your rating counts as ten points. I had 96 points. I wasn't going to Japan and so were quite a few other guys, so the last I'm sitting there somewhere didn't make any difference. And they took us back down to Naples and finally at the end caught the boat. My outfit had left. On the way to the United States, Japan surrendered. They were home before I was.

He had a very nice big restaurant and I took my job there, but I no longer had any desire to cook. So I made up my mind, my sister had come here, sister was a very bright girl, and she first worked as a nanny, she saved up money and she took up beauty culture. And she became a hair stylist. And she said to me, I says, you're very talented in arts, I used to paint, I used to draw, I used to do all kinds of things, she says, why don't you take a course under the G.I. Bill of Rights. So I says, that's an idea. So I went down to the place in Newark where they gave the lessons and the lectures, it was a year course. And I signed up. Then I went back to my restaurant and I said I can only work from five till nine. Why? I says, because I'm going to be a hair stylist. Guy says, are you sure going to come here? I says, absolutely. I went to the school from nine till four, and then from five till one o'clock, I did cooking. Until the last man had left. And when I graduated there, I got a job as a hairdresser. And I worked there for a few months and I said, I said to my boss, it was a Jewish man who used to work for Albert and Carter, which was in, what was that big place? Saks Fifth Avenue. In a beauty parlor on Saks Fifth Avenue. And I said, Walter, I says, I can't stay with you. He says, why? Everybody likes you. I says, I know, I says, but some of these women drive me bananas. He says why, what did they do. Oh, this curl should be this way and this one here should be this way. And you know, I've been through too much to listen to this garbage here. He says you'll get used to it, you'll get used to it. I says, well, I'm going to take some months off. And I went to a place in Towaco in New Jersey.

I was the only cook there, the owner was, he knew how to cook, but not much. And I worked there for July, August, till September. I started in June already. In the meantime, the hairdresser guy called me, they want you back, they want you back. I says, well I'm going to finish here. It was a good thing it was where I met her. This beautiful child here was 16 years old and she came to the camp and the boss's wife said, wait until you see what's coming in. This girl was a counselor last year I says, she's 16, and she was a counselor at 15. Yes. When she came, she was cute, but a little too heavy. Can I tell "em how much you weighed? A hundred and seventy-two pounds and I said to the woman, I says, this is what you want for me? I says, wait until you hear how she laughs, she's very funny, she's very cute, she's very smart. So I made a mistake one day. I was making pancakes for breakfast and everybody came with their plates, you know, three pancakes, three pancakes, everybody was fed, she came up to the counter, can I have more? I looked at her and I smiled and I says you can have more, and that's when she says she fell in love with me. I didn't know. But all during the time that we were out there, whenever the counselors went out I went along with them and she sort of attached herself to me. So when some of us over, her girlfriend came to me and she said, are you gonna take Sunny out? That's Sunny. Going to take Sunny out when the camp is finished? I says, no, I've no interest in her.

So, once the war was over, my father was reunited with my mother and I applied right away to bring them to America. And being that I had a rank, that I was decorated, she was on the second boat coming here. And she also came to my sister, who had an apartment with two bedrooms, yeah, and a living room that had a couch. Oh, no, that was a little room attached to a balcony. The room was about from the middle of this up to here, but it had a cot in it. So if I opened the door, I fell on the cot and fell asleep. My parents were in the other bedroom. One night we were having dinner together, and I asked my father a few questions about the concentration camp and he says, I really don't want to talk about it, I told you about how I kept myself alive with the potatoes and all that, I says, but I really don't want to talk about it.

And my father looked at me and his eyes started to water and he said, if the war had lasted nine more days, my son, the newest second lieutenant in the American Army would not have had a father.

My car, after a while, I could close my eyes, you knew the way already. And I used to see her on my day off.

But then I got a letter from the Disabled American Veterans and I was home about a year when I was getting 20 percent disability. Because I was hurt, another time, but it was not a bloody hurt, it was wounded in a way.

Naturally, everybody that was around there saw that, they were in their holes, and right away came over, they dug me out, I couldn't breathe, finally got back my breath back and I went to the hospital. I was in the hospital for eight days. And then I went back to my outfit and then I got a Purple Heart for that. I says, well I guess I didn't bleed. But then later on, when I was home I once wrote to the Veterans Administration and I asked them you know you have in you have boys in Iraq and you have boys in Afghanistan and you have boys on the, what was the other one before that, and they can be on a truck, you know, and hit a mine or something and get hurt, but not bleed, but they get a Purple Heart.

I was part of them. Whatever happened, Eric was part of it. So I can't say that I suffered. Naturally, when I go to school and everybody stands there Heil Hitler, I don't say Heil Hitler, I was always a little shaky, but I had training in throwing a hand grenade, I had training in rifle shooting. Oh, this is another cute one. In the last year I was there, this is 1937, we had rifle shooting one day, we did it in our, we did the gymnasium. All right? And they set up a place in the back where they had a stage, metal pieces so you know and then put these signs up and you had to shoot into the sign like you do when you go to a market or something, not a market. And I shot and the fellow next to me, I knew was a very good shot because in the summertime he used to go with his uncle. His uncle was a forester, in charge of keeping the forest clean of people stealing animals or something like that and he always had a was a very good shot. He won the shooting, but I came in second.

The house where I lived in that my father owned with a beautiful, beautiful apartment we had was now a lake. The house had been bombed. There was a big open lot next to it, 1 remember that, and they had torn everything down and made like a big beautiful lake, well I'm saying lake like a square in America here, and flowers and trees and ducks in the pond. That was my then-home. And my father's business, which I had very vividly in front of my eyes because I have it on a picture, too, was now a pharmacy. But more like a CVS, they were selling everything, you know, because in Germany, when I was a kid, a pharmacy only sold things to make you better and most of it was herbs. So I felt bad, especially when I saw my father's store, the building behind it was still up there, but the part over the store was taken down except behind there the apartments were still there.

Cute story. When I was a kid going to school, if we had any kind of things going in school any kind of tests, if it was on the 13th, I knew I would get an A. I mean, I felt so confident, because I was born on the 13th of January, 1921. Now how did I come to the 13? I was once at my uncle's house in a little village and I'm reading a magazine. I was sitting down and I see there a story about Richard Wagner, very famous musician, opera man, very German. And it says here, Richard Wager always thought of the number 13 as his lucky number. Why? Because he was born on the 13th, 18- whatever he was born in. The 13th he was born. His name had 13 letters. The year he was born, if you took the numbers apart made 13. I says, very interesting. I said, wait a minute, I was born on the 13th. My name has 13 letters, Eric Hamburger, and I was born in 1921, one and nine is 10 and two is 12 and one is 13. Hey, I got it made, 13, beautiful.</p><p>Then when I told that in school, when I went back to school after vacation time, I says 13 is my number. I says I got another one. I was born in January, right? What's the month before that? The 12th. So, it could be the first or the 13th. And they remembered that when I got there, you're the one with the 13. And they invited me to their house and they took me out for dinner, nice people. Except when we went to the house of one guy, there was one fellow there and his wife came, who was very nice to me except she was an idiot. She's telling me that she was a nurse in a hospital in Theresienstadt. That's all I needed. What else?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I told them, I says, I want to thank you for inviting me, I says, I never would have come back here if it wasn't for the fact that you invited me, would have a chance to maybe straighten some things out that you have misconceptions for. I said, I can forgive you of what you did because it's so long ago and the people that are my age there's not that many around, I says, but I will never, never forget. I says, what you did to me and my family, you stole my youth from me. I says, this was just the years that a young man has a good time, where he learns a trade, where he learns a business, whatever it may be. You took that away from me, I says, and I hope that you realize that this was horrible for me and my family. When we left there, we had a dinner and we were seated all around on a like a horseshoe table, was it? Or even a square. We weren't seated next to each other, they split us out.

And I says, but I must tell you, it's very hard, very hard for me to look around and see people that haven't got the slightest idea of what the Jewish population went through. I said I had a funny experience, I says, I saw Hitler with my own eyes. I says, when he was here in Ludwigshafen, when he went through there. I didn't tell them I was sitting on top of .

Let me tell you this. Her father was in World War I, like my father, he had relatives in America, they sent him an affidavit for him, his wife, and my girlfriend. No other children. They went to Frankfurt to the consulate and they examine them there and they noticed that this part, this little part was missing on his finger. And they said, what's this?

You say it's nothing, I don't see it here on the affidavit that your people here in America know you're missing a finger. I'm not missing a finger. Well, I can't give you the visa.
