<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I just want you to begin by stating your name as it was during the war, your date of birth and the town you were born in?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Yes. My name was Rozia, like Rose Luft, that was my maiden name, and I was born in Zamuch (ph), the first of July 1918, and I don't know what else do you want to know? I had one brother and two sisters. We had a pretty good life because my father was a builder, and we had people working for us. We had a maid in the house, and we lived very comfortable. Before the war, in 1937, 1938, a friend of my brother's came from Warsaw and he saw me, and he said who is that cute little girl. So my brother said that is my sister, and he took us out for a little dinner and he fell in love with me. So, I get married to him and be married and then the war broke out, so he was in the army, in the military, and he was hurt and he was in a hospital. So my father sent a guy who worked for my father, he sent to Warsaw and he brought him as a soldier wounded in the war.</p><p>They covered his face. It was a Gentile who brought him, because the Germans were already in our town, so they covered his face not to look like a Jew, not to see that he is Jewish. Even the Germans carried him from one train to another. So, that's the time he came to our town and in 1940, I got married, in the war time.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You met and you planned to get married. He was wounded and then you got married afterwards?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, we were just like engaged. He sent me a ring from Warsaw, but I wasn't married to him, and we got married in 1940. I wasn't crazy about marrying, but he was hurt and he said he was going to go to the Germans to be killed because if I'm not going to marry him, he doesn't want to live. So, my mother said you're going to die anyway, all of us, so why don't you marry him. So, I did. I was pregnant in 1941, I got pregnant in 1941, I had a baby and her name was Maugacia (ph), in English it's Margaret, and she died when she was 7 1/2 months old because she had diarrhea and we didn't have any doctors, and we couldn't go to doctors.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was in Zamuch?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I would think in Zamuch, yes. And I had two sisters in the same town. In Europe family lived in one town only. We didn't move around. We didn't leave the nest like. It's all the family, uncles and aunts and everybody lived in the same town. So, then my sister married, I was the middle one. I had an older sister married already. She was I don't know how old. She was 24 when she died, but she married when she was 15 years old. By 16, she had a baby. She had a boy, and that boy was during the war, and she looked-- my sister didn't look like a Jewish girl. She looked like a Gentile so the Gentile boys used to say "Saki, why do you need a Jew for. Throw the Jew away, like she doesn't belong to him. But she was married, happily married to that guy, and they had that boy. Then the</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She was about that time 20. She was born in 1921, and he was about seven years older, 27 at that time. He was a pediatrician. They lived together, and then the Germans used to come in to give us all kinds of orders.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm sorry. I need you to stop a second. I think you were talking about your younger sister?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes. She was married to that doctor. My youngest sisters --- there were three sisters and I was the middle one. She married his name was , and they were very happy together, and when the Germans started coming into our houses and taking everything away, you know like here the carpets we have on the floor, but the real what do you call it, not Chinese, the carpets that come from the East, we had on the walls at that time. They were hanging on the walls. So, they told them to take down the carpet from the wall, and he saw that they are very rough to us and they were pushing him and hitting him and they decided to take their lives. So, they went into their -- because they lived one apartment, one home near the other and they went into their room and they told the maids to go into our house and stay with my mother until they're going to wake up.</p><p>They're going to sleep. So, she came in and she was sitting an hour or two and she said they're still sleeping. So, my mother told me to go in and see what they're doing and I saw them like that both of them. He was really dead and she was all right, but she didn't know that he died. They took their lives. He gave her a shot. I don't know what the stuff was and himself and then he told her when she wakes up before him and he's going to be dead already so she give herself another shot, and he put it away in a place in the oven. We didn't have like heating, but big huge ovens so she said it's there because when the doctors came and the whole town was by our house and when the doctors came, his friends, and they asked where is the rest of it, and she told them while <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Nobody, we knew that Hitler wrote and the Germans used to tell us it's nothing now. You're going to see what's waiting for you. So, we knew that something is going on, but they didn't tell us what they're going to. They used to say to everybody that they're sending us to work, to the Russian front or to camps, but never they're going to kill us. So, my sister after three months she saw a boy who worked for my father and she said you tell my family that I'm going to see , to be with because <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> happening. Then they told us we have to move together, together in a different place, but we for a little while we stayed in the same place, and my sister had a maid and she was part of the gate, standing and the Germans used to come and they asked if there were any Jews, and she couldn't speak German so she said, "No, Jews," so they left. But we were in the window watching what's going on in the streets, and we saw all our neighbors a lot of them came out of the houses and they told them to make a big ditch and everybody was working hard to make the ditch and they laid around, they told them to stay around the ditches, to stand up, and that's what I saw. A very nice, I don't remember her name, a lady with a little girl, she was about five years old. She was holding the baby with her and they told them to stay with the Germans with the backs and they were shooting from the back in the heads or whatever and they were falling into the graves, into the ditch.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this right in the town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Right in the beginning. They were falling and she was holding on to that little baby and she was killed and the baby, and after a while in full blocks and lots and lots of people. I don't remember how many it was at that time, but a lot of people fell into that grave, and that little baby came out after about five or ten minutes, from under the mother because they shoot her in the back of the head, so the little baby was she was holding on her so she wasn't hurt, and she came out from under the mother's body and she was begging them on the knees please don't kill me. I want to live, and they killed her just straight on her -- and she died. This we all saw and my nephew said you see what they're doing. At that time he was about five years old. He said, "I don't want to be killed like this." And so, it was over and we cried and we said this is going to be our end. At that time, I worked already for the Germans, the SS, the German engineers, and I used <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> be registered, and we used to go all out to work.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was this in the town?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was all in our town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were most of the young women going and doing this kind of work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All of them, old and young.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What was the actual work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Anything. One worked and cleaned houses. I worked as a helper there, you know. They asked me if I know how to make manicure and I said, I don't know. He said try, and I made for the SS men's manicure and I was afraid that if I'm going to hurt them, they're going to kill me, but they were nice SS people, really. They weren't the military. They were private. They were like engineers, but they belonged to the party, but they didn't know the cruelty yet.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But your work was really very intimate. It wasn't working in a factory. It was this one to one contact?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the beginning in our town, they used to make us work in getting used that all of us have to work if you want food. They didn't give us much. The Russians were very small.</p><p>They gave us bread and the bread tastes like raw, because they didn't bake them like they were supposed to be, but we had something. Then, we worked there until about -- they made , that was in 1941. My daughter died by the time, and they came and <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> were in one room later. So, it was terrible, but you're still -- we were allowed to take our clothes, not much, but a little, but not the furniture. Nothing like this. It's just personal things they let us take and you know, little by little they take away our freedom and everything. We couldn't get out. The Ghetto was from this place to this place. We couldn't go to the other side of the Ghetto by ourselves. We had to have a German or a dressed in a German uniform, but they were . They spoke Polish but they were from some place in the border of Germany and Poland, so they spoke both languages. They had to bring us to work. We couldn't go by ourselves. We met one nice and his name was Philip. I don't know the last name. He used to help us. He used to put when they say he used to come and say they are going to make a raid today, you know, like they're going to kill a lot of people. They are going to raid the Ghetto, and so he said let me take you all go into the ditches, you know where the potatoes are high. So, he put us in the ditches and he said I'm going to watch and I'm going to see where they are and I'm going to tell you when to come out. So, the Germans were very smart and very clever, and they used to go around and looking for people like this. They knew that everybody is trying to stay alive. So, he watched them, and he used to show us quietly don't get up. Just stay there, and he was like a means he was the watcher, a watch guard for them, but he helped us. He helped us a lot in the beginning. They had a little more freedom to do that, the , and the Germans. They weren't so bad. But, they were bad enough because we weren't used to a life like this. But, you know from the worst they were the better ones. So, they moved us again, and I moved out from my mother to a different place. They gave me a little room in a building, in the same building my aunt lived downstairs with my cousin and her husband and child and another guy, another family lived next door and they made an . Do you know what that is? They told us to go to the market place and they were cleaning up the place, so we all went to the marketplace, but the contribution of people, so many they can put into the trains, that they had enough. They did the amount of people, it was over, so they sent some people back. Then when we came back home, it was the middle of the night and we couldn't go because they were shooting everybody on the streets, whoever they saw. So, we went into a building that we didn't even know who lived there, and we heard somebody crying and it was an old lady, maybe 100 years old in the bed crying that she doesn't have food, and that she doesn't know where her family is and we told her to be quiet because they are going to shoot us all. I was with my little baby at that time, yet still, and I was breast feeding her and | didn't have anything in my breast how to feed her. We kept the baby quiet and my cousin was with me with her boy.</p><p>He was six years old and my cousin's husband. Then the middle of the night, it was too dark, maybe 4 o'clock in the morning, we were going back quietly and we saw blood all over the streets. It was like a war field with people who I knew were on the streets all over, and we saw a German on a horse. He was Gestapo or SS officer, a very high rank officer and he said "What happened?" It was quiet already, just, you know, once ina while we heard a shot someplace. So, he asked us what happened here and we said, "We don't know. They killed us all." And he said, "Tell your people -- I never knew who he was -- "Tell your people that I am ashamed of our race." And he was a high rank German.</p><p>He told us tell the people so we went home and we said so what can <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> you say. We went back home so we had to lock the gate and my cousin went to the next door neighbor for the gate -- locking the gate, it was a big like a piece of iron, you know to put an iron on the gate. In the meantime, he went in there and he called us all and he said, "Come in, come in, you're going to see something." Fourteen people were shot through the head. All of them. My two aunts. One aunt was standing. She was looking something in the drawer and she opened the drawer and she was with her head looking into the drawer and she was shot, I suppose in the back of her head and the drawer was full of her blood. One of my aunts was sitting on the floor in the corner, with her tongue out, shot to death. That was my cousin's mother. My mother's brother's wife, and so it was a full house of dead people, fourteen people. All of a sudden I hear somebody calling my name, and one girl was moaning because they shot her in an eye. They said she's too pretty to shoot her so they just shoot her eye out, which she died a while later, but the woman who came out from under the bed, they were all standing or sitting or just so the woman was my neighbor and she came out from under the bed dripping in blood, and she said, I run the first under the bed and they couldn't see me. They just shot the next person who was after me. I said, "Come out" my cousin said, "Come out. You're going to be with us." She said, "No, I'm afraid they're going to kill me." And she went back under the bed. Finally, you know, we persuade her to come out and we said go and wash yourself.</p><p>Look how you look. She was soaking in blood. So, that was then my mother knew what was someplace else and she sent the maid and she said to Anera (ph), she said go and see what's with my daughter. She came to the window and it was I had a candle on because we were afraid to put the lights on and so she said she came back to my mother and she said I think in Ruzia's apartment there's a little candle so she must be there. So, my father came with a blanket and he came for me and when he saw me he fainted because I looked like -- he couldn't recognize me because we went through hell all night. It was not a night, it was a hell. What we saw, and that's always in my mind. I never told my children anything about those things, and my father took me home to my mother. He took me home and my mother said you're not going anyplace. You're staying with us until they move us further. That was the place for you to stay with us. So, then I said no I'm going to go home tomorrow. Soon after my baby died, because I didn't give her milk. I gave her water. I didn't have anything to give her, and so we --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there constantly terror in the streets?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Constantly, constantly, night and day you hear shooting and screaming and running. It was not a day or not a minute without fear, without that horror, not fear, horror. It was unbelievable.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You saw this when you went to work?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: All the time, all the time. Then you know, after that you're still a few months in that Ghetto, and I used to go to work, and I had nice friends, and I had a teacher who and his name was Mr. Khun (ph), and you come to me, and I'm going to feed you and I'm going to give you something to wear, you know things you need. I want to help. So, I used to go</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But it was many for a pound of sugar, they sold your soul. So, they worked for the Germans, and one time I said to that Philip, he used to come and he used to take me to visit my friends. Like I used to have a friend, my brother's friend, and she used to tell me how about coming to dinner and I said -- she's a , you have full Germans, and she said, I'm going to tell her you're my sister and nobody is going to know so that was the truth. But in the meantime, we were making Gentile papers for ourselves to live through the war if we decided to run away before it's too late. So, we were working on the papers. It cost a lot of money too make Gentile papers.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was helping you with us?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was a lot of Polish people who did those things, who put the German stamps, like it looked real and everything. They gave me a name, Bernice Slabovuchko, that I should live on this name, and my brother and my father put money down for camp cards like passports like Gentiles and they put money down and they waited. They said it's going to take and they gave them pictures and everythings, it's going to take a little while and you're going to get your papers. So, and I had papers from a church and I had those papers but you're going to work every day and all of a sudden one morning they came in and they said it's everything , they didn't let us go to work and it's</p><p> , you know they clean out and we all have to go out of town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When was this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was by the end of 1941.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You were still living in ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, but then I came back and it was "41, because they took the whole town together and we marched, children, old and young, whatever was left, we marched to a little town</p><p> . was never there in my life and we marched 21 kilometers with my <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> we walked and I helped carry my sister's little girl. And he was walking, my nephew, alone by himself and he was so proud you see I am walking by myself, all by myself.</p><p>And he walked the whole 21 kilometers. They brought us to a little town. It was a dirty little town with -- it wasn't even a town. It was a village like and there was no place to go and no place to live. We found a room someplace. We went in with a family. I don't know who that was. In the same day, a German, an SS man, but I worked for him, he was -- Lworked in an logger, that means a camp and we were going there for there for the day and working and coming home and you know. So, I worked all the time for him. So, he came and he used to call me Pauline, not Rose. So, he came to the town and he was standing on a truck and he said where is Pauline. He called for me, and my brother came into the house and he said I think Walter -- his name Walter Robert, my brother says, I think he's looking for you because he called your name. And I said, "I don't want to go." And I want to go all together. We're going to go all together all of us. So, my mother said, "No, you go," and she put on I don't know whose coat, my brother's coat on me. It was cold already. I don't know what month it was, it was like fall.</p><p>She put that coat and she said you're going to keep warm. You go back. Maybe by you're going back to work for Robert, you can save us, and we're going to start hiding ourselves in here by the time maybe you can help us. So, I didn't want to go and I cried. I said, "Mother, I don't want to go." He said, "you go." My brother took me there and he said, "You go with Robert," and he was standing on the truck and the other side of the cane, he always had a cane to hit somebody, so he pulled my neck to him and he said, "You come here," and he took me on the truck and he said, "You're going back, because they needed 75 people back to our town to clean up the town. My brother and my father and my mother and my sister and the children stayed in that little town. So, my brother started going for those cards, for the passport. So, the Pollack who made that passport saw that the Germans are you know the bosses and he said -- and my brother paid him 3,000 slotas, that means like $3,000, and that time it was a lot of money. So, he said, you better get out of here. I don't have papers for you and I'm not going to make them. I have the money and you go out, and if you're not going to get out, I'm going to call the Gestapo.</p><p>So, my brother ran away. He ran away and he came down, and by that time, my mother and sister and children were hidden in a hole underground. They found them there, I don't know, because I wasn't there anymore, because they took me back to my town. They found them there and where their remains are if they were cremated or they were shot, if they were shot whatever happened to them, I don't know, but my father in the morning he used to like to go to the forest. So, my father went to the forest, and he said I'm going to be back. So, he was walking around in the forest and after a while he came out. He didn't know that that they are killing all the people. They are taking them away and screaming and everything. He came out and a few Germans on horses they were</p><p> , because they spoke to him in Polish and they said to him, you SOB, <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 said I'm not going to kill you.

They told him that they are going to announce him to the Gestapo. So, he walked out. He came to our town and he was working in the city. He went to work and he met a friend of his. I think he was in the Army with him together, my brother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In the Polish Army?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In the Polish Army. So, because my brother was the oldest brother in the family and so he was born in 1910 so he was not a child and so he was after the Army and he met the guy and he said to my brother why are you miserable what's wrong what happened to you.</p><p>Are you hurt? Are you hungry? And he said no, I can't get my gentile papers because they took away my money and my father's paper is Kochonoski, and I want -- no and my father doesn't have the papers really, and I want him to be my father and I am his son and we Polish officers are going to run away. And he says, okay, take my camp card. He took off his picture and he gave it to my brother. He said, "I am going to report that in three months that I lost it. By that time you make yourself other papers." So, he gave him the papers that he is Kochonoski, and he made my father his father and they left. They went to Lemberg, to as Gentiles. I took my father the night before when they had <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 2 camp. I was peeling potatoes, a potato peeler. Then I got sick of Typhus there and that Robert who took me back he told a soldier that he should bring me every day water there and keep me -- I was in a little coop like, and you have to keep give her water and make a little fire to keep her warm and she is going to be okay. We didn't have any medication nothing and so I got I was crazy. It went into your head. After I came out of the sickness I was nuts. I didn't want to do anything in the kitchen. I didn't want to peel potatoes and he came in, that Robert, with and he said if you're not going to do what I -- not because he was mad at me, but he wanted me to wake up. He said, I'm going to beat the hell out of you but you have to work if you want to live. And I was so scared of him that I started doing it. So, then I got better with nothing. We didn't have even an aspirin, nothing, just water. When you're young, you get through a lot. So, I make the story short and the</p><p> camp and one night it was late in "41 I had a dream there that my mother I want to run away. No, I had a dream that my mother is by the door and I said, "Mother, what kind of mother are you. I want to run away and you're keeping me here." And she said, "Over my dead body." I'm never going to forget that dream. It was real, I saw her there on the floor and she said you're not going to run away because over my dead body because they're going to shoot you outside and all of sudden we hear screams outside "Arouse, Arouse" that was about 4 o'clock in the morning. Arouse, so the Germans the Gestapo came, we worked for the SS but then the Gestapo came at 4 o'clock in the morning, and the Gestapo were over the SS, so they said all out and they start you know putting us in lines and the outside people start running and they were all shot outside. My mother told not to run, and they took us away. But, before that, there was a guy an engineer with a wife, I told you they even brought me from Germany presents, a raincoat and a rain hat, and a parasol and they said they are going to adopt me and send me to Germany, but it was so sudden that the SS didn't know what the Gestapo was cooking for us and they came to the gate and they were standing in the gate and he saw me going out of the gate and he started crying and he said just like this. He showed that he couldn't do anything, and they took us on big trucks and we didn't know where we were going. They shoot a lot of people in the camp there before we left because they were starting to run and they shoot a lady that I knew by my door and her brain was by the door. Nothing you can do about it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you think you were going to work somewhere else?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, we knew they are going to kill us. We are going to death, because we weren't dressed. I was in my nightgown. We weren't even dressed, with a coat on top. We didn't know really where we were going, but when we passed those death places we knew that they are -- it's death camps, just ovens, not even camps, just straight to the crematory. So, we went by it and we said, no we're going someplace else. So, you know, we lived with hope that maybe we're going to live. They brought us into Maidanek. After a long, long drive they brought us into Maidanek, and they told us to undress and to take a shower.</p><p>They put us into cold showers and they took away everything. They gave us old junk to put on us, and they took away all our jewelry but you see before we left we were smarter, we put all the jewelry in the toilet. We had packs. We were sitting on it so we put everything there. We said let's not give anything to them. But I forgot that I had long hair and I forgot that I had my earrings with my monogram in my ears and my hair covered it, so it went through, but everything went and we were naked. The men, they took separate and they undressed the men naked and they left them only the strap in the hands and they told them to hold the strap in their hands and they let German Shepherds after them. And you know, when you have something in the hand and the German Shepherds went wild and they were biting out pieces of meat of the people. This was the beginning of Maidanek.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We were watching. The women were separate, but the men were running. We were naked, we didn't have straps. Men had pants with straps so they had the straps and the German Shepherds tore them apart. So, we went into the camp. They took us in camp.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Before that, we were about eight months in that camp.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: In Maidanek?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Maidanek, about six months maybe. I don't remember exactly but so we went into that Maidanek and they took us in. They dressed us in clothes and they took us in. We marched in. The women separate. The men separate. I don't know how many blocks it was, about five all together I guess and we had about one block that were men and the men had the rest. They had kitchens in the men's place but not by us. By us we only did work and when we came from work they used to put us -- we worked like not melioration, we put grass in the -- the men were bringing us the water. They were the horses and the wagons, and they pulled the wagons with water and they gave us buckets of water and we watered the grass there. That was the job in Maidanek.</p></p></dialogue>

He paid his bread -- he worked someplace else, that he wants once to go to the women's camp to see me and I took off my earrings and I put them in a piece of my undershirt and I had them in my shoes because the shoes didn't take away. I just cut off my heals and I was walking like backwards but I had them in my shoes and when he came I took him out and when he was giving me the water I just gave him those earrings and he didn't know what it is and I gave him my bread because men need more bread.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you know your husband was there? You hadn't seen him in a while?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, but I was working there and I saw him coming because he told somebody that he's going to be that day through -- like a messenger like you know one word comes to another that he's going to try to see me that day.

They used to let us in between the wires and sit there and we couldn't move because if you move one way it's electric and you move the other so you were sitting there one by one around the wires. This was our past time or we used to they used to give us a job to bring stones from one corner to another, the same stone. We bring it to one corner of the camp and bring it back, go back and forth like you see ants working, you know. They're going back and forth.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why were you doing that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: For nothing, just because they wanted to occupy us. We shouldn't be free. We shouldn't have free time.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Every day?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, sometimes when you went in. We didn't have toilets we went out not even an outhouse, under there someplace where ever we found a place. We didn't have anything.</p><p>We didn't have a paper so you know what I used to do to take pieces of my underwear and I used that until my underwear was to here but because we had to give them back one to get a new one. So, this was to left to give it back to get a new one. So, you see we didn't have any paper. We didn't have any water. We had very little food. We had just barely to live through the day, a little soup which was terrible from cabbage, rotten cabbage and collarabi. It was the worst thing you ever ate in your life, but when you're hungry you try to swallow it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you eat it in?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, they gave us dishes and we used to put the dish in here, under and it looked like this and this was our dish to wash ourselves. I washed my face in it. Sometimes, I don't know how to say, I went number one in that thing and we ate soup in it and the soup it wasn't too much. It was just like a cup of soup.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you able to rinse it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: With the coffee they gave us in the morning, not coffee. They were leaves, like burned leaves, they made brown water, so with this we washed the faces and we washed the dish and that's all.</p></p></dialogue>

I had later on in Birkenau friends who were aggressive and they were going to the garbage and they brought food and they wake me up and they said you have a soup from peels from the potatoes or whatever it was in the garbage but that was later on.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were you surprised by the other people?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very, they used to put the heads in those big pots of what they brought the food and liquid the tanks there and I said what kind of animals are they because they made us animals. They made from people unbelievably animals. I think not everybody had a mind to control themselves and they broke you down and you couldn't control.</p></p></dialogue>

Then when we heard that it's going to be transports so my husband sent me word from the men's camp that he is going to register for a transport, I should do it too.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It was your choice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, you could register or you could be killed. They gave you the choice to leave the place and go to a worse one, but we didn't know if it was worse. We thought it was better.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I'm sorry to do this, but I want to back track just once more. Were there any gassings or burnings done at Maidanek?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No. They used to be they're gassing I think at the beginning where they just took you to work and they gas you there because we knew and we saw those gassing chambers but not people. They didn't gas them anymore. So, then we had the right to go for a transport.</p><p>They knew that we not going to a resort place. They knew they were sending us to worse places and this is the way the Germans did their work and that to be to make you very little in not thinking. You know but they gave you like a little authority. You can register, but they did what they wanted to do. So, we registered and they took us away and we didn't know where, and so did my husband. They took him to Mauthausen and they took me to Auschwitz.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was like fall, it was fall. I know it was cold but so they took us out. They marched us out of Maidanek and they took us to -- we marched to the train and that wasn't people train they were animal trains or coal trains or whatever and they put me in a coal train. I was black when I came out of there. I looked like a black person. In Polish negroes they didn't say they said black people are coming. The black people are coming because we came out we were black from the coal and this is later. I just go back, they put us in those and they gave us a little bread and they didn't give us water, they gave us a little margarine and a little cheese. We were in the train about four days without water. We begged them for water. They didn't want to give us. Many of us died. They were jumping over the dead people to the window to scream out for water, please water. Nothing was more important than water. They didn't give us any. So, we used to make number one and we used to drink it. What could you do. Maybe people don't -- I don't know how many you interview don't tell those things, but this is the truth. So, we had some water, it was salty, but water. So, we came into they took us four days for a ride.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: More than that, more than that. Maybe two or three thousand people. Germans were in a line lined up, the Gestapo with dogs by the train and like they saw me they said go this way. They saw an old person this way. This way, this way, children left and right. Left and right, we didn't know. Who knew what means left and we went where they told us to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was a different system than at Maidanek?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It was different. In Maidanek they took everybody who came from everyplace. This was the segregation because in Auschwitz or in Birkenau they want you to still be healthy and able to work, and they had there later when I went to work, I saw them, but they had there all working people who had still a lot of energy in them. Energy at least and the old and the children they put separate. It was screaming and pulling. The parents pulled the children to them and they pulled them out of them, the Germans. And they were hitting the people and they were hitting the children and they were taking out the children and beating and killing those children if you're not going to get into here that's what's going to happen to your child. It was the middle of the night. It was awful. It was screaming. I can still hear the hollerings, the screamings, the cryings. It was an old couple he was in a uniform with his wife. He was holding her hand and they pulled them apart. That he is a man. He has to go to the men and she should go with the women. Because they didn't gas you with men and women together. Women separate and men separate who has to go, and children whatever. So, they pulled them apart and got the screaming. They took our children from our camp didn't come with toys because they didn't have the toys, but from the freedom they came with toys and they took away the toys. They keep them, the kids and you saw the kids walking to the ovens in and the parents and all of a sudden you hear screaming.</p></p></dialogue>

We marched in and we came in there and they looked at that part of the train of us and they saw negroes, they said black people. Because we only had the eyes showing the faces because you touched from the coal the faces all the time. We didn't know how we looked. We came in and they put us under showers, cold showers. They took us in and they said now you go into showers. The other one went into the gas chambers they told them the showers too, but we went to give us clothes. They took all our clothes away. They shaved our heads. They shaved us all over and they gave us clothes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were you thinking?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We didn't recognize each other. When we came out and we said that's you, that's you, that's Tricia and that's Rose? We didn't recognize each other. That wasn't the worst part.</p><p>They gave us pieces of material to cover the head because it was cold and it was very, very cold at that time. They let us in to the shower, cold water and all of a sudden they put hot water, like hot and cold, hot and cold. It was screaming terrible because here they bend us and here they give us cold water, cold, freeze us. They gave us barracks to go into. They gave me the 21st block.

I don't know what kind and who had it before and they gave us wooden shoes. Huge ones, on my foot I was a five and they gave me a man's big shoe so we were just walking in them and put some junk in it, like whatever we found to fill it out. Those were wooden shoes, wooden bottoms and material like junky material tops. That was our shoes and that's why the dress. When we saw each other how we looked and how we dressed we laughed and we cried and we didn't know what -- we really didn't know how to behave. We laughed like I was you know bald so I didn't see me but I saw her, the other person. So, we were all bald.</p><p> End of Tape #2</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: One thing that I am sort of curious about is how the physical conditions at Auschwitz compared to what you experienced at Maidanek?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Different, much, much different. Hannah she was a very clean lady. She loved cleanliness and so am I and we were afraid that we were going to get like everybody else. They had malaria. They had typhus. They had and that everything together and besides everything from the dirt we had sores from the body. If somebody didn't wash, they just died from that. They went to the gas chambers with those sores, but Hannah, ; used to wake me up in the middle of the night and she said you know what, I found a place that's called they wash clothes and water is dripping a little in the middle of the night we went out with her because we weren't allowed, but we sneaked out. I'm always forgetting I always say barrack and we always sneaked out and we cleansed ourselves. Thanks to her she gave me the courage she said come on, come on let's go because you like to be clean and so do I. So, we washed ourselves with that little drop of water, we shared it. So, that was very important. It was a terrible, they gave us five minutes to go to the bathroom, and we were sitting around and you know, number one, it wasn't a bathroom, it was a room with holes and you could sit there for five minutes and they opened the water in the morning for five minutes you have to get to the water and wash your face and drink a little water and go to work. They start counting us going out to work we had to be all together. They count us.</p><p>They separate us who is going where to what work to what shop and we had to march out by the music, no matter what. The music was waiting for us.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who was playing the music?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: People from-- they were in concentration camp and they asked them if they know how to play and they gave them instruments and they told them to play. They cry and play because what else can you do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were the actual physical conditions like? How did they differ from Maidanek? Was it more comfortable, less comfortable?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Less, less, it was worse. First of all they made selections every few weeks. They looked at you naked. You had to go through naked with your clothes on your arm and they looked you through like cattle and looked at your teeth, exactly like cows like cattle, they're buying cows to work. So, they looked us through from the front and from the back and they went around us like you know looking all over you. This was selections, called selections, and they selected if you were still good to work they send you straight ahead and if not they took you out on the side. So, you knew that this was the end. So one time in a selection like this, I had a friend from my town and her name was . <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 very heavy and she lost a lot of weight and she said but I'm still heavier than you.

A musselman is completely to nothing. He couldn't walk any more. That was a musselman, and that she said to me I was going before her and she was behind me and she said, you know let's change places because when they look at you they are going to take you to the gas chamber and I have here on my arm a wound and she said put the clothes because we should keep the clothes in our right hand, not the left and she said change it and you cover this because even with a little thing like this they took you to the gas chambers. So, and she said I'm going to walk before you and you after. They're going to look at me not you they're not going to see you. She was right. A fat person when you lose weight your skin hangs, and she went through and they took her aside and they took down her number and I went through. She went to the gas chamber, but she was working with us for two weeks. They took down her number and every day they're going to call me now, they're going to call me today, and I said why did you do that for me? You could live and I could go, and she no, I wanted to go. You're going to stay here and she gave me her piece of bread and she said you take care of yourself. So, anyway, after two weeks they called her name and she went to the gas chamber and I went through like they didn't see me, like she said. And I always have her on my conscious that maybe she was saving me that maybe she went instead of me. I don't know. I have that on my conscious many, many years. So, I come out of there and she was calming me down, don't worry. I want to go, I want you to live and I wanted to go I have nothing to live for. Maybe you'll find your father and your brother. Maybe you're still going to have anybody to live for. So, she kissed me goodbye and she gave me the bread and she went.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you learn what that was, the smoke?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: We knew who was burning. You know when fresh transports came from freedom -- not really freedom, they were better off wherever they were like at Bergen-Belsen or in other camps than Auschwitz, so they had a little flesh on them, so when the flesh was burning you saw only smoke. You didn't see a fire, you know. The flames you didn't see, only smoke. When we were burning, like those musselmens, like what they didn't like, you saw flames. So, we knew that those are the freedom people and those are our people. We knew who was who, burning.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you first learn what was going on in there at all, though?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The minute they brought you in and they send you to work and you saw before people were coming in to work it was just a crematorium. Or they brought them in not a crematorium made to burn but they were killing them there because we were finding spoons on the floor, bones, heads, we saw heads with hair to work. We saw because I don't think they buried them very deep and they were buried -- you know we could see.</p><p>We were walking on bones and hair, on heads.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you think these were things that didn't get burned properly?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they didn't have the oven finished yet, so they just killed them and they just covered them with I think a very, they were not covered much and we found like spoons and forks and things like this. We were lucky we found those. We had something to eat with because we ate with the fingers. It was not civilization. It was, I think in the old ages, they had a better civilization that we had. Germans looked us over naked like pieces of meat. We didn't have our period time because they put something in your food that we weren't women.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How do you know that?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't remember the name of it. It was like a powder and you put that powder into the soup and we at that so a woman wasn't a woman and a man wasn't a man either, I suppose. I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>

If we would live through it if we're going to be able to have children, to bear children. Never never in life because we didn't even have -- I was married already. I had a child already. There, is I said I have a child and I had a husband and they used to say I was nuts because I looked like a little girl. We were bones, no breasts, nothing.</p><p>They took away our dignity. They took away everything you have in life, and we didn't care. We just didn't want to suffer, but we didn't care, but we did suffer because they saw we used to go to work every morning.

Then they were selecting people all the time in the morning where to go and they selected me to .

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Very. We knew, you know we found in Jewish clothes big crosses, bibles, catholic bibles because they were already, I think they changed their religion and they thought they were going to be saved. But Hitler found the generation of Jews and some came there and an old lady came in and said I am not Jewish why am I here. She said my grandparents were Jewish. I said, that's why you're here because the Germans were the most stupid Jews in the world. They didn't believe. They said we're going to win. That's our Germany. Hitler's going to vanish. You see, they didn't believe. They believe our Germany and they really believed in them that they are not going to kill them because they are Germans. So, we used to when walking to work in Birkenau we're going every morning to Auschwitz, four kilometers to Auschwitz to , and they told us to sing, what we were singing, but I can't sing so I'm going to just talk and it's like</p><p> , you know what that means.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Of course. We shared it and we had a terrific dinner. We shared that because she brought it in so I didn't have to sneak it in, so it was in already so I said let's have it and we sat in the back and we all ate it and we had a ball. That was one episode I could bring something in. I couldn't believe and everybody said "How did you do it?" I said you see, hunger is more than life. I kept his beak closed so that he shouldn't make noise and I had full of his feces in me, but I didn't care because I had bread. That's what happened one time to me and I couldn't believe. Then I had another girlfriend who lives now in</p><p> she lives now in Israel and she was in care of the feces. You know what we did the whole night, you couldn't get out.

You reach out to anybody especially to God. I believe in God, but I am not a fanatic. I believe in something higher than we are, better than we are of our savior, but I am not like today, I am not going to a synagogue because I don't know how to pray, but I pray at home. I put on a tape of and I have it at home by myself. I cry a little and I pray to God because he's there. If not for him, maybe I wouldn't be here.

She gave me a comb and I made it nice with a fingers, I made the waves. I don't know how. Fear teaches you everything. From fear you know everything. There's not a thing that you don't know. So, I start making her hair and she said I'm going to show my boyfriend my hair. She's going to show if he likes it and he said it's wunderbar, it's wunderbar so that's all, so I became her private beautician and manicurist, but she said to me you are going to work in the kitchen, that means we didn't peel potatoes, we were only that was a machine that it was like scraping the potatoes with the dirt and everything. In the beginning I didn't work in the kitchen so my girlfriend Hannah, no another girlfriend used to make pancakes, no potato pancakes threw them in a little oven there and with the sand and the dirt and everything just like baking them and we were supposed to swallow them because you couldn't chew them. It was in the teeth, it was an awful feeling so we were swallowing them to fill the stomach. So, she cooked a little soup and she brought me up to eat a little soup, but when I was in the kitchen so Hannah wasn't there yet. They took from -- no Hannah was there. We all were there. Going out to Sweden she wasn't there. So, then other girls start coming into from Auschwitz, from wherever they took them, because Auschwitz was in Poland and the Russians came very close to there so they had to evacuate very fast. So the evacuation came very fast and they brought them in bunches to . So, Hannah came with the next transport with me and other girls and that Sarah Goldberg what I tell you she was there too, and I worked already in the kitchen. After a while she prepared me she didn't want me to be by the potatoes. She wanted me to be a cook to have nice hands to hold her hands and I said I couldn't believe it I was in a kitchen and I saw food. And so when the transport a few weeks later a new transport came and I came out of the kitchen with a white, I was wearing a white uniform in the kitchen because that kitchen cooked for the Germans too.

It wasn't a resort, it was a camp, but that was the best one from all of them, so because it was really in Germany, so the German ladies, the SS women who worked in the kitchens and they worked with us. They were our superiors and some were very bitchy, very bad.</p></p></dialogue>
