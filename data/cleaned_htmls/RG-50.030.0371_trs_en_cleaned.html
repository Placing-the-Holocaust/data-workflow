<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: F</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How about, tell us about your mother and your father, where they lived &gt;&gt; you know about.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, my father, I have to go back a little and tell you a little story about my grandfather. My grandfather came from a little town in the Eifel region. The Eifel region goes all the way up to the , where they had the major battles in World War One and World War Two. My father was born in Hollerath, you want me to spell it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: H-o-I-1-e-r-a-t-h, that is called the snow Eifel, that's the upper Eifel, right on the Belgian border. So I have relatives in Belgium and I have relatives in Germany. Well, that little town had 600 people and the girls there, of course there was no contraception, so people had many children, but they were extremely poor. I think the richest farmer had four cows. I used to go to take care of the cows so they wouldn't walk into the potato fields. Anyway the girls in that little village, since the parents had difficulties feeding them, would send them down to the valley to work as maids and prosper to find a husband. When my father's mother, she was one of those who was sent down to Olef, O-l-e-f, and she came into the household of the family, Meyer. They were farmers and schoolteachers. Well it looks like my grandfather and my grandmother, yep, had a little relationship in the haystack and as a consequence she became pregnant and she was told to go back to her mother, back to Hollerath, in 1890, when that part of Germany was extremely was extremely poor, and the neighbors, when they found out, they were staunch Catholics, when they found out she was pregnant, threw stones at her until the priest, the pastor , may he who cast the first stone, you know. So, in the haystack, they'd made a little mattress with straw and that's where my father was born and he stayed there until he was 12 years old.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He lived in the barn?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: He lived in Hollerath, in that little village until he was 12, then my grandfather, the</p><p> Meyer, he was offered a job by , which was one of the <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> German, he only spoke the dialect of his hometown, and when he went to school, they put him in the last bench where all the, generally you put the retarded ones. And he told me that when the principal came once, he asked, what is that boy doing there. Oh, he is from the Eifel region, he is a little retarded. So to overcome the situation, he spent every minute in the library and he came one of the most educated, self-educated man I ever met. And changed jobs and every job was an improvement, see, until he came to Kassel. My mother was pregnant 10 times, but lost babies and a brother of mine was born, a year and a half earlier than I and one earlier and then of course my father moved again to Kassel and worked for Hensel(ph), which was at the time the largest locomotive factory in the world and he was in charge of export and took care of the linguistic aspect of exporting and so on, because he had acquired a number of languages. Already I am speaking about my father being my father, but actually maybe I should tell you that he volunteered in World War One to the garrison in Metz, which is Alsace-Lorraine in order to learn French. And he was in World War I from the first day to the last day and was in every major battle and wounded three times. Before the war started, he came to marry my mother, and then orders came, the war had started, so he couldn't stay, but three days and then he went back and my mother was born in M-u-c-h, pronounced in German , which is also in the Rhineland areas and she was born in a resort town, which became a resort town and I already mentioned her father. When my mother was two years old, her mother died during childbirth, and my grandfather, not being able to cope with children, married the housekeeper of the local priest and she was the, what you read in books about stepmothers, she was a witch. I don't remember her and if I did, I would try not to remember her. So there was quite a bit of child abuse, and then when my mother was 14, she was given a -- five marks or something like that, walk 10 miles to the railroad station and buy a ticket, fourth class, that was a little above the cattle and go to Cologne and you were expected there and my father met, my mother then started as a maid in a rather, rather fine household of a Jewish family. And I think, like my father, she was very eager to improve things, so she went to evening schools and ended up being the secretary of a very important man in Dusseldorf and one day walking her little dachshund, she saw a rather handsome man, my father and that's how they got together and eventually ended, it ended up in marriage.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you're describing two people who were very much self-made, certainly self-improving?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Totally, totally, but the point that I am astonished when I read what my mother wrote, it's so impeccable and so well expressed that well, it must be an innate thing with her. She was a very unusual, unusual woman who didn't fit in this century at all. To her there were only flowers and beautiful things, you know she was extremely sensitive, neat. I hear <span class="page-break" number="2"></span> old and she protested. After her fifth victory, at the age of 81, she had a special trophy from the Secretary of the Interior, true.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Could you tell us her full name, her maiden name?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, Henriette Paula Summerhowser(ph).</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That's a great story.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us what it was like to have them as parents. What was it like growing up? Did they spend a lot of time with you, giving you instruction?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well my mother was a mother plus. I sometimes wonder where she got all the knowledge, because we were exposed to, that is my brother and I, we were exposed to food, <span class="page-break" number="3"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you were rebellious at first, within the family structure?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I was probably born rebellious. Yeah, within the family structure, yes, my brother would receive chocolate and he would probably have it for three weeks, but I ate it immediately and hated him for having some left. I liked the outdoors, I should have been born in west Texas on a big ranch with animals. I was confined so. Fortunately my father, for example, he thought maybe if he embarrassed me in public by putting the bed sheets outside like flags, that would make a difference. Well that upon the teasing. Fortunately I was physically, I was in good shape, so anybody who would start teasing me, I didn't suffer much, because I would beat them up, so my physical status helped me in many ways to overcome this. But it was not a pleasant situation and it was kind of balanced with the enormous amount of love that I received from my mother.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: It's like it sounds like almost the two you know, very, really kind of stern and sometimes brutal father and a mother . <span class="page-break" number="4"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That I still have. When you -- I'm speaking now about "41, the war had started already. In history of course you would see ___ in other countries of the world, you would see a</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> education of everything, German and Germanic, which made you believe that</p><p> we were a superior race. We learned, in an intellectual way, to recognize Jews and others.</p><p>Jews were then regarded as a race, rather than a religion, were inferior. It was explained very thoroughly that even statements made by and other prominent Jews who spoke negatively about their , So to speak, so there was justification. The history of the Jews as nomads and , you learned to appreciate that Jews were inferior or no <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: As I remember it, we used to have, well every German family was supposed to have a little radio, it was called a . The Volkes receiver, like the Volkswagen? It was the Volkes receiver, which was the standard model, if you had more money, you bought a more sophisticated one, but the allowed you to listen to the news, to Hitler and so on . But there were many who did not have the money to buy one, so there were large radios on public squares, people stood around and listened, okay? And so the big news was that a Jew had killed a member of the diplomatic corps and of course I didn't know the name, , that came later on, but it was called the , because of all <span class="page-break" number="5"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What was the mood among you and your friends or other families? Okay, that there's this horror going on outside, things are being broken and thrown, people don't really understand it, there's not a lot of discussion going on at home about it, what was the mood?</p><p>Did you know what was coming ? Did it surprise you that it happened?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I think my generation, we were a little too young to understand, but you would hear those who would make remarks like, all this good stuff, just destroying it, makes no sense and you would hear others say, they asked for it, they asked for it, they had it coming, suits them well. So you had these two parties, and then others who had learned to shut up, to say nothing, and that party was probably the strongest one. They didn't ask. Another party would say, they know what they're doing. Don't forget the, well Germany's a very young country is Germany, but let's say Germanic people, for endless generations, have obeyed government, faithfully, stupidly, without asking questions, and when you read the paper, or you just read the paper in Germany and then this is the truth. Nobody would say ah they lie, papers don't tell the truth, this was the word. So there was no open rejection, resistance, uproar,</p><p> , no. But you have to understand that by that time Jewish <span class="page-break" number="6"></span></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, because when it came to the persecution, that was when they disappeared and there was no argument any more, as a matter of fact, you were not allowed to associate with them, they were not allowed to come to your store to buy, they were not allowed to attend your schools, it was suddenly a war and that was it, so you couldn't argue with them, and say what happened to you, what happened to your father and so on, you couldn't, that was it, you did not know that they were moved to concentration camps. You later on heard j which meant concentration camp, , you heard that, but that was more or less like hearing about, if you don't behave, you're going to end up ina , you're going to end up in a labor camp, but definitely there was nothing known about gassing people, mass executions. was a word like, oh maybe an exaggeration would <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> 0</p><p> played with us, his name was Brendon Brook(ph) and I discussed it when I was in Germany</p><p> with a friend of mine, he said remember Brandon Brook(ph), I said yes, whatever happened to him, I don't know, but we knew he was Jewish, I don't know what happened to his parents, but he played with us and we used to hide them, hide him. He stayed three days with me, we put him in the basement, then he stayed with my friend. We didn't want anything to happen to him, because we liked him, we always, he was a buddy, understand? And whatever happened to him I don't know, because I was arrested, I was gone, so whatever happened to him, I don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did your parents know you were hiding him?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know because my father was, I was pretty much independent at the time because my father was in France and my mother, she asked me questions, where you going tonight, oh you ask too many question, I'll be back soon or something like that was the answer you see, so I was pretty much I had my bike and I was gone. I lived more, more outside that in the house.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But there was a sense that this, your friend needed to be hidden, hidden from view?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, hidden from the Nazis. Oh, there was no question about it, we knew, we knew that they were picked up and sent away and assumed, not only did we, it was not so much because he was Jewish, if we had been friends with Chinese, we would have done the same thing. It was kind of an entire authoritarian thing. We would not allow the police to pick him up, he's a good kid, so let's hide him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you have a first memory of being aware of the Nazi's in uniform, seeing the swastika?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yeah, I think I was maybe eight or nine years old, where I saw for the first time, brown shirts and I saw a man who was frequently drunk and would abuse his family and nobody liked him very much, he became somewhat of a lieutenant or something like that with the SA and</p><p> the first remarks of my father, saying something like, we don't got the kind of <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> 1</p><p> page a little bit and see the part that I enjoyed and that was, first I was the , the young people, 10 to 14, that was the evolution from Boy Scouts, to the</p><p> Hitler youth, which was a small step, really, even the uniform looked somewhat alike and I had been in school in Switzerland for a year, and there was part of the Boy Scouts. So the Hitler youth was 10 to 14, because of the was 10 to 14 and the Hitler youths, the HJ, Hitler youth 14 through 18 and the same existed for , the young girls and the BDM, BDM. BDM means , the association of German <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> 2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: No?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Obligatory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: That was obligatory?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Hmm-mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The same with the Hitler youth?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Let me, let me, let me justify, if you had a son who had flat feet, or he had something that prevented him, then you would be excused, okay, but as long as you were a somewhat perfect specimen, yes you had to go.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you were healthy?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was a perfect specimen, yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so that, did you have to wear uniforms?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh sure, oh yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were the uniforms like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Shorts and often, where I lived in the Rhineland, we adapted , a brown shirt, with the suspenders, brown shirts and a . [had these, what we call in Germany, swallow nest. These little things that meant I was a drummer, okay? I had a little black tie, I got , really very similar to the Boy Scouts. <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> 3 philosophy?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, the is mostly, it's mostly learning to build fires, things just like the Boy Scouts, go out to camp and having some instructions and a lot of physical education, getting tough and some, within the group, wresting matches and things like that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: we should stop and rest - <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> 4 Tape #2</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I wanted to touch a little more deeply on religion. If you could just tell us how you grew up and how important was the church in your family. And then it seems you made some personal choices also, as a young boy, about religious commitment.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. Religion was totally unimportant in my family. The Meyers were not the church going family, much to the disappointment of my grandfather. My father, well let me explain in Germany, you had to pay taxes, church taxes and so you have a little book, if you don't pay for September, then they write you a little note and if you still don't pay, then you cease to be a member, so it's very easy not to be a member any longer. My father decided that he did not like all the hocus pocus and he didn't, he was a little disappointed that the churches did not do enough or presented no resistance at all to what was going on. As a matter of fact they seemed to be very much in favor of it. So he quit paying and he became a former member.</p><p>My mother hardly ever went to church, but not because she didn't believe in God, or she was not a Christian, but there was too much work to do at home. Took them take care of the <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> 5 dormitory. Of course everybody was happy with me, but I knew that somebody would sing once they asked who did, somebody would say I did it, so I told my companion, my buddy, let's get out of here. I was on the third floor, so we put sheets together, it was about 10:30 in the evening, and climbed out of the window, on the street. And I asked him to give me a little money, he did and I said, well let's go. We put the sheets in the garbage can and then he stopped and said, I won't go, my father is going to kill me, no, no, no, so he went into the front door, to wait for the director to come and I took off and I joined then with a girl I had met and that's a little story I don't know whether you want to know about it, but I met her playing hit ball, which is kind of a baseball and we had eye contact and eventually I saw a little more of her and she came to every game and I tried to sneak out and talk to her a little more. Well, I went to her house, she had a little garden and I threw a little stone at her window, she came out and we went and checked into a hotel. I wanted her to go with me, just let's go and I knew that the police would come, the police would come to every hotel to check who was living there and so on and so we took two rooms. And the police came to my room, police, I said look, and I had told her what to say, look my cousin, we went to a party and we have to go, we have to leave early, why don't you let her sleep and so on, so they left her alone, but after that, she joined me and I took her home in the morning, I explained to her parents we'd been to a party, there was no telephone. Very few people had telephones. And they understood, they knew that she was a good girl. So I didn't have enough money to take the train, I thought well, since I was rather unusual I felt, well it would be a hell of a lot of fun to take a barge. I went down and convinced the captain to take me along, I did. So I went by barge down the Rhine River to Dusseldorf, which is most unusual, but it was quite an event and I first met with the guys, they were happy to see me again, I told them what happened and my father was in France already, so I remember my mother looking at me and saying, why are you so different? Why don't you give us nothing but problems? But I would find a way to say, but you love me, don't you, things like that, you know. What is your father going to say? Oh, you don't have to tell him. So, mailmen had disappeared, they were in the army, so we had mailwomen and I had developed a little relationship with the mailwoman, who taught me a little about sex and I told her, any mail that comes for me, give it to me. A letter came from Elsie, that was the girl I had left and I read, I said oh my God, put the letter in my pocket, the letter said, I'm pregnant. So I didn't quite know what to do, she needed help, but my father had come to town that day or a day earlier and my mother thought it was time to change , So they took everything out of the pocket and there was the letter. So my father woke me up, did you sleep with the girl? Yes, sir. If you're old enough to sleep with a girl, you're old enough to become a father.</p><p>And my mother, I see her go to pieces, Paul, he's not even 13, how can you say that? Well, I tried selling things, toys I had, things of value, sent to the girl, who had an abortion by some kind of alley doctor and it ran into complications, my father finally intervened and</p><p> , but those are the things, so it's not only like I beat somebody up, or built a fire <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> 6 youth returned. The Hitler youth, I believe in 41.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you want to join Hitler youth, or you knew you had to, did you say uck?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no. There was absolutely no...</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What did you do?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah, I was fine, yeah it was fine because there was nothing really negative. It meant you had to go to service, I think twice a week, generally on Sundays, and the, I have to tell you another thing about another school, generally on Sundays and it was instructional and that it, you learned the Morse alphabet, or you learned the flags, in the navy, you know, a, b, c, d, x and all. It was a pre-military thing, very physical education centric and then of course I wanted to swim and the only way you could swim was by being a member. Without being a member I couldn't even swim. So I was representing now, the Hitler youth of Dusseldorf.</p><p>Even though I belonged to a swim club, the swim club went into the background and I swam for the Hitler youth. But I was in , which meant I was about 11, I think and the truth is I don't know exactly where they were , but a new kind of school had</p><p> called the Adolf Hitler school. I hate to make that kind of analogy, but it was about as select as the Air Force Academy, something of that sort. A one directional school, and I was chosen to go to the Adolf Hitler school, because I had, my intelligence level was really high, physically I was in top condition and no Jewish blood for at least five generations, so I was a top candidate. That was quite an honor. But before going to the Adolf Hitler school, I was sent, with a group of other candidates to a kind of pre-screening school, where there were certain tests, physical and mental tests. I was there for about a week. When my father heard about that, he said forget it, it's out, you're not going to any, that kind of school. And I hated him for it. And he explained then, with a very few words, saying things like today you won't understand, one day you will thank me for it. So I didn't go. But I was chosen for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you ever talk to him about why he didn't want you to go?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was the other way around, he told me, you now understand why I resented, yes I said, I do and I appreciate it. So he was in many ways very far-sighted and very, very realistic.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You disappointed. <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> 7 Germany at the time, we'd see a wild west film, then definitely, what's the little child?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p>Shirley Temple. Shirley Temple and Nelson Eddy(ph), Jeannette McDonald, things. The funny thing is, I always saw Andy Devine, remember him, the one with the funny voice?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Hmm-mm.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay. I ended up doing a portrait of Andy Devine in Austin, Texas. just an incredible man, I saw as a child, I meet him now in person, only I didn't meet him.</p><p> a thing, because the big event. I think I was 10 or 11, 11 maybe. I, for some reason, I could write like an adult, a weird thing, but I could. So I would make money by writing excuses for other students. My son could not attend today because he had fever, so on and so on, and they would give me one mark or something. But I was very, very good with a pencil. With my fountain pen I of my grandfather, and my <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> 8 when he was in France, so the greatest part of the war, he was not at home.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: He didn't really know exactly what you were doing ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us a bit about the indoctrination, what did it mean when you were required to join the Hitler youth? On your birthday did you have to go down and register and then you were expected to make at these meetings? Did they give you a uniform, what was it like?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: The uniform you had to buy, also those who didn't have the money were given the uniform.</p><p>Since everything is known pretty much like nowadays in the United States, about you, somebody knew, somebody knew about your birthday , so then you were asked to come, the Hitler youth was divided into, let's say the Northwest Headquarters, the East headquarters, south headquarters, so each district of town had a little headquarter and you would then report to your district, okay? And then you would be to be at what time, and when the service would be and when he would come. You would march, you would learn songs, you would go camping and you would participate in social things like going through the streets, cashing money for the winter aid program. That means those who were a little cold, in northeastern Germany, they helped them with clothing and 5 you would have a little box and cash money. You would help, on some comers they had what they called the , where they made soup for something like a <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> 9</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, right. The greater the danger, the more I was for it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you, what other sense did you have about the purpose of the war? How did you make sense of the war?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I don't believe that at that time I asked that question. I know what I read and heard eight hours a day, left some sort of explanation within me, Germany was not the aggressor, Germany was the victim. The Poles had killed a number of poor Germans. Took me a long time to read the true story, but this is what I was exposed to, the Germans than <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> 0</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not every, we lived in the did not suffer much, when you say the did not suffer much, I mean you saw destruction maybe a mile from here, okay,</p><p> and all suffered a little bit but speak about total destruction or just some shrapnels, of course Dusseldorf not only suffered air attack, but also the Americans eventually came across the Rhine River so that you had artillery, so you had from both sides. Anyway, so you, you get used to it and see suddenly a bunch of houses that look like being under construction, but they were destroyed, you see only some walls standing and you hear cruel things like one family decided not to go in the bunker and they were found in bed on the next block, you feel these tremendous deprivations and so you then develop, oh a small minority will say we asked for it, the majority will say, will display a tremendous amount of anger, would say oh, let's help to kill the enemy, so there are very few people, in reality who said, well really, we begun it. We kind of, it was felt that we were right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you? How did you feel?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know. I don't, I don't really know and I don't really, I don't think that any of my comrades, my friends, we discussed it. I believe strongly that we considered this a temporary situation, after all, Germany would win, therefore we didn't take it very seriously. Well, they throw a few bombs, but we're going to get them eventually. I don't remember there's, as a intelligent conversation, but I believe that was the thinking.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You're talking about that you would go to the service, was it actually when you were with the Hitler youth, was there some sort of ceremony once a week, you mentioned singing songs, what was the songs about?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, the songs were typical marching songs, you know. The words were very nationalistic, you know. Tomorrow we have Germany, today we have Germany, tomorrow the whole world, things of that, you know. It was a place on the Rhine River where we had all the tools of instruction, the flags and the Morse alphabet and the pictures and so on. It was a very nice place, right on the water. It was very far from my town, so I had to go a long way, and the truth is I didn't go there very often simply because swimming meets, championships were generally on the weekends, so every Sunday I was in Krefeld, in Essen, and every German city and finally went to Stuttgart or for the German youth championship, so I was gone away. But during the week I was home and on the weekends, we generally had a meet. So in the beginning, before I swam competitively, I went through the service a few times, but it was not that I went there for three years in a row.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: It wasn't a really big, big part of your life?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, not really, no not really, no, I was pretty much married to swimming and to becoming the goalie of the German water polo team.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Tell us about the Edelweiss . <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> 1</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Edelweiss, do you know, is a little flower that grows in the Alps, there's , my brother, who was a year and a half older, fell to his death picking Edelweiss for his mother, and when he was found he had an Edelweiss in his hand. So that was an extremely tragic event in my family. Oh, there was hardly a day that my mother didn't cry, and my father. But Edelweiss has a very, it's much stronger than the Bluebell of Texas. It has the effect that it grows only up in the mountains makes it a kind of a special thing, and means pirates, so is a very good name, but it was not coined by me, as a matter of fact the anti-Nazi movement, called the , that started in Berlin or somewhere, so <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 2 and has a river in the middle and all chestnut trees and so on. Well there was a cafe and on the back of the cafe was a pool room. We used to play pool and we had little meetings there and one would say, we have a new member and we would ask him questions, test him, and why do you like to join us and you know, whether they have some assurance, and then we put, what are we going to do next and maybe one would say, you know, the Hitler youths, they all stored their equipment at such and such a place, let's make it disappear. Okay, when are we going to meet, such and such a time, and that's what we did. It became, it came to the point where we became enemies and people began to look for us because we went a little too drastic, you know we started by deflating the tires, then we made the whole bicycle disappear, so it came to the point where too many complained. Well, I went to see my French friends and I took the bike over to the cafe and the alarm went off. And so we waited for the siren, and it eventually went up, and we knew by the shaking that a bomb had dropped rather close by, so we went out. Everything is dark of course, I mean all the cities were dark. I found that, we found, because there was another guy with me, that, oh I was on foot because my bike had disappeared, I left it outside, it was gone and I went outside, I found, we found a shoe store, totally destroyed and the shoes were everywhere, so I said come on, let's pick up shoes. Put the shoes in my coat, it was winter. Then we <span class="page-break" number="18"></span> 3 you realize the penalty for looting is death? I'd been walking home after an air raid and had helped myself to some shoes that I had found scattered around. From there I spent maybe two hours, questions and questions and.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How old were you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: 16. I would have been, yeah, my birthday was in May, this was in January. And then came questions, the first man sit in front of me and stared coldly into my eyes, while the second</p><p> relentlessly beckoned forward across the back of the room. And where were you before the air raid, he asked, the tone in his voice suggested that he already knew the answer. Some friends, we were socializing. Liar, he shouted, you were with a group of boys planning subversive activities against the Hitler youth. We know about your involvement in the Edelweiss , and we know you sympathize with the French. I wanted to argue, tell the officer that he had no right to accuse me of such things. Unfortunately what he'd said had been true. From there I went, I was transferred to Gestapo headquarters, Gestapo means secret state police. And that was quite a terror, because I was beaten, kicked and I had to clean my own blood and my own vomit and then I was called before a man, I was asked to undress, and one looked at my penis, and he looked at the other and said, he's Jewish. I should explain that there are men who are born almost circumcised and I'm one of them. Matter of fact when I was oh, I guess 11, I began to masturbate and that caused a little problem, it caused pain and like in most cases, like circumcision of the Jews, they just stretch the foreskin and then cut it, so it kind of rolls back and the whole head of the penis is exposed. In my case the skin was glued to the head, so I had to go to the doctor with my father and I remember the doctor looking at me, what have you been doing? I played innocent, nothing face and then he said, well we have to maybe had long needle and my father said, I remember it well, I give you marks if you don't scream. I didn't scream.</p><p>So he loosened the skin, but anyway I looked circumcised. So then they called a</p><p> specialist, a race, a race expert. He looked at me, he turned me, he looked at</p><p> my nose and my eyes, he turned me around, | felt like a prize bull, and very convincing, said, ah, he's not Jewish, forget that part. And I could hardly move, I was so beaten and then I was transferred from there, early in the morning to a prison that was called 5 <span class="page-break" number="19"></span> 4 inspection every day. The floor was polished concrete. There was a lamp that you could pull up or push it, pull down or push up, had a little, little lead balls in it, for weight. And got up early and then there was lunch and dinner, mostly soup and bread. First time I didn't quite know what to do so there was generally a guard with a privileged prisoner, would push the cart with the bowls of food, he would open, and then you have to stand there and donk, donk, give you the bread and then he would lock. The first time, didn't know quite what to do, so I wasn't quite ready, so they locked the door again, I had missed lunch. In the morning they opened the door and you would have to get your big bowl, your sanitary bowl so to speak, and walk down the row and empty it, rinse it out and then you were allowed to do your business so that was the time you were able to exchange some words with fellow prisoners, although there was always the guys that shut up, but what are you here for, what's new and, but that did not teach you much.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What were the guards saying to you__, how were they treating you, why were they saying you were there, because , why were they saying you were there? Was <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> 5 Tape #3</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Before we go into more detail about your time in prison, just want to return to the Edelweiss Pirates and ask you, what were you , what was the purpose of this group?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, if you, well, forced to give you one word I would say anti-authority. We are going into psychoanalysis here. It may be because I hated authority of a, I really did not hate authority of a benevolent man, but authority was always, in my life, somehow related to something bad. My father's authority meant beating me up, the principal authority, there was nothing positive about that, so the guys becoming leaders, telling me what to do, that was no good, so, anti-authority is probably the answer, coupled with lust for adventure.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So it wasn't per se that you were anti Hitler, or anti what was going on with the Jews?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I was much too young to understand that, however, after the war, there were a few members of course who were in my group, they were kind of glorified as the ones who resisted Hitler, but . That's a wild story. No, it wasn't that, but it was interpreted as such. I mean if | wanted to glorify my life, I would probably say at a very tender age, I resisted and fought against Hitler, but that would be a lie, so I was nothing but, as I told you before, it's like a gang, and like gangs fear, kind of resent other gangs and resent the police and resent authority, that's what I did, I resented authority, because to me, authority was negative.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well what , because some of the things you were doing were, in a positive way, part of Hitler's plan for young people, the swimming, maybe going to a special academy. You wanted to do that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: True, true, I was a, let me be a little sarcastic, I was a fine German specimen, as expected by the leaders of the Third Reich. I just took the everywhere. <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> 6</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: , 1 don't know.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I think I should, I should say to you with all sincerity that there's nothing normal about my family. My father a very unusual man in every sense of the word, who spent little time with me when I was a child because he didn't particularly care for me and when I was a youngster he was away. My mother didn't fit in the picture, she was probably the most naive woman of the 20th century. So we were quite unusual, and as my father was a self-made man, I definitely was self-made. Even though I had a relatively good education, but life taught me much more and my traveling around the world, much more than my education in Germany, I was well prepared, like every high school, like every high school boy. So it was my free spirit, my resentment of authority, resenting anybody who told me you have to, which prompt me to say why and that got me in trouble automatically. I sometimes ask teachers why and that was almost like a sin, you were not supposed to ask questions. So I was the one who asked and looked for explanations for all kinds of things, but that does not mean that at the tender age of 14 or 15, I wanted to have a, if there is such a thing, a logical explanation to the existence of Hitler, or to the Jewish question, so no, that's, I would have been a genius.</p><p>That just would have been somewhat unnatural. Would I ask, which I didn't understand why suddenly there was so much anti-Jewish feeling, then the explanation came, well because they have nothing to do but this and that, so they have taken over the university, they have taken over education, they are parasites, they are, they have white German girls, they have done this and this and that, and whether you believe all of that or not, but they're, it creates certain doubts, are they really bad? And as you grew up in this atmosphere, you don't ask questions like is that really all true? No, you accept it and it does not become a dispute within you as far as rationality is concerned.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: , was there some other group like yours in the city or in the country? <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> 7 problems, because I would have questioned the authority of my superior, unless he had treated me properly, in a justifiable way.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did it ever occur to you that you might have been asked to some way be involved in</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> ofJews  _?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Ihave because it was not a navy thing to do, but killing, I have asked myself the question, I don't know the answer to that. I wasn't there. I had to kill a few times in my life, but self defense or whatever the circumstances were. At the time, at the age of 17, if I had been asked to kill, would I have, would I have asked questions why, I don't know that. I do not know that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Let's go back to the point you were in prison, where we were about 10 minutes ago. You've been in prison for a few days now. getting used to it, are you able to have any contact with the "</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh no, I never get used to it. I think it was the third day or the fourth day when a guard came and he was from my part of town. And I assume that he disliked the fact that a member of his district of town embarrassed him in a certain way, so he came, opened the door, and I stood there, with my ceramic pot, he said, aha you, he said something like you are the embarrassment of the town. Shame on you and so on. He said empty the pot in your cell.</p><p>When I come back I want this clean. There was a little piece of, of course I had the water, a little piece of cloth, and I had to clean the cell. It was my first devastating experience so to speak after I'd been beaten up before. Then I had a neighbor, I mean in the next cell, he was</p><p> from morning to evening, , 1 can still here it, that makes ; , his voice was gone. And one of the prisoners told me that he <span class="page-break" number="23"></span> 8 eaten, that I purposely wanted to get sick, that was a no no. So then I kind of gave up and said, well it won't work I have to wait for better opportunities. On April the 12th, April the 12th, 1943, I was taken to court. My trial, the state attorney I think they call it here, district attorney, state attorney, asked for the death penalty. My thought is, first time I saw my father and my mother, my mother couldn't control herself, so she was crying, and my father didn't quite know what to do. There were two attorneys, when he recommended the death penalty, I know they kind of jumped over and hugged my arm and said, that's not the last word. Then kind of the judge and the state attorney and somebody else, some functionary, they kind of argued about whether it was looting, or whether it was theft. The idea was that the two had different consequences. And so they retired and when we came back, the judge decided, or had decided that it was, well before they'd had an argument and the state attorney that, I would call it theft, but this man, having had intimate contact with our enemy, and being the leader of the Edelweiss , having destroyed state goods, and state property, does not deserve any kind of consideration. So when the judge came back and said, on the grounds of his outstanding involvement in athletism, and considering age and circumstances, I condemn you to one to four years in prison. Let me explain, they said, with good conduct after one year, you may be relieved and join the armed forces, and if not, you will remain.</p><p>That was it, and maybe a week later I was put in, what in prison slang is called, I was put on transport. So I was taken to the railroad station, we took a train, and at that time, I don't know how it is today, at that time, if you go let's say from Washington to California, you would not go non-stop, you would maybe go from Washington to maybe North Carolina and stay there a couple of days, three days in a prison and then join other prisoners and form another group that goes and you eventually come to California. So, first I went to Cologne, the prison. And there I was exposed to, it was a dirty prison, to bedbugs and lice and fleas and so on. And we all were set to move in the afternoon, all of us, the one side of the prison had to move to the other side, because we could look into the courtyard and they used to chop heads, so they had executions in the courtyard, if you hear ding, ding, the little bell, so we weren't allowed to witness that, so we had to go the other side.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who would it be?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, whoever was condemned to death, but instead of electric chair they had beheading, which is really not an axe like so many people believe, but is an extremely sharp instrument that just go kind of straight through. So, from Cologne, I went to , that took two or three days. From there to Frankfurt, from Frankfurt I was accompanied to</p><p> where a few of the group, was a kind of security prison for harsh criminals, I was condemned to one to three years in , which was a <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> 9 prison, but it actually is. The front part, the administration building was once a convent. It had walls about three feet wide. And then from there you go this never-ending walk and then comes the prison. Of course most prisons are, there's a cross or there's a star so that from the center you can see all over. And well, like in most prisons you receive your uniform and then you are to go to a cell, and we had, three times a week we had school, which was limited pretty much to German history and geography, something like that. It was very limited to the new Germany, so we talk about nation. There was more indoctrination there than anywhere else. And I assumed that they found out that I was probably at the intelligence level, more educated than any of the others, so I got a job as assistant to the buyer. We bought groceries and sent to the kitchen, the kitchen was underway, it was a separate building on the way from the administration building to the prison proper. And I assure you that if I had been a good boy, I would have laughed at the war, I probably would have gained 100 pounds. And the old guard, you know to me at the time, anything that was over 50 was pretty old, like my grandfather was an antique, you know. And anyway, he was so kind, so good, that I, I was not about to escape from him, because life was a little too good. But in one day, I had to do, I don't remember what, I had to do something, and the old convent building on one side and I remember, and I discovered in one of the windows, there were three bars. Thick. You know, octagonal, they have eight corners or six comers, whatever, these bars, and one was loose. That was just too much temptation. My father was coming to visit and I wrote a little note. I will be at such and such a time at that window, please pick me up and I thought he's going to take me in a car to France and I'm going to disappear. I put it in my pocket. I think I needed a key or something and the note fell out of my pocket and the guard saw it. I never got to see my father. I was taken to the warden, whom I called the spider because he looked like a spider. This immense room and I had to enter a circle, stand there. He had a big nose and his gold rimmed glasses sitting on his nose, said, well, well, mistake, mistake, mistake. I thought you were kind of a</p><p> prisoner sample, an inspiration, and I thought this is probably one I will <span class="page-break" number="25"></span> 0 guards saw me and shot me in the leg, so I fell. Back to the spider. So you have this dialog. I have prisoners who make my life difficult, I like to have a peaceful existence. I don't know why you're that way, but I think that the only way for you is to go back to the bunker, it'll do you some good. Something of that nature. So I went back. Another 28 days. By that time I thought, I picked flies, I picked anything and put it in the wound, so it would become infected. I was too damn healthy for that, | mean my immune system was too damn strong for any bug. But for a long time it stayed open.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Why did you put that bug in the wound?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I thought I would have an infection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And you the bunker 2</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cause an infection, dirty ;</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Cause an infection.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Cause an infection, yeah. That would take me to the hospital.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So you kind of did it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That didn't work, so I tried to find anything sharp and I tried to commit suicide, well I couldn't, I have scars here, all over when I look now. Couldn't get the vein, just a little blood, so that didn't do any good. Well and life goes on and 20 days go past, back to the cell. This time a guard opened the, he ran the hot water. You have no idea how much I loved the man.</p><p>And I think he was responsible for getting me a job to peel potatoes. And I remember maybe the first or second or third day. These are cooked potatoes, I cooked a bunch of potato peels and ate them because I was so hungry, and got so sick. Well, we were given an atlas from the school situation, every prisoner had an atlas, but each map had a back page which was blank.</p><p>And I don't know where I got a pencil, but I had a pencil, maybe I was given a pencil, and I did a drawing, a satire drawing of the warden. Drew him as a spider. Even an idiot would have recognized him. And then I drew two or three guards. That was discovered. Back to the warden for a third time. I'm back in the ring. Well at one time, at one time, I think the second time I was taken to the little , which means the little , not hospital, <span class="page-break" number="26"></span> 1 me to join the armed forces, because there was nobody else who could handle me. And whether he told me or I knew this would be the penal division, I would be first line. So when I walked with the guys, I said, well I said something like, he's trying to make me cannon food, and they all wanted to become soldiers badly, everybody wanted to get out, so he kind of reported what I had said, and I was called. Did you say you don't want to become cannon food, or you refuse to join the armed forces, I think that's what . That's all.</p><p>Three, four, five days later, I was told to get ready, I was being transferred. Where I am going? Sachsenhausen. Sachsenhausen was known as a , aS a concentration camp, and that was, that was bad news. But you have to understand that was, I was not in condition to discuss, to appreciate, to fear. I think it was more of some relief to get out somehow. So I packed and I went on transport, and thankfully I met several other prisoners, and we took the train to Berlin, _ station, there was several cars, we were given some soup in aluminum bowls and water and bread, and there was, well I talked to one prisoner, we talked and thenIslept__, I was pretty weak and there was one who was Jewish and I tried to get away from a conversation, said oh, what are you, I'm Jewish also. I said, oh, okay. That was more or less the end, and I asked him what is the other guy doing, he looked funny. He's homosexual. Oh, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You said that you were a Jew?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. Just because I didn't want a lengthy conversation, I said if] tell him I'm Jewish, he's going to leave me alone. So I went to Berlin, I had to change a train in Berlin and there were only five of us, and one was kind of, well we ended up being three only, eventually, and one, one prisoners made kind of serious , do you remember Einstein? We were like the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost and we will all die and things like that and oh, quit this bullshit, we will live. Got to Sachsenhausen and stayed there overnight, so I never went to the Sachsenhausen camp, I went to a barrack, and somebody told me that I was going to, up ina youth , and whether there was confusion, whether there was misunderstanding, I do not know, but in 1941, Ravensbruck became the most notorious women's camp, where they committed all these atrocities, these medical experiments and so on and when people hear that I was in Ravensbruck they say but you're not a woman, well in 1941, a satellite man's camp, Sachsenhausen, a satellite man's camp, Ravensbruck for men was installed, installed in 41. It had I think, all together a little over 20,000 prisoners.</p><p>Anyway the next day I think I went to the, with the , we were three, and taken from Sachsenhausen to , that is really a short distance, then from you <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> 2</p><p> moment. His family, will they ever know how he died? So then I was deloused and when I bath, when I was in there, was for the first time in a long time I saw there was a woman prisoner who took care and gave me clothes and allowed us to take a shower. It kind of embarrassed me and I was more embarrassed to blush. Then I was taken to an , that's one of those guards in charge, and I met the first couple, and I was told</p><p> which barrack I would go to and you will be part of a commando, you'll do outside work and really there were many satellite camps all around because of all kinds of companies had established factories so prisoners would work, and concentration camps made money with the prisoners, the prisoners weren't paid, but the companies paid the concentration camps, so they had an income. And I wasn't too long, I don't remember how many, but there were three beds, three beds, three beds, one __ the other and I learned eventually that you could buy things in the canteen if you had money and I learned that when one says, do you have any money, do you have any money, the other prisoners. I didn't have any money, why do you need money, oh, can buy things. Somehow I was accompanied by the notice that I was a possible SKP, that was probably part of the dossier that accompanied me from the prison.</p><p>SKP? One who likes to escape.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: SKP, okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay? And so I was a dangerous one, for watching, so to tell the other guards about me, they had left a crown, like a mark, what's it?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah. I don't know how long they , probably a week there or two. I was called, well we had a pill every day, which means the big square, you see, dance, <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> 3 they did with the rocks, but the different layers, the Russian prisoners were at the bottom, the French prisoners and we were on top and what you had, you had rails going up and on top of the privileged character, I had this big, big handle that would bring the lorries, a lorry's a flat bed, these had sides on them, get them down to the mill, and pump, and empty one up and he would pick it up and then go the rail and there you had your little areas, whatever area was destined. I had one prisoner who showed me how to cut a vein, because it's not, you can't be all day long, you have to fill 12 cars a day, that was the 4 means <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> 4 going to die. Days passed, in a few days I thought this is it, I'm going to die, spitting blood, pain, could hardly work. I came to the point, which is very interesting, when you're hungry you fight, you'll kill for bread. Then comes a time where your body doesn't demand any more, you give it away. That's when you're ready to go. I gave away bread. But there was this of my, my body couldn't do it any more, but the spirit was still going strong. So <span class="page-break" number="28"></span> 5 Tape #4</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, so it is 1944, and you're still working. . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it's 1945.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay, it's 1945, and you're working at the rock quarry and you feel, not , but you feel you must do something. One day you decide to do something, that's really what . . .</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I knew I was dying and I didn't want to die there. I said, I have to try to get out of here and if I get shot, well that's better than dying here. So, looked like all the gods and all the angels looked at me and brought dense fog and to test the climate I asked the guard to excuse me, I had to go to the outhouse. He kind of waved like, I don't care, this kind of attitude, as I said, everything was a little lax. See, it was total fog, so I went back to work and maybe a couple of hours later, maybe three hours later, maybe enough time has spend and I asked the guard again, and he waved me along, and I looked and I couldn't see anything and in a moment of desperation, concentration, whatever, I ran. And, of course in retrospect you think you ran 50,000 miles, but I didn't run really far because I didn't have the stamina to run. I was coughing, but when I stopped I realized that as crazy as I was I had almost run in a circle, so I almost came back where I had started, so that gave me a certain impulse to run again. And I ran, mostly downhill, until I saw a, well farmers have these, look like giant carports kind of, where they store hay or straw to keep it from getting wet, so I saw that, I tried to make it and</p><p> I kind of covered myself with the last of straw and the next thing I</p><p> remember is somebody shaking me. I was terrified, I looked into the eyes of the farmer and before I could say anything he said, don't be afraid, I know where you come from, I'm going to help you. Well you have these mixed emotions, is he actually going to take you now to the police and he just wants you to keep quiet, does he really mean it. But you don't have the power any more, you don't have the energy to fight so you just say oh, what the hell. So he had two horses. He covered me in the wagon and drove me to his modest stone little ranch house, from the stalls on one side. He told me that he had lost his son in <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> 6</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: ____ you ended up as ?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, it was infantry division, no I don't, but I was never asked a question. The milk truck, I remember the driver of the milk truck, he thought of doing me the greatest favor in the world by offering me a cigarette. Kind of a self-rolled cigarette and that's the last thing in the world that I wanted. But I felt a little better, but weak and he took me, he left me kind of, you could see the railroad station, he left me there, said don't worry about tickets , there are no tickets any more, you just take the train. I went up there and sit on the bench. I was afraid.</p><p>And I heard some people conversing, I heard about somebody who had escaped, and they were looking for him in the neighborhood of , which was not too far from <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> 7 walking was out of the question, so two guys, I put my feet on and then waterskied kind of, I skied and they took me to the Red Cross. The Red Cross took my temperature and so on, hospital. I said I don't want to go to the hospital, I want to go home. by the way</p><p> , has that been bombed? The whole city's probably, can't tell you. And the <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> 8 and I had to jump on one foot 13 times and then the other foot and he encouraged, see, come on, good boy and so on. Well, with the GI's, actually they drove me on a wheelchair and I used to do sketches, portraits of the GI's, I learned quite a bit of English. I think the greatest shock was respect to you, one of the guys referred to the major, the medical, he's a Jew, he's a fucking Jew, he's no good. And to digest that was very, very difficult. I mean in retrospect I understand, I understand the world pretty well, but at the time, it was, it was, it was confused the hell out of me. But it was shortly thereafter I received my credentials, I think I have a copy here. It was from the, I have it somewhere, from the union</p><p> , from the Union of Former Political Concentration Camp Prisoners, and political prisoners. This was to give me a seat in railroads and so on, because of TB. This was later, from the French police, when they ask I said that I'm a Francophile who has paid for his sympathy to the French prisoners with time in a concentration camp and so on</p><p> . So the first doctor, German doctor I saw, which was the 24th of September in 1946, he said that on the 10th of April 1944, he was 174 centimeters tall and at that time he weighed 42.8 kilos, so that was under 100 I already gained, and with fever and so on and so forth he had contracted tuberculosis in a concentration camp of Ravensbruck and this is made for the military authorities because at the time my father wanted, the idea was TB, you had to go to the mountain air, they wanted to send me to Switzerland, to</p><p> , which was a special hospital for TB patients.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you tell this story about what's happening, it's hard to make it jive with the fact that you were a star athlete, perfect German heritage, I mean it sounds like at that point in the country, the Germans were not just persecuting Jews, but really anyone that had gotten in the way, or perceived to be in their way. What were your thoughts on that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Almost, almost automatically, when people ask me, how long have you been in the states, oh you were , were you in the army? No. What'd you do? Well, I don't volunteer all kinds of information, so I said, well actually I was a prisoner. Oh, what a Russian prisoner?</p><p>No, a German prisoner. Well that of course is a little shocking, I was in a concentration camp. Oh, are you Jewish? That's the first thing. Very few people know the concentrations were full of non-Jews. That is not to say the majority, but yeah, quite a few, anybody who was not in agreement, or presented some sort of an obstacle to the Third Reich was put away. Either put away for good or put away in a concentration camp, or another camp of some sort, so I was one of those, so I was, I had fallen in disgrace.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Were there times when it was happening to you that it surprised you? That you were being treated like that? 2 <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> 9 right, you see people being creative, I know some prisoners who were chewing bread and let the bread dry and made little chess figures because they were more eager in playing chess than anything else. There were others who would denounce anything in order to get a little reward from the SS or from the , so they would sell, probably even sell their own mothers for a piece of bread. You have all kinds of people. And we arrive in a concentration camp , so things don't change much.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The story you tell about the farmer looking at you and asking your age and saying, how could they have done this? How do you make sense of that? How the people who shot people in front of you, who kept sending you back to solitary confinement, how do you make sense of how they could have done that to you?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: I don't know whether I can makes sense out of it, but I have been in many places and I see that people kill each other like flies, in Ireland in 1996. People put bombs there, people put bombs on airplanes. Half a million people died in Rwanda, others are going to die maybe in</p><p> Burundi, so have things changed? No they have not. Is there any country <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> 0 wish I couldn't, but I can. The first time, after I left Germany, in a cargo train, so here I am escaping again. After seven years I returned to Germany and I had prepared how to go back and kill the spider. I remembered him more than any SS guard, especially the Lithuanian SS guards who were the most sadistic ones. No, the spider, the spider was on my mind day and night. I had a gun and I went to the village in which he lived, the village was right next to the</p><p> prison. And I kind of had rehearsed with myself, nobody knew. I said, do you remember me? I'm the one who stood in the circle four or five times, I'm the one you let suffer. I'm the one this and this, you remember me now, does it come back to your senses?</p><p>Then I would have killed him. I went to the house. The lady came to the door and I said I would like to speak to Dr. , that was his name. Oh, I'm sorry, but he moved about a month ago, he went to Hamburg. Well, I didn't go after him in Hamburg because after that came the moment of reconsideration. What do I do, what do I do by killing him, what do I establish in that, so then you kind of put it behind. But that was, that was a moment I will always remember, I went to the door and I hoped I would see him. God, I hated him.</p><p>Because you just don't have a right to make a human or an animal suffer to that point.</p><p>Unfortunately there are people who derive pleasure from doing that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Sounded like he enjoyed it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Getting a power trip.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I think what I'll do is , but before I ask you this, we just don't have the time to go into the post war experience , so I don't think I'll really move into that, so instead of doing it separately, we do want to in on the picture and maybe piece of paper you showed us. because that's going to take a little time , So before I do that, just in this section we hear something, is there anything that might have to your mind in the last couple hours that you thought, well I'll have to make sure I tell, tell that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh well, there are so many little episodes, but it's not really enjoyable to talk about them. It's a little tough so I think, but I told you enough really and I was asked before I gave the interview to bring pictures and I'm very sorry to say that the only picture I could find is a picture of me when I was 15 and you see me in the uniform of the Hitler youth and that was I at 15 and I know that this is true, because my mother wrote on the back this is Walter and the picture was taken by my brother Paul in the spring of 1941, so this is two years before I became a prisoner. I think the certificates have very little value, I just brought them along.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you that closer or just ? Why don't you just show us that one certificate?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><p> A Well this lives any more, but this is a copy, this you'll see is the barbed wire <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> 1 Prisoners and this simply asked the railroad and buses and so on to give me a seat and be nice to me because I had TB. This is mainly it.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The TB cleared up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Pardon me?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Your TB cleared up?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, except when I was admitted to the United States, then an x-ray was taken and I was told, well I'm very sorry but we cannot give you your final documents because we have to take another x-ray and see whether what we see on the x-ray is scar tissue, or whether it's active. So [had to go to a quarantine station in Staten Island I think. They took another x-ray and compared, there was no change, so that meant it was just scar tissue. So other than that, I'm pretty healthy.</p></p></dialogue>
