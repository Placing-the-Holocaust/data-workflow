I was born in 1920, the 30th of April in Poland. Then we lived there for a while.</p><p>Q. What was your name at birth?</p><p>A. Ava Mueller. And I remember that one of the German Gestapo people when I came to concentration camp asked me, you could not be Jewish because my name is Mueller, and I said maybe I'm not, but it didn't help me too much. It shows you -- and even Jewish language is so very similar to the German, so many names, so many words are the same.</p><p>Q. What is your name now?</p><p>A. My name now is Ava Dorfman. That is my husband of 39 years, and I lost him in 1988, on July 3rd, suddenly, very suddenly.</p><p>Q. You were born in 2 <span class="page-break" number="0"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> to , where my grandparents own a building, four story, and my grandfather <span class="page-break" number="1"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> because we were Jewish. The fact that everyone of the six million was a person with loved ones, with friends, with dreams for the future, and then they had to face death by whatever means those murderers had for them. They had a great many of them. Then, since you spoke with me and I really tried to search my mind. I must have really, like excavating the back memories from my brain, and reach so many gruesome stories, that I tried very hard to suppress. I know that lots of Holocaust survivors share those gruesome stories with their children. I don't know what effect that had on them, but before I got married in the United States, I decided if I ever have a family, I would like to establish as a nearly normal life as it can be. I didn't want my children to be sorry for their mother. I didn't want them to have the feeling that they are different from the other children, so I really was very evasive about it. The only thing at night, I had very bad dreams, as my husband was telling me. I sometimes screamed or just said don't let them take me. So I shared lots of things with my husband, and not until the children were in high school and there were many documentaries shown on T.V. and the newspapers and they always asked, "Mom do you know anything about it? Have you been there?" And then little by little I would just tell them, not very much. I have been asked by so many organizations to speak about my past. I refused it. The only time I spoke was the Lutheran Church, and that was only because that the minister there felt that everybody who is not Lutheran is going to go to hell and of course, I just thought I'd tell them what hell really was. That's the only place I spoke. But, I feel right now that even my children encourage me that I should give testimony. Just like my son called me yesterday and he said, "Good luck Mom. I think you owe to the younger generation, because it should never be forgotten what happened." I personally being so attuned to the anti-semitism which is going right now on, not only in Germany, France or England, but in the United States.</p><p>I'm scared for the future generation because just like I hope that the Holocaust in Washington Museum or any other Museums or Memorials which were erected in memory of the six million will be able to educate the people what hatred and bigotry can do, and what they have done even to homosexuals and lesbians. They tortured them, and it was just because they had other sex preferences. We should let the people live for what they are, and therefore I feel that I consented</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But I have to tell you that the last two weeks, I weighed all together 99 pounds, and I'm pretty sure I'm down to maybe 80. I can hardly eat or sleep. It's hard for me to sleep. There comes something that one son knows about and the other son still doesn't. When I was in Vienna I met many people, but one in particular was a medical student. He was like five and half or six years older than I. He visited us when we went back to Poland. Then, as I mentioned, my aunt who was childless, she was very eager to have a wedding, especially at that time, the rumors what was going on in Germany, because I think had in 1932 that Hitler started the revolution already in Germany, and at one point I heard my family speaking, oh he's just a maniac. They don't let him succeed. They will stop him. But how wrong they were. So, at one point, my aunt entertained that maybe we will get married. His family was not very well to do and neither was mine. He found a position in . was near <span class="page-break" number="3"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> stayed in my mind after searching my memory that I pushed my mother in through a window because the train was so jammed that she can go and also in some way was able to place her mother and then she and I stayed a while there. We didn't have any possessions there, but when it start to be very bad, she was married around three years to Doctor and they were located where he practiced, and she and I decided that maybe we ought to go to her home. That progressed so quickly. They started to bomb the trains, and we were just having the hardest time to go to Warsaw which was by plane maybe an hour and a half. It took us four days to go to Warsaw. When we came there, her husband</p><p> , Said, look they are already progressing here. They are vandalizing, even the Polish people vandalizing Jewish homes. I think it would be wise if you and Ava start to make your way to . That's where her parents lived and my mother and Ruzia, and her father was a very prominent oral surgeon, Doctor Katzner. It took us twelve days, ten or twelve days.</p><p>Everytime the train was bombed, we had to jump, no matter how high the train was into the embarkment. We were bleeding all over. Our clothes were torn. We didn't have food. But when we stopped, there happened to be a little town. The people came out and said, what is going on. Tell us where they are, and brought some food out to us. When we find, as you know at that time the Germans invaded Poland there was the agreement between the foreign minister of Germany and who was the foreign minister from Stalin's, from Russia, from the Bog River east of the Bog River the Russians will invade that portion of Poland.</p><p>That of course was this camp . So when we made our way to , she was <span class="page-break" number="4"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> from one apartment or house to another to take a survey as to how many people are there. So, Mother was afraid that they will arrest me because I was the newcomer and they were already there. So, through the contacts of my sister's husband, who was . She was <span class="page-break" number="5"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> day I came and they didn't show her and they say she's dead. That was I think she was only three months or three and a half months old. That took lots and lots of maneuvering really to get the body out so we can bury her near my father, so she wouldn't be alone. That was the end of that.</p><p>But the Russian was not very easy to live under either. They just unannounced would knock on the door, came and took whatever they liked. My mother had some nice china and they wanted it so it was not even would you give me. I remember being just so attached to the drawing that that was my father and never knew him, but from the pictures sometimes he stood at the foot of my bed and I could visualize him and I was a fan of his that he had a very nice and of other literary writers and philosophers like Hiner Shuller, a man, and I thought one day I will have it in my home. Well, it stayed there until the Germans came, but then they raped also some people-- the Russians. They also came and tortured you that tomorrow they come and they emptied out, but mostly they were like and when they find our watches they just have like five watches on one hand and the other, they never had those things. Or they took a nightgown from the women and just wear it as a dress. They were very primitive. My mother felt that they interfere a lot in the war of and when we heard that eventually maybe the Germans come, my mother said, "It couldn't be worse." But once again, she was wrong. At least we were alive. Now, I spoke to a friend of mine who was very young when he left Poland. He's an orthopedist in our town, and I spoke to Andy Solenski, and I said, for some reason as a matter of fact the night before I came here, I said Andy for some reason I feel that the Germans attacked Russia and forced themselves into our territory that there was in 1939 -- excuse me in 1941 that it was in June, because I remember that was my sister's birthday, and my mother baked a cake and asked and the little boy who was <span class="page-break" number="6"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> drunk they came to the restaurant and sometimes with the bottles of liquor stayed and everything they would just push everything on the floor and just destroy it. They took it very hard that they could not operate and support the whole family. My grandmother took very ill and within one week of each other, they passed away. My uncle who was my father's brother, , his daughter is my cousin who lives in Paris, Nira, and is married to a non-Jewish, but non-believer really, a Parisian artist. She has a son Stephen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited Mitchell and I here last year, and he continued to operate the restaurant and we still lived in that house the whole family together. But then they established a Ghetto and they start to line up the people and we had to leave everything behind, and my that I somehow thought I was going to have that from my father, and we moved and I don't remember the street. There was a big building with lots of stories, three or four stories. We moved to an apartment where one and a half rooms, two families lived. My mother and I. Ruzia was still there, and another family with three children. It was very hard. But when the Russians left, &gt;&gt; who were very religious. The father had a beard. The mother had a . Idon't know what it is in English. A wig? Isee. They had a daughter who also by coincidence her name was Rose. Now, today, I think it is multiple sclerosis. She was unable to walk. She was bedridden, and the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund that still going back to the Russian occupation, encouraged the boys, there was Zigmund and two brothers. One of them now a year ago established contact with me , who by the way told me he saw my sister's <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> know. Then the mother did not know what to do with her daughter Rose, and I think she lost her mind. She was just going around the streets and screaming, and they must have shot her because she never came back, and here I was with Mom, myself, and then Ruzia was at that time, and Zigmund was already in the Russian Army and when the Russians were moving away when the Germans came, they followed the Russian army and that's why he felt then it would be better to have the German people come. We had both of the atrocities, and before we moved in with this other family, when I said that we lived in that building that had few stories, it's hard to believe how many people jumped to their death from third or fourth floor. I remember one prominent doctor who did it with his wife together because they didn't want to face what can happen to them.</p><p>Q. Was this when the Germans came?</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>Q. Did you see them?</p><p>A. Yes. So, that's why when you asked me to do that, after 50 years, which is a half century, to really delve into my memory things that I try so hard to suppress, it was very hard for me.</p><p>Then, we didn't have any money, and we didn't have any means to support ourselves and there was already the Germans. I was wearing an arm band with the Star of David and J, Judea. I took off my arm band. I was very blonde, long hair, they say blue eyes. I always thought I have green eyes, and I went to the other side to the brewery, and tried to bring beer, bottles of beer. It was very small, but I still feel that my wrists were very very affected by it. I had surgery here and carpal tunnel, and I just went back and forth and sold the beer to the people who had money.</p><p>Mama was able to get a bushel of flour and make something to eat for us. Then the Germans took over the factories the same that the Russians had, and we start to work there again. But Ruzia was designed to clean the streets, so she came a few times. She was so delicate, so very pretty, and she said as long as the child is here, and we took care as best we can. Mother didn't work anymore, and the brewery was taken over by the Germans. One day she just didn't come.</p><p>One day just like the next day maybe came a Polish man. He was a conductor of a trolley, and</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 0 he knocked on the door and he asked for Ava and I said I am Ava, and he said that my sister is going to be taken to Auschwitz and she's so hungry. She would like to have a piece of bread. I asked him where they are going to march the whole group of people, and he told me. I took my armband off and went on the other side and stayed there while they were walking. The men looked like skeletons and they even picked up anything that was on the street. Sometimes I wonder if it was even something from animals, everything. I saw Ruzia and I just run out and I don't know, there was a Ukrainian or some German Gestapo took my arm and they said</p><p> and I said no, I'm Polish. I throwed the bread to her and she said please take <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 around here and maybe in three months over a year I remember and just prior to the gate I stuffed a little hanky in his mouth and then they stopped us and they said and I <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 Then he said are you sure you're Jewish. I said maybe not, but it didn't help me too much, but then he threw an apple, I thought he was going to kill the child, that was a good gesture, and some candies and they left. I asked once again, what a miracle. Then when I took out Gaynosh, I placed my mother with a neighbor that we used to live way back where my grandfather's house was. We didn't have much, but mama had such small little diamond earrings that evidently my father gave her when they were married. Don't forget that Ruzia was 2 and a half years older so they had some time together. I think her two rings and she wanted me to take it so I can survive.</p><p>They say no, I want you to have that. Maybe at one time they will ask you to do that so they can buy food. So we made like a pouch in her dress that she had. We couldn't take too much with us. There were only two dresses that each one of us had and we sewed it underneath and that was what I left her. My heart was somehow easier because I took care of that. Then, that didn't give me too much time to really do something for myself. We were just taken in big cattle wagons in the concentration camps. So, I found myself there towards the end of "41, 42, and what one saw in that concentration camp, it's really better to repress that. One time, of course they had I think it was recreation for them. Every time at night which were just bunk beds, no pillows, no sheets, no nothing, you just lie there, and roll calls. When it was snowing or raining or thundering that you put your feet like that and sit with your head down and then they would with the rifles would point out you go to your right, you go to your left, you go to your right.</p><p>You never know which one side is better. Then one of them was to be just get away in some means. Sometimes they called it twice a night and then you had to get up at 5:00 to go to work.</p><p>Then they would give you soup which you could find nothing in it. One time they put us there to -- let me say, when you came there, they shaved everyone.</p><p>Q. This is 2 <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 there like a which was like a heap and then they put a big fire and while we were <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 was watching when the people are going out, but the women were not going out anymore. So, one time, around that time, we were selected to help the men dig trenches, and they said, this is not deep enough. The men were like skeletons, no food nothing. Then once again, right, left, right left. Then they put the men facing the trenches and then the music played, famous</p><p> and the . That's how they buried the people or tortured them and <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 going to have to wait. I don't want to tell my mother. Maybe Stashu, her brother, will somehow pick you up and bring some clothing. Then I heard steps, and my heart stopped and that was the superintendent. He said what are you doing? I said I escaped, can you help me and he said my wife is not going to do that. Let me talk to her. He talked to her and she said here is soup. Eat the soup and go. Where would I go? Go back to the cellar. Let me just use your phone and I can tell her where I am. She did that, gave me a scarf so I can cover my head and then sometime it was very, very dark that they came and I jumped into there. They couldn't take me to their home. They placed me in a shack and they brought me some food. I think I stayed there for almost three and a half weeks, until my hair grew to something like you have, so I can go out.</p><p>Sometime very late at night they would let me take a shower and that was a blessing.</p><p>End of Tape 1 Tape 2</p><p> Q. Before we go on, I want to go back a little bit.</p><p>A. All right.</p><p>Q. When you saw those people committing suicide, jumping out of -- did you ever think to yourself that you wanted to commit suicide?</p><p>A. Not then. Not then. Suicide no. I just didn't care. When my mother and Gaynosh were taken there was a time when I didn't care. Only when I found mother's clothing and I knew that she was no longer alive, then I had that great desire to fulfill my promise to my sister. Because when they took her to Auschwitz and I threw that bread if she caught it or not I will never know, and shear miracle that that Ukrainian or German let go of my arm and didn't pull me together through that marching group, I felt, I have to fulfill my promise to her. Suicide no, I'm just not geared to it.</p><p>Q. Were you afraid of being raped?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="12"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 6 A. Yes, that I was. And by a very great miracle, even later on when I was in Vienna, where I will tell you from the point when I enlisted remind me to tell you about a very close call to rape and I will touch on that. I'm trying to do it sequence as possible. Have you have any other questions?</p><p>Q. Yes. When you were escaping -- A. From the concentration camp?</p><p>Q. From the concentration camp, but I want to ask you both about the escaping about taking your mother out, about taking Gaynosh out. It seems very brave to think about going outside and taking the chance?</p><p>A. It was not so brave. There was really guts and the will to do that. I was bringing really income to the family by going everyday out to the brewery, taking my armband. Good, I was blonde and blue eyes as they say, but nevertheless it was going out, facing -- it was like two different cities. Ghetto was all Jewish the other side was not. That was taking a chance.</p><p>Walking through the streets and seeing them marching and looking at you and pretend that you are just hah-hah and you just smiling good day. That was brave. But then when they took my mother out, I didn't do it by myself because there I have the help once again of the Jewish boys who also took mother out to Gestapo headquarters and then she was going out to our area where we lived. That was brave because where my father lived, we were known there. Where my grandfather lived, we were known there. She was there I don't know how long, but it must have been at least to that year that I found it unless they kept the clothing that long, but that was in the beginning of 1943.</p><p>Q. How did you go out everyday, through the gate?</p><p>A. No, through the other street that was just a hole and I was just making my way out because there was no wire in the Ghetto. There were just streets. If you knew the area you could just try to get out, and that's how I went almost every day.</p><p>Q. Were you afraid?</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. <span class="page-break" number="13"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 A. Yes, yes. Because I wanted to go back. As said, my cousin from England, my mother always said Ava is so brave. That was under good circumstances. Until today, I am the do gooder, always for other people. I do it today, too. I think that's my nature, but then my mother was a widow. We didn't have money, and she was working, and she was very active in an orphanage house. Her name was on the orphanage house, so every time when she was saying to us, to both of us, if you feel that you are deprived, just look at the children who are much worse off, and then you see how lucky you are. Then, I said, well, how lucky we are. But then I did the same thing with my children when they didn't eat, I would just say, see you don't finish, people in Europe would give anything for crumbs, and Mitchell was always joking and he said, mother, pack the crumbs and send them. But both of them grew up to be very charitable. I remember we were in New York and walking through the streets there was a man without feet and a beggar and Mitchell said can I have my advance 25 cent allowance. I'll pay you back, and then he went and gave to the man. You live by example. You live by example, and therefore I feel that the children, whether it be German or Polish or Lithuanian, they don't grow up with prejudices. They're taught. They're taught, therefore, I feel that really the United States Holocaust in Washington or any other museums are memorials that were erected in the memory of this six million will somehow educate the people and let them know what hatred and bigotry can do. Not only to a group of Jewish people, but it could be an individual what they have done to the homosexuals or lesbians or to any other group. One day they may turn because they are catholics, but I think I always think that Hitler couldn't do those atrocities by himself. He got the masses to follow him. That is the tragedy. How blindly people follow. One, it be crazy or irrational and do what is absolutely against any principle to being a human being. This is what is hard to understand for me. Do you have any other questions. Maybe I didn't make myself clear.</p><p>Q. I'm interest to hear a little bit again about your escape from camp on the <span class="page-break" number="14"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 8 sister Ruzia. I had a desire to escape, and in that time, no, I wasn't scared. If they would have shot me in my own heart I know I placed Gaynosh and I placed my mother. I didn't know what their fate was going to be at the end, but at that time I felt good. When I was working for that Gestapo who was that sadist cleaning his house, and then I had to go to the barracks. I didn't stay, but I came there almost at 4:00 to his house. 4:00 in the morning, without any food, and when I spoke to that Jacob and I told him just drop me off some pants. I cannot go in a dress or skirt because there was just that outfit. When he brought that, he said you will have to fall in at 5:00 and march with the men, but you are so short they're going to spot you. I said don't worry, if they shoot me, they shoot me. Don't worry. Just give me a chance. There was a big gate, and there were dogs and people with rifles to shoot when they didn't like somebody. Maybe somebody looked very fragile and they didn't let them go. They just pulled them out and shot them right there. This we saw too. Then everybody tried to stand up straight so they still with their last breath of their strength could go out. I marched in and tried being short to get closer and closer to the first, second row and then just outside the gate was the trolley that took them to the factory. Then, when I started to walk faster and faster, someone of them spotted me, and they started to "halt, halt, stop, stop, stop." Nobody stopped. They were marching and I quickly tun into the trolley and said to the conductor. I'm escaping and I'm not even Jewish, I'm Polish and I'm trying to escape because they took me by mistake, because I didn't know what the Polish person was thinking of the whole story neither. So, I said they shaved my head and I have to go and find my family. When they came almost very close to the trolley all the men were there and he took off and they were shooting and he said, I don't stop, I go. He said in Polish</p><p> , we go. But unfortunately later on I know that they shot that Jewish younger <span class="page-break" number="15"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 9 Q. Go ahead continue on when you were hiding.</p><p>A. All right. I was there in that shacks, two shacks, like I have one now in my own house.</p><p>They brought some food when it was very dark, because they still don't know -- there was a cluster of homes of the directors, the higher ups lived on that area. Higher ups like the directors of the brewery and things like that. They didn't know what is going to happen. But when I came there, my feeling was I'm going to see Gaynosh, and I said where is . Oh, they didn't want to stay here because they were afraid of the Germans and they went to Czechoslovakia, and they took Gaynosh with him. Gaynosh is Gershin named after my father like my son Gary is always named after my father. Then she told me that after the war I can find her, which I will tell you what I did after the war. I stayed there I think to my best recollection of three and a half weeks, to gain a little hair and then one day came and said you know what, I spoke to Wanda she's in and she and Peter are working in the underground. They are helping lots of Jewish people and also bombing the bridges so the Germans cannot go from one side to another. They said that you should make your way to</p><p> because lots of people registered as Polish to go to Germany or Austria. Of course, I wanted to go to Vienna because I knew so many people. In that time, I just once again, took a chance and went to by train. Somebody could recognize me. That's that famous blouse that you have the picture that gave me, and one skirt and that is all that I had. I registered. I had to wear an armband that said P "Polish." They asked me if I would go to Berlin first, and I said no, can I go to Vienna, Austria, preferably Vienna. Of course you could speak like a Polish. You could not speak like a Jew. The Germans said do you speak German and I said yes. I went to work in Vienna. is -- have you ever been in Vienna Joan? You know where the , Just on that street, which you come out and you cross the , which is just like Fifth Avenue in New York. Then you have that</p><p> . This is where . There was a Nazi. What was his first <span class="page-break" number="16"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 That's what we did. We found by midway there was five of us who registered in different areas.</p><p>But somehow we find ourselves working for that Mr. Shiltz. My name is --- I'm still in . I lived longer -- excuse me, I retract, I was in living <span class="page-break" number="17"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 somehow took to me, his wife too and those two children and the little one. He said come in here and I said yes. Do you know what the word is. You never heard of that. Then there were other Jewish expressions and I said how would I know that. Well, aren't you close to the Jewish people. I said, well they could be my neighbors but they did not know the language. Then that man that I worked for that sadist one day he came in 1944. He came in Shiltz, Heil Hitler and of course he was such a Nazi and I don't know how I possibly put my head so deep down that he doesn't see me. Maybe he would not even recognize me. I had hair and looked different, but I thought my heart stopped. He was talking about us, Shiltz, with him, because they were looking at our side. I couldn't say anything to the girls because I didn't know they were Jewish. So, they say, is something wrong. I said no I just see that is here. I wonder what he wants. Maybe he is looking for Polish girls because Mr. Shiltz talks to him. IfI get nervous I talk. As you know, I told you that, and finally he was going like toward us, but there was a little T.V. and that was the time that the Germans had lots of trouble in Russia. As a matter of fact, one of the Jewish girls, the only one I don't know her name, she was from Lodz of course in the Irish papers she was Marisha, but what I understand her brother was a famous Jewish historian. I don't know her name and she was singing or reciting the</p><p> you know, backwards. March, march forward and then backwards.

And she was looking at me and looking. I couldn't swallow. I had a cup of soup, and I couldn't hardly swallow. She just have noticed my uneasiness and finally she came over and she said, hello. She said, are you hiding. I said no, I'm working here, a Polish girl. Where are you working? I say ina German place. She said, you can tell me, are you Jewish? I said no, and she said you can be honest with me. I would like to help you. I watched you. I must have been in the restaurant before. You always have the same outfit. Can I buy something for you, and I said, that's the end. She must be from the German Gestapo. I said, I don't accept anything from people. She said, what's your first name? I said Ava. Ava, ah,</p><p> , I said Ava, I'm Polish, and she said, confide in me because I will confide in you. I am Jewish. My husband was not. That's why we don't live together, not to bring harm to him, but I have a son I wish you could meet him. His name is Eric. I said I cannot date anybody because that's against the rules. Well, where are you working. I said not ar away from here and she just extracted from me and I said , and she said I give you the address.

He never tried to do anything to me. He just said can my mother -- not he, can my mother buy you -- you will make her so happy. I said no I don't need anything.</p><p>So, one day he came and he told Mr. Shiltz. He didn't ask me, but he asked Mr. Shiltz if he could take me overnight to -- he named her name, I remember only her name was Elli and she was in the . I don't remember the street. She owned a shoe store and a most beautiful apartment and a very known husband of a , and she was a Nazi. He asked Shiltz that he would like to take me for a date there to a party. Then I found out that she took over the Jewish families, the store, the shoe store and all his apartment with beautiful things, with paintings that maybe you see in Louvre, and a big bust of Adolph Hitler. Then came some other young soldiers that they came from Poland, SS men to the party, and Eric was there too. This young man who was maybe half drunk he was telling the group something that would amuse them. I just came from near Limberg where we tied each child to a branch of the tree and put it aflame. And he said, why don't you laugh. I don't know. I don't find it funny. They are human beings. But they were Jewish. I said, oh, not to get myself into trouble, and Eric looked at me and he said, well I have some plans to take to show her a little bit around because she can not really go as a Polish girl. He must have seen something on my face, and I don't know if Ellie knew something or not, but she always felt that I'm her . She took to me. One time she came to Shiltz, Heil Hitler, she wants to take me to the Gestapo.</p><p>Remember marching up those big headquarters, all those steps up with all those swastikas and I went there and she said could you say Heil Hitler and I said Ellie don't ask me to do that. I'm Polish. And she said, "I'll protect you." And she introduced me my . But she didn't use Rutkofska. My , so I didn't have to add that. Then when it was very <span class="page-break" number="20"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 many shoes as they can, and that was my revenge. At least to her. I never saw Eric or anyone.</p><p>But you spoke about the rape, but when the Russians came into that part, which later on they retreat on the other side of the Danube, I was living with a family, a German family who were Ellie's friends. He was a piano player, blind, very nice family, and his wife was Maria. They took me, so when the officer of the Russians came, they caught me in that building and asked to bring it down. This person laying down on the table and he said, "I'm going to have intercourse with you." And somebody went quickly upstairs to I think his name was Paul, that blind man I lived with. I don't remember the last name, and he came blind with a stick and he said, let my sister go. That's how close I was to it. Just because he was blind, I think, that that's what really took that person back.</p><p>Q. This was a Russian soldier?</p><p>A. A Russian officer. Then I understand that many people in that building worried, and then we heard that the American soldiers came on that side and I came down walked on the street and there was an American soldier and I didn't speak English an I said American and he said yes.</p><p>Name? And he said Orbanik. I said are you Polish? He said, yes, no speak it. Never even tried to find him, but then I don't know with that United Jewish restitution who came with the packages and everything like for the Jewish people or was it that what was that?</p><p>Joint Distribution, that's what it was. So, Icame. I didn't have any food, nothing too much, and I said, I'm Jewish and I would like to register and they said, but you don't look Jewish. I said, are we going to do in reverse now. Hitler thought I do, and you say I don't. He said, well, everybody would like to be Jewish to be a package. I said, that is unbelievable. Then there was near the river and there was not far away from the , | was walking along and <span class="page-break" number="21"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 5</p><p> and I had to recall when I met her she had always that beautiful hair growing all round. She was the first one to tell me where my mother was hiding. She came across in another hiding place with my mom, but then she was very good financially off so she was able to go to a safer place and she never saw my mother again. So, she said, I hope you're getting food and I told her what happened. So, she said, , it must be like some name, let me go with you to the joint distribution and let me be a witness and I have that paper if you want to say Anna</p><p> and I forgot his first name. They married eventually. He was in film industry and they made a statement that I didn't know how to write -- read Jewish. They asked me to read that Iam Jewish and I got a package with eggs and milk, and I broke out because I didn't have anything for so many years and to this day I cannot have eggs because I break out. I just can have egg beater when they came out. That's how it was that history. So after I didn't have to work anymore in Shiltz office, I start to enlist with to somehow finish my education in the business administration and I met a Valerie. Her father was a veterinarian and we made very good friends, and that was still before they recognized me that I'm Jewish, because that happened in 1944, almost the war was over. No, no, no, that happened in 1946, after the war was already over. She invited me to her home to introduce me to her parents. They were very nice to me. They asked me to live with them. Then, in one Sunday dinner came Victor who was a dentist and he started to just ask me out. Polish, that's what they talked. They were very happy that we're going. They liked me, but they said that they were . You know, when <span class="page-break" number="22"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 was a Viennese. I start not to see him, but after when I start to inquire, my mother had a cousin that I know that he sent her sometimes five or ten dollars because my father and my mother helped him when he was a young man to come into a big city from a small little . lam still in touch with his daughter Sadelle, in New York. She's married to a banker. He tried to work with the restitution during this period. The papers started to be processed for me to come here. At that time I denounced Victor, that he's an SS and his practice should be taken away, and I liked him, but I felt I had to do it. I did it. He tried to find me, because he knew me as a Rutkofska. I saw him one time when I was with my husband, the only time in Vienna he was working and he turned around and I turned around but that's all what it was it. Never called, nothing. It was hard to live being somebody else. It's not easy and especially when I was not recognized. I had to go on for the longest time to pretend, otherwise I was no one. But then, I decided to go to Czechoslovakia. I had to find Gaynosh. That was the whole purpose. So, I make myself wait to go to Czechoslovakia but I was . I didn't belong anywhere.</p><p>Q.

As a matter fact, I went to Parochial schools. And I have in my family people who are today practicing Christianity, but then I knew a friend from Poland, and she was married to a doctor at the same hospital where my future husband now was working, which was the University Hospital in New York City, where my husband <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 I live since 1954 when I came with my husband at that time. The people were very nice. They tried to . Inever knew what that is, but they were very friendly and I spot that.</p><p>That was in 1948, memories it was very hard to remember everything, and I even forgot that I was in Springfield. When I sent you the clippings I said I was looking for some papers, and by coincident I had the clippings from Springfield Massachusetts. Joan, if I wouldn't see my picture in that article, I cannot recall that I was in Springfield Massachusetts. No way. I remember I was in Syracuse University because over there they once again, pretty girl with blue eyes and I always thought I had green eyes, said now Ava Gardner will speak to us. Of course I don't know who is Ava Gardner. I didn't see any movies, and I waited and they started to laugh. It's me. So, right now, before I came here. I tried to contact the Utica Observer Dispatch, which is a newspaper, and they told me that if it's "48 or "49 it would be on microfilm in the public library, which I got the clipping that I showed you. Then I called the library and the University of Syracuse, and they send me a clipping which I showed you.

Then there was a position in Rome, New York. We didn't know that Rome was horrible at that time. I couldn't believe that I lived there. Then my cousin came from Paris she said this is a slow death. Why are you living here. We don't even have a movie. We have to travel 20 miles to a movie. But a close knit family, and if you are part of the society or the community then you grow closer. My husband was chosen among 14 other radiologist one of them Jerry Segal, who is in Utica right now, and is glad that he didn't take it, because there is very anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my husband never delved into what is going on, so when they proposed to him, he said fine I like to play golf but then when he found out that we would be the only ones, he felt very bad. Later we learned that three voices were against only because he was Jewish and the vice president of the , Charlie Getty, who is a <span class="page-break" number="27"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 1 degree. However, once again tragedy struck and we have been married 39 years and children start to make preparation for our 40th wedding anniversary and on the fourth of July 1988, Gary and his family we pick them up at the Syracuse Airport with their little daughter who was 2 1/2 or three years old and we went to our house. We had a wonderful Saturday, that same day. I had some people for dessert in the evening, and my husband said, well it's late but we don't have to get up next morning, Sunday, so early. He never woke up. I found him sitting in his chair gone.</p><p>End of Tape 2</p><p> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Ava you were talking about the loss of your husband and how important he was to you.</p><p>A. Well, he was not only a husband, he was a true friend and I didn't speak about my experiences but only with Milt. He was a very kind and understanding person. I know that the patients former patients of his are still saying when Doctor Dorfman was here they must have thrown away the mold, how the saying goes. There isn't a kinder person that you can feel like at home especially when you have radiology. You go into that big machine you need somebody.</p><p>At night evidently I had very bad dreams and sometimes I'd say don't let them take me. I had to explain to him what I meant. But one time I think when Gary was around 17 or 18, he was just to graduate from high school, my husband was taken to the hospital with a heart attack. That was the only one. He was on very minimal medications and everything was wonderful. As a matter of fact, that fourth of July when the children came to visit us, Gary could not come very often because he is so busy. It was only because ten days later we were supposed to go to Alaska where I was taking a group of Senior citizens, and he and Doctor Brown who is on the picture with with me and his wife were supposed to go together. Gary persuaded me that I <span class="page-break" number="29"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 3 remembers when I said "He's so cold, he's so cold." I was in shock. They didn't know if I'm going to get out, but they used to have a friendly poker game every Friday in the Sentinel which is our newspaper. When Milt died, they never resumed it. George Waters and Shirley said, George doesn't face anyone without Milt. He was very recognized professionally. He was president of the whole Society, not only locally but for the New York State. He was a very good</p><p> , was a wonderful husband and friend, and a wonderful father. When you read the clippings, which maybe I left you, he did volunteer radiology for the DDSO, which deals with the mental retardation and they provided a portrait of my husband. He looks exactly like the write up that Gary put for his obituary in the medical journal. It was a whole dedication with lots of friends invited and the mayor of our city, Carl Ilemberg said that he doesn't know in his history of serving everywhere he comes from Rochester that two people in the same family would be honored because there was the dedication and the whole radiology department and the DDSO is Doctor Milton Dorfman. And of course, as you know, I think I mentioned one time to you Joan initially when we spoke like a year ago, that when I saw the mistreating in the concentration camp of the elderly in particular no mercy, and I was so close to my grandfather and grandmother, I said to God, whoever he was at that time, that when I survived the concentration camp I will do something for the elderly and for the children, and I left you the write up. You'll see that I single handedly I was able to try to get and through <span class="page-break" number="30"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection</p><p> 4 Citizen's Council and the movement in the room I called the University where he is the President of the third world, and I said I would like to speak with Monsignor Faye, and he said who shall I say is calling, and I said he would not know me, but I would like to speak with me. So, he came to the telephone and he never said Monsignor, he said Father Faye and I said Monsignor you would not remember me he said "Hello Ava." He said it there was 400 people</p><p> which is a big beautiful place and he said how can we forget Ava. Then, just by the Senate and the Congress they proclaimed the whole day Ava Dorfman. I told Sheri Bolet who is the Congressman you have to give me at 8:00 in the evening the day is almost over. I hope -- the one thing I will say that God helped me to fulfill my promise, because I started just calling a meeting of the retirees from the manufacturing from cable and I'll call and and <span class="page-break" number="31"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 than the Triple A pays and I aid how much I owe you. He says nothing. He shows me a picture, like a newspaper picture of a girl and he said you paid a lot. I said, how did I. Jackie was in your speech therapy and she was stuttering and having a clef palate and you sent her to Kim Janet in Hunter New York. You have done wonders because she is now graduating from college.</p><p>So, there is you don't ask for rewards but whatever you do good to people it comes back and I feel if my children, and I see them living by that example, and when I sometimes used to say to Gary how come you're getting so late for dinner. Well, mother it would make you feel good. I went to the ward where they are really forgotten elderly people and I just thought I'd see what they are doing. I was happy. I was happy. My husband was also very active. He was the first chairman, president of the . He tried to be active, and most of all was very kind <span class="page-break" number="32"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 said, now that you've had your fun, can have the child have some water. He once again thought that that was very brave and Jews wouldn't do that. Am I not Jewish and I said no, I'm not.</p><p>However, they put the other bucket and the child crawled again and he kicked the child in such a way that we couldn't even look around because we couldn't turn our heads. Then he came and struck me over my face and I had a big scar here. Now, I had the surgery I never know but everything happened on that side. It was not the strap but what he did. That is what I would always remember. There were many other incidents too numerous to mention. I mean the hanging of the people or putting dogs, vicious dogs and seeing the flesh taking of the people. I don't know. It was 20th century and the German people were supposed to be so civilized.</p><p>Where is the civilization taking us.</p><p>Q. One last story. When you were waiting to come to this country, you were waiting for a ship called the Lillymarlane?</p><p>A, From . At that time there was a strike an they could not move the boat at <span class="page-break" number="33"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 there and he said, well, why don't you don that for me. I said I wouldn't do that for you. I wouldn't do it for me. He said, well it seems like you are determined. I will tell them that I have a different job for you. I don't know what I did and Henry said she won once again. Well, won or not won, it was degrading to me after the war that they had to do once again that dirty job.</p><p>But, as they said when I came here it was not so easy neither because the cousin of my mother had an aunt from his wife's side. We never knew and he was on vacation when I came. He came in July and he was with the children Sadell and Julius and he asked me to be with that aunt.</p><p>Very uneducated and she had a daughter Molly and Molly came in and asked me how the dress looks on her. I was always and I said not so good. They didn't know that in the United States you always say oh nice lovely and she felt that that was very offensive to her. At one point she said, hatred did not do that to the Jews in the United States so it <span class="page-break" number="34"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 there was a Time Magazine and they had an article just around the corner because they lived just around the corner. She asked me that she's very sorry that she would like to help me, to give me anything they wanted and I said no. You could have saved your family and maybe us, but you asked Zigmund only to come and leave Ruzia and her little boy alone and your family said Shiva and tore his garment and he wants you to know that. Then she called my sister-in-law Blanche how she can get me. They tried very hard then I married and I said I don't want anything from them. But one time I was maybe, a year ago, that's how I find I said to Mitchell in New York City, you know I wonder if she is still alive because she had a practice and this is the time that we found in the telephone book .

And I think I will do when I visit Mitchell at the end of this month as I'm going to the Survivors of the Holocaust they are having gathering in New York City. It's not going to be easy, and this is why maybe a whole year that you are trying to make contact, I didn't want to say something that it's not accurate, and it will take me a long time to return to be half normal. I cannot ever be normal life. In the beginning we didn't have too much, but then we're comfortable, and I still would not spend on me to buy a suit unless I'm pressed to it, but I would donate $5,000 to a cause if it would be for a good reason. It's hard when you eat dinner and remember my sister saying that she's hungry. You don't forget that. You can keep on the bottom somewhere in your memory but it stays with you. Any my mother now that I'm definitely over 42 and I realize that 42 is very young, it's a young life and Ruzia never fulfilled her dreams neither and my uncles and aunts. I lost 58 with the immediate family not counting farther relatives. lost her father even he obtained papers and went to practice in Warsaw as a Doctor Wosinski. It didn't help them.
