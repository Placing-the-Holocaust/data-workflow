<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh I'm sure not. I'm sure we were frightened now that you get to it.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: This was a relative who came to your house you mean?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No this was a poor soul who had a sister and a father and they were, they came from Klagenfurt which is the provinces and they had been chased out the very day that Hitler arrived.</p><p>And all she could do to get food on the table was do domestic work so she came to us. And a very sad soul whom I remember to this day. And then my father --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: How did she know you all?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh she didn't know us. My mother somehow -- recommendations. I don't know, somebody recommended a needy case. My mother was always ready for needy cases.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Had you ever heard him speak over the radio before 38 any of his speech --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: I remember sitting in the living room with my parents, listening to the radio but I didn't take it seriously.

<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23, 2014 10</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Iwas 11 and, when they marched in and I was even younger before. When it began.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So that's when the big change happened at the Anschluss. Did you see Hitler at that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Inever saw him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: You never saw him.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No but I saw the guy you know the SS and I saw them marching in front of my windows and screaming and you know that was immediate. The night that he marched in, we still had the gentile woman working for us and my parents happened to be at the theater that night and weren't home. And it was very frightening, hordes and hordes of people marching in front of the windows. And you know my sister was even younger. She was seven so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did your nursemaid, governess, handle that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was actually the maid and that wasn't our governess and she didn't handle it all that well. And when my parents came home, they found that the gas was on. So she didn't stay with us much longer. But it could have, if they hadn't come home when they did, god knows what would have happened.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. What was it like to see these soldiers marching and hear the sound of the boots and things like that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: That was frightening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What about, did the swastika have any meaning to you? At that time?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: It conveyed a lot of enthusiasm of the masses from which I was excluded. That's what you <span class="page-break" number="7"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23, 2014 11 know, it didn't quite hit me just what they were doing. Yeah, that they were going to kill my grandparents and everybody else.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: The Anschluss happens and then and you go to school and you have to stay in the back of the room and then what was the next development?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The next development was we were told that we, in my school that, it was a gymnasium, an academic gymnasium, that we could not continue there. That the school was closed down. And that only the top students in the city would be allowed to enroll in the one Jewish gymnasium that existed.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: But the gymnasium you were in was not a Jewish --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, but women's, you know not institution but a women's school. So they had to qualify for that other gymnasium with grades and so forth and I did qualify and I was accepted to it so I was happy that I could continue my academic education. And my sister was younger so she --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: She was in the earlier school?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yeah and that could continue til fourth grade. So there was no issue. I went to that school in September in 1938 but it really didn't have the greatest effect on my life, except that I felt good about being there because we left you know several months later. You know four months later.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: With your relationship with your parents, did they talk over as things were --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: They were very supportive all the way whether here or in Cuba or anywhere else. It was fantastic when I think about it.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But I meant when you were younger, before you left Austria, were they open with you in discussing what was happening? <span class="page-break" number="8"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23, 2014 12</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: They didn't hide it. I didn't feel that they hid anything, were hiding that. It couldn't be hidden. It couldn't. They were open I think. Maybe not completely. I mean we were children. I just can't gauge that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But you weren't allowed to go out on the street then?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By myself, anyway. And we were, you know I was afraid to be. And going away in the summer and for instance on the ski trip that, with the school that was just the week before March in where you could, there you could feel the Nazism in the mountains. It was completely so.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: How did you feel that, in what sense?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: You just felt it, that we were surrounded by enemies. And the amazing thing is we were on the slopes and it was a second year gymnasium which is the sixth grade class. Skiing and on the slope with us was the Duke of Windsor who had just abdicated I think or something. He was in the process of marrying her, the Duchess of Windsor. But anyway, we felt it there. I mean totally because we stayed at the type of place that you know in the mountains where there were no Jews. It was obvious that it was their town.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: You yourself didn't experience any direct anti-Semitic --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well it was coming pretty soon. I mean my father's business.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What happened with that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: That, a commissar was put in which meant that he oversaw the whole business and eventually it was taken over and he had a lot of good friends among the gentiles who suddenly became big shots in the Nazi party. But so I think that he was somewhat -- he was somewhat in better shape by some unseen protection you know. But so that, the business was going and what else. How did -- <span class="page-break" number="9"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23, 2014 13</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Do you know if they had any, if your father or mother had any relation or communication with their families in the other, you know far away?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Well that, they immediately tried to get us out. 1 mean they knew we had to leave. So --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: To go into the countryside you mean?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, no, to go abroad. Is that what you're asking?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: No, they offered to take us into Poland. My father didn't think that was a good move.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Right. Ok.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So we didn't move. He wrote to relatives in other countries.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So that's when he started to write to --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Yes, immediately. So they wrote to Palestine and to the United States and I had some cousins in Palestine and his brother and the cousin didn't answer and my sister years later said it's a good thing. But anyway so didn't answer. I had cousins in New York who did answer.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Who did answer.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Did answer and who you know gave us an affidavit and helped us elaborate the roads through Cuba and all that.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: At that point, what did America mean to you, as a 12 year old? <span class="page-break" number="10"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: But something very positive?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes, yes. I had met actually those relatives were on their honeymoon in Vienna a couple of years before and other people too and whom, you know it sounded like an unknown wonderful place.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Your father got papers, got the affidavits from the New York --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: From the family in New York, in New York. And then there was another issue that, you know the Kristallnacht. You know that. So do you want the sequence was that they came to our house and they went from door to door and took out all the men from the whole building. You know and they came to our door. They read the name. The name is Schachter and somebody gave the order, skip that door.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: So they skipped our door and went on and we could hear the screams in the streets and could hear the glass breaking and everything else but we were saved for the night.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Do you know how that happened?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, I never found out but we were sitting in the ante room, the large ante room, actually waiting to be invaded and my father said would you like me to go out so that we get it then over with. And so we said no. And that's when they skipped us and, but we could hear everything and I've never forgotten it. In the streets and then after Kristallnacht when the others were transported you know to god knows what destinations. My father was contacted by some Aryan friend of his or formerly friends and now Aryan. But they were still friendly and was told that he had to leave the country by December 31", 38. Otherwise that nobody could vouch for anything. That wasn't likely to leave. <span class="page-break" number="11"></span> https://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alize Barzilay January 23, 2014 15 Anyway so they intensified their efforts to get the exit possibilities and the, so America was so, I mean the United States was the possibility. But we also needed a document called an unbedankleischtide [ph] to get out of the country which had to be gotten from the Nazis and which wasn't available so quickly. We might not have it by December 31". So we decided, my parents decided to split the family up. And so that my father and my little sister who was adorable would go on New Year's Eve and try and cross the border because the guards would be drunk. They thought.</p><p>And we would stay and wait for the paper and then see if we could exit properly and perhaps ship some of our stuff overseas and so await us later on.</p><p>At any rate they did proceed accordingly. In the meanwhile the people from -- the cousins helped us get a visa into Cuba, which was obtainable at that point by depositing $500 per person as a guarantee in Cuba and sending us tickets to go to Cuba. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: This was your American cousin who told you.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Yes.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: What were their names?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: By an elderly aunt who actually, she and her husband, they were the parents of the Rothschilds. Mrs. Rothschild, Ida Rothschild and she wanted us to stay with her which she was, actually had a grocery store and a small apartment in Brooklyn and I don't know if she thought my mother was going to work in the grocery store. We stayed very briefly and my brother in law, the one that had come from Poland and for the World's Fair to buy some machinery, had by then lived in Lakewood and purchased a farm. And so we had, they thought that the most intelligent thing in the way of moving was my mother and the two children would go to Lakewood and my father would try to establish himself in New York and make connections during the week and come just on the weekend. Anyway we moved, the whole furniture, everything to Lakewood and we stayed there and about five days after we arrived, we had an episode at night where somebody was climbing up the ladder and my brother in law took a shotgun. They used to -- and looked out the window and it was my father. He didn't shoot, who had come to say that the family had to stay together. No matter what. This is no good. So and that's a good thing because my brother in law was ultra-orthodox so it would have turned out much different. To live with. In general too. I mean this is a very orthodox community in Lakewood. Anyway, my father got us. No, my father and mother went to New York and got an apartment in Washington Heights and we moved to Washington Heights. And I've been in New York ever since. And that was you know with the whole furniture and everything.</p></p></dialogue>
