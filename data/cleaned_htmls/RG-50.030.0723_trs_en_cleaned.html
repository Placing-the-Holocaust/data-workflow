<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But I-- I volunteered to do whatever they said, because it -- I thought well, somebody needs an architect, or a mar -- somebody with architectural experience.</p><p>So when I get there, I meet this man, Alfons Kamyczek(ph), he's in the office as -- as -- he's just there. In fact, he lived there, as well, in the -- in the -- in the -- it was in the building. So anyway, he told me what happens there, we ha -- we were in charge of the -- the water and sewer and -- and then I ended up being the director to -- to pick up all these bodies.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did anybody come up to you, of these -- of the prisoners?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh - oh, yeah, why, sure, I talked to a -- in fact, I have pictures of some of them, and yeah, I got to know quite a few of them, but those -- there was a lot of people in the barracks that were dead, that we didn't know. If you didn't move, you didn't move your anything, you were considered dead. We had a -- a dentist as a--as a doctor, so what could he do for us? And so nobody really knew --</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Well, did anyone give you an explanation of what you had come across? If you didn't know that there even had been such a place as Dachau, who -- who explained to you why they were there, and who these people were?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, as I say, a pa -- the -- the -- the -- the American army was coming through, they were -- they were getting all the guards together, and they shot them.

These poor guys were standing there with their hands up, and the Americans shot them anyway, it didn't make any difference; they were guards. But th-the German SS guarded the things, but when these people were -- were dead, and they were either gassed, or whatever, into the crematory, they were -- th-the -- the Germans didn't -- they didn't handle these people that were passed away or put into the crematory. They would get prisoners of theirs from the -- from the barracks to come in and do all this work in the crematory. So they would move the bodies around with their bare hands and so on, and put them in the furnaces, or whatever. And -- but they -- the -- the SS didn't do the -- they didn't actually do any of the work, they just did the orders, it's -- in other words, they directed the people what to do.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: By the time you got to that camp, were there any SS still there, or they'd all been either arrested, or escaped?</p></p></dialogue>

We had si -- 30,000 prisoners in the camp when I got there, from 31 different countries. And so, they were -- they were told that they could leave. Well, they wanted something to eat, so they were eating American rations, and so on, and -- but -- but the thing is, a lot of those people couldn't even walk, they didn't know where they were from, they didn't know what they were gonna see when they got home, and the -- this --  <span class="page-break" number="24"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Norman Coulson 8 October 4, 2013 the roads were just fi-filled with people all over the place, and the ro -- other ca -- other prisoners in other camps, they were also let go. And they were all, everybody was out in the street, walking, just walking, they didn't know where they were going. So -- and there was no transportation provided for them, so -- so you just -- they -- I don't know what ever happened to these people, I have no idea. I was just there in the camp, just happy to be -- be there. And I remember one day some bird colonel walked in the office and said, Coulson, it's good to see you here, he said, I'll see you when you leave. And that was my orders. So I--I had been da--a couple of times during the year, I was to the commandants ca -- to his house, which was located right in the middle of the camp, and I was there for couple drinks and so on, I guess we had some wine and so on, but that's the only -- that's the only orders I had, and I was there for a year. And then eventually the -- the war crimes trials came in t-to the camp, and they -- and they tried the -- the people that were still living. And the doctor was there that did all the experiments on these prisoners, poor souls, and they're treated like animals. Animals are better treated than these people were. And I met a lot of people. I met people from Austria and so on. I met a count there, and I met the other -- the officers" mess -- the American officers" mess had a --a German chef, who I had him --I don't know, and he and I became friends.</p><p>So--so he wanted me to -- to go half on a ski lodge down in the mountains.

Anyway, he said --I said, well, what are -- what do I have to put into it to buy this? He said, well, do you ha -- for half of it you're going to have to come up with 300 American dollars, with real, actual cash. And we said -- I said, I'm not allowed to have American cash here. So he said, well, can you get it? And I se--I wrote to my wife and said, just send me 300 American dollars, which she did. And anyway, I said to this -- this German chef that -- but which was going to be my partner for the -- the chateau. And --and I said, how am I gonna get my money out of it when I leave here, how can -- how can I get my money? Cause there was no -- no di--no transfer of money funds or anything else between the countries at that time. And anyway, he said I don't know. So I ended up selling my money on the black market and I did pretty well with that. But so-- my 300 dollar -- I don't know what these poor souls did with the American money. Most cases I sold it to the -- the Germans, they bought most of the money, because Americans weren't allowed to have it.</p></p></dialogue>

I sold cigarettes, which we'd get a carton of cigarettes every week, and I used to sell them. And I sent the money back, and after a while they were catching up to us sending all this money back home, so -- so I -- anyway, they decided that evwa -- everybody would have to have a -- the -- a book that when you got your pay, which I got five dollars a month, and then they'd write down in that book, and -- that you had -- that you got five dollars in pay, so you couldn't send any more money back any more.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, I don't know, I guess the people in Dachau -- I mean in -- in the -- yeah, the town of Dachau thought that was just a training camp for the SS there. That's was there from 1933, so up to -- until the 40s, then it became a concentration camp, and the SS operated it. So Alfons told me almost what I had to do, what he was doing for years, was making drawings, and so on for buildings and things like this. And --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: What kind of -- excuse me, I'm going to go into some detail.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see, barracks and things.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- yeah, right, yeah, the barracks and so on, things like that. Or service buildings, and so on, maybe it's a place of -- to house th-the vicious dogs and so on.</p><p>So it -- if somebody tried to escape, they'd send the dogs after them, or whatever, and then when they caught them down there, they'd shoot them, so -- so there's not much chance to get away. But Alfons would tell me, many days, if somebody tried to escape or work -- coming back from their work, outside the barracks, they all had to line up there, and they had to stand there until they caught this guy, and then, no matter what the weather was, if it was snowing or raining, or whatever it was, or heat or whatever, they had to stand out there in the street until they found them.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: When you met Alfons, he was a prisoner, or he had been a prisoner.</p></p></dialogue>

Did Alfons look any different from them? Did -- he was -- was he just as skeletal and as mal --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: No, was -- the odd thing about it was that he -- h-he was fairly dressed. I mean, he had shirt and trousers on. Where he got them, I had no idea. I don't know where he got them. But the -- the prisoners, the-they -- they're -- they're -- they're [indecipherable] next to rags when th -- when they came in there, and they were always brought in on trains, closed boxcars and so on. Most -- some of them were open, but most of them are closed, that way nobody outside, the civilians wouldn't know --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Yeah.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: -- who was coming in there on the trains. And so that's where the death train was parked, somewhere outside our office. Everybody smelled this thing one day, and wondered what was going on. And when somebody opened the doors on, and that's where we saw these two guys that -- two out of 400 that lived. So a friend of mine went down to -- into the -- in Dachau and got the mayor and I don't know who all, all -- some of the officials, and brought them out to -- to -- to take these people off the cars that were there, the dead people that were there.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Did you see that?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh yeah, sure, because th-the train was just a short distance from where our office was.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: And how did the mayor of Dachau behave when he was told to do this?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, he wasn't too happy about it, let me tell you, none of them were, cause they said they didn't know that this was happening. So -- so anyhow, there's these 400 people, they're almost all dead, and -- and it was just a horrible mess, and so they had to pick these people up and take them to the crematory.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was that far from the place where the train was?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh, it was maybe a block or two away. So th-they had to dispose of them, and they -- they cleaned the cars up somewhat, and they just wipe them out, or whatever.</p><p>They had [indecipherable] brooms or something that they had, and cleaned up the -- the freight cars, but [interruption, coughing] Pardon, I'm talking too much.</p></p></dialogue>

At Dachau they -- they did many tests there. The doctors would try different inoculations on the people. They put them in -- they were testing a palette of -- of uniforms there, and they -- they put them in cold water, because if the power came down over the -- the -- the ocean between England and -- and France, they would be in cold water. They wanted to know what -- what kind of uniforms you should make for them.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Was there any place that you went, that looked kind of confusing, you know, what was this for, or what was that for?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: Oh yeah, sure, yeah. Well th -- one of the experimental buildings, you had to -- where -- where these tests were done, and so on, one of the tests I know they -- they put these people in ice -- in ice water, like in the -- which would have been the ocean, and they put them in -- they took these guys out, and put them in bed with two girls. They wanted to see if body heat was going to revive them. And I don't know why, because they wouldn't have them out in the airplane, it didn't make sense. But anyway, that's what they were doing. They were trying all kinds of tests there, different kind of -- of diseases and so on.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, we were -- we were making drawings [indecipherable] instructed over what to do and so on. You gotta remember, I was only 23 years old, I didn't have that much experience myself.</p></p></dialogue>

And there was a like a couple hundred people that were there, that were prisoners, SS officers and so on. And that's where they had the war crimes trials. And the doctor was there, and --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Within Dachau?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: In Dachau, yeah, right.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: So they didn't go to Nuremberg?</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Oh no, no, not these people. These people were considered low class people.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And they have -- they held the -- the -- the -- the hearings right there, and if the guy was guilty, we took him -- or they took him out and hung him, and that was it. It didn't make much difference. So one day --</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: So you -- excu -- okay, one day, mm-hm?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Some -- some officer walked in, I don't know what he was any more, and he said they wanted a new gallows because when they hung these people, these newspapers  <span class="page-break" number="39"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 43 Interview with Norman Coulson October 4, 2013 were there and so on, and they would see these guys hanging there, down below the -- the ba -- the floorboards, they'd come through, and they'd take pictures of them.</p><p>And so these peop -- the American officers didn't want that any more, so they asked me to design a new gallows for them, which we did, and then all we did was put some canvas around it, so that the -- the newspaper people who were there couldn't see or take pictures of these people that were hanging.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Oh, I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: So, it was -- it was pretty crude when you really think about it. There was the -- there was really no order. The object was just to get rid of these people who were running the camp, that was it, really. It was -- it didn't make any difference -- we had -- some people would -- would talk about other -- they'd get information about their fellow workers and so on. So that's how people knew what their jobs were, because the Germans didn't want -- and I don't know what I want to say here -- they didn't want to -- they didn't want their -- their buddies to n-- to know what they were -- what they were doing when these pe -- when the pri -- the prisoners were there. So that's really what the war crimes trials were all about, you know, just -- actually it was just a ha -- it was really a farce when you really think about it, because they just wanted to get rid of these people that were guards there, of the -- of the inmates, th- the pri -- the prisoners.</p><p> <span class="page-break" number="40"></span> http://collections.ushmm.org</p><p> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Norman Coulson " October 4, 2013</p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p>Q: Okay, "m a--I'm a little confused here.</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>

Why -- what made it that way di-- for you?</p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: Well, the thing is that nobody wanted -- wanted to talk about their buddies and so on, so that they didn't really have too much information. They knew that they were already there, they knew they were guards, because they got them out of the guard -- the guard buildings. So th-they would -- one prisoner might tell about what the other guy did, or something like that. But it really didn't make any difference; if they were guards, they were shot, and that was it. A lot of them were shot even before the war crimes trials came there, and -- the Americans were so upset about what they saw there, cause they couldn't understand that these kind of things were happening.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Yeah.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: And they just got the guards out of the building, right, so one day, the -- they let the prisoners out of the -- out of the camp, out of -- they cut the wire, and so on, or the gates, and let them out. And they went up in the towers, and threw these guards right out the window, which are like three stories high, or something like that. And so the -- some of them were -- they ga -- the inmates killed them. The-There was some that I -- that I never saw many women that were there, there were some that I ti--I took a picture of one day and -- but th -- I don't know where they brought the women from, I have no idea.

They had women's clothing hanging may -- in there, you know, on a -- some sort of a form or some such thing in the window. And they just take the -- their clothes off, standing right there in the window and -- and put these new clothes on that they got out of the -- out of Dachau stores.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: The stores, that's right, the town, and they just smashed the windows if they couldn't get in the store, if the door was locked, they just smashed the windows, and standing in there, take all their clothes off, the rags that they had on, and put the new clothes on that they found, you know, in the windows.</p></p></dialogue>

And she got a knife from a friend of mine and cut his testicles off, right there in front of everybody. So, they didn't care. That's what I'm saying, i-it was just a madhouse. Nobody -- nobody knew -- we knew that the Americans were in control, and the Germans had to listen to whatever they did. If they didn't listen, they got shot.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p>A: It didn't make any difference.

But then a lot of things I didn't really want to see, you know, I -- like I say, I didn't go to the trials. I never went to hangings. I -- I just wanted to get out.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Okay.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- but Alfons had his own camera, and that was one of our biggest problems.</p><p>The fil -- the film we got might have been old, and we traded it for cigarettes, or candy, or chocolate bars, or something like that.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: Were these executions taking place on a daily basis?</p></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><p>Q: I see.</p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: But they may have had friends or somebody, maybe they knew somebody, or they -- they'd just walk into houses and throw the people out, you know, take over the house, you know, they were -- pardon me, prisoners for -- of the Germans for a while, and they just wanted to get out of the camp, just get out of there quickly as they could.</p></p></dialogue>
