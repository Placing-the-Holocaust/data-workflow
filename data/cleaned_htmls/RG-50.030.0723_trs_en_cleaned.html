And anyway, I said to this -- this German chef that -- but which was going to be my partner for the -- the chateau.

Cause there was no -- no di--no transfer of money funds or anything else between the countries at that time. And anyway, he said I don't know. So I ended up selling my money on the black market and I did pretty well with that. But so-- my 300 dollar -- I don't know what these poor souls did with the American money.

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><p>A: And -- yeah, right, yeah, the barracks and so on, things like that.

So a friend of mine went down to -- into the -- in Dachau and got the mayor and I don't know who all, all -- some of the officials, and brought them out to -- to -- to take these people off the cars that were there, the dead people that were there.

They knew that they were already there, they knew they were guards, because they got them out of the guard -- the guard buildings. So th-they would -- one prisoner might tell about what the other guy did, or something like that. But it really didn't make any difference; if they were guards, they were shot, and that was it. A lot of them were shot even before the war crimes trials came there, and -- the Americans were so upset about what they saw there, cause they couldn't understand that these kind of things were happening.</p></p></dialogue>
