<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: I have pictures of Meir as a baby. </sentence><sentence id="47">No, actually as an adult, too. </sentence><sentence id="48">Come to think of it, yes, there is a picture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults. </sentence><sentence id="49">One from Italy and one I'm not sure where from. </sentence><sentence id="50">He went to Pisa and studied medicine and then he was in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="51">I think he married in Paris but I don't think he had children. </sentence><sentence id="52">And I don't know what happened to his wife. </sentence><sentence id="53">I don't know if she was deported or not deported. </sentence><sentence id="54">My father never tried to look her up after the war. </sentence><sentence id="55">And my mother, after my father's death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir's wife wasn't Jewish and that's why my father hadn't bothered to look her up after the war because he was in Munich for two and a half years after the war, he could have. </sentence><sentence id="56">And he knew his brother was in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="57">And he found out that his brother had been deported so he could have presumably investigated his brother's wife but he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="58">That may mean that the family was angry that he had married a non-Jewish woman or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="59">Anyway Meir's experience as an educated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov was a devout Zionist, I think indicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out to the modern world, either through Jewish nationalism or through secular education. </sentence><sentence id="60">And it's also true that my father, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious. </sentence><sentence id="61">As an adult in Poland, I don't mean in America after the war, that's something else. </sentence><sentence id="62">But as an adult in Poland was not as religious as he had been growing up. </sentence><sentence id="63">He had a kosher home, he sent his kids to Jewish schools, he was very Jewish, but that was normal in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="64">People did that. </sentence><sentence id="65">But he was not that observant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his mother remained religious. </sentence><sentence id="66">And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren't. </sentence><sentence id="67">I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="68">That would be a nice question to ask. </sentence><sentence id="69">My cousin in Israel would know all these answers because he was seventeen when he left and he would have a better sense of who was http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection religious and who was not. </sentence><sentence id="70">Anyway what else can I say about just his family background. </sentence><sentence id="71">His mother had this store. </sentence><sentence id="72">I think several of his brothers were involved in running the store or in, as I said, selling to the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="73">But some of the brothers moved. </sentence><sentence id="74">He himself moved to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="75">I think another brother, Simcha moved to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="76">I'm not sure where his sister Nehama lived when she grew up. </sentence><sentence id="77">I mean they were all adults by the "30's and they were all married and had children and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="78">The only thing I could say I suppose my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, I mean "Markusfeld" is very important. </sentence><sentence id="79">She was a Markusfeld. </sentence><sentence id="80">Rozenblit was something that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld. </sentence><sentence id="81">She must have been a very feisty lady, she sounds like it. </sentence><sentence id="82">She ran this store, she had her six kids "which she raised by herself, or at least partly. </sentence><sentence id="83">We have a picture of her. </sentence><sentence id="84">She looks like a Jewish woman from Poland but she was kind of a neat lady, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: Do you know when she was born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: No, but she was in her sixties when she was killed. </sentence><sentence id="129">So that would make her born in the 1880's. </sentence><sentence id="130">Right and if my father was born in 1907 that's about right. </sentence><sentence id="131">So she would have been born in the 1880's or 1870's, probably in the 1870's if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child, he was her third or fourth child. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I think my father's father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was probably in his forties when he died, in around 1919 say so that means he was born also in the 1870's. </sentence><sentence id="133">My father, by the way, even though he did not have formal higher education or even secondary education, knew a lot of languages like many Jews of that part of the world. </sentence><sentence id="134">Yiddish was of course his native language like it was for virtually all the Jews of Poland except a small group of hyper-assimilated Jews. </sentence><sentence id="135">But he was fluent in Polish and that was common for his generation, that is people who came of age in the twenties and thirties knew increasingly also, unless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish. </sentence><sentence id="136">And certainly my cousin Mutti, the one who moved to Palestine in 1937, "38, Mutti went to Polish public school in the thirties and has very fond memories of his teachers in the Polish elementary school in Lukow, that they were not anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="137">I don't know if he's telling the whole truth when he says that, it may be nostalgia. </sentence><sentence id="138">I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990's after living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so rusty that he didn't use it. </sentence><sentence id="139">But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently. </sentence><sentence id="140">He knew Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="141">Now that's unusual. </sentence><sentence id="142">That would indicate also a Zionist whatever. </sentence><sentence id="143">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="144">My mother says he knew Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="145">Now what does that mean. </sentence><sentence id="146">She says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could easily speak Hebrew to an Israeli. </sentence><sentence id="147">I don't remember that although we did have an Israeli neighbor in the fifties and my mother says he spoke to her in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="148">Now maybe he said three words and my mother thought that meant he...... Certainly he had a traditional cheder education and he was well versed. </sentence><sentence id="149">He wasn't a Talmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a traditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="150">It wasn't rote. </sentence><sentence id="151">He could look at the prayer book or at a bible and understand what it said. </sentence><sentence id="152">He knew Russian. </sentence><sentence id="153">I don't know if he could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German. </sentence><sentence id="154">So he knew his languages. </sentence><sentence id="155">Okay what else can I say about just childhood. </sentence><sentence id="156">My father was clearly a very mischievous little boy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for example about how they tormented the Malamed at cheder, how they tormented the teacher at the traditional Jewish school in the cheder. </sentence><sentence id="157">In fact I remember when I was in Hebrew school as a child he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teacher that we did, that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="158">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="159"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I did to our teachers. </sentence><sentence id="160">And he did all the things you read about in all the Haskala, I mean putting tacks on the chair and putting honey on the chair and they just bedeviled the life of the poor teacher, which was standard, standard childhood high-jinx. </sentence><sentence id="161">And the other thing is that his sister Nehama who was older than he, probably three or four years older even though she was three children older, his sister Nehama wanted a date. </sentence><sentence id="162">World War I was a kind of liberating experience, not the war itself, that was just a horrible experience. </sentence><sentence id="163">In the aftermath of the war things really opened up and social life really changed. </sentence><sentence id="164">And she wanted to go out on dates but her mother didn't want her to because her mother was still very traditional. </sentence><sentence id="165">And so my father and another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="166">And they did this through some kind of closet, some armoire, in Europe they have these closets and apparently they would move it against the window and open the window and open the back of the closet. </sentence><sentence id="167">I don't remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our family car in the 1950's with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying. </sentence><sentence id="168">But, you know, nothing serious. </sentence><sentence id="169">She didn't cover her hair, actually. </sentence><sentence id="170">Pictures we have of her or that I've seen of her as an adult, she didn't cover her hair. </sentence><sentence id="171">So clearly this was a very mischievous child. </sentence><sentence id="172">He always had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind.....and survivors, of course, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts. </sentence><sentence id="173">Okay, I think I don't know very much more about my father's real childhood, that is when he was a baby. </sentence><sentence id="174">If I think of anything I'll come back to it. </sentence><sentence id="175">My father got married pretty young. </sentence><sentence id="176">He got married when he was about twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply. </sentence><sentence id="177">So this was also non-traditional in a way, that is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Was it a first cousin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: You know I think it was a first cousin. </sentence><sentence id="233">I think it was his first cousin. </sentence><sentence id="234">I'm not a hundred per cent positive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin. </sentence><sentence id="235">Her father owned a lumber yard in the Warsaw area in a town called Wolomin, which I think is spelled W_OL OM _LN,I'mnota hundred per cent sure but I think so. </sentence><sentence id="236">It's in the Warsaw area. </sentence><sentence id="237">So he moved to Warsaw, or to Wolomin, and he ran his father-in-law's business or worked with his father-in-law in running the business. </sentence><sentence id="238">His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella I don't remember which, his wife though died about a week after their first child was born because she had a rheumatic heart and she was warmed by doctors not to have any children and she then didn't listen. </sentence><sentence id="239">She wanted a child, it wasn't accidental. </sentence><sentence id="240">They weren't that religious and she died very shortly after he was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: So you think she was probably about twenty years old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: She was probably twenty, twenty-one. </sentence><sentence id="253">I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably the same age or a year younger. </sentence><sentence id="254">She was very young. </sentence><sentence id="255">Their son's name was Avraham. </sentence><sentence id="256">He was named after my father's father. </sentence><sentence id="257">Avraham was born therefore, let's see in 1943 when he was killed, he was twelve. </sentence><sentence id="258">So he was born in 1931. </sentence><sentence id="259">So my father wasn't twenty-one, he was twenty-four. </sentence><sentence id="260">Well, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="261">These stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not especially good at dates but I think Avraham was born either in 1930 or 1931. </sentence><sentence id="262">And his wife died and he was very, very miserable, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="263">And the family talked him into marrying her sister whose name was either Mira or Perella. </sentence><sentence id="264">In other words, Mira and Perella were his wives. </sentence><sentence id="265">I just don't remember which was the first and which was the second. </sentence><sentence id="266">I think Perella was the second. </sentence><sentence id="267">I think Mira was the first. </sentence><sentence id="268">Again I'm really not a hundred percent sure. </sentence><sentence id="269">Again my cousin in Israel would know the answer. </sentence><sentence id="270">And they had another child. </sentence><sentence id="271">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="272">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="273"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: The family talked him into it. </sentence><sentence id="297">Was this under duress then that he did this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this is the smartest and best thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="301">The child needs a mother, what better mother than her sister. </sentence><sentence id="302">She needs a husband, she's a nice lady, why don't you just marry her. </sentence><sentence id="303">You know I think it was that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="304">And he was very depressed and he needed a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the kid. </sentence><sentence id="305">I don't know exactly but he definitely married her. </sentence><sentence id="306">And it was all right. </sentence><sentence id="307">Obviously it was sad. </sentence><sentence id="308">I didn't know this when I was a child. </sentence><sentence id="309">When I was a child my father was very open and talked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience and about his life before the war. </sentence><sentence id="310">But for whatever reason, maybe because it was ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy of the Holocaust, he didn't tell me about the fact that his first wife had died. </sentence><sentence id="311">He thought that would be too sad for me. </sentence><sentence id="312">Here he was telling me about his son and daughter who had been slaughtered by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="313">And that he could tell me about. </sentence><sentence id="314">But the specific tragedy of his own personal life with his wife's death he didn't tell me. </sentence><sentence id="315">I found out when I was twenty or something. </sentence><sentence id="316">A cousin of his in America was visiting us and she just mentioned it casually. </sentence><sentence id="317">I said, what are you talking about? </sentence><sentence id="318">And she told me the whole story and I just bawled. </sentence><sentence id="319">It was very sad that this love of his life died in childbirth. </sentence><sentence id="320">But anyway he did have a daughter with the second wife. </sentence><sentence id="321">Her name was Toby. </sentence><sentence id="322">That's what my mother called her. </sentence><sentence id="323">It's probably Tova, which again sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="324">Tova is already a sign of modernity in its modern Jewish form. </sentence><sentence id="325">She was four years younger than Avraham. </sentence><sentence id="326">So she would have been born in 1934 or "35, something like that, or deg33 depending on exactly when Avraham was born. </sentence><sentence id="327">And my father continued to live in Wolomin with his wife and running this lumberyard. </sentence><sentence id="328">He sent his kids to -- there were several Jewish school systems in Poland as you know. </sentence><sentence id="329">There was the Zionist school system and the Bundist school system and the "frumie", the religious school system and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="330">He sent his children to a school system that was very like American Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish subjects which were taught in Hebrew and secular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in the Zionist or Bundist schools where everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a minimal amount of Polish. </sentence><sentence id="331">So his children went to this kind of modern Jewish school which means, of course, that it was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the Bundist schools which would indicate a kind of moderate religious position. </sentence><sentence id="332">So that's the kind of school he sent his kids to. </sentence><sentence id="333">As I said he kept a kosher home. </sentence><sentence id="334">I don't think he was Sabbath observing. </sentence><sentence id="335">So he was kind of a little traditional, but not.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: And they spoke Yiddish at home, I assume. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: You know I don't know what language. </sentence><sentence id="375">Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at home, that goes without saying. </sentence><sentence id="376">What language did he speak as an adult in his family in Wolomin? </sentence><sentence id="377">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="378">I really don't know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both. </sentence><sentence id="379">You know if you're utterly fluent it probably depends on your mood. </sentence><sentence id="380">Yiddish was definitely his mother tongue, what he dreamed in, what he counted in was definitely Yiddish, but I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="381">I bet they spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="382">I think most Jews spoke Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: That would be my guess. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: My guess would be Yiddish although maybe sometimes Polish depending if the kids came back from school and spoke Polish, then you answered them in Polish and then all of a sudden for an </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="538">A: What happened, okay. </sentence><sentence id="539">You know I'm used to telling the story to my six -year old son and of course to my six- year old son I have to include what happened during the war. </sentence><sentence id="540">I have to sketch out the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I don't have to do that here. </sentence><sentence id="541">In the first months of the war there was just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="542">I assume that his business was Aryanized because that's what the Germans did as soon as they came in. </sentence><sentence id="543">They Aryanized businesses giving them to ethnic Germans. </sentence><sentence id="544">I assume my father was not compensated for it. </sentence><sentence id="545">He was a clever man. </sentence><sentence id="546">He probably managed to get stuff out of it before it was technically Aryanized. </sentence><sentence id="547">In all the stories he talked about the years before he was deported to Auschwitz he never mentioned that he was starving to death and he was living on the street or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="548">Of course he was starving but he wasn't......He must have managed to get something out of his business even though he wasn't compensated for it. </sentence><sentence id="549">You read about this in the memoirs people who with Polish friends manage to make arrangements and deals and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="550">But anyway his business was confiscated, his bank accounts frozen, all of those things taken from him. </sentence><sentence id="551">But then, of course, he was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="552">Now when my father was alive and he talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="553">He didn't specify which one. </sentence><sentence id="554">When my mother, who is not a historian and who is not at all good with details and in fact was terrible with details, when my mother talked about it for him, after he died, or when I would ask her as I got a little older, well which ghetto, she said the Warsaw ghetto, that he was in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="555">Some of the details of his story very much match the Warsaw ghetto in terms of.....well the fact is he escaped from the ghetto when it was burning in April 1943.That's the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="556">What other ghetto was burning in April "43 that you could escape from in some way. </sentence><sentence id="557">But on the other hand, he didn't live in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="558">He lived in Wolomin which was close to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="559">There could have been a ghetto in Wolomin. </sentence><sentence id="560">On the other hand it was so close to Warsaw that all the people may have been moved to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="561">But usually people who had to move into a place did very, very badly. </sentence><sentence id="562">And my father obviously didn't fare badly. </sentence><sentence id="563">I think that he probably was in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="564">He probably did just simply get moved from Wolomin into Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="565">Let's say for the purposes of this record that he was in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: So you don't know if they lived with other families or....? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: That I just don't know. </sentence><sentence id="679">The only person who might know is Shaya May but Shaya never wanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time. </sentence><sentence id="680">I should add I have another source about my father's experiences and that is that when he went to school in America, when he came to America, the equivalent of "What I did on my summer vacation," he had to write an essay about his experiences. </sentence><sentence id="681">He had to write an essay that described his experiences during the war, I guess, so he wrote, I have part of that essay, part of it is missing. </sentence><sentence id="682">But he just says I suffered terribly and goes on. </sentence><sentence id="683">He doesn't provide specific details about what it was like in the ghetto or in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="684">There was also, of course, the testimony that he provided to B. Goodmachen for the reparation claim which my mother typed and of which there is no copy although she swears she made one. </sentence><sentence id="685">She doesn't know what happened to it and she suspects that my father actually destroyed the copy. </sentence><sentence id="686">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="687">But the copy just doesn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="688">Most of her memories I suppose come from that formal This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="689">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="690"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection document that she typed for him. </sentence><sentence id="691">So I don't know if he lived with others or what the situation was. </sentence><sentence id="692">Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation. </sentence><sentence id="693">Most of his family, of course, was in Lukow, in the Lukow ghetto although he had a brother in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="694">Simcha was in Warsaw and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew. </sentence><sentence id="695">He was shot during the time of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="696">I mean for not playing cards but after playing cards going out in the street. </sentence><sentence id="697">So Simcha died before the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="698">And he had been in Warsaw because he had moved to Warsaw already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don't know why he had moved or what he did at all. </sentence><sentence id="699">Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because since he was in Lukow he didn't really know the war.....he actually knew my father the least well because my father was already in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="700">He remembers my father coming home to visit twice or three times and giving him a ball or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="701">His stories are really best. </sentence><sentence id="702">From my cousin Mutti in Israel I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha Rozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too. </sentence><sentence id="703">Anyway so I really don't know much about the ghetto years except that things were okay. </sentence><sentence id="704">His brother was shot but things were reasonably okay. </sentence><sentence id="705">Of course then came the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="706">During the deportations from the Lukow ghetto, his mother was shot. </sentence><sentence id="707">She was in her sixties and rather than take her to Treblinka or Sobibor or wherever they were taking the Jews from Lukow, they shot her. </sentence><sentence id="708">Somebody must have witnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn't in Lukow. </sentence><sentence id="709">She was shot. </sentence><sentence id="710">I assume the rest of his relatives in Lukow, aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: Do you know what year this was, was it "43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: No, well of all Polish Jewry, it's 42. </sentence><sentence id="749">The operation Rhinehart which just simply went methodically and liquidated all the ghettoes began something like March of "42 and was over by October "42 with some pockets left. </sentence><sentence id="750">That is there were Jews left in the Warsaw ghetto and in the....was it the Lublin? </sentence><sentence id="751">Yeah the Lublin ghetto was made into a labor camp and a couple of other places. </sentence><sentence id="752">There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue. </sentence><sentence id="753">Those were destroyed in "43. </sentence><sentence id="754">I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in "42 unless by some chance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the labor camp, in the Jeneska Road labor camp or Poniyet Tovah, I forgot there were a whole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area which maybe his brother or one of his nephews because if my father's son was already twelve by that time then his older brother's kids could have been teenagers. </sentence><sentence id="755">So maybe they were in.....But I just don't know. </sentence><sentence id="756">I assume that everybody was just killed in deg42. </sentence><sentence id="757">His sister Nehama, though, who lived in Lukow with her family, you know I wrote down that her name was Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein. </sentence><sentence id="758">Yes, her name was Bernstein. </sentence><sentence id="759">Pearlman was my father's wife's maiden name. </sentence><sentence id="760">She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was the joke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, -- that when I was a kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men's Benevolent Association and all the people who had come from my father's town -- and people would go Nehama, Nehama. </sentence><sentence id="761">They looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="762">I don't look like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her. </sentence><sentence id="763">But anyway she and her family, her husband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="764">They somehow escaped the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="765">I don't know if they escaped in "42 or if they escaped earlier but they were hiding in the woods near there in the Lublin region. </sentence><sentence id="766">And they were only killed in "44, about three months before the end of the war in that part of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="767">They were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis at that point. </sentence><sentence id="768">So I don't know what happened to them if they were then sent to Auschwitz or if they were shot right away or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="769">But they did succeed in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="770">Nechuma, I should be fair, her name was not Nehama, her name was Nechuma. </sentence><sentence id="771">Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she used the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="772">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="773"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection name Helenie. </sentence><sentence id="774">There are pictures on the back that say Helenie. </sentence><sentence id="775">I think she was the only one that used a Polish name. </sentence><sentence id="776">My father didn't. </sentence><sentence id="777">He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the others, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names. </sentence><sentence id="778">But she used both Nechuma and Helenie. </sentence><sentence id="779">But anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe even more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to say, for a bottle of vodka). </sentence><sentence id="780">The Poles were given booty for handing over Jews. </sentence><sentence id="781">Now I don't know if these people had just happened upon them and turned them over or if these were people who had been helping them all along and then turned them over, because often people were hiding with the assistance of Poles. </sentence><sentence id="782">Maybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping them who turned them over, who knows. </sentence><sentence id="783">I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of the family, his mothers and brothers and sisters, well whatever, there's not that many brothers by that time because Simcha and his family were in Warsaw and presumably they were deported in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="784">Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew violations but presumably his family was deported in "42 when most of the Jews in Warsaw were deported. </sentence><sentence id="785">In Lukow Haim, his brother Haim Yakov had already gone to Palestine although his family hadn't. </sentence><sentence id="786">My father's brother Haim Yakov had gone to Palestine in 1937 alone. </sentence><sentence id="787">His son Mutti, followed him in 1938 leaving the wife and the other children. </sentence><sentence id="788">So they were all presumably killed also in "42. </sentence><sentence id="789">Shia was there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in hiding until 44 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to the Nazis and killed and of course Meir was in Paris and he was deported, I assume, again I don't know this, but I assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in Paris took place, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Jews in Paris were deported. </sentence><sentence id="790">Now this is not necessarily true. </sentence><sentence id="791">He could have escaped to the south and have been picked up at some other time. </sentence><sentence id="792">He definitely was deported to Auschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel, he was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives, also her own relatives from her own family. </sentence><sentence id="793">But her family was mostly in Palestine because they were all Zionist who'd come mostly in the 20's. </sentence><sentence id="794">So she tracked them down and she found my father and she found nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="795">So in fact the first time I saw those letters I wanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in English. </sentence><sentence id="796">So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English so I could read it easily and my father didn't know English yet but Mutti knew English and then of course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had a real address and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I didn't read it quite as easily. </sentence><sentence id="797">But she found nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="798">So I assume obviously she would have found -- there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish organizations tracking down people. </sentence><sentence id="799">So he was presumably killed either in "42 or deg43 or deg44, everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="800">And Nehama definitely in deg44. </sentence><sentence id="801">Simcha at some point before "42, everybody else in "42 except for my father and his family. </sentence><sentence id="802">In any case assuming that my father was in the Warsaw ghetto, his family was able to stay there after that initial depletion of the Warsaw ghetto in August/September of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="803">That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually because the people who stayed in Warsaw, the 70,000 or so that remained after the major liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry, or whatever industry that was working for the German economy. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="864">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="865">Also I think the Wolomin ghetto was simply, I read that in Orad the Wolomin was totally destroyed in 1942.

information about this collection Warsaw, that April "43 date is so fundamentally Warsaw that he had to have been in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="870">In fact he always lit a yahrtzeit candle for his children at Pesach because that's around, I mean the Warsaw ghetto was finally liquidated on the second night of Pesach. </sentence><sentence id="871">And they didn't die that night. </sentence><sentence id="872">I'll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="873">So Pesach of 1943, so Pesach is when he lit a yahrtzeit candle for everybody then. </sentence><sentence id="874">I don't know, maybe because he was in Warsaw and that had such an impact on his conscience. </sentence><sentence id="875">His mother was probably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at Pesach. </sentence><sentence id="876">My father, therefore, and his wife and his children and his wife's sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she schlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were together in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="877">So he was in the ghetto after that liquidation in August/September 1942 when most of the people in the ghetto were liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="878">So he was one of the 70,000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of 43 when the Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="879">Now my father in 1943, he was born in 1907, so in 1943 he was 36. </sentence><sentence id="880">Well he wasn't yet because his birthday is November, so he was 35 years old. </sentence><sentence id="881">And he had a twelve-year old son and an eight-year old daughter and a wife and a sister-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="882">And they decided to escape from the burning ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="883">Because of the uprising the Nazis sort of bombed the ghetto and sent in firebombs and so forth and basically burned the ghetto down. </sentence><sentence id="884">And my father and his family decided to escape from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="885">I don't know if that means they went through the sewers or not. </sentence><sentence id="886">In Warsaw that's how people escaped from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="887">This is where he really told. </sentence><sentence id="888">My father told the stories from the escape from the Warsaw ghetto until liberation. </sentence><sentence id="889">That's what he told. </sentence><sentence id="890">The ghetto experience didn't interest him. </sentence><sentence id="891">That must mean that it was not too terrible. </sentence><sentence id="892">My image of hearing the story as a child was that they escaped into the woods. </sentence><sentence id="893">But there are no woods around the Warsaw ghetto or around Warsaw even for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="894">So I don't know how they escaped, presumably they did it through the sewers. </sentence><sentence id="895">But in any case they escaped. </sentence><sentence id="896">Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that he did make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non- Jews. </sentence><sentence id="897">And nobody would do it. </sentence><sentence id="898">He was unable to get anybody to agree to do that. </sentence><sentence id="899">So anyway there he was with his twelve year old, his eight year old, his wife and his sister-in-law and they escaped and somehow they made it to some woods, or maybe not to some woods, they were just out. </sentence><sentence id="900">They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that person because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should go to a farm house that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers but I was a little kid when I heard this so I don't know where it was. </sentence><sentence id="901">Somehow Avraham, my father's son, who by the way was not called Avraham, that's my way of Hebraisizing it again, it's Avremy, the Yiddish nickname for Abraham. </sentence><sentence id="902">Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="903">My father's wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said no. </sentence><sentence id="904">We'll lose you if you do that. </sentence><sentence id="905">We have to stick together and go to the farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="906">We'll find Avremy at the farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="907">And she just was mad with concern for her son who's not technically her son but she had raised him his whole life so he was her son. </sentence><sentence id="908">And she went to look for him and they never saw her again. </sentence><sentence id="909">I assume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the SS and taken directly to Auschwitz which at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not Auschwitz, maybe she was taken to Treblinka, I don't know where she was taken to but she was presumably killed. </sentence><sentence id="910">But my father and his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this farm house and they found Avremy there without his shoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably he needed them, probably he thought that Avremy would be killed soon anyway, what did he need shoes for. </sentence><sentence id="911">Who knows why he took them, but he took them. </sentence><sentence id="912">This is April of "43, my father, Avremy, Toby and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law whose name I don't know and then they were arrested, they were found. </sentence><sentence id="913">I mean it was very hard to really escape especially since the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them. </sentence><sentence id="914">And he was taken to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="915">They were taken to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="916">Of course my father was 35, and the rest of them This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="917">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or

how old his sister-in-law was, presumably in her thirties too but she was crippled. </sentence><sentence id="919">And she was as if the mother of these children. </sentence><sentence id="920">She was an adult female with two children. </sentence><sentence id="921">And so when they got to Auschwitz, he was sent to the left or the right, whichever way. </sentence><sentence id="922">He was sent to do slave labor and they were sent the other way which means that they were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="923">So in April of 1943 his son and his daughter and sister-in-law were killed by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="924">But he was in Auschwitz and he was a slave laborer in Auschwitz for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="925">He worked in Auschwitz and he would talk about his experiences quite a lot. </sentence><sentence id="926">He talked about how awful it was although I must say that he did not dwell on how awful it was. </sentence><sentence id="927">My father talked about his experience in the camps a lot. </sentence><sentence id="928">Saturday nights when we would have company, in the 1950's if you were a Jewish family in Brooklyn you would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so on and company and he would talk . </sentence><sentence id="929">People would say Mark what was it like. </sentence><sentence id="930">And he would talk. </sentence><sentence id="931">And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my father talk about this. </sentence><sentence id="932">And when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much. </sentence><sentence id="933">He certainly made it very clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it. </sentence><sentence id="934">And in fact when people would be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be presumptuous and they would say, how could you have done such a thing?

id="937">It's not really nasty. </sentence><sentence id="938">And he would say, you shouldn't talk, you don't know what it's like to be in a fire. </sentence><sentence id="939">I remember the expression, you don't know what it's like to be in a fire. </sentence><sentence id="940">But he wouldn't dwell on how awful it was except to indicate that it was unbearably awful and constant beatings and starvation and filth and dirt and crowded and disgusting. </sentence><sentence id="941">He indicated that but that's not what he dwelled on. </sentence><sentence id="942">What he dwelled on instead in his talking about it was the things that people did to survive and the things that people did to help each other survive. </sentence><sentence id="943">The image that I had as a child of what it was like in the camps was unbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the Nazis but the inmates being human, working to do things that would make themselves survive and things that human beings do. </sentence><sentence id="944">I don't mean that human beings are pigs and do horrible things, but in the good sense of being human, that is if helping each other and working together to try to survive, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="945">For example he always spoke about what the memoirs all talked about, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through which people bargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things. </sentence><sentence id="946">He talked all the time of it how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or for garlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself. </sentence><sentence id="947">Onions or garlic so you could get vitamins. </sentence><sentence id="948">All of that which I've read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time, about the need to trade. </sentence><sentence id="949">Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi stewards and from the suitcases of people who came in to be gassed. </sentence><sentence id="950">So he talked about that a lot. </sentence><sentence id="951">He didn't use the word organization as far as I can remember but maybe he did and I just don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="952">But he talked about that you really needed to do that. </sentence><sentence id="953">He also talked, in fact more importantly than this whole organization business, he talked about holding on to the will to live. </sentence><sentence id="954">My most vivid memory I have from childhood, the most single vivid memory of my own childhood is my father talking about holding on to the will to live. </sentence><sentence id="955">And that the only way you could survive such a horrible place was to hold on to the will to live and that's how you did it, you just held on to the will to live. </sentence><sentence id="956">Like literally held on to it. </sentence><sentence id="957">And every second said, I'm going to live, I'm going to live, I'm going to live. </sentence><sentence id="958">I just remember that vividly. </sentence><sentence id="959">I don't remember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to live or what strategies he used to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="960">There are different strategies that people used. </sentence><sentence id="961">That I don't remember, his own personal strategies. </sentence><sentence id="962">But I do remember him talking about that -- holding on to the will to live. </sentence><sentence id="963">I also remember that of course it made him This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection lose all faith in God. </sentence><sentence id="966">Actually I don't remember that, I take that back. </sentence><sentence id="967">He did lose all faith in God. </sentence><sentence id="968">But that he didn't tell me about. </sentence><sentence id="969">My mother told me about that when I was older. </sentence><sentence id="970">He didn't want me to know that because he didn't think that was fair to me. </sentence><sentence id="971">He thought that I was a child and not know that he didn't believe in God as a result of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="972">And he didn't believe in God because his children had been killed and everybody's children had been killed not just his. </sentence><sentence id="973">That didn't stop him from wanting to have a kosher home or from going to shul all the time. </sentence><sentence id="974">He didn't stop being a Jew, you know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="975">Well, actually he did stop going to shul until I was born. </sentence><sentence id="976">From the time the war ended until I was born he would not go into a shul, he would not do anything religious. </sentence><sentence id="977">He would not go into a Passover seder, he would not do anything religious. </sentence><sentence id="978">No, that's not true. </sentence><sentence id="979">He would go to a Passover seder. </sentence><sentence id="980">I think that was the only religious thing he would do but he would not go to shul. </sentence><sentence id="981">When I was born he didn't even think about it. </sentence><sentence id="982">He went to shul to name me. </sentence><sentence id="983">He was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="984">That's what eastern Jewry was like. </sentence><sentence id="985">You were a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="986">You did things because you were a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="987">Jews named their daughters in shul. </sentence><sentence id="988">The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="989">You know you had to. </sentence><sentence id="990">Just because you didn't believe in God didn't mean that you didn't name your daughter in shul. </sentence><sentence id="991">And that broke the ice and he went to shul all the time. </sentence><sentence id="992">He loved to go to shul. </sentence><sentence id="993">He absolutely loved to go to shul. </sentence><sentence id="994">He didn't go every week, he wasn't religious. </sentence><sentence id="995">But he went at least once a month. </sentence><sentence id="996">He really loved to go to shul. </sentence><sentence id="997">In fact he even wanted me to go to a Jewish day school but my mother didn't want me to go because we weren't that religious and in those days it was just orthodox schools. </sentence><sentence id="998">Getting back to his experiences I don't remember that he talked about how he lost his faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the camps, the loss of faith. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: Do you remember any discussion of any specific episodes or incidents that he might have told you or other people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: No, I don't remember anything specific from the camps except the business of trading bread for soap which is not a specific incident; I'm sure he did it more than once and the business of holding on to the will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was. </sentence><sentence id="1139">I think in his testimony for reparations he did provide some specific instances. </sentence><sentence id="1140">But my mother, who unfortunately was terrible at details didn't remember them and had lost the carbon copy. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I'm sure he was beaten mercilessly many times as was everybody, I mean he wasn't singled out. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I'm sure there were but I really don't unfortunately know any very specific thing. </sentence><sentence id="1143">In terms of what he actually did in the camp, I assume he did a variety of labor things. </sentence><sentence id="1144">He could be a carpenter so presumably when they asked him what do you do, he said I'm a carpenter and they did have him building. </sentence><sentence id="1145">My mother used to say that he built crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="1146">But they were already built by the time he got there so I don't -- see my mother was really bad at detail. </sentence><sentence id="1147">It was a shame. </sentence><sentence id="1148">I'm a historian concerned with detail and she wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And my father died when I was young. </sentence><sentence id="1150">So I'm bringing all these memories of sitting around our table listening so I can think of something very specific. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1166">A: I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed -- like if he would discuss -- in the Warsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was

</sentence><sentence id="1167">People were in awe of my father. </sentence><sentence id="1168">He was a very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his stories. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I don't remember a specific incident unless I keep on talking I'11 come to something. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection don't remember anything specific. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I do know that he was in Auschwitz from April of "43 until January of "45 when the Russians -- so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1174">In January of 1945 as you know the Russians came very close to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1175">Knowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute the Nazis evacuated the camp and in the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other -- Isabella Leitner -- millions of other people described -- marched off people to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And my father was part of that death march. </sentence><sentence id="1177">I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1178">I remember him saying that it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1179">It was January, it was winter, and they didn't have boots and they didn't have coats. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Two thirds of the people died. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And I remember him saying that you couldn't fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die. </sentence><sentence id="1182">The snow was deceptive. </sentence><sentence id="1183">You think that it's warm when you're in it and so you could fall asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And then of course you freeze to death because in fact it's not warm it's cold. </sentence><sentence id="1185">So you should never go to sleep in the snow. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And I remember him saying that they would force each other to stay awake. </sentence><sentence id="1187">In some of the memoirs I've read about how they were put in barns, my father never talked about that. </sentence><sentence id="1188">He just talked about the snow and how people straggled, they would be shot of course and the Nazis would beat people up. </sentence><sentence id="1189">The Nazis were very nervous of course at this point. </sentence><sentence id="1190">He was taken to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1191">Other people went to other places. </sentence><sentence id="1192">They were in Bergen- Belsen, Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1193">They were all taken to concentration camps in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1194">He personally was taken to Dachau where he spent the next few months. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I don't know how long it actually took him to get from Auschwitz to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1196">In some of the memoirs you read how that part of the way they were on trains and trucks and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1197">My father never said that. </sentence><sentence id="1198">He just said the death march. </sentence><sentence id="1199">He called it the death march and he said they took us to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So he was in Dachau for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And I have a couple of little stories that I remember of the actual liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1202">Not of the moment of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1203">Not of the moment of liberation although I have a wonderful story of somebody else of the actual moment but I won't put this in my father's record. </sentence><sentence id="1204">It's one of those classic stories, the other story of how this other person got out of Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1205">The Nazis left the camp before the Americans got there and he was wandering around the streets and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1206">That's not my father's story. </sentence><sentence id="1207">Right after liberation he and Shia, this person who had been his employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Auschwitz with him and had been in the orchestra in Auschwitz actually, my father was just a laborer in Auschwitz but Shia was in the orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1208">And after the war they were walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the street that he saw and my father said what are you doing that for because now we have food. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And Shia was still too scared that there would be no food. </sentence><sentence id="1210">But that again is not my father's story because that's not what he did. </sentence><sentence id="1211">He of course was nothing at the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1212">He was utterly emaciated and utterly depleted. </sentence><sentence id="1213">My mother used to say he weighed fifty pounds at the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1214">I can't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="1215">But he must have weighed seventy or eighty. </sentence><sentence id="1216">My mother was also an exaggerator a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1217">But I bet he weighed seventy pounds at the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1218">He was not a huge man anyway, he was probably about five nine. </sentence><sentence id="1219">He was broad but thin. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1338">Q: I was wondering about that because I talked to a number of people and they said well we just lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And I said how did you get food. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Well, we got food. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1425">Although actually some of my father's Lukower friends, that is the friends from the town that he met again in America, they might know her name because she lived with him. </sentence><sentence id="1426">All these pictures of my father and his other survivor friends in Germany after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1427">There she is, she's with them. </sentence><sentence id="1428">My father did know German though, he probably did speak to her in German. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Anyway, so he lived in Germany and had this job, joined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of 1947 he came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1430">That was right after Congress passed that emergency legislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi persecution. </sentence><sentence id="1431">I guess because he worked for UNRRA he was able more easily than others to get an early seat in that. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And he came to the United States in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1433">I don't think he ever had any contact with her again. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Maybe initially he did but not for very long. </sentence><sentence id="1435">He got himself a job very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1436">It was the only job he ever had in America. </sentence><sentence id="1437">He actually lived with a Lukower. </sentence><sentence id="1438">He lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to America God knows when. </sentence><sentence id="1439">But her son, Muttel, who was my father's friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my father's friend in Germany, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Muttel came later to America, too. </sentence><sentence id="1441">But he lived with Mrs. Feldman. </sentence><sentence id="1442">He wandered around lower Manhattan looking for a job, he got a job right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor which did store fixtures, you know furniture that's inside stores. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with wood, he owned a lumberyard, and he was also very handy, actually more than handy. </sentence><sentence id="1444">He was talented with his hands. </sentence><sentence id="1445">He could build beautiful things and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1446">So he got a job there, initially I guess just as a carpenter since he didn't -- I don't know, whatever -- but he also worked for them supervising job installations. </sentence><sentence id="1447">When they did Bambergers in New Jersey, he went out to Bambergers and made sure the job was done right. </sentence><sentence

do. </sentence><sentence id="1450">He died before he could do that. </sentence><sentence id="1451">But that's what he wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="1452">So he got a job right away, I mean he probably got a job three days -- oh actually I have a funny story to tell. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I know you're mostly interested in the Holocaust but I love this story. </sentence><sentence id="1454">When he came to America he was met at the boat by his aunt, Judith Marcus, Marcusfeld shortened to Marcus. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Actually she was an aunt-in-law.

before World War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it more American. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Anyway his uncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the boat and she said to him, today I'll speak to you in Yiddish, tomorrow only English. </sentence><sentence id="1460">You're now in America, you have to speak English. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Presumably he knew some English because he worked for UNRRA. </sentence><sentence id="1462">Today I will call you Mendel, but from now on you have to have an American name and your name is Mark. </sentence><sentence id="1463">She gave him a name that was common in America. </sentence><sentence id="1464">In 1947 Mark was a common name. </sentence><sentence id="1465">So in fact, when he became a citizen in 1951 he changed his name to Mark. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So in America he was Mark Rozenblit, although my mother called him alternate.....she called him Mark most of the time, This is a verbatim

survived from this town. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Actually a very large number considering how tiny the town was. </sentence><sentence id="1483">Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for Muttel. </sentence><sentence id="1484">I think Muttel had been in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1485">Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet. </sentence><sentence id="1486">God, Frimmet, Frimmet and Dave Rosen. </sentence><sentence id="1487">They're so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it's amazing. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And Chayetta whose son

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1562">Q: But they all ended up in New York? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1564">A: They all ended up in New York, all the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1565">There were probably eight of them; it's not like there were hundreds of them. </sentence><sentence id="1566">But there were some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1567">Some of them actually subsequently moved to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1568">In the 50's and 60's they lived in America and 70's and some of them retired to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1569">Well Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny moved to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1570">But I think Lola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in America, in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1571">I mean, unless they're dead, I haven't spoken to these people in a hundred years, a hundred years, but a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1572">So my father adjusted very, very well to life in America. </sentence><sentence id="1573">He really did. </sentence><sentence id="1574">He didn't want to have children because he lost two. </sentence><sentence id="1575">He had one because he thought it wasn't fair to my mother to impose that on her but he wouldn't have any others because it was too much of a risk that you could lose your children. </sentence><sentence id="1576">In a way I replaced his daughter; his son he mourned for continuously. </sentence><sentence id="1577">He had nightmares all the time, all the time my mother said. </sentence><sentence id="1578">I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="1579">That was from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1580">He was in his daily life in America, fine. </sentence><sentence id="1581">He joked and laughed and was successful. </sentence><sentence id="1582">I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job and worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American family. </sentence><sentence id="1583">I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his waking consciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="1584">He missed his son profoundly. </sentence><sentence id="1585">He was in excruciating pain at a barmitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="1586">He had a very hard time at barmitzvahs because his son died just before his own. </sentence><sentence id="1587">The loss of his children was really unbearable to him. </sentence><sentence id="1588">The loss of everyone else he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1614">Q: That must have been a big responsibility for you really to have that position. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: I felt it an honor. </sentence><sentence id="1617">I felt very privileged. </sentence><sentence id="1618">I felt very special as a child. </sentence><sentence id="1619">I felt that I was privy, very close to tis horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I understood it better than others. </sentence><sentence id="1620">I felt honored. </sentence><sentence id="1621">I felt terrible for my father and the family and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1622">But I felt very special. </sentence><sentence id="1623">I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing that I didn't have a burden but in the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility to bear the information and the pain of it. </sentence><sentence id="1624">I knew lots of other people in the same situation though because although my mother was American and therefore all the family that I had was American, that is her family, we knew a lot of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1625">Both because of the Lukower, all of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1626">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1627"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection these people who had survived, but also because in Brooklyn in the fifties when I was growing up there were survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1628">There were lots of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1629">I had friends whose parents were survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1630">Not all my friends, certainly. </sentence><sentence id="1631">In fact probably most of my friends didn't have survivor parents but Elaine and Esther Rosenberg's parents were survivors and whatever, I don't have to name all the names. </sentence><sentence id="1632">But there were plenty of other survivors around so it was not an unusual or weird thing at all. </sentence><sentence id="1633">But yes I did feel a responsibility, a very great responsibility, probably magnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old. </sentence><sentence id="1634">I remember, my father always talked about it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1635">We didn't call it the Holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the camps, or the Nazis, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1636">So I don't remember not knowing about it. </sentence><sentence id="1637">I always knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="1638">But I do remember the first time I saw pictures. </sentence><sentence id="1639">There was a series of pictures prepared by the American army for Germans so they would know how horrible the camps were. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And my father had a set. </sentence><sentence id="1641">In the back it said "Zo vais in Dachau" So it was in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1642">It was horrific pictures. </sentence><sentence id="1643">You know those really gross concentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse, because there were bodies lying all over the place and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1644">And I remember I was eleven years old when I came across those pictures and I vomited. </sentence><sentence id="1645">I remember that very vividly. </sentence><sentence id="1646">I mean this wasn't a picture of my father, of course, my father was alive. </sentence><sentence id="1647">Not then, he was already dead. </sentence><sentence id="1648">Yeah, I felt this great responsibility because of it, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Anyway what else would you like to know about the whole thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1686">Q: I think that should probably cover it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1688">A: As much as you guys need, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1690">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1691">If there's anything else that you feel you want to include for the sake of this interview and have it in the museum we can turn off the tape and if you think about it, you can tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1694">A: Yeah, I'm just trying to think. </sentence><sentence id="1695">You know of course I'm not the survivor so I can't give you the details that your survivors are giving you. </sentence><sentence id="1696">My father also did die when I was ten which means that I didn't get a chance to question him and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1697">My cousin in Israel could only provide information about Poland before the war. </sentence><sentence id="1698">My mother was bad at detail. </sentence><sentence id="1699">So it's a hard thing. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Let me just think of a few other things randomly. </sentence><sentence id="1701">My father taught me not to hate all Germans because of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1702">He thought the Nazis were evil but he didn't hate all Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1703">I mean I think the fact that he had a non-Jewish girlfriend is a sign of that. </sentence><sentence id="1704">He taught me that. </sentence><sentence id="1705">He taught me that I had to distinguish between people. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil. </sentence><sentence id="1707">I probably did get the sense that all Poles were anti-Semitic in my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="1708">That is, I think Polish Jewry in general thought that although no, no although. </sentence><sentence id="1709">That was the sense I probably got. </sentence><sentence id="1710">I got the sense that obviously most people were killed but that those who survived did so not because they were awful people. </sentence><sentence id="1711">I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in the fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed each other and been dog eat dog. </sentence><sentence id="1712">From my father I learned that you survived because you were clever. </sentence><sentence id="1713">You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically. </sentence><sentence id="1714">You were clever. </sentence><sentence id="1715">You figured things out. </sentence><sentence id="1716">You were lucky, gutsy. </sentence><sentence id="1717">That's what made you live, not being underhanded and mean but being tough and strong. </sentence><sentence id="1718">In fact I had a wonderful experience. </sentence><sentence id="1719">I went to the first international gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel in 1981 and I in fact gave a paper on it. </sentence><sentence id="1720">I gave a paper on teaching the Holocaust at the university level. </sentence><sentence id="1721">But I went to not all the sessions but many of the sessions. </sentence><sentence id="1722">I went to the final session which was held at the kotel, at the wall, when there were speeches. </sentence><sentence id="1723">Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack spoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in English, really weird. </sentence><sentence id="1724">But anyway English This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1725">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1726"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was the common language because there were French survivors and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1727">Anyway so I went to it and it got real cold. </sentence><sentence id="1728">It was at night in Jerusalem in the summer and I was wearing a jacket and I was feeling very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1729">Begin, maybe he wasn't the last speaker, but he was one of the last speakers and he was going on and on endlessly. </sentence><sentence id="1730">Everybody else had spoken for two minutes because thee were hundreds of speakers. </sentence><sentence id="1731">He was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1732">He was already prime minister. </sentence><sentence id="1733">He was going on and on and he was really being nasty. </sentence><sentence id="1734">He was exhorting the crowd that if they didn't live in Israel they were traitors to the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1735">It was a really not nice, disgusting speech. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Half the crowd started to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1737">They just started to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1738">They picked themselves up and they walked. </sentence><sentence id="1739">My American side, that is my Protestant side, I mean I'm not a Protestant but you know what I mean, the American side that you just stand on line whatever, was appalled that they would do that. </sentence><sentence id="1740">Because, after all, even if you hate him, even if you think he's saying awful things, and I certainly don't agree with Menachem Begin politically and I though what he was saying was awful. </sentence><sentence id="1741">But still he's the prime minister of a country. </sentence><sentence id="1742">You don't get up and leave in the middle of his speech. </sentence><sentence id="1743">It's just not nice even if you're cold and even if you're unhappy you don't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And so I was really annoyed. </sentence><sentence id="1745">My sort of American side that hates when people cheat on line was getting very angry. </sentence><sentence id="1746">And then all of a sudden like I had this revelation, wait a second, that's why they survived. </sentence><sentence id="1747">They just do what seems to them the right thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And then I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="1749">My father's dead for a long time and I've moved away from that world and I just loved them and I wanted to kiss all of them. </sentence><sentence id="1750">I didn't leave because I'm not them. </sentence><sentence id="1751">But they left because that's why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life. </sentence><sentence id="1752">The vast majority of the survivors are normal, functioning human beings. </sentence><sentence id="1753">Even if they're a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too much, even if they have more fears than your average person, even if they are way more over-protective of their children, than your average person, even all of those things and even if their children say oh my parents were such crazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And the ones who are were lunatics anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1755">The ones who are were lunatics before the war. </sentence><sentence id="1756">This had a searing and traumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for the most part. </sentence><sentence id="1757">There are lots of successful business people, successful professionals. </sentence><sentence id="1758">All the survivors I know as children all of them made it. </sentence><sentence id="1759">Even if they were just laborers, they still went to work in the morning and they still provided for their families. </sentence><sentence id="1760">They were fine, they were really fine; crazy but crazy in a way that's understandable. </sentence><sentence id="1761">But anyway so I love them all because they are what they are. </sentence><sentence id="1762">They survived because they have the courage to do what feels right at the moment instinctively. </sentence><sentence id="1763">I don't know if there's anything else I can say at all. </sentence><sentence id="1764">This is not about my father's American experience and that's of course what I'm most familiar with. </sentence><sentence id="1765">He had a good one. </sentence><sentence id="1766">He spoke English all the time to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1767">They spoke Yiddish when they didn't want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1768">He was fiercely proud of being Jewish even if he wouldn't fast on Yom Kippur because he didn't believe in God anymore and he'd gone hungry long enough. </sentence><sentence id="1769">But I didn't know he didn't fast on Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="1770">He didn't want me to know that because ......1 mean I'm sure he would have told me if I was older, but I was little. </sentence><sentence id="1771">I think that's all I have to say, at least now. </sentence><sentence id="1772">If I think of something in the next ten minutes we can always add it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1887">Q: Thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1889">A: I have one more thing to add, I just remembered. </sentence><sentence id="1890">When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939, my father's wife said to him, escape to the Russian zone, you can do that for a couple of months in September, October, November of 1939; you go escape. </sentence><sentence id="1891">After all the Germans won't hurt women and children but they might hurt men. </sentence><sentence id="1892">And my father said well it's true the Germans certainly won't hurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1893">His memories of World War I were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the German army came and occupied Poland the situation of the Jews improved. </sentence><sentence id="1894">The Germans were civilized and nice and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1895">So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn't be so bad but he didn't want to go to the east because he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric and he didn't want to go to the east. </sentence><sentence id="1896">He said the Germans are more civilized than the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1897">I will take my chances with the Germans and I don't want to leave my family alone and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1898">So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the detriment of lots of Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1899">That's all I wanted to add... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1911">Q: Thanks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1913">A: You're welcome. </sentence><sentence id="1914">My father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil and that they were doing terrible things to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1915">He understood that. </sentence><sentence id="1916">He just thought that ultimately German decency would prevail whereas the Russians were utterly repulsive and that it was at best to stay at home with family and take one's chances with these Germans than go off to Russia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
