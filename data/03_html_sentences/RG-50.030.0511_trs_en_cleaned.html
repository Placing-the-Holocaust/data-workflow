<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2152">Q: Mmn-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2154">A: And we fortunately -- this was at the beginning, the French still had stuff, we got vaccinated for these miseries. </sentence><sentence id="2155">They da -- it took care of three shots, you know, we -- a week apart. </sentence><sentence id="2156">The trouble was that they were administered by German trained doctors and I don't know what possessed the Germans, they put the vaccination in your pectoral, whether you're male or female, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2157">Not nice. </sentence><sentence id="2158">Hurts a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2159">So the first one, I took it. </sentence><sentence id="2160">At that time I might also say that the needles were approximately a good five to 10 times larger than what they are now. </sentence><sentence id="2161">And of course, there was no such thing as AIDS, so everybody got stuck with the same needle. </sentence><sentence id="2162">So anyway, the first shot in, fine. </sentence><sentence id="2163">A week later, second shot in. </sentence><sentence id="2164">It hurts. </sentence><sentence id="2165">And the third time, they -- the doctor was like this and I go like that, I jerk back. </sentence><sentence id="2166">So the needle being half in, it zigzagged a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2167">The doctor didn't bat an eyelash, pulls the needle out. </sentence><sentence id="2168">Straightens it out with his hand and then he sticks me again. </sentence><sentence id="2169">End of discussion. </sentence><sentence id="2170">Of course, I didn't get any of the sicknesses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2189">Q: Is -- i-is -- does it surprise you now that you would vaccinate you? </sentence><sentence id="2190">I mean, why are they doing that if they're what -- if they're supposedly not caring about who you are, or what you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2191">A: Well, the French are very nice people. </sentence><sentence id="2192">They are ha -- they are not at all like the Germans, they're not out to kill you. </sentence><sentence id="2193">They're forced into a situation that was abhorrent to them. </sentence><sentence id="2194">You see that -- that's what people don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2195">They didn't like to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2196">There was anti-Semitism in France, too, mind you, 99 percent Catholic country, you know, that you gotta understand that the -- the Jews did all ba -- kinds of bad thing to Christ, which wasn't true, but that's the preaching as it went, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2197">One of the popes in "96 says, hey, forget about that, but at that time it was still running. </sentence><sentence id="2198">But the French really are not vicious. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2199">Q: But what did you know la -- in this camp, if you didn't know? </sentence><sentence id="2200">Anything about the Vichy government versus the occupied [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2201">You didn't know anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4034">A: A 1936 Chevy station wagon. </sentence><sentence id="4035">And they drove us up in the woods, you know, like the mountains, the beginning of the mountains is woods. </sentence><sentence id="4036">And the foresters had marked up the trees that needed to be cut. </sentence><sentence id="4037">Now, they were all dead oak. </sentence><sentence id="4038">Now, oak by itself is very hard. </sentence><sentence id="4039">If it's dead, it's like trying to cut steel. </sentence><sentence id="4040">Not only that, you had to clear away the underbrush, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4041">So first you had to clear the underbrush, I had -- well, I had the -- the other guys with me, eight guys </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4042"> and me. </sentence><sentence id="4043">Teams of two there with the saws. </sentence><sentence id="4044">You know those long saws that slightly curve [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="4045">So I was the hatchet man, the axe man because I have experience in Castelnot as a lumberjack. </sentence><sentence id="4046">I did that for quite a long time in the winter over there. </sentence><sentence id="4047">They send me in the woods, they told me which trees to cut down all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="4048">Anyway, so I have plenty experience, I was the axe man. </sentence><sentence id="4049">So I was the one that had to clear the underbrush. </sentence><sentence id="4050">And if you notice, if you look at the tree, the roots grow up like this. </sentence><sentence id="4051">The roots don't grow underneath, they grow outside. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4052">And when they're oaks and when they're like a hundred years old, I mean we're talking. </sentence><sentence id="4053">So you had to chop that up before you could get at the basic tree trunk, and the prerequisite was not like the lumberjacks over here with the power saw at arm's height like this, cutting the thing, no. </sentence><sentence id="4054">You had to cut it right flush with the ground. </sentence><sentence id="4055">Wonderful, wonderful exercise. </sentence><sentence id="4056">And I have to decide which way the tree would fall, so I had to notch it in various ways, and then the saw team came and they went opposite of the notch, and -- and then we had to cut it in three foot lengths, you know, stack the wood, cords of wood, and split it. </sentence><sentence id="4057">| mean, can you imagine splitting trees that big around?

</sentence><sentence id="4122">Took a gamble. </sentence><sentence id="4123">Could have handed me over to the police, too, right, or the Germans? </sentence><sentence id="4124">Says, let me see, come back in a little while. </sentence><sentence id="4125">He set up an appointment with me -- for me with some mountain type guy, and we met, supposedly some sort of bridge, I -- I could get out, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4126">I me -- I worked for the assistant and he -- he had the gate right behind his house, so I knew how to get out of the place without getting through the barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="4127">So I met him, and meanwhile it became known for some reason that I was gonna get out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4128">And the next think I know, I got four guys bugging the bejeebers out of me to take them with m -- with me, along. </sentence><sentence id="4129">There was only one drawback. </sentence><sentence id="4130">After I saw the guide, he says it's -- argument-wise, 5,000 whatever it is per person. </sentence><sentence id="4131">I says okay. </sentence><sentence id="4132">I had -- I always had some money, I worked. </sentence><sentence id="4133">Even in the camp when I was the orderly I made money, fine. </sentence><sentence id="4134">Always had money. </sentence><sentence id="4135">But the other dudes didn't have any money. </sentence><sentence id="4136">So what are we gonna do? </sentence><sentence id="4137">I have to rustle up a fortune of money. </sentence><sentence id="4138">So in the middle of the night we used to sneak out of the camp and sell everything we could get rid of, we didn't need. </sentence><sentence id="4139">So eventually -- and then I went to some guy I know who had a lot of money, and I says, look, blah, blah, blah, I'm shy so much money, how about it? </sentence><sentence id="4140">So he gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="4141">So finally I have got all the money and when we went out the camp at night, was the winter anyway, it was January the 21deg, 1944 -- so I gave him the money and the money wasn't for him. </sentence><sentence id="4142">He -- during the day they had to hide us in a farmhouse and the farmer had to feed us. </sentence><sentence id="4143">In order to buy food they needed money, that's what the money was for. </sentence><sentence id="4144">And you know the Pyrenees fooled me a lot. </sentence><sentence id="4145">I had no idea, I'm telling you, I'm naive in every re-respect. </sentence><sentence id="4146">Only once though, you don't do it twice with me. </sentence><sentence id="4147">But the first time around, anything goes. </sentence><sentence id="4148">I saw the mountain, I says, oh, you climb that mountain, on the other side is Spain, no big deal. </sentence><sentence id="4149">Imagine my disappointment when we get on top of the mountain, what's across the s -- from me as far as I can see, another mountain, just as high. </sentence><sentence id="4150">Well, there were six of them. </sentence><sentence id="4151">Ill make it short because w-we don't have a week. </sentence><sentence id="4152">The last week -- the last day, we hit the glacier, we were that high up already, you know, past the snow line, glacier. </sentence><sentence id="4153">Now, we weren't exactly dressed. </sentence><sentence id="4154">Remember this is between January 21deg, and January 27% alright? </sentence><sentence id="4155">And in the mountains that's not exactly summertime weather. </sentence><sentence id="4156">And especially without the proper equipment. </sentence><sentence id="4157">So we hitting this glacier -- oh, by the way, those guides were all volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="4158">They walked the whole night, and then they c -- they -- they could walk much better than us, then the following -- well, the following morning, they ran back to the -- their day job. </sentence><sentence id="4159">Some of them were e-engineers on a -- on a train. </sentence><sentence id="4160">Some did ta -- they -- th-they did that -- they didn't get any sleep for 24 hours. </sentence><sentence id="4161">They did that without a nickel of remuneration. </sentence><sentence id="4162">The money was strictly for the farmers so they could buy food for us. </sentence><sentence id="4163">Logical situation, which we didn't know but we found out. </sentence><sentence id="4164">So we climbed during the night. </sentence><sentence id="4165">The reason that it took so long -- there's a perfectly good road that goes along in the valley, the only trouble is that it's patrolled by Germans, because that's the road between Spain and France. </sentence><sentence id="4166">So we went over every mountain without any roads whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="4167">Was horror show. </sentence><sentence id="4168">I once fell down the side of a mountain cliff just like that. </sentence><sentence id="4169">And it's just like in the movies, th-the only thing that stopped me between heaven and earth, there was this shrub sticking out from that cliff. </sentence><sentence id="4170">And I get ahold of it. </sentence><sentence id="4171">So now I'm looking up and I see the guys on top and I look down below. </sentence><sentence id="4172">And the guides came, he was like s -- more of a mountaineer, right? </sentence><sentence id="4173">You see, there was -- the pass was that wide, there was no light. </sentence><sentence id="4174">And it had eroded, there was a hole like that and I didn't see, and I stepped right in that hole. </sentence><sentence id="4175">The way we could see is -- you know what a musette is? </sentence><sentence id="4176">That's like a bread bag that they have in France for the soldiers or for anything, a -- a bag, and they're usually in light canvas. </sentence><sentence id="4177">So, was flung over the back from the guy, so that's what you were focusing on because him you couldn't see, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4178">Phew. </sentence><sentence id="4179">So he came and got me back up again. </sentence><sentence id="4180">Oy. </sentence><sentence id="4181">That was scary. </sentence><sentence id="4182">I didn't scream, either. </sentence><sentence id="4183">Not a peep out of me, I wasn't giving anybody away. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="4335">I'm not a soldier or anything like that, I'm their leader, hallelujah. </sentence><sentence id="4336">Same way I was the leader of the other dudes. </sentence><sentence id="4337">They all were older than me. </sentence><sentence id="4338">So we're facing this glacier there, sheer wall. </sentence><sentence id="4339">So the mountain man, he has this pick, you know this -- they got these things, they're those picks, and he's hacking a step into the ice, one step at a time. </sentence><sentence id="4340">So here -- it's like a bunch of monkeys, we're all hanging on for dear life, one hand in this -- in -- in the step and the other one was standing there, and the guy in front of you is standing there. </sentence><sentence id="4341">Finally you make it to the top. </sentence><sentence id="4342">And the top is one sheer field of ice, going down like this. </sentence><sentence id="4343">Anyway you want to look at, sheer ice. </sentence><sentence id="4344">Well, we get to the top and guide says to me, well okay, this is th -- that -- this is one for the ages. </sentence><sentence id="4345">You follow that river, and that will lead you to civilization. </sentence><sentence id="4346">I said to him, river?

</sentence><sentence id="4375">And once in a blue moon we saw a Spaniard. </sentence><sentence id="4376">Now, two of the guys were Spanish Civil War veterans, so they spoke Spanish, so [indecipherable] you know, whatever, so a -- ah -- they thought we were Spaniards. </sentence><sentence id="4377">Here goes. </sentence><sentence id="4378">We come around the corner, and we froze. </sentence><sentence id="4379">What's in front of us like -- hard to say accurately, let's say 500 feet. </sentence><sentence id="4380">A platoon of Germans with trucks and everything. </sentence><sentence id="4381">I says, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. </sentence><sentence id="4382">And you know who was the most scared?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5196">A: You can't stay there, da da da. </sentence><sentence id="5197">I came over here -- of course, it was an experience, an eye- opener, because the United States, even though it was originally populated by white people from Europe, is so different from Europe, like night and day. </sentence><sentence id="5198">There's no -- there's not even -- you can't even compare. </sentence><sentence id="5199">The closest you could conceivably come to compare one with the other is Germany and the United States. </sentence><sentence id="5200">But even that is really a stretch. </sentence><sentence id="5201">The attitude, the mentality, the - - it's totally different here. </sentence><sentence id="5202">Look, I want to just explains to you how -- let's forget Hitler which was the worst thing in the world. </sentence><sentence id="5203">Happened to the world, not just the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="5204">Germany had social security under Bismarck, we're going back to the 19" century, okay, okay? </sentence><sentence id="5205">They were pretty advanced, right? </sentence><sentence id="5206">You work in France [indecipherable] twice, doesn't matter who your boss is, you can change jobs five times a year. </sentence><sentence id="5207">As long as you work a four months, you get credit for that four months. </sentence><sentence id="5208">For every month you work -- I'm going back to 1948 -- deg46 -- deg47, you get one and a half days vacation, right? </sentence><sentence id="5209">Which means 18 days a year, working days. </sentence><sentence id="5210">Plus a bonus, not your salary, but a little extra, so you should actually be able to enjoy a vacation. </sentence><sentence id="5211">I think that's very progressive. </sentence><sentence id="5212">You're not at the mercy of a boss. </sentence><sentence id="5213">This is state mandated. </sentence><sentence id="5214">You retire at the ripe old age of 60 with 80 percent of your earning. </sentence><sentence id="5215">Over here you get Social Security, if you make 20 percent you're doing real good. </sentence><sentence id="5216">You -- you -- you know what I'm saying? </sentence><sentence id="5217">So there -- there are differences, and these are the large difference that you don't even know when you come here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
