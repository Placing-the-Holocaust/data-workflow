<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: And where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: That was a very famous German school, one of the most famous boarding schools in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="181">My father had a -- a friend, a friend -- or friend is said too much, a companion, when he grew up in his high school gymnasium, yes, called Kurt Hahn. </sentence><sentence id="182">And Kurt Hahn is a fascinating character in his own right. </sentence><sentence id="183">Kurt Hahn was -- became secretary to the Prince of Baden, who became chancellor -- interim chancellor. </sentence><sentence id="184">And after the first World War, in the castle of the prince, he founded a boarding school, on the English model, on the English model, which became a boarding school si -- it's difficult to say. </sentence><sentence id="185">It became a boarding school -- it's -- I mean, it's not difficult to say, it's just I have to find the right words. </sentence><sentence id="186">It became a boarding school for the aristocracy, yes. </sentence><sentence id="187">For example, the Duke of Edinburgh went there, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="188">The queen of Greece. </sentence><sentence id="189">I used to dunk her pigtails into ink. </sentence><sentence id="190">I mean, the late queen of Greece, yes. </sentence><sentence id="191">Didn't like her very much as a child. </sentence><sentence id="192">And all sorts of yes, royalty, and rich families, but also poor. </sentence><sentence id="193">But it's typical of the atmosphere of the school that the free places, or scholarship places were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="194">Or people, officers who'd fallen in the first World War, something like that, yes. </sentence><sentence id="195">I think that was very typical, though the plus of the school was that it was one of a very few, I think the only German boarding school that was co- educational. </sentence><sentence id="196">And that was not on the English model, and that was a great plus, yes. </sentence><sentence id="197">But otherwise, it's very strict discipline, as you can well imagine, yes. </sentence><sentence id="198">And I don't think the teaching was very good, I don't think you learned a lot, but your character was built. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Did you like school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Yes, I liked school, because I'm a bully by nature, and did very well. " </sentence><sentence id="221">Cause in these boarding schools, if you're not a bully by nature, you don't do very well. </sentence><sentence id="222">I did very well indeed in the two boarding schools I went to, "cause eventually I went to an English boarding school, of course, when Hitler came in. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Well, if your s -- boys together in a boarding school, yes, I mean, there's a lot of bullying, you know, after all, yes? </sentence><sentence id="233">And it's children among themselves, especially young teenagers can be very brutal. </sentence><sentence id="234">But all this was controlled by a discipline which I now think, looking back on it, was really excellent and doesn't exist in this country at all. </sentence><sentence id="235">For example, from -- from the age of 10 on, yes -- I left it when I was 15, but it existed "til the age of 18, you got something called -- if you were especially good -- this was a privilege, you got a training plan, which was a plan on which there was written, have you brushed your teeth, have you done your run in the morning, have you had your cold shower, yes? </sentence><sentence id="236">You know? </sentence><sentence id="237">Have you cheated today, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="238">And you put a plus and minus whether you did it or not. </sentence><sentence id="239">And nobody cheated. </sentence><sentence id="240">Was a privilege, nobody cheated. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that -- that, I think, makes up for all the deficiencies of the school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Why do you think that was so, that nobody cheated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: -- It was just in the atmosphere, it was a privilege, it wouldn't have occurred to anybody to cheat. </sentence><sentence id="255">It was not done. </sentence><sentence id="256">The best way of putting it: it was simply not done. </sentence><sentence id="257">And that sort of training is totally absent in American education, unfortunately. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: George, growing up in -- in such a household, with parents who are, in a real sense, public figures, what does that mean about who you meet, who comes into the house, what was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Well, you met interesting people. </sentence><sentence id="264">Of course I was much too young to notice interesting people, yes? </sentence><sentence id="265">I mean, for example, one day Litvinov, the -- the -- the Russian, first foreign minister, the Bolsheviks, came -- came to the house, a party or something, and I was allowed to go into the drawing room downstairs, which as a rule I was not, of course, yes? </sentence><sentence id="266">And he had on a </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: Well, at -- first of all I was last because I was bad, generally, and I had to do -- what do you call it, after school, what do you call it if you have to stay after school, yeah? </sentence><sentence id="548">I had to stay after school, and my parents and everybody was out. </sentence><sentence id="549">And Hitler made a decree that I think -- I -- I always get that wrong, but let's say towards the first of February or something, you -- not the first of February, the 12" of February, you had to have a permit to leave Germany, yes. </sentence><sentence id="550">That was unprecedented, that never been before, yes. </sentence><sentence id="551">And I wouldn't have gotten it, because the Nazis would have taken me hostage for the family, and the newspapers, and everything, yes. </sentence><sentence id="552">So my parents pleaded, but the headmistress of my pre-school -- I was, of course, in pre-school--who was a real Protestant type, a Vermont Protestant type, but a real Prussian Protestant type, said no, that I must stay till I have finished my duty after school, you see. </sentence><sentence id="553">So, the result of that is -- no, I mean she was a wonderful woman, she got into -- Fraeulein Koeppen was her name, she got into prison eventually because she refused to teach "Mein Kampf", but she refused to teach "Mein Kampf" in German class, because it was bad German, not because we -- you know, it was bad German. </sentence><sentence id="554">It is bad German, yeah, so she was a real -- as you call it, a real -- you know, a real type, as it were. </sentence><sentence id="555">So I was late, and the way to leave was via the ferry across Lake Constance, "cause that's near where the school was. </sentence><sentence id="556">So I came to the ferry, and that was the last ferry before this so-called "sichtvermerk," this permit -- the exit permit, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="557">And there were nothing but Brown Shirts on either side, yes. </sentence><sentence id="558">And when you had to run through them, as it were, yes. </sentence><sentence id="559">And -- and it was my luck that just before Hitler had mentioned us, in some way. </sentence><sentence id="560">Mosse, Jew press, you know, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="561">So I came there, and I said, well, I'm done for, because all they did is hel -- hold me back five minutes and the ferry would be gone and they had me. </sentence><sentence id="562">And indeed, when I showed my passport, they looked at each other and passed it from one SA man to another. </sentence><sentence id="563">They didn't stop me. </sentence><sentence id="564">That's Germany. </sentence><sentence id="565">It was five minute to 12, not 12. </sentence><sentence id="566">So that's why I'm here today, yes. </sentence><sentence id="567">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: George, talk a little bit about being liberal Jews, and the importance of that in that -- in that context. </sentence><sentence id="591">Because often people talk about anti-Semitism, but not about the political -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: Well, the political orientation of most Jews, German Jews, most Jews in Europe, was a liberal orientation, because they were emancipated in the enlightenment. </sentence><sentence id="593">That had given them the chance of emancipation, to become part of the community as it were. </sentence><sentence id="594">And this chance they used, and what remained of it was a belief, let us say in -- in -- in processes, not in finished thing -- in other words, in Germany -- there's one other factor perhaps I should explain. </sentence><sentence id="595">There is the word "Bildung", which means -- it's a German word, essentially European word, which means cultivate your character, cultivate yourself. </sentence><sentence id="596">And the assimilation of Jews was facilitated by the idea that everybody could cultivate his own nature, his own character, yes. </sentence><sentence id="597">Didn't matter were you Jews and Christians, because this was a process. </sentence><sentence id="598">This was not a finished product, like nation or anything else: this was a process. </sentence><sentence id="599">Now, this fitted the whole Jewish situation obviously, because that was their way to integration, yes? </sentence><sentence id="600">So that you will find, for example in Germany, yeah, that the Jews supported the small liberal party, which was tiny by 1933, yes, our newspapers, the other Jewish owned newspapers, yes. </sentence><sentence id="601">Which meant most of the serious press supported the tiny liberal party, when it obviously had no chance. </sentence><sentence id="602">And of course, as in a way the fate of the Jews depended not only on tolerance, but also on freedom, economic freedom, and so on, yes. </sentence><sentence id="603">They didn't see -- my father, for example, not at all-- what was obvious, that by the 1920's, the social democrats were the great champions of the Jews in Germany, yes. </sentence><sentence id="604">But they didn't see it, they still saw the social democratic Marxist rhetoric as an enemy, yes. </sentence><sentence id="605">So I remember when my sister first voted social democratic. </sentence><sentence id="606">That was terrible row in the house, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="622"> terrible row. </sentence><sentence id="623">And my mother immediately began with the toothbrush, "do you want to share your toothbrush? </sentence><sentence id="624">That was her reaction to everything on socialist, you see. </sentence><sentence id="625">It was terrible, though. </sentence><sentence id="626">Illegitimate children were also mentioned, and God knows why. </sentence><sentence id="627">I mean, today it seems ridiculous, but that's how social democrats were perceived, though they were the real champions of the Jews, not the liberals, not the political liberals in Germany, that -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="628">But they will remain liberals to the very end, that is the German Jewish tradition, and it's a very fine tradition. </sentence><sentence id="629">In a way you can put it this way, that it were the German Jews who carried the liberal tradition from 1933 through to 1945. </sentence><sentence id="630">Who transmitted it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="650">No, many of the children of these very rich Jews became socialists, of course, yes. </sentence><sentence id="651">Some became communists, it's well known, yes. </sentence><sentence id="652">No, she worked up in the north of Berlin, in the Wedding, the working class part, with children at that time in her life. </sentence><sentence id="653">And told my father, for example, that working class children already came to -- came to the meetings with little Nazi daggers in their belt, my father should take Hitler seriously. </sentence><sentence id="654">My father thought till the last that Hitler belonged in the comic papers -- pages of the newspaper, yes. </sentence><sentence id="655">After all, that's what Hitler, you know, helped him so much that everybody undervalued him. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: Do you go to France, or do you go to Switzerland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: No, I go to -- well, first I go to Switzerland, cause you see, what happened after deg33, the advertising agencies of ours, which were outside Germany, they went with the family, yes, not with the German, but with the family. </sentence><sentence id="716">And the biggest of those was in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="717">Indeed, if you go to Zurich, have -- I don't know if you've been to Zurich, but in the Limmatquais the chief you know, where the canal is, there is one house that to this day has Mosse house on it. </sentence><sentence id="718">That was the headquarters of our Swiss business, which was very large. </sentence><sentence id="719">So first we went on to Switzerland, for one year I went to a Swiss boarding school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: And everybody's together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: No, no, nobody's together, because my brother immediately went to study in Zurich, my sister went to study medicine and so on in Basel, you know, and I stayed one year in a boarding school near Zurich. </sentence><sentence id="728">My parents were already divor -- separated, my father was in Paris, my mother immediately went to Juan-les-Pins, the Riviera. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="735">A: I mean, it was -- it was hard. </sentence><sentence id="736">The Swiss boarding school wasn't particularly good, I have very few memories of it. </sentence><sentence id="737">But then I went to English boarding school, and that was hard, because you had to adjust, you had a language, nobody there knew German, it wasn't really in the cards. </sentence><sentence id="738">You had to adjust and so on, yes. </sentence><sentence id="739">But it was a very good boarding school, the Quaker boarding school, run by the Society of Friends. </sentence><sentence id="740">A good boarding school, and -- and I -- I made it all right, yes. </sentence><sentence id="741">But everything wa -- became a hassle, because in the first list of si -- of people who lost their citizenship, we were in that first list, including me, all of 15. </sentence><sentence id="742">So having no citizenship in the modern world was a terrible fate. </sentence><sentence id="743">So everything became a problem. </sentence><sentence id="744">Everything, yes. </sentence><sentence id="745">First, when you visited your mother in yo -- parent, father, in France, you had to have permit de sejour. </sentence><sentence id="746">Was dreadful and humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="747">These women there, and these -- these official things in France are unbelievable, unbelievable, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="762">Q: What did they do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: Imean, they're -- they're just -- just a bureaucracy that you can't imagine. </sentence><sentence id="765">And very nasty, because we were mere immigrants, and nothing, nothing, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="766">So that wasn't a big change, yes. </sentence><sentence id="767">You had to do that everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="768">For example, whenever I went to Switzerland to see my sister or brother, I had to -- my father, I -- my father had to deposit a very large sum, to be sure I went out again. </sentence><sentence id="769">Do you know? </sentence><sentence id="770">The Swiss were the worst, that's not generally realized. </sentence><sentence id="771">The "J" for Jew in your passport, that was a Swiss, not a Nazi idea at all. </sentence><sentence id="772">It was a Swiss idea, so they could keep Jews out, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="773">That isn't enough -- emphasized enough, yes. </sentence><sentence id="774">So I didn't -- so then we all got different passports, of course. </sentence><sentence id="775">My sister, because it was very -- she knew how to do things, went -- there was one consul in Naples, Reitling was his name, who gave Jews passports without a "J". </sentence><sentence id="776">And she got one. </sentence><sentence id="777">And th -- almost the same thing happened to me, I went in London to get a new passport without a "J", you know, and the consular official talked to me and shoved me over surreptitiously, a passport without a "J". </sentence><sentence id="778">You see, there were decent people around, yes. </sentence><sentence id="779">So for awhile I had a passport, then my brother became a Turk for awhile because we had very good Turkish connections, yes. </sentence><sentence id="780">And then this German passport expired in a very short time, and my father got the Prime Minister of Luxemburg to forge his own passport, which I still have, for me, yes, without expiry date, so I traveled for about three years on a Luxemburgian passport, which was embarrassing when I met somebody from Luxemburg because I'd never been there, of course, in my life. </sentence><sentence id="781">And today I keep it in case the Americans are cheeky, I say, me, a Luxemburgian, you know. </sentence><sentence id="782">And what I learned from that is you can never have enough passports, believe me, you can never have enough passports. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="803">Q: So tell me more about what it's -- what it's like during this time, you're traveling around the -- this is before 1939, between "33, and "34, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="804">A: In "39, when I was first in Bootham, in this school in York, and then every vacation -- don't forget you're six months in, six months out usually in England in those days. </sentence><sentence id="805">So during the long vacations I went first to my father and stepmother in Paris and then to my mother in Juan-les- Pins usually, yes. </sentence><sentence id="806">Divided it. </sentence><sentence id="807">Or if it is summer, my mother had a house in Charmonix in the Montblanc -- I mean, in the Alps, so I went to Paris and Charmonix. </sentence><sentence id="808">You see, in winter I went skiing. </sentence><sentence id="809">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="810">Q: So during this period, at least, there is support from all the businesses that are outside of Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="812">A: Yes, indeed, mm-hm, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="814">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="815">And you father is still working at this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="818">A: Yes, right, he had an office in Paris and he still worked at this, yes. </sentence><sentence id="819">But Hitler took them one by one. </sentence><sentence id="820">Every time he con -- conquered a country, a business went out, you see, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="821">So it must have been difficult, I wasn't in -- you know, in the loop that I could say what the discussion was about finances. </sentence><sentence id="822">But it was certainly difficult. </sentence><sentence id="823">I would say that when I remember -- also I should add that is, yes, I remember when we left in "33, we first went to Zurich, to a hotel, yeah, and that I remember visit -- vividly, cause that hotel was full of emigres, sudden emigres. </sentence><sentence id="824">It just happened, just happened. </sentence><sentence id="825">Emigres who were quite famous. </sentence><sentence id="826">The literary critic of our paper, for example, Kerr was there, and all sorts of people. </sentence><sentence id="827">And the whole thing I always thought, even then, must have been like the refugees from the French revolution sort of atmosphere, yes. </sentence><sentence id="828">But I    lost it cause I was bitten by my dog -- by a dog then, the first time I was ever bitten by a dog. </sentence><sentence id="829">But nevermind, it had nothing to do with the greater events. </sentence><sentence id="830">So anyway, that I remember vividly. </sentence><sentence id="831">And the next episode that I remember vividly is that Goering called my father back, and he said, "T want to talk to you, and if you don't come back, we'll take your mother." </sentence><sentence id="832">And so -- his sisters were still there, yes, hostage. </sentence><sentence id="833">So my father, who must have been a very courageous man -- well, he fought in the first World War-- I guess, went onto the train to Berlin, to Goering. </sentence><sentence id="834">And nobody knows what really transpired, but there is a secret history here, which has never been really scru - - it's never been investigated by scholars, how many Jews were Aryanized. " </sentence><sentence id="835">Cause my f -- Goering offered my father Aryanization. </sentence><sentence id="836">There were others, some very famous, the German chief of the Luftwaffe, General Milch was Aryanized. </sentence><sentence id="837">Now why he did this is a general dispute. </sentence><sentence id="838">Either -- I don't think it's cause he wanted to use the advertising agencies as spy places, he had enough spy places. </sentence><sentence id="839">Maybe he wanted respectability, and he would have -- you know, he would have had him maybe for a year, and then, yo -- you know, to Dachau, or something else, yeah? </sentence><sentence id="840">I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="841">Anyway, my father refused, and was escorted back on the train by the chief -- then chief of the German secret police, a man called Bergmann, the first chief of the Nazi secret police. </sentence><sentence id="842">And we think he should have been murdered on the train, but he wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="843">And Bergmann wrote his memoirs where he also talks about this, and he came back. </sentence><sentence id="844">So that was the next episode. </sentence><sentence id="845">And that, of course, I remember, yeah, cause there were some anxieties, you can imagine, yes? </sentence><sentence id="846">But then it must be said that in these early days, the Nazis asked other people to come back. </sentence><sentence id="847">For example, the - our chief editor, Theo DeWolfe, who was a [indecipherable] man, has a correspondence, and Goebbels asked him to come back. </sentence><sentence id="848">They wanted respectability for a period. </sentence><sentence id="849">I think that's really the explanation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
