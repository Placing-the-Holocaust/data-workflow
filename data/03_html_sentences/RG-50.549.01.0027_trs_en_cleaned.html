<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection because we didn't know what happened to anyone and so we were hoping that when we go home, we'll find each other and start a new family, a family again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: | want to ask about the family that you stayed with, what, what was their nationality and do you remember anything about them and your attitude toward them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: | did not stay with families, these are the people that ran away. </sentence><sentence id="6">These were the Nazi homes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: You were in a vacant home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And who, was there food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: As | said, the Russian soldiers, the occupiers brought us food and medicine and that's how we were being helped to, you know, to get stronger again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: I'm trying to get a picture when you say we, was there a group of people who you were close, closer to than the others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: No, not basically, just people who survived and if had two sisters survive, naturally they would stay together or like my mother and | survived so we stayed together and we were just trying to get some food and medicine to try to get stronger so that somehow we could get, head back home to look for our families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: But you and your mother were in this place with lots of other people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Mm-hm, there were, as | mentioned originally, there were about 500 women there from the Poland and then the next 500 were us, who were taken later, from Auschwitz to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="24">| might just see what I'm touching and what I'm not touching there. </sentence><sentence id="25">And this is the part that's very important, there. </sentence><sentence id="26">As | mentioned, the Russian soldiers were helping us with bringing food and medicine to this homes, where the empty homes that we, they have places us after the German SS ran away. </sentence><sentence id="27">And took us several weeks, I'd say about three, four weeks until we had enough energy to sort of walk around and just even think about going home. </sentence><sentence id="28">And that we did because the only thought that we had in mind was to get home, because we were hoping that if any of members of our family, would do the same and that we would meet there and be a family again. </sentence><sentence id="29">When my mother and | arrived, we went straight to our home and when we approached it there were people living in there and they were looking out the window which faced the street and of course when they recognized us, they got scared. </sentence><sentence id="30">They said, "What? </sentence><sentence id="31">You return, you survived? </sentence><sentence id="32">We were told that you were all killed and now that you survived and now you are back home, you will want your home back and you will This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="33">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="34"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="35"> want your businesses back. </sentence><sentence id="36">This is terrible, we thought that you were all killed." </sentence><sentence id="37">My mother and | looked at one another and my mother said, "No, we don't want our home back, we do not want our business back and we don't want to live among you. </sentence><sentence id="38">Anyone who was our neighbor and business partners or business associate and this is the kind of greetings that we get when you see that we had survived, we don't want to or we are unable to live among you again." </sentence><sentence id="39">And my mother and | turned on our heels and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="40">We walked to the center of the city, where there were already some of the survivors who also went home, trying to find families and | don't remember now whether we were put into a big home, somebody's home or rather a small hotel, but we were placed somewhere again while we were waiting to see if my father or my brother will come home. </sentence><sentence id="41">Because most of our families, you know, like mother's parents and sisters and brothers, lived in different cities. </sentence><sentence id="42">So basically here we were waiting for my father and my brother, hopefully that they would come back. </sentence><sentence id="43">And so, several weeks passed by and every day a train arrived and we went to the train station to see if by some miracle my father or my brother would be on it. </sentence><sentence id="44">And then weeks went by and they were not on there and so one of the men, who was a former citizen of our town, he apparently had pity on us, because we been doing this now for weeks after weeks, going to the railroad station every day and my father and my brother didn't show up so he called my mother on the side and myself and he said that we should not wait, we should get away from here as far as we can, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="45">Because my father and my brother are not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="46">So my mother asked how does he know? </sentence><sentence id="47">And he said that he was in the same camp with them and he saw them die, so he knows that they are not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="48">So with that, my mother turned to me and she said, "You know, we fought all this time so that we have our family hopefully together again and we suffered all of this and then, now that the war is over, we found out there was no reason to fight and to suffer, because there is no family left. </sentence><sentence id="49">We should take our lives now, because it's worthless, it's useless." </sentence><sentence id="50">And | said to her that | had just turned 15, nine days before the war was over and | said all | knew in my whole young life is suffering. </sentence><sentence id="51">| would like to go on living to see if there is anything better in this world, if there are better people, if there are kinder people and if there is a better life. </sentence><sentence id="52">So she said that if that's what | want, then her job as a mother was to go on with me, to help me survive and go on and try to make a new life for myself. </sentence><sentence id="53">So at this point we packed up the couple of things that we had and we were leaving our hometown and went over to Romania but at this point it was hard to get over there already because the Soviet Union occupied this area. </sentence><sentence id="54">The one thing | forgot to mention that my father had hidden some dollar bills and some jewelry before we were taken away and he showed it to all three of us that if we didn't know what was to happen to us, that is anybody came back, to see where it was so maybe it will help us go on when the war is over. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="55"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="56">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="57"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: Could you describe, did you have to sneak in to the yard to find that money? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes, what happened was, the money and the jewelry, my father hid in one of these small mason jars, sealed and he buried it in one of our warehouses in the ground. </sentence><sentence id="60">And because we knew that we have these neighbors that used to be our good neighbors and friends and they greeted us in the manner that | just described, we certainly didn't want to dig for it during the day where they would see us and possibly hurt us. </sentence><sentence id="61">So at night we took some shovels and the two of us and went there and we dug up the money in the one jar and the jewelry in the other jar and we took that money and some of it we paid border guards between Hungary and Romania so that we could get out already and the Russian soldiers were there, so in order to be able to get out of there and go over to Romania where my mother's, a lot of my mother's family lives. </sentence><sentence id="62">And so we gave them quite a bit of this money so that they would get us out of there and that's how we were able to get away already at that point. </sentence><sentence id="63">And then we live in, in Romania, this is again Transylvania, Romania, Hungary, where they changed again in 1940, it became Hungary again and then after the World War 2, 1945, it became part of Romania. </sentence><sentence id="64">And my mother had sisters there and other family and so we thought we'll stay there and see if any of those members of the families might have survived and come back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Where were you at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: This was, it was called Transylvania, Romania, Hungary, which is the southeastern part of Hungary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: What was the roof over your head? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: At that point, we had a small apartment, a one bedroom apartment that somehow, my mother's brother lived there prior to the war and so somehow they kept that apartment for him so when we came back and my uncle survived and he came back, we moved in together and we lived there and we stayed there for close to a year, again, waiting for hopefully family, to trickle back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: In a little town called? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: It's not a little town, it was a fairly decent sized town, it's called Satoumary(ph) in Romanian and the Hungarian name was Satmarnamaty(ph) and so we stayed here close to a year again, hoping for somebody from the family to come back and actually one more sister came back, out of eight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Your mother's sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="86">Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="87">And then... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Could you describe that? </sentence><sentence id="92">Do you remember her return? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="95">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="96">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="97"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: | don't quite remember, well | remember the return because we were all just hugging and kissing and you know, we somehow were all lived in this one bedroom apartment because it was very difficult to get anything else. </sentence><sentence id="99">And it was just, you know, hope and despair because despair was that, you know, my mother had eight siblings and only two of them came back. </sentence><sentence id="100">Her parents were killed. </sentence><sentence id="101">All the nephews and nieces and cousins, all of them were dead, all of them were killed, there was just this few of us, handful of us that survived. </sentence><sentence id="102">And again, we didn't want to stay there either, because there are a lot of the people were anti-Semitic again there as well. </sentence><sentence id="103">And so we didn't want to stay there, we were hoping that we could possibly emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="104">And the reason we wanted to come to the United States, because my mother's only sister, who got away just, couple of months before the war broke out in 1939, that she had left and so we wrote, well, her, fortunately | remembered her address in United States, | was all of, what, 13 and | wrote to them, you know, there's a couple of us survived and we would like to come to the United States so that we can be together. </sentence><sentence id="105">And so one day she found out about this, you know, then of course they arranged for all the necessary papers, which was quite difficult because at that time the United States did not want to let in much, many people of the eastern European continent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Could | ask you something? </sentence><sentence id="115">Do you, did she save that letter that you wrote to her, your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: | don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: | don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: So you don't have any letters like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: No, that one | don't have, what | do have letters from my father and my grandfather and from my uncle, who wrote to their sister here or their daughter, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: This same woman we're talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="131">That basically, | have other letters that my father wrote my grandfather, the father of the girl that was here and her brothers and sisters, writing to them, this is going back to 1937, "38 and even the very beginning of "39, begging them to do whatever arrangements they can for us to come to the States, you know, because the, it looked like the war was imminent and if they cannot help all of us, at least they should try to get my brother out, who was a teenager and my father, my parents were afraid that they will take him into the army and God knows where he will wind up, if he'll wind up alive at all. </sentence><sentence id="132">So these are letters that | have here, in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="133">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="134"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection original handwriting of my father and my grandfather and uncles and aunts, who are begging them to try to do something, but it was too late at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Were you able to receive a reply from her or did you just never hear? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: No I, we did not. </sentence><sentence id="143">The only thing that | do have a copy of is, where this daughter, this sister who lived here, wrote to the American Red Cross, looking for her parents and this was already the beginning, of 1944, in April "44, maybe a week or two after we were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="144">And so she did not get a reply, but she does have a copy that the American Red Cross did receive this inquiry. </sentence><sentence id="145">So | have a copy of that, my aunt has the original. </sentence><sentence id="146">So this is something that, you know, is very, very precious because, you know, she was looking for them and we were already in Auschwitz, or when day, you know, days after they were killed in Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: You mentioned, we're back now in Transylvania in a small apartment with your surviving family members, you mentioned anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="153">What was it about the environment that, that happened that made you know or feel or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Well basically you know, we had this practice already, we had practice for many, many years, you know, what it was like and with anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="157">First very subtle and then if, after a while it wasn't subtle any more, they would just say whatever they felt or if people came back and they opened up their own businesses that they had before, they were, you know, really angry at them and they let the people know that you don't belong here any more and you shouldn't have the businesses here, nor should you live here. </sentence><sentence id="158">So when we saw all of this, this was when we decided that it was time to move on from here, too, because this is not a home for us any more either. </sentence><sentence id="159">Nobody wants the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="160">And so this is when we decided to try to come to the United States, you know, different people were trying to go to different places. </sentence><sentence id="161">Some to Israel, some to Canada, some wherever they would accept us because you've probably read about it, that most countries did not want us, including the United States. </sentence><sentence id="162">You know if you heard about the ship, the Saint Louis, where 1000 people were turned away, first from Cuba and then from the United States and no other country wanted them so most of them wound up in a concentration camp and killed. </sentence><sentence id="163">So no country really wanted the Jews whether it was during the war or even after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: So when you went from Transylvania, you were there for how long? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: As | said, a little less than a year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: And after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: That's when we went back to Germany because they, you know you could not emigrate from Romania or from these countries. </sentence><sentence id="179">Only from Germany or Austria This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="180">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="181"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and those are the places where the displaced, where the concentration camps were. </sentence><sentence id="182">So there were, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of people who survived the concentration camps but they had nowhere to go, so they were all just hanging around in some of these camps. </sentence><sentence id="183">Now some of these camps were actually concentration camps, prior. </sentence><sentence id="184">And then of course, the SS went away, ran away. </sentence><sentence id="185">Some of them were, these were mostly army barracks and so when we were in, in the camp, this particular camp was near Munich. </sentence><sentence id="186">It's called Poking(ph) and it was a rather large camp. </sentence><sentence id="187">And so we waited here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: When you say we, who do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: My mother and myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: So you said good-bye to your relatives? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Yes, stay, one of them stay there, she got married and stayed there, her sister and the brother stayed there for awhile but then he also came to the United States, also about 1949. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: And the distance from where you were to where you went, to the camp in Germany, how did you get? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Again, you know by this time they had some railroad, you know, trains traveling. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="209">Not the boxcars, but more or less regular railroads so we would hitch rides on them or we would hitch rides with farmers and pay them something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="210">Because there was no other transportation and we wanted to go back to Germany where, that was the only place we could emigrate to, either United States or anywhere else. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: This is the end of Tape 1, Side A. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Okay, so in order to seriously thinking about move, you know, coming to the United States where my mother's only surviving sister came, we had to go back to Germany and stay in one of these displaced person's camps, where most of the survivors of World War 2 and primarily of course the Holocaust survivors, since we had no other home, that we made this, these camps our homes and trying to make whatever arrangements have to be in order to be able to emigrate, whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="213">The reason we wanted to come to the United States was because my mother's sister was here and she's the only one that was able to get away before, just before the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="214">And so | remembered her address and wrote to her that a few of us survived and that we would like to come to the United States and could they make the arrangements? </sentence><sentence id="215">And so we got a letter back, oh by all means, you know and they would have to do, they would do whatever they have to do. </sentence><sentence id="216">In other words they had to guarantee that we would not be a burden on the United States government, that we would have a job waiting for us and a home waiting for us and that we will not be any kind of burden of the government or of the United This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="217">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="218"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection States citizen, that we would not take away their jobs, their homes, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="219">So they filled out all these forms and whatever else they needed, but being that we were born in Czechoslovakia and that quota system is very, very small, you see. </sentence><sentence id="220">Even the United States allowed only a very small number of people annually to enter the United States and there were certain countries that had even less, | mean a minute amount of people that they would let in annually. </sentence><sentence id="221">And we were unfortunately among those. </sentence><sentence id="222">So we had to sit here, in this displaced person's camp, in Poking(ph) until the beginning of 1949. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Okay, now | know and you heard me mention that when |, it's very fresh on my mind, your video interview, it was these, you were there for four years in this camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="236">It was these four years that | heard the least about. </sentence><sentence id="237">Could you recollect as a 15 year old, through her eyes, who you were then, what you saw, where you slept, how you ate and how you socialized? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Okay, | had just turned 16 by the time we got back to Germany in the displaced person's camp and this was another experience. </sentence><sentence id="239">We were again in this army barracks that did not have partitions or rooms, individual rooms. </sentence><sentence id="240">The only privacy that we had, we were given a blanket and a pillow there already and the only privacy we were able to muster for ourselves was to find a rope and tie it on between two nails and maybe find a few safety pins and with these safety pins, put these blankets on these ropes to separate one family from another. </sentence><sentence id="241">If a person was snoring right next door, you know, to you, well you just have to put up with it. </sentence><sentence id="242">| was just a 15 year old little girl, or just turned 16 and if | heard a couple who was next to us and have marital relationship, well that's what | had to listen to. </sentence><sentence id="243">If there was an old couple right next to us, they came from Uhzbakistan(ph), the backwoods of Russia, who knew very little of progress and life of today, having lived there. </sentence><sentence id="244">Their bodily noises were their lifestyle. </sentence><sentence id="245">| mean it was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="246">No matter, | mean you were surrounded by people who lived so many different ways and you just had to bear with it. </sentence><sentence id="247">Now the bed that we slept on, it was a cot and army cot, this particular camp, displaced person, displaced person's camp was built in a forest because this too was a concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: It had been. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: It had been during the was and so when the war was over, the people who survived the concentration camps lived in these places because there were no other place to go to. </sentence><sentence id="261">So being in middle of a forest, a lot of mice and a lot of rats came into these barracks and so middle of the night you had a visitor. </sentence><sentence id="262">When you were sleeping on this cot, you just never knew what bit your hand, it could have been a mouse, a field mouse or it could have been a large rat. </sentence><sentence id="263">There was no individual toilets, there was | think one on each end of the barracks and you know how large one of the barracks are. </sentence><sentence id="264">And so this is where we would take a shower or This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="265">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="266"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection stand in line for a bathroom or for a shower. </sentence><sentence id="267">And, and the food that we were given, excuse me, was again, you know, like army portions and that kind of stuff, but of course much more than what we have gotten when we were in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="268">It was already a living portion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Do you know who did the cooking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: At this point, it was more under the United States government and so there was a group called Unrra, U-n-r-r-a and the Joint, J-o-i-n-t distributing committee and they are the ones that supplied the food and did some of the cooking for us and such. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: But it was not much better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Well, not an awful lot better but it was at least more than what we have gotten before and the fact that we knew that we were free, that we could move, we could go, basically during the day wherever we wanted, that was everything because that was freedom. </sentence><sentence id="285">And there is nothing more important in a person's life, is just being free. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: So when you lay there, Maddie(ph) on certain nights, were there fears that you, your freedom might end? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Well there were all kinds of fears, there were many fears because when you are, you basically just turned 16 and already three years you have gone through all the hell a human being is capable of, one is scared of everything, whether it's the rats or the mice or what will be tomorrow or will | have anything to eat in these three days from now or am | going to survive and get out of this camp and will | have another, a normal life again? </sentence><sentence id="291">These are all fears and some. </sentence><sentence id="292">There are things that | can't even think of right now but these were all fears. </sentence><sentence id="293">So in order to counteract some of these fears and not think of them and to occupy people, these organizations | mentioned had offered something for people to do during the day. </sentence><sentence id="294">One of them was sewing, you know, clothe, making clothes. </sentence><sentence id="295">Another one was dental technique to become a dental technician and there were tailors and various other occupations that they brought in also from the group called ORT, O-R-T, which exists even today and these are people who help others that need help, to learn a profession and get started in life again. </sentence><sentence id="296">So these are the things that have been offered, they are to do during the day cause otherwise for years you'd go out of your mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1340">A: Just to, to basically almost like make-believe. </sentence><sentence id="1341">You know like putting it in the historical background, but it is more like, like Dr. Zhivago, that kind of feeling, you know, to show a lovely story. </sentence><sentence id="1342">A little bit more dramatic perhaps but that was not the way to portray the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1343">The one to portray the Holocaust are basically two films, as far as I'm concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1344">One is Shoa, which is a very long movie, S-h-o-a, which in the Hebrew means Holocaust and the other one is Steven Spielberg's, the Schindler's List. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And even and those are not 100% nearly as quite as bad as it really was, but they will give you more of the true facts as to what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1401">A: Specifically women, how they were able and coping mechanisms and what kept them alive and my experience and I'm sure most of the other people will agree with me, that there was no one coping mechanism. </sentence><sentence id="1402">There was no way that you could decide that if you go in this row, rather than in that row, that you will be safer. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Because the Nazi may have decided that, at the spur of the moment, that that row is going to the crematorium today and that row might go tomorrow or the day after. </sentence><sentence id="1404">So there was no such a thing as trying, you know, making it or able to make the right decision, there was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Survival in my opinion was a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1406">Chance of survival. </sentence><sentence id="1407">| mean how could | have said, told that when | was digging ditches, after, when the raw material in the factory ran out and they took us out to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1408">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1409"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection dig ditches, foxholes for the German army. </sentence><sentence id="1410">How would | have known that | was barely able to pick up that shovel, that that SS was not going to get mad as all hell and blow my head open, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1411">So you could never tell what will happen to you from one moment to the next. </sentence><sentence id="1412">Therefore it is strictly a chance survival. </sentence><sentence id="1413">Now as far as my mother helping me and my other two girlfriends, I'm sure they had similar experiences, where my mother would try to tell me, when they come around, when the SS comes by, try to make sure you show that you are working and you're trying. </sentence><sentence id="1414">That, yes, that helped me. </sentence><sentence id="1415">Her giving me the part of her bread without my knowledge, without a doubt that helped me because | was just a 14 year old skinny little kid who was not used to this kind of abuse and work and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="1416">So these things yes, these things helped. </sentence><sentence id="1417">But there was no coping mechanism, maybe my friendship with these other girls was a little helpful, that | had somebody to talk to who was my age. </sentence><sentence id="1418">Perhaps all these little things added up, but | can't say that there was one thing, any time, anywhere during this whole period, that there was one thing that helped me other than these two things about my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1437">Q: | know, Maddie, it's a very difficult subject, but and you've told me that to some extent, you religion has been therapeutic and | know that your family has been a very strong force in your continuing faith. </sentence><sentence id="1438">But there's been a lot of talk and things written about self-hatred over having survived at all. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Were you affected in this way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1443">A: To some degree | was, because if | think of my mother's, my father's birthday coming up, if | think of my brother's, there isn't a time, in all these years that | don't think of them on their birthdays and | say, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="1444">My father was a very, very good, charitable, kind person. </sentence><sentence id="1445">My brother was only 19, just turned 20. </sentence><sentence id="1446">What kind of bad thing could he have done? </sentence><sentence id="1447">So | say, "Why was | better? </sentence><sentence id="1448">How was | better than either one of them? </sentence><sentence id="1449">So how come I'm entitled to live and they were not?" </sentence><sentence id="1450">And there is no answer, the same way there is no answer when you ask where was God all this time? </sentence><sentence id="1451">And we all asked that, every single one of us. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And that's the same way, how come he let me survive and he didn't let my brother survive? </sentence><sentence id="1453">How was | any better than he was? </sentence><sentence id="1454">So these are all questions, good questions, bad questions, these are just questions. </sentence><sentence id="1455">There is no such thing again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1481">Q: All right, we're resuming here after a short telephone break and a coffee break. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1482">Very good coffee and very good fruit and what we began to talk about was the value of the Holocaust survivors group and your teaching. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And it seems, it almost seems that it's a value not just for others, but also for each other. </sentence><sentence id="1484">Could you talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1485">A: Well, let's see, when we started with this group, you know, the Holocaust survivors, we got together for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1486">Number one was for each other and that we can share some of it with each other, those who survived it, who understand it, who, we can just look at one another and we know what the other one means, because there is such communication that it doesn't have to be verbal and in this case, the Holocaust survivors practically don't have to talk about things to understand one another. </sentence><sentence id="1487">So this is a communication that is definitely between just survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And the other reason that came up a little bit later, because we remembered when some of the people who were killed and they said, their last breath, remember us, don't, not let us, do not let them forget us. </sentence><sentence id="1489">And basically, | mean that's not, you know, word for word, that was basically what they kept asking before they went to their deaths. </sentence><sentence id="1490">Do not let us, do not let them forget us. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So this was a promise that probably all of us that survived made to ourselves, that we will not let the world forget them, because these were all decent human beings and they were just killed because they were Jews, or the other six million who were not Jews, but for various not important reasons, that they were being killed as well. </sentence><sentence id="1492">So this was one of the other things that we have promised, that we will not let the world forget what happened and what they did to them. </sentence><sentence id="1493">And so, as the war ended, the other thing that besides trying to find our families and trying to make a new life for ourselves, we also wanted to talk about the people that were killed and so when we started this group, the Holocaust survivors, one of our major reasons to getting together was to try to create some kind of a memorial to remember all these six million Jews that were murdered for no other reason that they, than they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1494">And in order to create some sort of a memorial, we had to gather on a regular basis and plan whatever we could afford, whatever we could do. </sentence><sentence id="1495">And that's what happened here in Houston, when |, we moved down here the end of 1979 and we started this group in the beginning of 1980, in fact we were planning on going to Israel for the world reunion of Holocaust survivors and a group of us went and when we were all together, you know, many thousands of people who were together in the concentration camps and we realized that we can no longer postpone this and we can not dilly dally with it, we have to speak about what happened and we have to educate people what happened, whether it's verbally or they can possibly do a building or a memorial or whatever, that will speak for all these innocent people that were murdered and one of the most important things that we have decided on when we came back from Israel, from this trip, that we are really going to put a very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection strong emphasis in building something here in Houston. </sentence><sentence id="1498">And so | was among the first ones, a small group of us that started really working on it and working on it hard. </sentence><sentence id="1499">It took us a long time because it was, we are talking about very serious money. </sentence><sentence id="1500">But after all these years, since 1980, "81, we finally opened this year on March the third, 1996. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And | have put in an awful lot of time, effort, energy, helping build this. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Many, many hundreds of hours in the museum and taking work home and | think we have done justice and | feel that we have done a good job and we are telling the story the way it took place. </sentence><sentence id="1503">In a simple way, but very straightforward and we are talking about everything that took place, people who were the murderers, we talked about the bystanders, who didn't lift a finger to help. </sentence><sentence id="1504">And we're also talking about, in there, about the people who helped, although very small in number, but there were those who helped and we have to definitely, | felt it was very important that we mention that. </sentence><sentence id="1505">In fact right now we have an exhibit, about four people who were diplomats and they saved, | believe it was, 15,000 lives. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Well, there's Wallenberg in Hungary and there was Sugihara(ph) in from Japan and there are four of them that are being displayed right now, describing of what they did and how they did it and it's fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="1507">So we just started that exhibit two weeks ago and this is very important because there were some kind people. </sentence><sentence id="1508">There were some fantastic people in France, in the village of Chambourd(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1509">There were some magnificent people who took Jews from Denmark and shuttled it to Sweden. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1544">Q: Now we're talking about people who, who have helped, in all this horror and | want to ask Maddie(ph) if there's anyone in your experience ever, who has helped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1546">A: Well, the only thing that | can remember that anybody that ever did for me, as a kind gesture from one human being to another, was when we were in the camp in , this is a camp where we were working in the manufacturing of ammunition and we would march close to an hour to the factory from the, you know, where we were staying, these barracks and the same of course, coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1547">And one evening as we were walking home from the factory, it was already dark and | was walking on the outside, because we were marching in rows of fives and | happen to be, at this point on the side of the sidewalk on the outside and as we were marching, sort of dark, | saw this man passing by but | didn't pay much attention, | was much too hungry and much too tired, | was just dragging somehow to get back to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1548">But | felt this man touching my hand, but my hands were so cold that they were frozen, | couldn't tell and then he, in German he says, "Take it already, take it." </sentence><sentence id="1549">And so | took it, which turn out to be a little brown paper bag and | didn't dare to open it up as were marching, because if the SS would see me open it, | would get killed. </sentence><sentence id="1550">So when we went back to the, the camp, | told my mother that this man that walked passed us handed me this little package so she said that let's wait until we go back where we go back where we can be alone and so we would open it. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And that's what we did and inside the package there were two thin slices of bread with just a little margarine holding them together and that was like a piece of gold, it was like a lifeline. </sentence><sentence id="1552">And so of course we split it and we ate it. </sentence><sentence id="1553">But that was the only kindness that | have seen throughout the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1554">And I'm sure there were other people who experienced something good here or there but it was not the norm at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1565">Q: Maybe later in the camp, the displaced person's camp, there were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1567">A: Well, that was already different ballgame, once we were in the displaced person's camp, you, that is not part of the Holocaust any more, that is past the Holocaust and life was a completely different routine and different lifestyle and as | said we were free at that point to more or less come and go as we wanted and although we were living in this awful barracks, you know, without any privacy, but that was, you know, that had nothing to do with the concentration camps any more and the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1568">The Holocaust was during the time that some of us were in the concentration camps, other's were murdered in Auschwitz or other camps, those that were hiding out in, possibly in the forests and they were possibly partisans and tried to survive that way, so this is the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1569">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1570">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1571"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1577">Q: One of the things that | know you have talked about and | want to hear you talk on tape, is your experience at the national museum, the Holocaust and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1579">A: Well, the national, the museum in Washington, | had been invited to give oral testimony back in 1990 and | found that very rewarding because when the opening took place and | went there and I've seen people's interest in there, it was very rewarding. </sentence><sentence id="1580">| also have a statement in the voices of Auschwitz in the museum in Washington and | didn't know that was utilized in there until | went there to the opening and when | sat down to listen to the voices of Auschwitz | heard my own and that was sort of shocking as well. </sentence><sentence id="1581">And that gave me even more incentive to be involved in trying to build something here in Houston. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And so we did put in an awful lot of effort and | was one of the people of a handful of us that worked on the core exhibit of this museum. </sentence><sentence id="1583">We have a marvelous gentleman by the name of Professor John Roth, who wrote the text and there were four of us who went over it with a fine tooth comb and added and subtracted and did whatever we felt was necessary to make it as authentic, which was the major word for us, as possible and | think we have done a pretty good job. </sentence><sentence id="1584">We have thousands of people, adults as well as students from the surrounding schools who are coming on very, very regular basis and they are praising it very highly, that it's very informative and very down to earth and it is, they think very highly of it and | must say that | feel very good about the job we have done. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And to me, what this represents is something that we are giving back, in other words we are keeping those promises that we have made right after the war, when those people who were murdered and yelled out in their last breath, "Don't let the world forget us." </sentence><sentence id="1586">This is how | feel, that | have given back a little bit, that | have kept my word to all those people, that to teach the world, to tell the world what happened and hoping that everyone who sees this museum and spends time there, will learn quite a bit about what happened and how they can think about it, that when something terrible happens, how they could possibly alter the course of that horrible thing that is happening and maybe to learn how they can stand up while so many others did not and those few who did, to learn from them and if anything bad does happen, that they will not let it happen, that they will speak up early, that it cannot become so as bad as it was during the Holocaust and the more we teach them, the better | feel about it. </sentence><sentence id="1587">And whenever we hear people who come and visit and they say that it was very informative and very very good, it is like, | mean | just feel marvelous that | was a small part of teaching people about what did happen and how we can avoid something like this from happening again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1597">Q: Can you think of an instance with a child, a moment when you were telling him a story or a response that a person or a child has had from your speaking to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1599">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1600">There were several young children who were about my age, because | always make sure | tell them my age, how old | was when all this started happening This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1601">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1602"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to me and | reached them very much because we are on the same age level and so many, many children come over and "May | hug you, may | touch you? </sentence><sentence id="1603">| just want to tell you how wonderful you're explaining all these things." </sentence><sentence id="1604">So all these things make you feel that perhaps I'm doing something or have done something worthwhile and at the end of our, the, the museum, there is, like in the Washington museum, voices of survivors and they have decided to use a couple of things that | have said during my tape, videotaping and so they're using it here and so that is the last part what, that one sees in the museum and expressing all of us, the survivors, who by the way are all people who live here in Houston. </sentence><sentence id="1605">All, this whole museum is basically telling the story through the survivors of the Holocaust survivors here in Houston. </sentence><sentence id="1606">So everything that you see there, you know, you're going to see your friends, excuse me, telling about what happened here or there. </sentence><sentence id="1607">And some of the people that were the, you know, in this voices is my voice and how | tell a couple of different things that happened to me, as did the other people and it seems to be quite impressive, people like it very much, so | feel this is a very good museum that we're able to build and I'm very proud of it and | feel satisfied that | have done something. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1835">Q: Okay, we're going to go to another subject and something we spoke about on our break was your husband's feeling about speaking about his experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1837">A: Well he has much more difficulty with speaking, as a matter of fact whenever I've tried to go over it a little bit, you know, just see if he could bring it out, but we have This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1838">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1839"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection tried many times, but apparently he's having a very tough time sharing or getting in touch with these feelings. </sentence><sentence id="1840">Maybe my healing mechanism is talking about it although it is very, very painful every time | talk about it because | relive this every single time. </sentence><sentence id="1841">But perhaps this is my way of coping. </sentence><sentence id="1842">He has a difficulty talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="1843">He is able to, if we have a conversation with friends and we reach a point in the conversation where it, we are talking about, pertaining something to the Holocaust, he is able to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1844">But so far he was unable to sit down and share his experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1845">But hopefully, if | get well soon enough, we're going to try it again, because | think it is very, very important that we share our experiences, for one thin, to discredit the people who are claiming that there was no Holocaust and also for those people who come after us and I'm afraid there is too little written about it in school books where the children can learn about it and so whatever way that they can learn about this most horrible happening of the 20th century, | think it is very important that they learn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1855">Q: And isn't it also for your own healing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1857">A: Well this is what | said, for me perhaps it is a form of healing and maybe that's one of the reasons why | am and have been doing it all these years, but I'd like to think more that I'm contributing even in a little way. </sentence><sentence id="1858">A little share in teaching the people what happened and making sure that it is not forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="1859">And this is the way | prefer looking at it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1863">Q: Is there anything, out of all the things that we've covered, that you want to go over again, or that you would like to add to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1865">A: Well, | don't know, | haven't thought about all these things for quite some time so it's difficult to pinpoint just exactly one thing or another that |, | see | would like to repeat but | think the most important thing that | see for myself is to continue educating people because the sign that | had suggested for our museum at the entrance and it was accepted by the people that | was working with, was from Primo Levee(ph), where he says, "It happened, therefore it can happen again." </sentence><sentence id="1866">And | feel that this is so very true and | feel that we have to repeat it and repeat it countless times, to teach people what happened and trying to teach them to stand up and speak up when they hear or see something terrible happening to any human being at all. </sentence><sentence id="1867">And since that sign is in front of my eyes all the time, that it can happen again, then my personal wish is, that as long as | can speak and as long as I'm well enough to do it, | would like to continue teaching people and telling people what happened and I'm hoping that they are learning from it so that if they do see something said or done to a human being that should not be done, that this time there will not be so many bystanders, but instead, rescuers. </sentence><sentence id="1868">And | hope | will help or | am helping to accomplish this. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1869">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1870">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1871"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1872">Q: Thank you so much. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1873">A: You're very welcome. </sentence></p></dialogue>
