</sentence><sentence id="79">I decided, well whatever is going to happen is going to happen to me and my parents and when I returned, they were already in   process of setting up ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="80">The ghetto, I think, was established in the first month, I don't remember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="81">The ghetto boundaries were already established and the Jews were encouraged to move there. </sentence><sentence id="82">Nobody was moving. </sentence><sentence id="83">At that time, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from Latvia, from Volhynia, from the parts of Poland, in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the states which Russia occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of Jewish apartments as we lived in the nice section of town where one of the parents were to go. </sentence><sentence id="84">Two German officials came and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus F (couldn't hear) to go, so we went. </sentence><sentence id="85">We were able to get a room in one of the two or three homes which had modern conveniences like water, flush toilets and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="86">The ghetto to which they press around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000 people and that was the worst slums by looting. </sentence><sentence id="87">There were very few buildings which really resembled anything we know before we got the room in one of these buildings. </sentence><sentence id="88">They closed the ghetto and in the beginning it was already no more horrors by the Germans, there were no more beatings, there were no more shootings. </sentence><sentence

finish gymnasium before the war. </sentence><sentence id="91">I finish in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="92">Polish didn't have right. </sentence><sentence id="93">They forbid Polish to have any kind of schools. </sentence><sentence id="94">They close all Polish schools. </sentence><sentence id="95">Somehow, they probably knew they were going to liquidate the population sooner or later they pay no attention so schools open in ghetto so I finish in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="96">What happen in ghetto in beginning years, it was a slow starvation. </sentence><sentence id="97">The ,

</sentence><sentence id="104">The men were already had their blood which he bought by the grave of his wife which was buried there. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was really widening up his ears. </sentence><sentence id="106">Evidently, all the power of the Germans was vested in him. </sentence><sentence id="107">He became absolute ruler of the ghetto and to us he seemed like a man that was drugged with power On the other feeling of course was that if we are going to make useful our services to the Germans, good part of the Jews might survive. </sentence><sentence id="108">No bodies even worst fears believed that the Germans would try to physically annihilate every woman and child. </sentence><sentence id="109">Well, he establish schools. </sentence><sentence id="110">He started to establish so-called "arbisin", they were shops which manufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people who administer the ghetto brought to the ghetto and they have a large number of people working in the resorts and in exchange they were sending food to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="111">What I remember from now on, I was still young but was rather a shielded childhood and we grew up in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="112">What I remember was hunger, terrible hunger. </sentence><sentence id="113">And it started very, very slowly by the people

crumble the bread and cook the bread and make a soup out of this so that physically they could pacify their hunger pangs. </sentence><sentence id="121">But, they consumed a lot of liquid and the heart was not able to pump and the water settled in the feet and people started to die out. </sentence><sentence id="122">And we had 60, 70 funerals a day. </sentence><sentence id="123">50 funerals a day will be 1,500 people a month. </sentence><sentence id="124">That was in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="125">In the beginning, the funerals resembles more or less which were held before the war but sooner or later there was only mass grave. </sentence><sentence id="126">Well, like a mass grave, one mount under the other unmarked graves. </sentence><sentence id="127">My father was taken

id="130">I    was left with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="131">Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="132">But yet the younger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization. </sentence><sentence id="133">The morale was, well, we still felt that we had a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="134">This had changed in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="135">In 1942, the runcoston had a assembly. </sentence><sentence id="136">It's 92, 50 years before and I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="137">He said to us, he stand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he organized orphanages even un ghetto and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="138">Jews over 60 years old and children under 10. </sentence><sentence id="139">He told us, you have a choice. </sentence><sentence id="140">Our police would take them and it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it would be much worse. </sentence><sentence id="141">If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked up in the ghetto want to survive, they have to give up 20,000. </sentence><sentence id="142">Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we all go. </sentence><sentence id="143">And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no. </sentence><sentence id="144">Yet, they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from house to house and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections. </sentence><sentence id="145">All the sickly people and the older people and the children were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="146">But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came. </sentence><sentence id="147">Some people were shot. </sentence><sentence id="148">They tore the children from the mothers" arms. </sentence><sentence id="149">They beat the people. </sentence><sentence id="150">The mothers who resisted were

horse drawn wagon, they realize what happen, they start to chase and cry. </sentence><sentence id="153">Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="154">And from then on, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work. </sentence><sentence id="155">The food supply didn't improve -- deteriorate, more and more. </sentence><sentence id="156">There was a lot of mismanagement, in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="157">He tried Rumkoski tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be rationed to the population. </sentence><sentence id="158">And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="159">In 1942, I think, 1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as much valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so called sondokommando. </sentence><sentence id="160">He tried to bring some order to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="161">In a way he did. </sentence><sentence id="162">He made the thing look a little more efficient. </sentence><sentence id="163">In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more were given and people were left in apartments. </sentence><sentence id="164">3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when you walk the streets of the ghetto 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench, because the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. </sentence><sentence id="165">The people became living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and you could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end soon, they are going to die. </sentence><sentence id="166">Well, the ghetto lived until 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
