again. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Turned out that his -- the commander's fiancee was Jewish, and she lived in our building. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And the commander sort of looked the

</sentence><sentence id="1286">And indeed, they were more prophetic that we realized, because in a couple of hours, the -- this -- this coup was over. </sentence><sentence id="1287">In fact, with

</sentence><sentence id="1378">We would be among those who were deported, and who would have been, of course, the victims. </sentence><sentence id="1379">This we found out later, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1380">In the place where we now were in the factory, we had about 120 - 130 people. </sentence><sentence id="1381">They had a bunch of kids, young women and in a few days we found out that there was a group of young people who were running around in Nazi uniforms, but they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And they had a -- a group of five or six people who went to the deportation trains and to the roads, to snatch some people back. </sentence><sentence id="1383">They had papers, wi    57 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 -- which were forgeries,

people back from the road, who were already to certain death, mostly -- mostly young women, and some young men, but mostly women. </sentence><sentence id="1385">And so in the next week or so, the number of people went to about 170. </sentence><sentence id="1386">We had about 22 kids, some of them were younger than I, and it was a -- a great camaraderie. </sentence><sentence id="1387">I mean, since -- since the early spring that year, in 1944, I haven't been with kids. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And it was a lot of fun, and what was fun about it is that this -- this factory had a bunch

there was another family with a little girl I remember, her name was Onchee(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1451">She was about two or three years old and she made a racket and she made her grandpa -- Papa, very, very mad all the time, and she knew how to push his buttons. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And it was hilarious, I mean, it was really funny. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Very close by,

very good friends and my mother and father didn't mind that at all, because of course, they didn't have to babysit me. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And that was another friendship, but she was more interested in another fellow, who was a young man by the name of Bondi(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1458">And Bondi(ph) was one of the -- the refugees there, the -- the one who was able to escape from deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1459"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Pick degdeg November 13,

id="1461">And the committee who ran this place had a real dilemma, they didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1462">If they bring in somebody from the outside, you know, they may jeopardize 129 -- 69 people, and if they don't, they may have Bondi(ph) dead within a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Well, they decided the next day, when Bondi's(ph) condition became worse, that they were going to bring somebody in. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And -- and they brought a Christian doctor in late at night, and he gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that it was an infection. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And in a day or so, he got better. </sentence><sentence id="1466">The date is very important, this was the first of December. </sentence><sentence id="1467">In the morning of the second, we heard the running steps, and as we were trying to scramble for some shelter, we saw five men running in with submachine guns and yelling and screaming us and saying that we know who you are, you are just a bunch of dirty Jews who are trying to -- to hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi state police. </sentence><sentence id="1468">This was the gest -- the Hungarian Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And they sorted out the men to one side of the room, and women and children to the other and we thought that this was the end. </sentence><sentence id="1470">I mean, there was just no way. </sentence><sentence id="1471">Within the few seconds of confusion, one man, John dove out the window and into another building. </sentence><sentence id="1472">It was like six or seven feet, and he really jumped, and he crashed through a -- a --a glass door -- glass enclosure. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And his luck was that it was a haystack underneath, so he   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with George Pick *" November 13, 1997 got into the haystack. </sentence><sentence id="1474">And they ran after him, they tried to push the haystack, they couldn't find him. </sentence><sentence id="1475">But we were captured, and we thought that this was going to be the end. </sentence><sentence id="1476">But for a while nothing happened, and about 20 or 30 minutes later, the detectives, one of the leaders of the detectives came out of the office, and made the following startling statement, that henceforth we are under their protection. </sentence><sentence id="1477">And we just couldn't figure out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1478">There was only one arrest which they made, and that was a na -- a man by the name of Kormus(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1479">Kormus(ph) was the -- the leader of the group. </sentence><sentence id="1480">Not the commander, but the real leader, the organizer. </sentence><sentence id="1481">I didn't know much about Kormus(ph), but I found out later what -- who he was. </sentence><sentence id="1482">They took him and they took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in cash, which by sheer luck was there, because there were a number of extremely rich people in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1483">So in other words, they bribed these detectives. </sentence><sentence id="1484">And they left with Kormus(ph) and the money, but they left us behind. </sentence><sentence id="1485">After the war I found out that they took Kormus(ph) and they -- they tortured him for two days because they knew that this, our place, was not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="1486">In fact, it was a network of four places, all of which Kormus(ph) ran. </sentence><sentence id="1487">They knew of three, our place, and another two. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And what happened is Kormus(ph) was betrayed. </sentence><sentence id="1489">We thought that the doctor did -- betrayed us, it was not the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1490">It was aman by name of Althurdi(ph), who hid Kormus(ph) and his family for months. </sentence><sentence id="1491">And the speculation was that he was either blackmailed, or he didn't get   Interview with George Pick * November 13, 1997 enough money, but he betrayed Kormus(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1492">He knew of three places Kormus(ph) could have been, and he knew of a fourth place, but he did not know the address of the fourth place. </sentence><sentence id="1493">So when he -- when Kormus(ph) was betrayed, they raided three of the four places, Kormus(ph) happened to be in our place. </sentence><sentence id="1494">But the fourth place they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1495">The fourth place was a factory in another part of Budapest with 350 Jewish slave laborers who were essentially also hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="1496">But they, the slave laborers were armed, and they had a mission there. </sentence><sentence id="1497">They were armed, and their mission was that they would save the utility companies of Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1498">The paper said -- they were all in army uniforms -- their paper said that they would be the last one to stay, to blow up these utilities, the gas -- gas company, the -- the wa -- the waterworks and so forth, and the electric company. </sentence><sentence id="1499">That was the paper which said, but the real mission was to, in fact, save these utilities. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And every day they were trained like soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1501">Every night on the other hand, they we -- they had a little factory underneath and they forged papers. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And they worked with the Zionists and they worked with our little group, and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish resistance, and Kormus(ph) was the head. </sentence><sentence id="1503">So Kormus(ph) -- they -- they knew Kormus(ph) knew about this and they tortured him. </sentence><sentence id="1504">He did not speak, and because he didn't show up for two days, they knew in the fourth place, that things were bad, so they left. </sentence><sentence id="1505">They -- they -- they -- they couldn't accomplish their mission, but they   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with George Pick *8 November 13, 1997 were all safe, they were able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1506">And then Kormus(ph) was sentenced to death, and they took him to the Danube, but he was able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1507">He was very sick because of the fact that he -- they tortured him, but he escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1508">He was able to hide, and he survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="1509">The other two places which were raided, were not as lucky as we were. </sentence><sentence id="1510">They had not many rich people there and they were deported. </sentence><sentence id="1511">One was deported on foot to -- to Germany, and they all died. </sentence><sentence id="1512">And the second part was taken to political headquarters, and they -- they were among the ones who were sentenced and 70 of them were taken to the Danube, and only Kormus(ph) was able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1513">The rest of them were shot into the Danube. </sentence><sentence id="1514">So our group was essentially the -- out of the three groups, our group was the only one who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1515">After this happened, the committee who ran the building decided that the 22 children were not safe, so they decided to take us from -- ranging from age of six months to 11 years, I was among the oldest. </sentence><sentence id="1516">And one lady who -- who had the six months old son, I think, they took us to a-- a Red Cross building which was in the middle of the city. </sentence><sentence id="1517">We took the lorry and the soldier brought us to the Red Cross building. </sentence><sentence id="1518">And the idea was that this was a protected building, we would be fed there and we would be okay. </sentence><sentence id="1519">That was the theory. </sentence><sentence id="1520">The practice was that when we got there, there were about three or 400 children, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half a dozen adults. </sentence><sentence id="1521">I didn't like the place at all. </sentence><sentence id="1522"> Interview with George Pick 4 November 13, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1655">A: It was a brave decision, but it -- we had no choice, because if we went back, the Nazi would recognize us, would take us to where my father and mother and the other people were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1656">I didn't want to take that chance. </sentence><sentence id="1657">The chance was that they would catch us somewhere, because they were looking for kids too, and of course we didn't wear our -- our yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="1658">That was the chance I had to take. </sentence><sentence id="1659">It took us a couple of hours to -- to get back. </sentence><sentence id="1660">We were sort of ducking various little   Interview with George Pick degdeg November 13, 1997 groups of Nazis who were patrolling the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1661">We bought a newspaper, which we pretended to read. </sentence><sentence id="1662">We took a number of streetcars to go, and we knew where -- where the place was, so we had to change like three times, and we got back there. </sentence><sentence id="1663">My mother couldn't believe that I did come back and we came back. </sentence><sentence id="1664">We were the only two kids who -- who did come back. </sentence><sentence id="1665">After the war I found out that about three days later, the Nazis raided the building and they took the children to the Danube and they shot them. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And my friend Mike and his sister escaped just a day or so earlier, but not the rest of them; the rest of them all died. </sentence><sentence id="1667">So here we were, this was, I think maybe the 10" of December. </sentence><sentence id="1668">A few days after this, two policemen showed up in our building and told us that the detectives sent out -- sent them to let us know that we are under suspicion by some of the Nazis, who live in the area, and they are about to report this suspicious building and people. </sentence><sentence id="1669">And that they da -- they suggested that we should follow them, they would take us to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1670">The ghetto in Budapest was established at the very end of November. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And the people who were still in the -- the yellow stone -- yellow starred houses were taken to the -- to the places. </sentence><sentence id="1672">Now, many of the yellow starred houses were raided, and many of the people already were deported, but in the middle of December, which is what -- what was, there were -- Budapest was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And so the Nazis decided that they would concentrate the Jews who are left in  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with George Pick *" November 13, 1997 Budapest into a small ghetto in the middle of town, which was the -- used to be the Jewish quarters. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And then they would do something. </sentence><sentence id="1675">And so, on the 14" of December, the ghetto was already established and these policemen told us that they would go ahead, we would be behind them, they would not look back, and nothing else was said. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Well, of the 150 people roughly, only 65 arrived in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1677">The rest sort of evaporated along the way. </sentence><sentence id="1678">My father decided that we have nowhere to hide, so we went back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1679">The ghetto, as I mentioned, was in a very poor section of town, the Jewish quarters. </sentence><sentence id="1680">The center of it was a square, Klauzal square, and in that square, or one part of the square was a market. </sentence><sentence id="1681">They took us to the market, where the Nazis -- a number of Nazis were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us that, if you have any jewelry, money, they are going to do a body search, and if they find anything, they"!l shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="1682">There was a dead body to sh -- to prove the point. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And we didn't have anything, but a couple of people did, and they would throw the -- the jewelry into the sewer rather than giving it to these people. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Of the 63 of us who got there, we were separated into several groups. </sentence><sentence id="1685">The group which my father and I -- my mother and I stayed with were about 20 people. </sentence><sentence id="1686">We were just taken to the other side of the square, is Klauzal square seven, a three story old building. </sentence><sentence id="1687">Turned out that this building housed a -- the remnants of a old age home, old age Jewish home, brought in, and the first two stories -- floors, were quite chock full of   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with George Pick degdeg November 13, 1997 people, but the third story was empty. </sentence><sentence id="1688">So they gave us two rooms there, and it was dirty and no food. </sentence><sentence id="1689">And I remember that after -- the day after we arrived, my father, who was always enterprising, he was looking around and he found a piece of bread, which must have been six months old. </sentence><sentence id="1690">And bugs were jumping all over the place out of it, but he said, that's okay, because we'll toast it and then we can eat it. </sentence><sentence id="1691">That's precisely what we did, somehow we toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we ate a piece of it. </sentence><sentence id="1692">That was the food for that particular day. </sentence><sentence id="1693">People were not very choosy at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1694">My father also went around to see what -- what was the situation in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1695">The ghetto was -- th-the area originally was an area for about 12,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="1696">By the time we got there, they had about 40,000 people living there, and at its peak they had 70,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="1697">So you can imagine that there were not -- there was not much room around. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2013">A: The -- the real plan was more sinister than the one which the soldier disclosed to us, namely that they would blow up the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2014">The real plan was to massacre us on -- for the 16" of January, there was a massacre in plan, 500 SS, a couple of hundred Hungarian police. </sentence><sentence id="2015">The number of Hungarian Nazis would come in with submachine guns, and would line us up essentially, and -- and mow us down. </sentence><sentence id="2016">It turned -- turned out that

he called -- called this action off. </sentence><sentence id="2020">That obviously saved the people, my life, my father's, mother's, my relatives and the 7,000 people who were still alive in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2021">This was on the 15" - 16". </sentence><sentence id="2022">There was one little girl in our building, her name was Alice. </sentence><sentence id="2023">She was about eight years old, and she was a weak little kid. </sentence><sentence id="2024">She was not very alive. </sentence><sentence id="2025">She had a mother, and a grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="2026">The mother was diabetic, and the grandmother was also. </sentence><sentence id="2027">And she came sometimes to play with me, but I didn't like her that much. </sentence><sentence id="2028">This day, on the 17", she came not just to my mother, but   Interview with George Pick " November 13, 1997 to everybody to beg for some food for her mother, who -- who was in a diabetic shock. </sentence><sentence id="2029">We had very little, namely and specifically, we had about a quarter of a pound of sugar. </sentence><sentence id="2030">As I mentioned earlier, when we left our house, our home, the Jewish re -- yellow star home to go into hiding, my mother took very little food with us. </sentence><sentence id="2031">This food was shepherded along since November, now it's January. </sentence><sentence id="2032">The la -- the -- the -- a month of food which is left in that little bag is fa -- is a half a pound of sugar. </sentence><sentence id="2033">My mother kept it for me because she felt that maybe a few sugar cubes would save my life if--if it all comes down to that. </sentence><sentence id="2034">So my mother refused to give Alice any food. </sentence><sentence id="2035">This was the 17". </sentence><sentence id="2036">On the 18" of January in the morning -- on the evening of the 17, my father came home and he decided to stay home. </sentence><sentence id="2037">On the 18" there was a strange quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2038">We didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2039">It wasn't as quiet for -- for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2040">I mean, this was a 24 hour a day artillery duel and bombing raid and we didn't know how much was left over of that city. </sentence><sentence id="2041">And all of a

</sentence><sentence id="2043">They were not Nazi boots, they were Russian boots, and we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2044">There was no elation. </sentence><sentence id="2045">We vid -- we really even didn't say anything to each other. </sentence><sentence id="2046">It was fear that the Nazis would come back. </sentence><sentence id="2047">Was indecision what to do next. </sentence><sentence id="2048">The one thing we found out is that Alice's mother and grandmother were both dead, and my mother felt terribly guilty for the   Interview with George Pick " November 13, 1997 next 47 years of her life. </sentence><sentence id="2049">Nobody could tell her that she was saving the food to her son, that was a choice between somebody whom she didn't know, and her own son, and there was really no choice in the matter. </sentence><sentence id="2050">She felt still guilty til the day -- day of her death. </sentence><sentence id="2051">I remember that some of the younger

</sentence><sentence id="2054">My father and mother decided that, around noontime, that it's time for us to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2055">Both my mother and father were so weak that the little suitcase which we had, which contained a half a pound of sugar and the family's pictures, they couldn't carry. </sentence><sentence id="2056">I was the one who carried them, I was the -- the strongest one. </sentence><sentence id="2057">My father, who was 43 years old, looked like 70. </sentence><sentence id="2058">And in his two or three weeks of patrol, he lost three of his partners, and he was more dead than alive. </sentence><sentence id="2059">And then he -- we started to walk out of the ghetto, that was not -- not an easy walk. </sentence><sentence id="2060">There were very few walkways there, half of the buildings were on the street. </sentence><sentence id="2061">We heard the shrapnel zipping and making this awful noise above our heads. </sentence><sentence id="2062">The artillery fire was going on, the -- the siege of Budapest was still going on. </sentence><sentence id="2063">It took us three hours to get home, and we decided, like homing pigeons, to go back to our home from which we were thrown out by the Nazis in June of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="2064">We went back, it took us three hours, two and a half miles. </sentence><sentence id="2065">We saw, in that journey, many dead bodies, many dead horses, and one live Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2066">Which was almost ludicrous because this man   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher

in that -- person in that whole -- whole mad, maddening scene. </sentence><sentence id="2070">And as we were walking, these shrapnels were hitting buildings, and whole walls came down, tumbling in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="2071">I mean, we were in mortal danger, we -- we were crazy to walk there, but we did. </sentence><sentence id="2072">And we walked through the city park, and we were held up by a small group of Russians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="2073">I mean, breaking up the ice, and he gave us these ice picks to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2074">My father couldn't lift it, you know, and he finally said well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2075">That was

</sentence><sentence id="2078">And we stumbled home, and it was maybe four, five in the afternoon by the time we got there. </sentence><sentence id="2079">And the man whom we met first was Mr.

that a few hours later my -- my maternal grandmother came home. </sentence><sentence id="2093">Turned out that she was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And revenge was the furthest from

id="2610">We had other teachers. </sentence><sentence id="2611">Some teachers left with the Bricha, some teachers stayed. </sentence><sentence id="2612">I became very interested in acting. </sentence><sentence id="2613">We had a little acting group in our school. </sentence><sentence id="2614">I became interested. </sentence><sentence id="2615">We had put on full three act plays. </sentence><sentence id="2616">My father became interested in this school. </sentence><sentence id="2617">He wanted to help the school. </sentence><sentence id="2618">He found out that the school, of course, lost most of its labs, and he wanted to raise money, so he figured a --a way to ask famous performers to come to the school for nothing, and have fundraisings. </sentence><sentence

raised money for. </sentence><sentence id="2623">And so my father became the president, or the P.T. and then my mother was very involved and I became involved with the -- on a student level. </sentence><sentence id="2624">And it was from "48 to "50 - 52. </sentence><sentence id="2625">They were -- despite of the fact that -- that there were -- th-there were terrors, and -- and -- and worsening political situation and crisis, there was an island there. </sentence><sentence id="2626">The school became a -- a separate island, where we had a dicono -- dichotomy where we shared both what we needed to share, such as you know, what you needed to talk about, you know, the great communist camp, and the [indecipherable] the imperialist camp and all this phraseology, which we had to also say, but then we talked about what was the Voice of America saying, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2627">So it was a really funny, ironic situation. </sentence><sentence id="2628">The same people who were parroting the phraseology were talking about the Voice of America. </sentence><sentence id="2629">And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also, Marxist phraseology, which

id="2636">Of course, the -- the tightening of the government, and the -- the loss of rights brought back a lot of memories. </sentence><sentence id="2637">And people who were deported during the Holocaust, were deported again. </sentence><sentence id="2638">This time not because they were Jewish, but because they were capitalists, and capitalists couldn't live in Budapest, so they took the --

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2643">Q: Did that make you more nervous? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2645">A: It absolutely did, but there was no choice in the matter now, of course, that the Iron Curtain was shut. </sentence><sentence id="2646">In 1948, after the Bricha, and very shortly thereafter when the communists took power, things were over. </sentence><sentence id="2647">And by then, of course, those of us who recognized too late, and too belatedly that we were pretty stupid again, we were there. </sentence><sentence id="2648">So what could you do, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2649">Well, what you could do was what we did, which is to go along outwardly, and go to the May celebrations and the November celebrations, and at the same time talk about BBC and Radio Free Europe and trying to keep each other in -- in a Jewish era. </sentence><sentence id="2650">We were -- we were still studying -- not legally at this point -- Jewish things, Jewish history. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2659">   98 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2660">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="2661">In the next -- in the first two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium meant that we were not studying, we were -- we do not have Saturday classes, but instead we had to go to the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="2662">So we did. </sentence><sentence id="2663">That wasn't a pleasant thing for me, I was never a synagogue goer. </sentence><sentence id="2664">But it made me want to know more Jewish history. </sentence><sentence id="2665">It made me much more of a conscious Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2666">And after the communist takeover, the synagogue was closed, we couldn't -- the -- the -- the synagogue of the -- the gymnasium was closed, it was no longer there. </sentence><sentence id="2667">So -- but -- but we still had some spark, and -- and many times the spark was nothing more than, I know you are Jewish and you know that I am Jewish, and you can trust me. </sentence><sentence id="2668">And that was not always the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could trust, within the school. </sentence><sentence id="2669">We knew that there were a few people who -- who we could not, including teachers. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And this came to a head in 1950. </sentence><sentence id="2671">In 1950, there was a letter, which was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the school, demanding of the government of nationalizing our school. </sentence><sentence id="2672">And they tried to intimidate the students and the teachers. </sentence><sentence id="2673">And it came to a head because there was a conference, a te -- a teacher-student-parent conference. </sentence><sentence id="2674">And it was supposed to be a secret letter, but somebody told that -- the principal of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2675">And this --all hell broke loose. </sentence><sentence id="2676">And I was there and I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2677">There was a parent of a classmate of mine whose -- who told the students and the teacher, who did not want   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Pick " November 13, 1997 to identify himself, that they are cowards, they are damn cowards, and they are traitors. </sentence><sentence id="2678">And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired thing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2679">And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next school year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was -- who -- whom we found out was a-- was a defector. </sentence><sentence id="2680">And he left, he became a principal somewhere else, and all these students. </sentence><sentence id="2681">But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed. </sentence><sentence id="2682">Our class of 30 became a class of 13. </sentence><sentence id="2683">This was our sixth grade, it was junior high school. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And we stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less. </sentence><sentence id="2685">We couldn't talk about Jewish history. </sentence><sentence id="2686">We couldn't talk about Jewish things. </sentence><sentence id="2687">But we could talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph). </sentence><sentence id="2688">And we could sabotage learning Russian, for example. </sentence><sentence id="2689">An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who did not know from Russian from a hole in the head. </sentence><sentence id="2690">I mean, he was always a--a lesson ahead of us, but that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2691">And -- and we took this as a joke, inside. </sentence><sentence id="2692">But we realized more and more, and more and more keenly that this island for us, is going to come to an end. </sentence><sentence id="2693">And then what? </sentence><sentence id="2694">And that end came in 1952, when I graduated. </sentence><sentence id="2695">Now one of the motivations of the -- all of my classmates who left, was that nobody's going to be accepted in a university from a parochial school such as the Jewish gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="2696">That was the motivation why they left. </sentence><sentence id="2697">It turned out very ironically, that out of the two -- four -- 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were    100 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 accepted. </sentence><sentence id="2698">Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such a thing as religious freedom. </sentence><sentence id="2699">Much less of the people who left were accepted, percentage-wise. </sentence><sentence id="2700">The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn't even want to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="2701">I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="2702">And here came the big shock. </sentence><sentence id="2703">The big culture shock, because I was trusting to the university, the technical university, Budapest, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200. </sentence><sentence id="2704">And we had this huge theater and we were sitting there, you know, men and women. </sentence><sentence id="2705">And I found myself in -- very much in a minority. </sentence><sentence id="2706">This was the year where it made a difference who's -- who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got accepted regardless of your qualifications. </sentence><sentence id="2707">If your parents were businessmen, you wat -- you were rejected. </sentence><sentence id="2708">My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a -- what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it was better than a businessman for sure. </sentence><sentence id="2709">My father wasn't a businessman by then, he worked for another company. </sentence><sentence id="2710">And so in -- I was able to slip in on this, but I found my colleagues to be very different from me. </sentence><sentence id="2711">The chemistry worked there. </sentence><sentence id="2712">Very quickly we found from each other -- 0-of each other, who were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2713">Of the f-- of the 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage. </sentence><sentence id="2714">And as I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn't know from Adam. </sentence><sentence id="2715">We found us, each other and we drifted toward each other. </sentence><sentence id="2716">The way the school were -- was   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with George Pick aa November 13, 1997 divided up, we had subspecialties within mechanical engineering -- this was only mechanical engineering. </sentence><sentence id="2717">We had specialties on textile engineering, shipbuilding, whatever else. </sentence><sentence id="2718">And in my subspecialty, which was naval archy -- naval architecture, we had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of them were not. </sentence><sentence id="2719">And we were sort of drifting in and out. </sentence><sentence id="2720">I was -- I was never really very friendly with these people because their culture, their -- their interests were very different from me. </sentence><sentence id="2721">I felt sorry for them because they were not really qualified and they were really struggling with the material. </sentence><sentence id="2722">They didn't know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus, and they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of scholarships and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2723">I have to step back now because there is a -- an important thing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally. </sentence><sentence id="2724">And that -- what happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2725">This was right before graduation in February of 1952. </sentence><sentence id="2726">Fell in love with a young girl who didn't understand my -- my feelings, and I was very brokenhearted when my feelings were not reciprocated. </sentence><sentence id="2727">And I was so brokenhearted that I fell sick. </sentence><sentence id="2728">They thought I had mononucleosis and other diseases and I was in the hospital for a month. </sentence><sentence id="2729">And this was in February - March of "52, just before graduation. </sentence><sentence id="2730">And my wa -- mother and father were worried that I was going to se -- lose that year. </sentence><sentence id="2731">But my colleagues were very nice and they brought me up to date very f-- very fast. </sentence><sentence id="2732">Then April roll -- rolled along, and walking    102 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 on the street, in a nice, bright, April afternoon, I met this girl who was very familiar. </sentence><sentence id="2733">Made a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five years earlier in a camp. </sentence><sentence id="2734">Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just graduating from college. </sentence><sentence id="2735">She became a singer, she never married. </sentence><sentence id="2736">Didn't marry the -- broke off with the fiance, and she was single. </sentence><sentence id="2737">I was 18, she was 22 - 23. </sentence><sentence id="2738">And it was a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had before. </sentence><sentence id="2739">It became a very hot romance, not to my mother's liking and my father's liking, who felt that I should really learn and study. </sentence><sentence id="2740">The way it went in our school system is that we finished the school early, in May, and then we had six weeks of real study, after which we had a five hour oral exam. </sentence><sentence id="2741">And it was almost like a PhD thing. </sentence><sentence id="2742">And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about the oral. </sentence><sentence id="2743">And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of questions. </sentence><sentence id="2744">We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers. </sentence><sentence id="2745">Of course, that was the trick, you know, you can't learn eight years of answers in two months. </sentence><sentence id="2746">You really had to learn some other things. </sentence><sentence id="2747">But at that point, you know, the -- the summer was full blown and -- and I was too interested in -- in -- in everything, mostly Judith, and less interested in the study. </sentence><sentence id="2748">But I studied a little. </sentence><sentence id="2749">And -- and it was just the hottest romance we had. </sentence><sentence id="2750">It was sort of crazy. </sentence><sentence id="2751">The -- her parents worked, my parents worked, so both of our apartments were vacant during the day and we    103 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 took advantage of it. </sentence><sentence id="2752">And it was my real -- first real romance. </sentence><sentence id="2753">I mean, I had some sex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes. </sentence><sentence id="2754">This was really a woman. </sentence><sentence id="2755">| didn't know what -- and she didn't know how to handle it either. </sentence><sentence id="2756">Which was too bad because she was 22, I was 18. </sentence><sentence id="2757">If I didn't know how to handle it, well, that was something, but she -- she should have known better. </sentence><sentence id="2758">Made a longer story short, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn't see eye to eye through this. </sentence><sentence id="2759">I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation. </sentence><sentence id="2760">My fa-- my mother told me the same. </sentence><sentence id="2761">My father said absolutely not, I am -- you are a minor. </sentence><sentence id="2762">In --in Hungary you were a minor until 21, and I'm not giving your permission and that's that. </sentence><sentence id="2763">Make the long story short, we didn't marry and she had an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="2764">And there is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it was a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="2765">And saying that, you know, she understands the -- the pain and the sorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2766">But she has to understand that I am too young and | am just starting my -- my schooling, and she should have known better. </sentence><sentence id="2767">And that romance stayed with me for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="2768">That was really a very potent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="2769">It was a happy ending, if you want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has children. </sentence><sentence id="2770">Nothing bad happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="2771">But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2772">And I went on to school, and I had this -- and I had another girlfriend about a    104 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 year later, who was more to my level of interest maybe, and same age as I was. </sentence><sentence id="2773">And the shock went on for four years, from 1952 to "56. </sentence><sentence id="2774">I had the same girlfriend this time, Erica was her name. </sentence><sentence id="2775">And we had a tempestuous relationship. </sentence><sentence id="2776">But there was a -- there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my circle of -- small circle of friends. </sentence><sentence id="2777">We still kept going to -- to -- to operas. </sentence><sentence id="2778">We went to theater. </sentence><sentence id="2779">We kept a cultural core, which the country in itself did not, you know, they -- they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide. </sentence><sentence id="2780">But we kept a western level of culture, and I think that kept our humanity, too, in a-- in a great degree. </sentence><sentence id="2781">Between 1952 and deg56, times were hard, and I was working very hard in -- in school, trying to earn my college tuition, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="2782">We were not rich, and I really needed to work. </sentence><sentence id="2783">In the summertime, I did. </sentence><sentence id="2784">I went to -- this was not my choice, I had to do work once -- one month every summer, work -- we got paid -- in industry. </sentence><sentence id="2785">And one month every summer, we had to go to the -- to the army. </sentence><sentence id="2786">And I had a hard time in the army, I must tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2787">Both -- I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all those three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="2788">And that in is -- in itself a story of itself, but I'm not going to go in there. </sentence><sentence id="2789">Fifty-six came around. </sentence><sentence id="2790">The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck. </sentence><sentence id="2791">My father all of a sudden got sick and died. </sentence><sentence id="2792">He got celebra -- cerebral hemorrhage. </sentence><sentence id="2793">He was a chain smoker, and finally got to him. </sentence><sentence id="2794">This was at the end of March, right   105 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 during my period of exams, final exams. </sentence><sentence id="2795">And I was very scared, and I didn't know how to handle it. </sentence><sentence id="2796">I was 22. </sentence><sentence id="2797">I had a ver -- a very good friend, his name was Dionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud -- he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was already a -- an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought. </sentence><sentence id="2798">He knew Erica very well, he knew me very well. </sentence><sentence id="2799">He was a very, very close friend. </sentence><sentence id="2800">He sort of said look, I think you should pull together. </sentence><sentence id="2801">You should have a better -- a bigger family. </sentence><sentence id="2802">You should really be not one -- I mean you -- my family, my real family was not very close knit, particularly after my father died. </sentence><sentence id="2803">In fact, even in the last few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and I drifted apart from my father. </sentence><sentence id="2804">And I drifted -- the only person I had close was my mother. </sentence><sentence id="2805">I had a couple of cousins I wasn't that friendly with. </sentence><sentence id="2806">My maternal grandmother died. </sentence><sentence id="2807">My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every Sunday, but after 18 I didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="2808">I found them strange, I had nothing to say to them. </sentence><sentence id="2809">So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to. </sentence><sentence id="2810">And I was scared, so Erica's family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very nice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And -- and essentially I felt that maybe this is the time when -- when I should have my own, and then I engaged -- I became engaged to her. </sentence><sentence id="2812">And we had an engagement in August. </sentence><sentence id="2813">And we were planning to get married after I graduated from school, which was at the fall of 1956. </sentence><sentence id="2814">It was going to    106 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 be in October of "56. </sentence><sentence id="2815">And in fact, in October of 56 --I just completed my last exam on the 22(tm) of October. </sentence><sentence id="2816">The 23"? </sentence><sentence id="2817">of October became a notable day, but for me the 224 was the -- the real clincher. </sentence><sentence id="2818">There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right after my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o'clock in the morning, and which, at the end, we declared that Hungary must be an independent state and should declare neutrally -- neutrality and the Russians, we demanded the Russians get out. </sentence><sentence id="2819">And we agreed that on the 23" in the morning, we would all come back to the university and we would have a-- a demonstration. </sentence><sentence id="2820">Came October

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3017">A: It did, it certainly did, th-the memory of that March Sunday, when the Germans -- German tanks came in the very same route, toward the -- the center of the city, and that -- that memory also triggered that, you know, what is happening here is -- is history repeating itself, or not. </sentence><sentence id="3018">But there was not very much time for thinking here, because there was a war going on and for two weeks there was a -- a real fighting. </sentence><sentence id="3019">I mean, at that point we went -- everybody from the building where we lived when down to the basement, just like we had in 1944, and "45. </sentence><sentence id="3020">It was artillery duels. </sentence><sentence id="3021">And by November, by the 20" of November, the inside of the downtown was completely demolished again. </sentence><sentence id="3022">I mean, 10 years after the war, the downtown area looked just like it did in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="3023">Twenty-second of November -- oh, during this period of time, we    108 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 are listening to radio free Europe and a voice of America. </sentence><sentence id="3024">And I was particularly appalled by the fact that I was sitting in Elizabeth Street, in a basement, while a bunch of people are already sending messages from Austria to their relatives, saying that they are already in Austria and they don't know whether they are going to Australia or Canada yet. </sentence><sentence id="3025">And I'm sitting as -- like a rat in a basement in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="3026">And I, just to mys -- I am saying to myself, I mean, how many mistakes can I make? </sentence><sentence id="3027">I mean, my mother and father made enough mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="3028">I'm not going to make the same. </sentence><sentence id="3029">So, on the spur of the moment, I called my fiancee and a friend, that in the next morning we are going to meet in [indecipherable] railroad station and then we'll see what happens. </sentence><sentence id="3030">And I bicycled there, because there was nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="3031">Said goodbye to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3032">The decision took all of a half an hour, and in the next morning we met at the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="3033">We had a vague plan, which is to go to a border town and then feel our way around. </sentence><sentence id="3034">We never got there. </sentence><sentence id="3035">After the -- the -- this is chaos now, there is no central government. </sentence><sentence id="3036">The Russians are occupying part of the country, not all of it. </sentence><sentence id="3037">There is still fighting going on in the countryside. </sentence><sentence id="3038">Railroads have no schedule, government is nonexistent. </sentence><sentence id="3039">People are doing their thing. </sentence><sentence id="3040">Obviously a lot of them are already outside of the country. </sentence><sentence id="3041">The train was completely packed, maybe a thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="3042">And shortly after we started, we found out that most of the thousand people had the same idea, to go to the western    109 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 border and get out. </sentence><sentence id="3043">We were told that it's dangerous to keep maps, so we throwed the maps away. </sentence><sentence id="3044">I had a couple of things in my pocket, two overcoats and a few other things. </sentence><sentence id="3045">Couple of pieces of jewelry sewn into my pocket and who knows who to bribe, how to do whatever is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="3046">We had no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3078">Q: What's it like to make decisions yourself? </sentence><sentence id="3079">Previously, in the war, it was your parents who made the decisions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3082">A: Well, it-- I was 22 years old and I felt that in the war I made a few decisions which saved my life, and I am not going to stay around. </sentence><sentence id="3083">I knew that some people knew that I was participating in the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="3084">I knew that the Russians are not going to be very merciful for those who were participating. </sentence><sentence id="3085">I could end up in jail, or worse. </sentence><sentence id="3086">So I didn't have much of a choice and I really wanted to leave. </sentence><sentence id="3087">I -- I thought this was the most psychologically opportune moment in the world for me. </sentence><sentence id="3088">I had completed my undergraduate education, and here is an opportunity I would -- would pay, you know, I would take whatever chances there was. </sentence><sentence id="3089">To make the long story short, the train never reached the town where we went to. </sentence><sentence id="3090">It stopped in a smaller town, some 20 -- 25 miles from the border. </sentence><sentence id="3091">We slept there, and the very next morning went to the station, we got into a cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="3092">The cattle train stopped in the middle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and ended up at the border. </sentence><sentence id="3093">And I didn't like the situation very much, because in the    110 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 border there was some fighting at night. </sentence><sentence id="3094">So I told my fiancee and our -- our friend to -- we are moving back. </sentence><sentence id="3095">We moved back to a small village. </sentence><sentence id="3096">I met a-- we met a fellow who told us that he would help us the very next morning, because he knew a way. </sentence><sentence id="3097">And we also told him to go back to our parents and see if they would be able to come out. </sentence><sentence id="3098">The next morning we went out bright, early morning, and he told us that between those two haystacks, if we stay between them it's okay. </sentence><sentence id="3099">That haystack -- beyond that haystack are the Russian, beyond that haystack are the Hungarian communists, but in-between is okay. </sentence><sentence id="3100">And that's what we did, we went in between. </sentence><sentence id="3101">The only problem was that right before no man's land, there was a quarter of a mile of completely cleared land, and behind that there were towers, watch towers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3123">Q: Do you think your experience during the war helped you get through this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3125">A: Probably. </sentence><sentence id="3126">I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="3127">At that point I was only thinking about the now and the then. </sentence><sentence id="3128">Th-The moment. </sentence><sentence id="3129">We knew that we had to go -- go through. </sentence><sentence id="3130">We knew that we also had an excellent chance of being shot in the back from the watchtowers. </sentence><sentence id="3131">We also knew that in front of us, which used to be a minefield, the mines were removed a few months before, and we have no other barrier. </sentence><sentence id="3132">And this was the chance. </sentence><sentence id="3133">And I think there are some points in life when one does not think too much, and hesitate too much, because if one does, one gets paralyzed. </sentence><sentence id="3134">So what I just did, I started to curse in Hungarian, started to yank my fiancee as fast as I could. </sentence><sentence id="3135">We ran though this    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3136"> 111 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 part, and it took us probably all of two minutes, but it il -- seemed like an hour. </sentence><sentence id="3137">And then we were there, we were -- we were in no-man's land, we saw the Austrian flags, and we were on the other side, and then in about five minutes later, the Austrian border patrol intercepted us. </sentence><sentence id="3138">We didn't speak the language, but they didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="3139">Turned out, when we ww-went to Lutzmannsdorf, which was the first little town, is that the night before, the border police all defected, and so nobody was up there, but I didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="3140">So my -- my luck was still -- still with me. </sentence><sentence id="3141">And then the very next day, the Joint came to Eisenstaedt, which was the next largest city. </sentence><sentence id="3142">They took us to Linz. </sentence><sentence id="3143">It was already organized, all the hotels in Linz, which was Hitler's hometown, were reserved for the Jews, and that was an ironic twist of fate. </sentence><sentence id="3144">It was Wiesenthal -- I don't know if you know the name Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal, who was in charge of that operation. </sentence><sentence id="3145">We had hundreds of Hungarian Jews there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3146">The non-Hungarian -- Hungarian non-Jews were thrown into a camp, and we were there for three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3147">Meanwhile, the Joint fed us and paid our hotel room. </sentence><sentence id="3148">There came recruiters from Canada and from the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3149">When they found out that I was an engineer, young engineer, they said absolutely, you should come. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3150">When they found out that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all. </sentence><sentence id="3151">And three weeks later, on the 19" of December of 1956, our plane touched down in Newark, and we went to Camp Kilmer, and a day later I was in New York City. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3152">  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with George Pick m November 13, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3153">Q: How did you feel putting your foot down on American soil? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3154">A: Well, it was unreal. </sentence><sentence id="3155">We had a 30 hour flight. </sentence><sentence id="3156">We stopped in Reykjavik -- in Reykjavik, Iceland, we were in Scotland, we were in Labrador. </sentence><sentence id="3157">Not the jet planes, th-they -- they had no jet planes in "56. </sentence><sentence id="3158">It was a -- it was an exhaustive -- exhausting trip because the night before we started, we already were going -- we originally were going from Linz to Salzburg, and in Salzburg we didn't have a place, so they sent us back to Linz, and from Linz to Muenchen(ph). </sentence><sentence id="3159">And so we were on a bus for 14 or 15 hours before we had the 30 hour flight. </sentence><sentence id="3160">So I was sort of in no-man's land. </sentence><sentence id="3161">There was one thing which happened a day before we left, which was very important. </sentence><sentence id="3162">We visited Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="3163">This was an inoculation against Europe and against any kind of -- of -- of wanting to go back to the old -- to the old -- to the old country. </sentence><sentence id="3164">End of Tape Three, Side B 113 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 Beginning Tape Four, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3182">A: Prior to leaving Austria, my mother and I were in almost daily telephone contact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3184">Q: Le -- you were talking about maut -- going to Mauthausen though. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3186">A: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="3187">The day before we left for the United States, we decided my -- my fiancee and my friend and I decided to inoculate ourselves against any kind of homesickness, so visited mau -- we visited Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="3188">Mauthausen is ina fantastic place, it's on the top of a hill. </sentence><sentence id="3189">Beautiful view, and unspeakable horrors. </sentence><sentence id="3190">In 56, Mauthausen was very different, I am sure, than what it is now. </sentence><sentence id="3191">It was much closer to what it was in 1944, and we had a vivid sense of what had -- what must have been. </sentence><sentence id="3192">And -- and it certainly recalled all the horrors which we read about and which we heard about from the surviving friends and relatives who came back and who -- some of whom came back from Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="3193">I have a number of uncles who were in Mauthausen and who came back. </sentence><sentence id="3194">And so I could now put together the -- the name and the place, and it certainly cured me for -- for many, many years, for 38 years from -- from any kind of homesickness. </sentence><sentence id="3195">And then the next morning, as I mentioned, we were bound to go to -- to Salzburg and then back and forth until we    114 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 got to the plane. </sentence><sentence id="3196">Prior to leaving, finding ou -- we only found out that we were coming to the United States about a week before we left. </sentence><sentence id="3197">We did not know precisely what was going to happen, how long things would take. </sentence><sentence id="3198">And shortly after we left Hungary, my mother and I, and my fiancee's parents were in daily telephone contact. </sentence><sentence id="3199">The original plan was that her -- her parents and my mother would essentially come to Austria and then we would meet there. </sentence><sentence id="3200">The peasant who helped us over, indeed went to -- to Budapest and he on -- he also told them that they could come with him and he would help them. </sentence><sentence id="3201">But they didn't want to take the chance. </sentence><sentence id="3202">It started to be fairly late in December. </sentence><sentence id="3203">My mother and a cousin of mine went down to Szeged, which is close to the Yugoslavian border. </sentence><sentence id="3204">They tried it there, they couldn't do it, they were turned back. </sentence><sentence id="3205">And I told my mother not to go anywhere, just stay in Budapest and see what happens and leave the country legally. </sentence><sentence id="3206">I didn't want to wait for her because by then we had the papers and I didn't want to miss the opportunity to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3207">So, late at night on the 19% of December we touched down. </sentence><sentence id="3208">On the 20", I met my uncle, who was very strange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don't need those Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3209">You come with me, I live in New Jersey, and I'll take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="3210">I told him that, that's nice, but I came with my fiancee and I'm not going to let her just drift away. </sentence><sentence id="3211">He reluctantly took her also with him, and us. </sentence><sentence id="3212">We went to this New Jersey place, it's    115 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 Wharton, New Jersey, it's a small town, small Hungarian town, sort of. </sentence><sentence id="3213">Most of the Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the war, which meant that most of them were Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3214">Now my uncle is a fisi-- was a physician. </sentence><sentence id="3215">I didn't know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he wanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret. </sentence><sentence id="3216">This led to a fallout, and a very irreconcilable difference between him and me. </sentence><sentence id="3217">Until I left Hungary, I went to say Kaddish for my father every day. </sentence><sentence id="3218">When I came to this country, I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="3219">There was no Jewish synagogue in Wharton. </sentence><sentence id="3220">My uncle arranged for me to have a job, mean -- two -- two weeks after I came, as well as my fiancee. </sentence><sentence id="3221">She was a chemist, she spoke English, she got a fairly good job. </sentence><sentence id="3222">I got a general helper's job in a small factory, not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could have. </sentence><sentence id="3223">What -- and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things is that in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fiancee and I had decided to go to the next town, which had a little, small synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="3224">And we -- to say Kaddish. </sentence><sentence id="3225">So I went to say Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle's whom we -- knew we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3226">And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and his fiancee in a synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="3227">You know, ho -- what -- what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="3228">Well, my uncle was quite furious about this and told me that -- why didn't I tell him this, he would have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him. </sentence><sentence id="3229">So it   Interview with George Pick mn November 13, 1997 was a big fallout. </sentence><sentence id="3230">I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to put the address. </sentence><sentence id="3231">And it -- the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a Hungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the town, who opened the letter and in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e -- much glee Iam sure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me. </sentence><sentence id="3232">And wrote a letter to my mother that I will end up in a gallows in this country and I will -- and I am just a terrible person. </sentence><sentence id="3233">My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="3234">Anyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at Temple University to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was -- "57 rather, sorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left. </sentence><sentence id="3235">My fiancee stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="3236">I went to vi-- to Philadelphia, I stayed there for over a year. </sentence><sentence id="3237">My fiancee and I sort of broke up at this point. </sentence><sentence id="3238">She moved to New York, and later on she got married. </sentence><sentence id="3239">My uncle and I broke up quite a bit, quite severely, and my mother left Budapest in August of 1957, with a visa to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3240">She never went to Israel, she stayed in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="3241">My uncle, who was her brother, helped him -- her a bit, however, in reality what he did is he told me that I have to help my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3242">And I sent my uncle a certain amount of money every month so that he would send it to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3243">After Temple, I got a job as an engi -- junior engineer at Westinghouse, and I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at Drexel and   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Pick m November 13, 1997 I started to study engineering. </sentence><sentence id="3244">And I did that until March of "58, at which time I found out that my mother was going to come to the United States and she will be coming in the next six months. </sentence><sentence id="3245">And my uncle very specifically told me that he was not going to help my mother come to the United States, or help her when she's here. </sentence><sentence id="3246">So I had no choice in the matter, I quit school. </sentence><sentence id="3247">I went to New York. </sentence><sentence id="3248">I was unemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it -- my friend's help, I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="3249">And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in Washington. </sentence><sentence id="3250">This Russian princess happened to be the cousin of the Lazar(ph). </sentence><sentence id="3251">Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some reason and another, hil -- she liked me. </sentence><sentence id="3252">And she called Cardinal O'Boyle, who was the chancellor of the Catholic University of America and told him that, here is this refugee boy, and that she would like to help him. </sentence><sentence id="3253">And I got a interview, and I got a job as an instructor there. </sentence><sentence id="3254">I also enrolled in graduate school there, I stayed there for seven years. </sentence><sentence id="3255">I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi -- ending up as an as- assistant professor and receiving my Master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1962. </sentence><sentence id="3256">In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer. </sentence><sentence id="3257">That marriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later. </sentence><sentence id="3258">Two months after I came to Washington in 58, my mother arrived here. </sentence><sentence id="3259">And I live with my mother from "58 until 64. </sentence><sentence id="3260">And I worked in the university and my mother -- most of the    118 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 time my mother didn't work, essentially. </sentence><sentence id="3261">She found a little job to get a social security, finally. </sentence><sentence id="3262">And the university was -- the university experience was -- was not as rewarding as I was hoping for, it -- it's a small school. </sentence><sentence id="3263">At that time Catholic University was a rather backwards school in terms of theology. </sentence><sentence id="3264">They still didn't step out to the 15" century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn't tolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that that's not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left. </sentence><sentence id="3265">Well, actually, divorce wasn't as bad as my remarriage in 1964. </sentence><sentence id="3266">I met another Jewish girl here, and we married. </sentence><sentence id="3267">And that -- after that, things became very intolerable. </sentence><sentence id="3268">By then I only worked part-time at school. </sentence><sentence id="3269">I got a job in a research inst -- a research in -- firm, a small firm, and it was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="3270">One thing which happened after I got my citizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, is I got my passport, and I took advantage of still working in a university and I went to Europe for two months, which was the first time since "56, and the first time I really had a chance to travel. </sentence><sentence id="3271">And it was a fabulous two months of -- of -- of not just vacationing, but -- but discovering western Europe. </sentence><sentence id="3272">It was very interesting, because I sailed on a ship, which was called the USS France. </sentence><sentence id="3273">On the manifesto of that ship, there was a girl, her name was Toby Yaspar(ph). </sentence><sentence id="3274">She became my wife a year later. </sentence><sentence id="3275">We didn't know that we were sailing on the same ship, or if we were traveling together. </sentence><sentence id="3276">We met in a   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with George Pick " November 13, 1997 -- ina Jewish get together, about a half a year later. </sentence><sentence id="3277">In 1966, I went to join the -- work for the navy. </sentence><sentence id="3278">At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for my PhD, and I needed a thesis. </sentence><sentence id="3279">And the university had no laboratory which was really capable of doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="3280">So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the David Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work on my thesis there, which is what I did. </sentence><sentence id="3281">I worked there 11 years. </sentence><sentence id="3282">I worked there in high energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis. </sentence><sentence id="3283">I never got my degree, because by the time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I just didn't -- I was in -- in school studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of it. </sentence><sentence id="3284">And I really didn't think that I needed it. </sentence><sentence id="3285">So I had all the PhD courses finished, and I -- the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3286">It was 11 years of research; nice years, interesting research. </sentence><sentence id="3287">I wrote more than 50 papers. </sentence><sentence id="3288">I was involved in the professional development there. </sentence><sentence id="3289">And then in 1977, I had an opportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="3290">I moved from 19 -- from Maryland where | lived, to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3495">A: I learned about the museum probably 10 years before it was built, through some solicitations and through friends whose -- who provided some funds to the museum. </sentence><sentence id="3496">I did not know very much about the museum until I saw an ad, I think in the "Washington Jewish Week," where the museum advertised for volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="3497">This was in 1992. </sentence><sentence id="3498">And I went to the L Street, where the museum headquarters were at the time, and I didn't know what was going on, and I volunteered and I said I could help in the library, could do some translations from Hungarian to English. </sentence><sentence id="3499">And I got --I-I worked a little bit with -- with a car -- with Sheri(ph) Shebo(ph) -- you know    123 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 --I don't know if you know Sheri(ph). </sentence><sentence id="3500">She -- I think she still works up in the library. </sentence><sentence id="3501">And I worked there for a couple of months until the first course started for the volunteers for the visitors" services. </sentence><sentence id="3502">And I was in -- in that group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3512">Q: Why -- why did you start working for the museum? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3514">A: I felt that the museum fulfills a mission for me. </sentence><sentence id="3515">I am a survivor and I had a responsibility and a mission until I can, and I'm capable of, to associate myself with projects which have something to do with the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3516">My awareness started before the museum, in the mid -- mid-80s, when Holocaust became a subject, which they spoke again about. </sentence><sentence id="3517">As you know, the Holocaust was a taboo subject, even in this country, for many years. </sentence><sentence id="3518">Although I read a n-- a number of books, it's astonishing how little came up between say 1956 and 1986. </sentence><sentence id="3519">There were a few books only, and not very much of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3520">I think where I became more aware is the gathering. </sentence><sentence id="3521">I was a volunteer there, because I felt that I was really not a survivor, that -- that, you know, this was for the older survivors, and the concept of child survivor did not hit me at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3522">It hit me a couple of years later, when I started to read about child survivor groups. </sentence><sentence id="3523">And in 1991 I got associated with a group here in Washington, called the Washington-Baltimore area child survivors, and I became very active. </sentence><sentence id="3524">We had a conference in 1991, and at that time I knew about the museum, and I became very interested in that, as well as the child survivor group. </sentence><sentence id="3525">I    124 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 started to write, I started to read more, I started to speak to groups. </sentence><sentence id="3526">And by 1992 - 1993, I was a --a full-fledged volunteer who is -- was more than eager to do something, and I liked the idea of wanting to educate the public, as well as others, about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3527">I felt that the people, even the Jewish people, were ignorant and that they really need education, and I felt that the museum was a -- was the vehicle for that. </sentence><sentence id="3528">And so when we finished, I was more than eager to start working there. </sentence><sentence id="3529">The first thing I did is I, when the opportunity arose, I-- I completed the learning center specialist course, and I finished another cor -- specialized course for -- for student, and then for teacher guides in the permanent exhibition, which I still can do, and do occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="3530">And then I got associated with the speakers" bureau in 1980 -- in 1995. </sentence><sentence id="3531">And in "95 - deg96, I-- I spoke to a number of outside groups: among them Pentagon, a number of army establishments, schools, synagogues and churches. </sentence><sentence id="3532">And I feel that -- that that aspect of -- of my work, in conjunction with the museum is very appropriate for me as a -- as a survivor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3552">Q: Are the talks that you give to these groups different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3554">A: Some of them are different. </sentence><sentence id="3555">Most of them center about my own story, you know, survi -- as a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="3556">But I have spoken to high schools, such as the Lee High School in Silver Spring about other things, such as the relevance of -- of the Holocaust in today's world. </sentence><sentence id="3557">It's a -- it's amazing how many people think that the    125 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 Holocaust is really not relevant, and how I feel that that's wrong, and that there is tremendous relevance even today and will for the future. </sentence><sentence id="3558">In a sense, I am very desperate to -- to -- to preserve the memory, which whatever means that takes. </sentence><sentence id="3559">I wrote up my story, which was published, incidentally, in 1993 also, as a--as a collection of stories with 11 other Hungarians and -- and it's published in a book. </sentence><sentence id="3560">And I -- Iam writing now a --a lo -- long -- longer autobiography which will be probably a full-length book. </sentence><sentence id="3561">Not just my Holocaust, but my post-Holocaust experience in life in general. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3570">Q: How has working at the museum affected your life? </sentence><sentence id="3571">Has it affected your memories of the Holocaust? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3574">A: It certainly has. </sentence><sentence id="3575">It induced me to -- to learn a lot more. </sentence><sentence id="3576">I thought I knew the Holocaust fairly well, through roughly 10 - 15 years of reading, but I found out that I needed to learn a great deal too. </sentence><sentence id="3577">And in the last five years, oh, I read maybe a couple of hundred books on the Holocaust and I took a number of courses, mostly in the museum. </sentence><sentence id="3578">There are tremendous courses in the museum, for learning center specialists and research department. </sentence><sentence id="3579">I try to go to every course and every lecture and every one or two day cour -- one or two day -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3580">Q: Seminars, conference? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3581"> 126 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3582">A: --sem-seminars, wherever it's offered, then wherever I have time. </sentence><sentence id="3583">I -- I went maybe 50 of them already. </sentence><sentence id="3584">So Iam -- I'm really immersed, and it made me very conscious about a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="3585">A lot of things which a lot of people just sort of don't care about or -- or feel that it's not -- not relevant any more, and I think it is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3590">Q: Why do you think it's relevant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3592">A: Why is it relevant? </sentence><sentence id="3593">I think that it's relevant because people are -- most people in this country and everywhere else in the world are still as disinterested in what happens to other groups who are discriminated against, or who are being killed, as they were 53 years ago when the Jews were killed, and I think the message is still fresh. </sentence><sentence id="3594">You cannot be disinterested, you must be involved, because involvement is the only insurance for the world to prevent mass genocides. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3598">Q: Do you think, as a staff member at the museum, you bring special insights because you are a survivor? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3600">A: I do believe that that's the case. </sentence><sentence id="3601">I believe that every time that I say to a group who comes, and whose -- and I give group -- little -- little group orientations when I say that my name is George Pick and I am a survivor and all of a sudden everybody looks at me. </sentence><sentence id="3602">And it -- it -- I think a survivor is a -- is the only direct link people have to the Holocaust, and I believe that that is a unique thing I bring to the museum, and    127 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 all the survivors who are there, bring to the museum. </sentence><sentence id="3603">And I think the museum should take maximum advantage of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3609">Q: With your survivor friends, have you ever tried to encourage them to volunteer at the museum, and if so what -- what did they respond to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3611">A: Yes, I do, I-- the -- I have two sets of survivor friends. </sentence><sentence id="3612">The -- some of them are older than I am. </sentence><sentence id="3613">The ones who are Hungarian, and who are in their 70s, and some of who gave considerable amount of money to -- to the museum. </sentence><sentence id="3614">Who can afford to, but they do. </sentence><sentence id="3615">And who are -- some who are not as wealthy, myself included, who would give our time. </sentence><sentence id="3616">I know that a number of us are volunteering in the museum who are Hungarians and who are survivors. </sentence><sentence id="3617">Same thing from the survivor -- child survivor group. </sentence><sentence id="3618">And I am -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3619">Q: So the -- so the response to -- when you ask people to volunteer has been good? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3620">A: Not as good as I would like it. </sentence><sentence id="3621">I would like to have more of them volunteer and more of them go out, but each year I can -- I can persuade a few more people to -- to get involved. </sentence><sentence id="3622">And as -- that's always pleasing to me, and I'm always gratified if that happens -- if-- when that happens. </sentence><sentence id="3623">And I'm trying to keep people's minds out -- interestingly enough, few -- few of my friends who really suffered a great deal through the camps, are not willing to speak out and not willing to face, maybe never will face the horrors they -- they had gone through. </sentence><sentence id="3624">And -- and I sympathize and I    128 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 understand that. </sentence><sentence id="3625">But I encourage everybody else, who are capable of talking, to -- to talk to the museum, talk to the foundation, the Shoah Foundation, and give testimony. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3635">A: We have a very close-knit relationship. </sentence><sentence id="3636">We know, of course who the survivors are, and we speak perhaps more among ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="3637">We have now a group who meet about twice a -- about once every two months. </sentence><sentence id="3638">We have now the -- the director of survivor affairs, and Martin Goldman, who is encouraging us to interact with him and with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3639">We are very concerned about the museum and we are concerned about the direction the museum takes. </sentence><sentence id="3640">We want to make sure that the -- the Jewish aspect of the Holocaust is emphasized and that the Jewish aspects of the Holocaust are not going to fall by the wayside. </sentence><sentence id="3641">We understand it's a -- it's a government institution, but we still believe that the main event of the Holocaust was still the -- the Holocaust against the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="3642">And we emphasize that among ourselves, and among the -- the visitors. </sentence><sentence id="3643">We do not think this is in contradiction with any kind of museum policy, should not be, and must not be. </sentence><sentence id="3644">And so we are -- we feel that we want to preserve the museum's main mission, which is to explain the Holocaust and show what -- what had happened during that period. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3645"> 129 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3646">Q: Do the -- you think the emphasis is becoming less Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3647">A: Ido. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3708">A: Okay, yes, of course. </sentence><sentence id="3709">I think that it is not a coincidence that in the volunteer corps, probably 95 percent are Jewish, whether they are survivors or non-survivors. </sentence><sentence id="3710">I feel that, and I very much encourage anybody who volunteers to volunteer for the museum whether Jewish or non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3711">But there is, I think, a reason why Jews feel more of a mission there than a non-mission. </sentence><sentence id="3712">And I feel the same thing about the staff. </sentence><sentence id="3713">I am sorry to say that one of the concerns I have, and not only I, but many others, is that many of the staff, the Jewish staff, is leaving the museum, and many of them already have left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3720">Q: Why is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3722">A: Well, that's a good question, I don't -- I don't know what the answer is, but I have a feeling that the answer is very complex. </sentence><sentence id="3723">One aspect of that answer is that the museum, in some respects become a bureau -- bi -- be -- is becoming a bureaucracy, just like any other bureaucracy and it kills initiative. </sentence><sentence id="3724">And there are some -- there were some very bright people there, with ideas and initiatives, who were stifled and who were frustrated and who find -- found a dead end situation there, and left. </sentence><sentence id="3725">They    132 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 were not just a bunch of young people who left, whom I knew and sympathized with, and who would have loved to stay in a museum if they have seen for themselves some -- some way up and some way to develop. </sentence><sentence id="3726">But some senior man -- senior people, senior historians, who had a reputation, and whose reputation enhanced the reputation of the museum, such as the research center. </sentence><sentence id="3727">I was very sorry to see Baron(ph) Vaughn(ph) first of all leaving. </sentence><sentence id="3728">I was very sorry to see when Sylvia Milton left. </sentence><sentence id="3729">And my fear is that, with these kind of people leaving the museum, the research institute is not going to be able to attract the type of reputable scientists, such as Browning and others. </sentence><sentence id="3730">It is not just a matter of money, I think it's a matter of reputation, and I think the -- the institute started out as a world class -- world class institution, and I am not positive that it still maintains that status today, and I think it should. </sentence><sentence id="3731">And if it doesn't now, it should certainly strive to do it again. </sentence><sentence id="3732">That is an awful lot that institution needs to do, and had the potential to doing it. </sentence><sentence id="3733">I think the museum management should definitely strive to -- to nurture that institution, and my impression is that it is not doing that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3746">Q: What would you like to see them do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3748">A: What I like to see them do is to first of all encourage and hire world class historians to work there. </sentence><sentence id="3749">As I said, some of them already left, and I'm not positive that too many of them wants -- wants to work there under the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="3750">I think    133 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 some enticement, grants, sut -- etcetera, probably will bring some of them back. </sentence><sentence id="3751">But I think that there is a -- a limitation there. </sentence><sentence id="3752">There are other institutions who are competing for these same people, and I think if -- if the research institute is not going to compete successfully in the next few years, they may lose that kind of brainpower, and I think that would be a great loss. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3811">A: I--I do not remember consciously resisting. </sentence><sentence id="3812">After the war, particularly after the communists took over in Hungary, this was a taboo subject. </sentence><sentence id="3813">We did not focus at this, we had day -- daily problems and concerns. </sentence><sentence id="3814">The memory, as fresh as it is 53 years later, was somehow buried for many, many decades, without losing its vividity, its -- its vividness, its -- its -- its relevance. </sentence><sentence id="3815">And it stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="3816">I mean, it obviously this kind of things don't go away forever, but I never resisted it consciously, I si--I simply just went somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="3817">I -- I did -- and I -- I must say also that my life is not defined by the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3818">Maybe in the later, last few years it's focusing -- the Holocaust is more of a focus. </sentence><sentence id="3819">But as you heard it from my post- Holocaust experiences and my -- my professional life, I was not -- the fofo -- the Holocaust did not deter me in what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="3820">I was among the probably few who ended up not in a helping profession. </sentence><sentence id="3821">You would be a-amazed how many of the survivors ended up in a helping profession, or ha -- how many ended up in becoming a -- more lawyers and doctors, and how few are engineers. </sentence><sentence id="3822">But I was among the ones who became the hard scientist and I felt that my real calling and    137 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 profession was engineering and science, although I am trying to catch up now, and I am very much like -- I would like to learn as much as I can about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3823">I still do not regard myself as, you know, as a survivor only. </sentence><sentence id="3824">But I f-- want to use my survivor status to speak, and my -- my privileged voice to speak and to teach as long as I can. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3860">A: [have to tell you the -- I have to tell you a little story about this. </sentence><sentence id="3861">You know Einstein was asked the same question. </sentence><sentence id="3862">The -- does he feel American, German or Jewish, and he says -- do you know what his answer was? </sentence><sentence id="3863">His answer was, well, as long as my theory of relativity holds up, the Germans will say I'm German, the    138 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 Americans will say I-- I am American, and of course the Jews will say I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3864">But if my theory turns out to be incorrect, the Americans will say I'm German and the Germans will say I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3865">So the same way with me, it's -- I feel that the components are there. </sentence><sentence id="3866">I am a part --I have 22 years of me with Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="3867">I have 40 years of me with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and they somehow counteract and interact. </sentence><sentence id="3868">I -- I think it is -- is sort of a very simp-simplified question when one asks, who, what is, in what component. </sentence><sentence id="3869">I -- I must say, I love Hungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music. </sentence><sentence id="3870">I love American literature, but I love a lot of -- lot of other things. </sentence><sentence id="3871">And my hobbies, for example are more universalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3872">But I lo -- but there are components of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated with neither. </sentence><sentence id="3873">For example, I -- I love photography, which is neither Jewish -- although there were many Jewish photographers. </sentence><sentence id="3874">Neither Jewish nor Hungarian were -- there were a lot of good Hungarian photographers. </sentence><sentence id="3875">Nor American, where again, same -- same thing happens. </sentence><sentence id="3876">My interest and philosophy of life, I hope transcends somehow, this compartmentalization. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3897">A: Yeah, I 1-1 like to go back to the museum, and I like to go back to a--a concern I--T had and raised and shall raise in the future, and that is about teachers"    139 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 education. </sentence><sentence id="3898">I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students, who will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies would be Christian. </sentence><sentence id="3899">I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the museum about anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="3900">And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year, where I was -- where I am -- was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers, trying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central -- centrality of anti-Semitism and church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3901">And the difficulties which these teachers had with the acceptance of this idea. </sentence><sentence id="3902">And I was very concerned because I feel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa -- one of the -- one of the teachers said well, what happens if e -- we teach it different? </sentence><sentence id="3903">And he says, well, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way. </sentence><sentence id="3904">Well, that's nice. </sentence><sentence id="3905">I always believe in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec -- spe-specific and fairly practical objections. </sentence><sentence id="3906">For example one black teacher got up -- very few black teachers participated in this, said hey, I came from Tennessee from the Bible Belt. </sentence><sentence id="3907">I cannot teach the Baptists that their belt -- their -- their New Testament is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3908">I can't teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3909">How do I do this? </sentence><sentence id="3910">And I was really concerned and I am -- I think that this is a great central concern and should be of the education department to -- to teach the Holocaust and the centrality of the a -- of -- of the anti-Semitism in such a way that    140 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 the teachers can accept it. </sentence><sentence id="3911">I'm not talking sugarcoating. </sentence><sentence id="3912">I am talking truth, or I am talking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it. </sentence><sentence id="3913">If you teach it without acceptable ways, then it won't be taught. </sentence><sentence id="3914">And if it is not taught, then the great point of the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost. </sentence><sentence id="3915">It's not enough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened. </sentence><sentence id="3916">And they cannot shirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art -- of anti- Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="3917">But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can teach it and can accept it themselves? </sentence><sentence id="3918">I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are struggling. </sentence><sentence id="3919">I mean, they -- they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs, and then they hear this, and they don't know how to resolve it. </sentence><sentence id="3920">I think this needs to be really considered and reconsidered in the museum, and that's not a small amount of work either. </sentence><sentence id="3921">That's my parting shot for this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
