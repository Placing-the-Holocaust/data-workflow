<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Good morning. </sentence><sentence id="4">Would you please state your name, your date of birth, and your place of birth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: My name now is George Salton. </sentence><sentence id="8">I have used two other names in the past, but this will come out in...later in the discussion. </sentence><sentence id="9">I was born in Chemish (ph) on January 7th, 1928. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And could you tell me a little bit about your parents and their occupations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Uh my father was a small-town lawyer in Poland before the war. </sentence><sentence id="16">We lived in town called Pitchen (ph), which a suburb of a county seat called ,uh in German,  happened uh the Germans came to our town and to the best of my recollection it was on the 8th of September, about a week or eight days after the war started, and uh things have changed from then on. </sentence><sentence id="17">First uh the day after the Germans came or maybe two days after, they uh broke into the synagogue uh and uh burned the Torahs (ph) and destroyed uh the the the contents and the furniture and they imposed restrictions on the general population, but more severe restrictions on the Jews, arrested a number of uh intellectuals or people that they considered to be uh leaders of society. </sentence><sentence id="18">Among them was my father who was arrested by the Gestapo about a week or maybe two weeks after the Germans arrived and and uh the life was changed. </sentence><sentence id="19">It was getting progressively worse. </sentence><sentence id="20">The restrictions were...that were imposed on us were were by themselves small but progressively more severe and the penalties were very, very severe, so therefore, for example, one was prohibited from shopping in certain stores or later prohibited from uh being walking on certain streets or later required to wear a white arm band with a blue Star of David on it, or prohibited from using the trains or the buses. </sentence><sentence id="21">While each restriction by by by itself was not all that severe, the penalty was very frequently imprisonment or execution and consequently life was changed. </sentence><sentence id="22">And as as time passed, uh life became more and more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="23">In addition to it, there were Jews, and my parents in particular were unable to exercise uh their professions or make a living and we had to sustain ourselves by slowly selling whatever possessions we had...furniture, fur coats, piano...and so the life was difficult and uh and in addition to it, my my friends, my former associates who were Christians uh now were quite uh sensitive to the fact that I was not one of them and made me and let me know about it. </sentence><sentence id="24">I remember the day when the when our synagogue was destroyed and when the Germans pulled out the torahs on the street in front of the building and burned it...uh we youngsters were observing this and wanted to know what the Germans were doing. </sentence><sentence id="25">My Christian friends stayed and laughed and said that that's kind of a funny uh incident where I and maybe one or two other Jews who were there felt aa sense of damage or destruction, and kind of laughed, you know, destroyed and so things like this have happened. </sentence><sentence id="26">So my life has changed both because there were restrictions on the Jews, because there was uh economic hardship, and because there was a general rejection by those of my friends whom I with whom I associated prior to the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: Now you then went into a a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="40">Is that correct? </sentence><sentence id="41">Can you tell me about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="46">I...let me just add something else. </sentence><sentence id="47">There is one something else that happened of course. </sentence><sentence id="48">Uh the the war started in September of 1939 and and shortly we were occupied uh mid-September or late September, the public schools opened again. </sentence><sentence id="49">Schools in Europe started usually the first Monday in September, and I went to school and I was...I think was in the fifth grade at that time and went to school because it was time to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="50">And I remember my teacher who who was known as anti-Semitic, my Polish Christian teacher, uh taking me aside with some sense of embarrassment and telling me that Jews were no longer allowed to attend school, so there was another change. </sentence><sentence id="51">That was another another restriction on my life. </sentence><sentence id="52">To to go back to your question, yes, uh life was getting more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="53">There more and more restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="54">My father, after a number of months of  uh being imprisoned, was uh released, came home a broken, sick man and uh the restrictions that the Germans imposed upon us were greater and greater. </sentence><sentence id="55">There was some terror. </sentence><sentence id="56">There was some executions. </sentence><sentence id="57">We were basically uh we were basically conditioned to to to obey the laws and the restrictions, the demands, until early in 1942 uh the ghetto was established in in and uh slowly the various uh Jewish communities both in the  worked. </sentence><sentence id="58">Uh my father found a some job in some social organization which really I I think had no other value than he gave him a a a some certificate that uh that that allowed him to be excused in any kind of a a raid for for workers to work on the on railroad and so on, but there was no education. </sentence><sentence id="59">There was no...nothing formal. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh of course our Jewish and intellectual roots uh cause us caused us to continue doing it, so there was some private private teaching and former high school students who were maybe teenagers were uh busy teaching reading and writing to youngsters and I who was fourteen was also sometimes asked to teach young children of nine or six to how to read and write, so there was a little bit of act...there was some, there was some, there was a structure to deal with it but nothing formal. </sentence><sentence id="61">Much of the time was spent uh wandering through the ghetto looking for some opportunity to to do something that would secure some food or listening to rumors or just wasting time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Did any kind of an underground organization develop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: There was uh...first of all, you have to understand that as a as a fourteen year old, I wasn't necessarily trusted enough to to be taken into it. </sentence><sentence id="82">Uh I don't know that there was a underground organization that uh that had plans to enter into combat, but there was, there were many underground organizations that dealt with the cultural and social life of the people in the ghetto and and uh uh approved and...I shouldn't say approved...but uh supported activities that were really prohibited by by the Germans like teaching or having some religious services or having some social services that provided whatever little help one could provide to to the inhabitants of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="83">It was underground. </sentence><sentence id="84">It took courage. </sentence><sentence id="85">It took commitment, even though it did not involve carrying a gun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: How long were you in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: I was in the ghetto about six months, and...uh in in about June of 1942, the ghetto was fully of rumors. </sentence><sentence id="94">Rife was rumors that something is going to happen and uh it gave it it caused us all to be very active, to run from place to place to to listen for some rumors, and I remember being one day uh together with my brother who was uh twenty at that time...I was fourteen...in front of a building, in that house the German work office, labor office uh and people...whatever there were there...maybe two or three hundred people standing and milling around. </sentence><sentence id="95">There was fear in the air. </sentence><sentence id="96">There was concern and at some point some of the officials of the the German officials came out and started examining identity papers of those people that were ed...on the edge of the crowd and again people were saying (cough) oh this is good or bad and those whose papers will be somehow examined will be sent out to work and others were saying those that whose papers are examined will be allowed to stay here, and it (cough)...excuse me...and in in the course of that uh activity and that...all that was accompanied you must understand while beating and kicking and hitting...and they looked at the young man's paper, a man, a young man who was maybe sixteen or seventeen at that time...I I knew him...and uh his papers, his identity card which was yellow...that was specifically uh given to Jews...uh yellow because the Germans consider yellow to be a color of shame and they were very very  much involved with the symbolism of that...and his papers indicated that he had some physical limitation that uh excused him from random assignment to la...to to work groups, and one of the Germans looked at these papers and said, ah...in German of course...you didn't want to work before so the heck with you now. </sentence><sentence id="97">And that gave us, of course, all of us, a great crowd of a few hundred people an indication that having the paper somehow stamped, the process was a positive thing. </sentence><sentence id="98">Everybody started pushing forward with their papers in hand and the Germans, the...additional German officials came out and was shooting in the air and beating and pushing people back, and it it happened that the man in charge of that office was a a man of German origin who lived in our town before the war and was a teacher, a high school teacher, my brother's high school teacher. </sentence><sentence id="99">He recognized my brother and said to him, give me your paper and of course my brother also gave him mine. </sentence><sentence id="100">Our papers were taken away and we went...our papers and the papers of a number of other people, and we went home without them. </sentence><sentence id="101">Again, the rumors were they are not letting us know what what this is all about and the next morning the Jewish police...they were kind of Jewish police is really...that's what they were called but they more like like couriers and and and uh people who help keep order...anyway a Jewish policeman came to our house and returned mine and my brother's paper and they had a stamp put from the German Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="102">We didn't know what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="103">We, again, were driven by rumors and speculation. </sentence><sentence id="104">Uh two days later there was an announcement in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="105">This is now late June of 1942...I have to take some water...(pause)...announcements posted on all the buildings in Polish and in German and in Yiddish I believe, basically saying that the ghetto is being being evacuated, being moved or the inhabitants are being moved to a big farm in Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="106">Let me just point out that this was in June of "42. </sentence><sentence id="107">Uh the German-Russian war started in June of "41 and June of "42 was the height of German success in in Russia where the large segments of Russian were under German occupation, so it made sense when they said that the ghetto population is being moved to a large communal farm in the Ukraine that sits idle. </sentence><sentence id="108">There will be work there, that the trip will take uh three days and that people should take food along for three days which really silly because we had no food, and that uh what the climate is going to be and uh what clothing to take along and that everyone except those who have stamps on their ID cards, on their identification papers, are required to to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="109">Deported is not the term they used, but to be moved to that new new location. </sentence><sentence id="110">I didn't want to stay. </sentence><sentence id="111">I was fourteen. </sentence><sentence id="112">I was the youngest son. </sentence><sentence id="113">I wanted to go with my parents, but my parents said no, uh stay here. </sentence><sentence id="114">You have a home town. </sentence><sentence id="115">You'll be with your brother. </sentence><sentence id="116">We don't know what's going to happen over there. </sentence><sentence id="117">In retrospect, I don't know...they they had some premonition that that story was really a lie as as you can gather. </sentence><sentence id="118">Anyway uh a week later the ghetto was divided into two parts. </sentence><sentence id="119">The lar...it was the large ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="120">It was a small place but we call...they called it the large ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="121">One corner of the ghetto was uh surrounded by an internal fence and the instructions were given by the Germans that all those who had their cards stamped including their wives and children had to move to that small ghetto and no one in the small ghetto...no one can be in the small ghetto without a stamp on his card and if there is anyone found without the stamp on his card, he or she will be executed and all others are to move to the larger ghetto which was then in the course of four days with great violence, and great shooting  and blood, uh driven to the railroad stations on four consecutive days and driven and taken to what I believe...and maybe some people believed to...was this farm in the Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="122">Me and my brother stayed in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="123">We were assigned jobs at the local factory. </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh that was kind of a random process. </sentence><sentence id="125">Those who who stayed were assigned to to work groups, and me in one...in a group that was doing construction on a housing construction on this large uh airplane engine factory that was built by the Poles before the war but was not operating, now was operated by Benz or Mercedes Benz  eroup was not uh no longer working there, that they were deported. </sentence><sentence id="126">I was , and  frankly when I discovered it was money I was had some second thoughts of whether I should have done it or not. </sentence><sentence id="127">About six months later I we I was working on a...cleaning windows, standing on a long ladder, because in addition to working twelve hours a shift in the inside the factory, we were required to work in the evening, on weekends and doing other work and I was standing on this long ladder cleaning a window above a entrance to an office building when one of the German guard guards kicked the ladder from under me. </sentence><sentence id="128">I fell down and there was a grate at the bottom in front of the door which are common in Europe on which people were able to scrape their shoes. </sentence><sentence id="129">Anyway I fell, uh cut my knee. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was very badly damaged and injured and since we had no physicians and no medicine, it was infected and my knee was stiff and I really couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="131">I was running high temperature and after a number of weeks of being sick and miserable, I was selected together some others uh to be to be driven to another place which we believed was really a place where they executed people that were not useful. </sentence><sentence id="132">And uh I was too sick and too beaten to really to care, to really be able to resist it. </sentence><sentence id="133">And as I was sitting on that truck or standing on that truck with maybe six or eight or other people, that uh German master came by, the German engineer. </sentence><sentence id="134">He recognized me and uh said oh, this is a very important worker that I cannot spare and took me off the truck and a job was assigned to me, a wonderful job...the best job one could have there...to be a janitor cleaning uh toilets. </sentence><sentence id="135">That may sound strange but this was a job that one had some degree of freedom because there was not a supervisor that stood over one. </sentence><sentence id="136">One could go walk and go and clean and and it gave me an opportunity in the next four or five months to recover, but again that little incident was one of those and there were others and I will mention them as I go along, that that were those lucky things for which I claim no responsibility because when I found the envelope and gave it back to him, I had no way of knowing that where it's going to lead. </sentence><sentence id="137">Anyhow it was one those lucky incidents that allowed me to continue. </sentence><sentence id="138">Uh we were in that camp, working. </sentence><sentence id="139">Uh there were a number of miserable things...some uh executions and killing and beating and hunger and misery. </sentence><sentence id="140">I remember one incident that I 1 remember it quite well because I could never really understand it and I still don't. </sentence><sentence id="141">One day...it must have been spring of "43 when the leaves were turning green and and uh weather was turning turn turning nice, when two young men and they must have been nineteen or twenty, young prisoners, escaped. </sentence><sentence id="142">They tunneled themselves under the fence. </sentence><sentence id="143">It was on a Saturday or on a weekend. </sentence><sentence id="144">On a Sunday it must have been because we did work on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="145">They tunneled themselves under the fence and escaped and there was much excitement and the Poles living in the neighborhood villages joined the Ukrainian guards in chasing them and they were caught by the by the two, by the Ukrainian guards with the help of the Polish peasants, brought back to camp, badly, very badly beaten and uh somehow the the authorities, the guards sent for the German Gestapo man who incidentally survived the war and was not not punished very much but that's another story...sent for the Gestapo man to come to deal with this breach of of order. </sentence><sentence id="146">And I remember he came on a in a in a kind of horse-driven buggy with his wife who was...he must have been a young man in his thirties with his young wife and two little children, really blonde, pink (ph) children. </sentence><sentence id="147">Left them sitting in the carriage outside of the camp gate and uh the kids were running around. </sentence><sentence id="148">The wife was sitting over there while he went inside, tortured the two men and executed them, and I could never understand how a  person who obviously had tender feelings for his family, who thought that it was a good opportunity to take his wife and children on a Sunday spring outing, would just transition from by just crossing the threshold of the gate and to become a a terri...a terrible torturer and executioner, but these were the things that happened in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="149">And I'm trying to remember...it was a long period of about a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="150">Difficult work. </sentence><sentence id="151">Difficult conditions. </sentence><sentence id="152">Hunger. </sentence><sentence id="153">Uh many tragedies, people trying to escape and being caught and and brought back and people executed but in the passage of time in spring of 1944 or maybe it was...yeah, it was late winter 1944 when...you understand that I was taken to this camp in July of "42 and about a year and a half later in spring of "44, the Russians were coming. </sentence><sentence id="154">The Ger...the Russian front was advancing and uh and uh they were not in our town but they were someplace in in eastern Poland, but anyway they were close enough and as you may know the Russian advances were kind of . </sentence><sentence id="155">They will advance uh a hundred  0 officials decided that everyone including Jews must have last name for tax purposes, and they just called my...they assigned a name to my great-great-grandfather uh that he had...uh that was associated with his occupation, so that's where the Salzman came and it was at that town that this camp was located, with most of the prisoners working in the salt mine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Let me go back for a second, if I may, to Pruschov. </sentence><sentence id="220">Can you give me a little bit more information, more detail about what it was really like and what your routine was like and and how you survived that that daily trauma? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Well, OK. </sentence><sentence id="224">The camp was a very crowded camp. </sentence><sentence id="225">There were barracks, wooden barracks in which there were great crowds of prisoners uh sleeping on kind of a three tier shelves. </sentence><sentence id="226">Uh food was very very limited. </sentence><sentence id="227">Our work was uh basically hard like labor where it was really no skill required and which made anyone of us expendable. </sentence><sentence id="228">Working in the factory...if someone's working on a drill press there was some value to one's identity, because if that operator of the drill press was executed, the drill press would idle until they found somebody else that they could train, but digging holes in the cemetery was really black labor, labor that was, that had no identity. </sentence><sentence id="229">It was just uh kind of useless labor and we were all vulnerable to be beaten or executed uh and uh one just existed from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="230">One just had a a kind of a inwards determination and to one's mind and to one's heart to just kind of bear with it, to to somehow avoid being identified, never to stand in the front row and if one marched in columns of five to be in the middle rather than the outside, to to appear busy, to avert one's eyes, to to be driven by an instinct for survival which was I think is in all of us. </sentence><sentence id="231">The other thing that was different about that camp...in in that camp for the first time I encountered uh women prisoners, Jewish women prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="232">They were I believe from Romania and it was it was an additional injury to my humanity to see women about whom I have romanticized, because I was just a young man of sixteen you know, being compelled to work hard and being compelled to walk around half dressed and to not being given any facilities for sanitary purposes that somehow gave them some degree of privacy, and all those things kind of added together to make us, to make me feel uh less than a human being really,but feel as a kind of a uh uh...a a a machine that whose purpose was to avoid exposure, to avoid any kind of a risk and just survive by uh obeying and following and doing the kind of things that I felt uh uh avoided uh being singled out by people, by the guards and by the SS supervisors who uh amused themselves I believe or satisfied some of their sadistic uh drives by beating and and killing people for no reason at all and and what one had to do is somehow be both lucky and be sufficiently assertive to avoid that situation when one could be singled out. </sentence><sentence id="233">Uh II avoided it, not because I was really more aggressive than the others, but because I I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="234">So that...when I look upon those months there, just months of of of ailment, of a of a sickness of mind and body... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: You were not able to continue the factory work that you had been doing at Reischof? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Oh no, no...we were just there, working there. </sentence><sentence id="250">And then when we reached Vileshka we  1 were...in which we were for a very short time, uh we were just also kind of like working in the ground and sleeping and uh and we were now emersed in a large mass of prisoners uh with the German SS men who were over us walking through the camp, you know, shooting people at random and and uh there was, we were just part of the mass. </sentence><sentence id="251">I was part of the mass. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Did they tell you why they sent you to Vileshka? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: Nobody told us anything. </sentence><sentence id="258">I was st...the the the the the consideration of being ever told or being or having any kind of explanation or justification uh doesn't apply. </sentence><sentence id="259">I mean we were kind of like uh if one has rabbits and one has chickens, one doesn't explain to chickens why they are being put in this or that building. </sentence><sentence id="260">We were treated in that way, and of course people speculated and this and that, but most of the most of our energy was was concentrated, was was spent on surviving of...on somehow nurturing that little piece of bread we received everyday, or the bowl of cabbage soup and of uh trying to make sure that our shoelaces when they broke could be repaired because if one was broken, had broken shoelaces one would limp, and if one limped one was singled out as somehow being being uh disabled and that was sufficient to be killed, so that's where our energy went, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="261">I mean the the little daily things that gave one a chance...no guarantee, a chance to make it through the day. </sentence><sentence id="262">And if one was hit by somebody or injured or if one fell down and had a bruise, that was sufficient to be singled out and not make it through the day. </sentence><sentence id="263">So that's where our energy went. </sentence><sentence id="264">Uh no one told us why we were there and we re...we really didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="265">We were sufficiently beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="266">We were sufficiently damaged that we somehow didn't expect any explanation, didn't expect any humane treatment, didn't expect to be treated as anything that was...that had any value. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: What did you do at Vileshka? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Pardon me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: What did you do at Vileshka? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Uh, in Vileshka we were relatively short time. </sentence><sentence id="284">I would say maybe a week, and they made me work uh on a...breaking stones. </sentence><sentence id="285">They had piles of stones that were the size of uh a basketball and they gave us a hammer and uh sit on the ground and we breaking the stones into smaller pieces and it was it was suitable for paving unpaved roads, but that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="286">And and and again I am saying this kind of unskilled labor was the most dangerous job to to do because there was no value in any individual worker. </sentence><sentence id="287">There were there were thousands of hundreds of thousands of people gassed and killed every day so there was basically unlimited supply of replacements. </sentence><sentence id="288">Things have changed. </sentence><sentence id="289">At at the end of one week in Vileshka, the four hundred or four hundred and fifty of us who came from the factory in Reischof were assembled and they had a way of assembling us, and put on a train and moved west, or we assume it was west. </sentence><sentence id="290">I really don't know that I could tell the direction but the others said we were moving west. </sentence><sentence id="291">It was first...it was the first indication  2 that the identity of that group that worked for a year and a half in the factory in Reischof was still retained and had some meaning. </sentence><sentence id="292">It was a very long trip and for people that survived the concentration camps, frequently the worse memories have to do with trips. </sentence><sentence id="293">Trips which maybe by car or by conven...normal train today would take three or four hours, took four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="294">The trains were sidelines and made to wait on on some back, back towns on the back rails and without food and water, very cramped and after four days of such a journey we arrived in a mountainous region uh where we were made to leave the train, those of the few people that died along the way...we were made to leave the train. </sentence><sentence id="295">We were surrounded by uh a group of SS. </sentence><sentence id="296">Young SS men was holding dogs and machine guns and turned out it was the camp was called Flossenburg (ph) and it is in uh now in in uh it is...it was in Bavaria in not far from the Czech border, not far from a town called Hoff (ph). </sentence><sentence id="297">Flossenburg was a well-known penal camp where most of the work was in the stone quarry. </sentence><sentence id="298">Anyway, we were caused (ph) to leave. </sentence><sentence id="299">The SS were very happy to see us. </sentence><sentence id="300">They were laughing, saying well these are the first Jews we are getting here since 1939 and we're glad to have you here. </sentence><sentence id="301">And they were really cynical. </sentence><sentence id="302">Marched us into the camp and you took a . </sentence><sentence id="303">As the train was moving from Vileshka toward  3 where the two prisoners, skeleton-looking hungary prisoners who would be given this bowl of soup to share, would feed each other, so if you gave me half a spoon, I gave you half a spoon. </sentence><sentence id="304">And if you dipped down and found a piece of potato, I'll dip down and give you a piece of potato, and so that customs or that habits or that arrangement which had both philosophical and not religious undertones, people managed to people who were strangers, people who were dying of hunger managed somehow to be disciplined and to go through that daily ritual of sharing the bowl of soup. </sentence><sentence id="305">After six weeks of work and hard labor...oh yes...I'm I'm forgetting something...when we first came to Flossenburg, we were marched by this young SS guards with their dogs up the hill to the camp, we we were brought before a very large building in a kind of assembly area, and we were...there were four hundred and fifty of us approximately, and we were all told to undress, to leave our clothing on the floor and all our possessions and we go in to take showers. </sentence><sentence id="306">Now there was concern. </sentence><sentence id="307">There was speculation, because by that time we knew about gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="308">We knew that our parents who were who went to the to the allegedly were sent to that farm in the east were really killed and sent to gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="309">We knew about that, and there was great concern that we may be taken to a gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="310">This was typical...this the thing...undress...go in naked. </sentence><sentence id="311">But there were really no choices. </sentence><sentence id="312">The choice was to resist and be killed, to run, to fight, to or to just hope and to do what one was told and hope that it was true that what they said that we will take a shower. </sentence><sentence id="313">I did that. </sentence><sentence id="314">I left my clothing and I left what whatever little possessions I had of my own that I carried through all the years of camps, and these possessions were a little handkerchief in which I had tied photographs of my brother and my parents, and after that we were really given showers and when the shower was over, made out...made to go out through another door where we were given new stripped uniform and uh and uh wooden shoes and all those things that we left behind we have never seen again, so I have not had a picture of my parents until I came to the United States where my aunt uh gave me a picture of my parents when they were first married. </sentence><sentence id="315">This uh...1 remember them only vaguely that way, and I have no picture of my brother. </sentence><sentence id="316">We worked. </sentence><sentence id="317">We were in Flossenburg for about six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="318">Worked very hard and one time we were exposed to a selection. </sentence><sentence id="319">Uh selection was a process where everybody stood naked and the a few SS people, one of them I believe a physician, kind of went by and marked us with a green ink writing numbers or some symbols on our forehead and he did it to me too. </sentence><sentence id="320">I don't know what it meant and we didn't know or we didn't care anyway. </sentence><sentence id="321">Didn't know, didn't care, but that night again our group was assembled, put on a train...that group of four hundred and fifty. </sentence><sentence id="322">And sent to France. </sentence><sentence id="323">Sent west I should say. </sentence><sentence id="324">Or sent west. </sentence><sentence id="325">Again this terrible long journey and it was it was uh like late spring of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="326">You remember February, March and they sent us to Pruschov. </sentence><sentence id="327">We were there for a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="328">Then Vileshka, then Flossenburg for six weeks and about April when I have to now really estimate the specific months...uh April "44 we were sent west and after a journey of about six or seven days we arrived in a town...we didn't know where we were. </sentence><sentence id="329">I mean I got...when I say France I mean that's in retrospect. </sentence><sentence id="330">At that time we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="331">Along the way experienced great hostility from the Germans along the way. </sentence><sentence id="332">We knew we were being driven through...we were being driven, if that's the right term to apply to a train, through through Germany. </sentence><sentence id="333">We sometimes stopped in a railroad station and through the little windows, through the barbed wires, we would call for some  4 water because this was the greatest suffering...that we had no water for these days, or very little water. </sentence><sentence id="334">And the Germans would mock us and say, you know, this and that...wouldn't help us. </sentence><sentence id="335">There was great hostility. </sentence><sentence id="336">After that long journey we arrived in this small town... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: We left off with your having just arrived at Colmar (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: Yeah, I I uh I made...I stressed some of the unfriendly and difficult and and hostile ex...encounters that we had along the way to Colmar to contrast what happened in Colmar, which uh was special and I I ] remember it with great emotion, so if I get upset, let no one be embarrassed by it. </sentence><sentence id="400">We were made to leave the train at some site, rail..railroad station in the town with a sign called Colmar. </sentence><sentence id="401">I really didn't know what it was uh or what the town was, even though some people said well, it uh it's France. </sentence><sentence id="402">I just...I must confess I don't remember at what point I found out that it was France, and then under SS guard made to march through this small town which is an ancient town of uh you know...it looks medieval and old buildings and cobblestones. </sentence><sentence id="403">We had wooden shoes and our marching made a tremendous clatters on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="404">It was early in the morning and as we were being marched people were, who were going to work, civilians, were stopped. </sentence><sentence id="405">The trolley cars were stopped and people were stopped to let us pass, a column of a few hundred people in stripped uniforms. ( </sentence><sentence id="406">Crying) And the people cried.(Crying) For the first time I saw support. </sentence><sentence id="407">I saw people cared. ( </sentence><sentence id="408">Crying) I have to stop. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="420">Q: It's OK, George. </sentence><sentence id="421">Just take your time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="424">A: You know, I never cry when I am...remember sadness. </sentence><sentence id="425">I cry when I remember happy things. </sentence><sentence id="426">Anyway, people (crying)... people cried and they threw their sandwiches or whatever they were carrying in their lunch box, packages at us which we couldn't pick up and cigarette, packs of cigarettes... (crying)...and they booed. </sentence><sentence id="427">They booed the Germans who were escorting us, who made us take of our caps every time we passed a building with a Nazi swastika flag. </sentence><sentence id="428">It really was such a special experience, not only for me but for the others with whom I have talked. </sentence><sentence id="429">While most of us didn't survive the war...of those four hundred and fifty, on that day maybe twenty-five survived or thirty survived. </sentence><sentence id="430">Uh we felt human. </sentence><sentence id="431">We felt human for for a while and that was a special gift that the people gave us. </sentence><sentence id="432">And we were taken then to a small camp. </sentence><sentence id="433">It was kind of a temporary camp in outside of of the town town of Colmar where we were kept for a week. </sentence><sentence id="434">Uh we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="435">Just sat there. </sentence><sentence id="436">There were hardly any food. </sentence><sentence id="437">We were eating grass, but at night fruit and (crying) bread was thrown over the fence by unknown people into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="438">After about a week of that, and it was special. </sentence><sentence id="439">I I get more emotional about it and I become embarrassed that I am that I am about those other places which were terrible because it was a a unique encounter with human kindness which I had forgotten about. </sentence><sentence id="440">After a week we were put in the train again, again after a few, two days of traveling, arrived in a kind of a mountainous area called uh in which which we discovered was called Orbas (ph). </sentence><sentence id="441">It's a small, small village in in eastern France in which there was a unfinished railroad tunnel and in inside the railroad tunnel there was a factory set up to manufacture airplane engines and most of the machines and many of the supervisors were those people back in  6 Reischof uh who were who left sometimes back in in March. </sentence><sentence id="442">Again uh circumstances of of luck that for which I take no responsibility and decisions that were made outside of my presence uh completely outside of any influence that we had, that some German officials in that factory or whatever, decided that it is valuable to retain this group of four hundred and fifty specialists which they considered us at that time, and had us catch up with the machinery that was being transferred to defense (ph) and uh uh absent that, we would certain not survived because working in stone quarries or salt mines or some other places was a job where one survived for only weeks and we worked with Frenchmen, uh guarded by Germans but working with Frenchmen in the factory and it was a better camp. </sentence><sentence id="443">The French workers that we worked with, the French worker I worked with shared his food that he brought with him...they used to bring a lunch bucket and they usually shared an apple or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="444">Uh on weekends I was made to work in the in the in a farm complex in which the SS were located washing cars for soldiers and as I did that strangers would throw apples or other things to me and uh and uh, you know, the countryside was pretty. </sentence><sentence id="445">There were hills with goats on it and little villages and uh we were still unhappy and miserable and the guards would still uh the SS guards that guarded the thing was still cruel. </sentence><sentence id="446">They have uh a few people were shot and killed. </sentence><sentence id="447">One man was told by a young guard I remember who was maybe nineteen to hey, run away and he ran and as he ran about six feet, the man killed him, but it was a different environment. </sentence><sentence id="448">It was a somewhat better camp. </sentence><sentence id="449">One night I remember I was walking through this tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="450">I was made to carry something and uh on the floor there was a piece of newspaper with a large headline, and my judgment wasn't very good at that time and I picked it up and stuck inside my jacket and then that night when we looked at it, it said in German, fortress Europe under attack. </sentence><sentence id="451">It uh really was the D-Day invasion and Normandy by the Allied Forces from England. </sentence><sentence id="452">It was very reassuring. </sentence><sentence id="453">We were happy about it, but we really didn't know exactly where we were. </sentence><sentence id="454">We didn't know how the Americans were doing and the the Allies were doing. </sentence><sentence id="455">The newspaper was not uh uh was not really honest. </sentence><sentence id="456">It's kind of said they attacked but they are being beaten back. </sentence><sentence id="457">But finally we didn't expect really anything good to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="458">We didn't expect...the whole idea of being liberated or being free or being autonomous was strange. </sentence><sentence id="459">We were conditioned now to be prisoners, to live in barracks, to be given cabbage soup, to be told what to do, to be completely without rights, to be beaten, you know, and so anyway the Americans were coming and in August as you remember...the Americans landed in June of "44. </sentence><sentence id="460">They was landing in southern France uh by early in August as I as I believe, and in August of "44 they put us in a train again and shipped us east. </sentence><sentence id="461">First the machines left and then we left. </sentence><sentence id="462">As our train went through Colmar, we looked out the windows. </sentence><sentence id="463">On our train there were box cars with four hundred and fifty of us...there were box cars and we would looked...no, we looked. </sentence><sentence id="464">We were in the box cars. </sentence><sentence id="465">We were looking out the windows and we saw the train with all the machines that we worked on sitting on the side railing, completely destroyed by a air raid and we knew that that connection was behind us, that connection with the factory. </sentence><sentence id="466">Incidentally this is also the time of the...in retrospect when there was the last attempt on Hitler's life in August of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="467">I just remembered now. </sentence><sentence id="468">Uh was a long, long journey. </sentence><sentence id="469">Many people, a number of people died from hunger and thirst. </sentence><sentence id="470">We arrived in a camp outside of Berlin in a town called . </sentence><sentence id="471">The name of the camp  7 was Saxonhausen. </sentence><sentence id="472">It was one of the largest camps in uh in Germany and my number over there...just to tell you how big...was 107,081. </sentence><sentence id="473">I was under the name the name of Salzman (ph). </sentence><sentence id="474">We were put in a barrack and the four hundred and fifty of us were assigned to work in a in a in a warehouse where iron devices like uh axles for trucks and so on were being stored and we were caused to move it and required to move it and assemble it and pile it and so on. </sentence><sentence id="475">I don't know that there was really any sense to it. </sentence><sentence id="476">It was hardness of the work...uh same thing again. </sentence><sentence id="477">Beating, hunger, uh uh rejection again. </sentence><sentence id="478">I know I'm kind of not emphasizing here...that I'm...but you know, we just was there. </sentence><sentence id="479">That's how life was. </sentence><sentence id="480">There was nothing exciting that happened from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="481">One got up and one hoped that it wouldn't rain and one hoped that the shoe which didn't have a hole in. </sentence><sentence id="482">One hoped that one got into line to to get one's soup. </sentence><sentence id="483">If one was at the right point in the line so when one got the the bowl of soup it wasn't from the top but was from the bottom of the of the of the container where there was a little bit more cabbage and these were the things that occupied our life. </sentence><sentence id="484">There wasn't anything dramatic or wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="485">Was just to survive to and little things in life were the kind of things that allowed us to somehow sustain ourselves another day. </sentence><sentence id="486">Uh if one uh was required to move a big piece of iron, one somehow tried to do utmost to have six people rather than four people, because four people carrying that piece of iron would be so much more difficult that one's ability to survive, to somehow carry another day, would be diminished. </sentence><sentence id="487">So I don't know what others say, but I must tell you those monontenous terrible days were were occupied by the by the compulsion to survive, by doing those little tiny things, you know, by somehow uh being able to find a needle to fix one's pants or to sew on a button because one needed this button to be warm and one needed the button to look orderly and proper, to not somehow be singled out by a guard who could use that for whatever purpose he wanted to use. </sentence><sentence id="488">After...at at the time, the time, the days passed one after another. </sentence><sentence id="489">There were...it was a terrible camp. </sentence><sentence id="490">There were French resistance prisoners, from the French resistance who were made to...they were being made to walk all day long in leg chains and and there were random hangings. </sentence><sentence id="491">There were other people in a in a prison uh company that were that were caused to march everyday with a new pair of German military shoes because they wanted to...when they issued the shoes to the German soldiers they wanted the shoes to be worn for at least one day so these people had to march all day long, and it was just...it was an awful camp, but after about a number of weeks, an announcement, an announcement was made that our group of about four hundred and fifty who were somehow identified as machine machine operators or or lathe (ph) operator specialists, was being shipped, was being sent to two different camps, one outside of Braunschweig. </sentence><sentence id="492">Now I...we just knew...1 I must tell you we are told we are being shipped to two different camps. </sentence><sentence id="493">I don't know that we knew at that time. </sentence><sentence id="494">I guess we knew that we...one group was going to go to Braunschweig and another group was being sent to a camp outside of Bremen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="495">And the way it was done that orderly would say well we need seven lathe operators to go here and five uh drill press operators to go there and because they allowed it that way rather than saying you and you go there, people that had some connection with each other, either because they were from the same town or because they knew each other, managed to stay together, and they would just be assigned and we continued going to work and about four or five days later there was a list posted  8 by number...all of us had numbers...I had this number that I said, 107,081, and there was a list posted of the people that were going to go to Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="496">I originally was supposed to go to Braunschweig and not that I had any knowledge of whether Braunschweig is better or not, but the people that I knew from before the war and some of the people I knew for a long time were going there and I just wanted to stay with people on whom one could count as a little bit of support. </sentence><sentence id="497">Well, I discovered that in the process of assembling the final list, there was some changes and about forty or so people were shifted and I was going to Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="498">Another person that was shifted with me was a young man who had a cousin by the name of Joe Senga (ph) that was allowed to remain in Braunschweig. </sentence><sentence id="499">I hope I'm not confusing it. </sentence><sentence id="500">Some of us that was supposed to go was shipped here and this cousin said I want to go with my cousin because we're just cousins and that's most unusual among those few survivors that that there was their cousins or brothers. </sentence><sentence id="501">Well, this cousin said uh I don't know what fate has for me. </sentence><sentence id="502">They assigned me here and I'm going to stay...I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="503">Well, anyway, after much ado and much suffering, Joe Senga and I changed uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="504">He put my uniform with your number on the side and so on and I took his uniform. </sentence><sentence id="505">He told me his name and his date of birth. </sentence><sentence id="506">He was incidentally born in Chemish too, but he was eighteen and I was sixteen at that time and he went to Braunschweig with his cousin...I'm sorry...he went to Bremen with his cousin and I, under his name, stayed with my friends and and town...fellow townspeople in that group that went to Braunschweig. </sentence><sentence id="507">Uh of that group of two hundred or twenty or forty that went to Bremen, only one survived I found out after the war. </sentence><sentence id="508">And all the others uh died and uh Senga who carried my name didn't make it either. </sentence><sentence id="509">Again, one of those lucky incidents. </sentence><sentence id="510">Lucky. </sentence><sentence id="511">One of those fateful incidents where, you know, I really didn't know which one was better, and I did it, you know, just for reasons to please him and to go with my...the people I knew. </sentence><sentence id="512">Our group of some two hundred and twenty...I would guess about twenty-five, twenty-eight survived and I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="513">None of the others. </sentence><sentence id="514">And I...remember I say twenty-five, twenty-eight. </sentence><sentence id="515">Maybe it was thirty-two. </sentence><sentence id="516">It was some small number survived and nevertheless I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="517">I was sent to camp in Watenstedt (ph) is the name of the camp, outside of Braunschweig. </sentence><sentence id="518">It was a camp of about twelve thousand prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="519">Uh we were the first and only Jews, about two hundred and fifty of us and that camp was attached to a factory in which they manufactured the casings for bombs and therefore there was a need for lathe operators and all that stuff and it was one of those...as as the war was going on, the time was passing, conditions were getting worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="520">There was much less food. </sentence><sentence id="521">The the guards were much more cruel and there was no clothing and anyway we we got there in October. </sentence><sentence id="522">I was now Joseph Senga, had a new number and my number was 107,028. </sentence><sentence id="523">I don't know why his number was smaller than mine and uh worked in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="524">Very hard conditions. </sentence><sentence id="525">Kapos, which were the trustees, were very cruel. </sentence><sentence id="526">They were...most of the people were uh from...well, there were no...very few Jews and people were dying like flies, either from hunger, from exhaustion. </sentence><sentence id="527">I have seen people arrive and be there for two, three weeks and then unless they were really hustling and competing, if they were trying to be some how accommodating of all the others who but all the other prisoners who by that time were very aggressive and would try to steal your bread or steal your soup just to survive, not out of villainy (ph), or they wouldn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="528">At one point there there were two French  9 people brought in who I was told were priests or bishops and they were just overwhelmed by the misery they saw around and were willing to share their food and they lasted two weeks and I'm not making any judgment about it but that's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="529">In January of...we got there in October...work in the factory, try to keep warm. </sentence><sentence id="530">We had very little clothing. </sentence><sentence id="531">We got wooden shower shoes and very thin clothing. </sentence><sentence id="532">In January of 1945 the factory was bombed by B-17's I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="533">It was a daylight bomb and it was on a Sunday and we worked all the time except Sunday afternoon was free. </sentence><sentence id="534">And it was bombed on Sunday afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="535">Was completely destroyed and at that point, from that day on...well, anyway, from that day on we worked rebuilding the factory, moving, building bricks, picking up pieces. </sentence><sentence id="536">It was just tremendous feel of gloom (ph) and also that night, the night of the bombing, snow for the first time, so when we went to work it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="537">It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="538">We had no gloves. </sentence><sentence id="539">We had no socks. </sentence><sentence id="540">We had no shoes and we just worked outdoors moving bricks and moving uh moving uh stones and I have and uh this was the time when most of the people died, just from cold and exhaustion. </sentence><sentence id="541">We would sleep two men to a little bunk and I remember sleeving...slee... sleeping with a young man whom I knew for about two, three years now whose name was Hoffenflack (ph) and at night when I woke up, he was dead, and I couldn't push him out of bed so I just slept there the rest of the night, but he was dead just from cold and not eating. </sentence><sentence id="542">Uh I need to go back for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="543">I said that in January when the factory was bombed...in mid-December, the times were already very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="544">There was very little food. </sentence><sentence id="545">Someone recognized that I have some artistic talent and assigned me to work for those kind of two weeks before Christmas in a uh carpentry uh shop in which uh toys were being made for the children of the guards, so I worked designing drawing horses and ducks and the carpenters would would uh cut it out and assemble it into something they could draw on a string and all that. </sentence><sentence id="546">At one point one of the SS officers came in and said to me we need a star to put on top of our Christmas tree and design one and have it painted, but don't make it make a five-corner star because it's communist or a six-cornered star because it's Jewish, so I had to design an eight-corner star because uh that's how I knew how to do it, you know, because I just remembered that incident. </sentence><sentence id="547">During that time when I work in the carpentry shop I was getting some extra food which I shared with a friend of mine, someone by the name of , Julius , who was somebody I knew from home. </sentence><sentence id="548">He was three  0 material because they had...and we tried to either fashion gloves or vests or something and they would search us and if we had any gloves made out of drapery material or vests, they would take the take it away from us or we would find paper sacks from cement and try to use this as something to keep warm. </sentence><sentence id="549">They would also take it away from us and we marched to work every day and every night when we walked back we would have to carry fifty, sixty dead people who died during the uh during the day. </sentence><sentence id="550">That is how it went. </sentence><sentence id="551">People were just dying, just dying. </sentence><sentence id="552">There was no hospital. </sentence><sentence id="553">There was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="554">People were just like flies. </sentence><sentence id="555">Uh those of us that survived uh again did the same thing and it it...there was no drama. </sentence><sentence id="556">There was nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="557">No no great things happened. </sentence><sentence id="558">There was no special danger. </sentence><sentence id="559">There was no special mercy. </sentence><sentence id="560">There was no...no one showed up to do anything good or bad. </sentence><sentence id="561">We just had to survive, day to day, survive. </sentence><sentence id="562">Find a piece of to  1 came outside and we had lice and we were dirty and we were just terrible and I came by a window and I saw my image in a window pane and I didn't recognize myself, and I saw that I was a mussulman already. </sentence><sentence id="563">I saw that I was not making it. </sentence><sentence id="564">After about three weeks in that camp they put us in a train again and shipped us someplace else and when we arrived there we discovered that the name of the camp was . </sentence><sentence id="565">It was a camp that  2 fire and uh then they took the German trustees out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="566">And we were kind of alone and I remember finding someplace three potatoes, because they...whatever supplies there were were no longer guarded by the German trustees, by the kapos, and cooking those three potatoes in the fire, baking and making little fires...others did it too...a little fire behind...and it was afternoon and then I hear noises. </sentence><sentence id="567">People running and shouting and I really didn't want to leave the three potatoes but I was concerned that maybe something bad is happening, and I was still, had sufficient instinct for survival that I needed to know what's happening. __ </sentence><sentence id="568">I couldn't walk very well and my head hurt. </sentence><sentence id="569">I and I I suppose maybe I was stimulated by that tank and which obviously was a friendly one, or at least unfriendly to the Germans, so I ran to see what all these people were running and there were Americans.
