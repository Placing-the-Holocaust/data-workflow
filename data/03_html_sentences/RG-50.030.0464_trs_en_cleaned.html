<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Oh yes, indeed, yeah, we did, and my father would -- on Friday night he would use -- you know, make a Kiddush, he had a good voice, which he was proud of, so he used it to full advantage, you know, to -- to sing a fancy, you know, Kiddush, and we had the usual chicken soups and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: -- Gefilte fish, and all that sort of thing, and he would ca -- take me occasionally to services, you know, and -- but -- but generally I don't think -- I don't remember him actually even using the daily prayer, the tefillin, you know, that you would use. </sentence><sentence id="200">I don't think he bothered with that, if I remember. </sentence><sentence id="201">So he was really going far -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: -- far away from the -- you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: So what was the Jewish commu -- were -- were you living amongst mainly Jews, or was it fairly mixed? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Yes, I lived on a street called Pilnikarska, which was several apartment buildings, almost close to the center of the city, and we lived in a two story building. </sentence><sentence id="206">The upper story was a set of rooms, and the business itself was downstairs, you know with the little factory there. </sentence><sentence id="207">And there was actually a stable with a couple of horses because the milk was being picked up at the railroad station early in the morning, so we had a couple of workers there, we had also workers in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="208">And most of the neighbors on our street were Jewish, was fair -- heavily Jewish because L'vov actually had a population of 110,000. </sentence><sentence id="209">Actually, later on it swelled to oh -- to a 150,000 more. </sentence><sentence id="210">So all a total population of 340, so it's only one-third, you know, was the third largest Jewish community i-in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="211">So -- so that was a very heavy population there. </sentence><sentence id="212">And so the kids that I would play with were mostly Jewish, wi -- you know, and -- and interestingly also that -- which we'll -- we'll get back to later, when I begin to assume a different identity, is that actually my native language was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="213">I like -- like families today, you know, where the -- first generation, you know, they speak Polish, and their parents speak Chine -- I mean peak -- speak English and the parents speak Chinese, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="214">Well, I spoke Polish, and of course, my parents spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="215">So I did understand everything they said, but I would always answer in Polish, which helped me a lot later on, because my Polish was very, very good, and very clean and very native Polish, unlike many others, who -- you know, from smaller towns, who did not have that -- that advantage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Now was this -- was this kind of thing fairly typical of the Jewish community, the kids were going to a public school, not a Jewish school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Public school, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: That was typical maybe of the larger cities like L'vov. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Not of the smaller communities so much. </sentence><sentence id="239">In the smaller communities they may -- may have gone to some public school, but they would also go to the cheder, you know, to study, you know, the Talmud, and the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: -- the [indecipherable] kind of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: And that -- and that you didn't do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: No, no, not at all, no, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Were there Jewish youth groups in L'vov, or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: There were some Jewish youth groups, I was very young, I didn't belong to any. </sentence><sentence id="250">My -- my brother did, you know, he was -- he belonged to organization called Betar, which was -- which I was kind of a -- unhappy about as I gre -- grow and understood because I was [indecipherable] to the right of center, you know, Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="251">But he was -- he belonged to Betar and -- and was fairly active in that. </sentence><sentence id="252">That wasn't -- you know, they had some uniforms of their own, all that. </sentence><sentence id="253">But that was early -- in the early stages, later on became much more difficult, even before the war, because the -- there was a lot of -- obviously some anti-Semitism that -- it was prevalent. </sentence><sentence id="254">And incidentally, L'vov also had a very, very high Ukrainian population. </sentence><sentence id="255">It was one third Jewish, one third Ukrainian, one th-third Polish. </sentence><sentence id="256">And L'vov being western Ukraine was a cradle of -- of Ukrainian nationalism and was a -- a lot of animosity between the Poles, and the Ukrainian and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="257">So the Jews basically, a lot of the Jews had a -- had a kind of a double -- double whammy, they were obviously hated by the Ukrainians and of course, a lot of the Poles were also, you know, anti -- anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="258">So -- so that was a big problem for the L'vov Jewish population. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: Did -- did you feel that as a child growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: I felt it occasionally, in public school, when sometimes a teacher would make some funny Jewish, you know, imitating Jewish words, or -- or one of the kids would speak maybe a little bit of a what I would call a Jewish Polish, you know, he would kind of make some f-fun of that and all that, but generally I did not feel a direct -- direct thing. </sentence><sentence id="272">I was never, you know, accosted or attacked or anything like that or -- or by -- by -- by other kids because we were pretty -- ina pretty heavily Jewish population where I -- where I lived, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="276">And do you recall your brothers talking about that at all? </sentence><sentence id="277">Ha-having any experience? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Well -- well, there were restrictions in getting to a higher education. </sentence><sentence id="282">You know, there were quotas involved and all that, and so my brother went to -- to a -- a commerce high school, you know, tried to get a degree there, and that didn't last very long, but my father -- my brother never mentioned any -- any overt or direct confrontations as such, because again, the Jewish community, even though it wasn't a modern city like L'vov, was still very, very closely knit, you know, and there was very little interaction, except for the -- some the servants that would work, or some workers that would come to work, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="283">So that was a -- a -- socially fairly isolated, I would say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: Would you have called yourself upper middle class, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: I would say middle class, maybe not upper, but middle. </sentence><sentence id="291">Certainly comfortably middle, not upper. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: How -- how did you find out that your parents were going to get divorced? </sentence><sentence id="295">Did your mother come to you, your father come to you, or they just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Well, I knew -- I knew that there were difficulties, I knew there were problems, and I knew when my mother took me with her to Danzig, to Gdansk, I knew that I -- that things were wrong, things were bad. </sentence><sentence id="297">My mother never told me directly that she was -- that she was going to be divorced, so sh -- but I found out si -- very shortly after, especially when my father began to look for another -- for a new companion, you know, to -- to try to remarry. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Did you resent that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Well, I did resent it to some degree, because he never told me that he would do that, and he married a woman who actually was a housekeeper, was 22 years younger than -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: -- he, and that was very, very hard. </sentence><sentence id="303">Tha-that -- I resented that he never told -- told us that, he came one day, left with her, and then he came back and says, "Well, meet your new mother." </sentence><sentence id="304">You know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Y-Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="311">Which was very, very hard, that was -- that was very hard, and -- and also the fact that he wouldn't support my mother, that -- that -- that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: -- that both -- that hurt, because I was living in a fairly comfortable household, and yet my mother was in a very small apartment, she had to -- she tried to do some physical therapy to earn a living. </sentence><sentence id="314">So that was very, very hard. </sentence><sentence id="315">Yeah, I -- I kind of never forgave him for that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="320">And I guess your older brothers also felt similarly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A: Oh very much so, because he really was very close to my mother, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: My -- the oldest brother was -- I wasn't very close to him because he was a little bit, I would say what you might call today, learning disadvantaged, or slow learning. </sentence><sentence id="328">Mordechai. </sentence><sentence id="329">And he basically helped my father in th -- in -- in the -- in the shop and in the s -- business. </sentence><sentence id="330">So I wasn't that close to him, even though he was a very gentle soul, I didn't have much to do with him, per se. </sentence><sentence id="331">But with Moshe who is now George, we were -- we were close, yeah, we quite often slept together, and you know, in the -- and of course our house -- our home was always full of visitors because you know, the big city. </sentence><sentence id="332">They would come from the small shtetl as it were, you know, and -- and visit the big city, you know, that was a big thing for them. </sentence><sentence id="333">So we had visitors because my -- my father had four brothers and one sister, spread in many places in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="334">None survived, incidentally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: None? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1021">End of Tape Two    Beginning Tape Three </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1024">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Michael, before I ask you about going into the -- the ghetto in L'vov, do you remember people selling furniture and bringing clothes and having to bring fur because the Germans were asking for -- they were -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: Well, it was mainly, mainly there was collections of that, you know, for -- from -- but mainly the Germans were much more interested in -- in -- in -- in money and jewelry and gold, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1027">Precious metals. </sentence><sentence id="1028">Art objects, you know, and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1029">Basic clothing, I don't remember that as being a priority for them. </sentence><sentence id="1030">But -- but it was a s -- just horrible in a sense that there was, you know, there was never enough, you know, there was constantly -- and what I think what the Germans tried to do is to get as much as they could before they -- before herding everybody into the ghetto, you know, because that was a time where they could actually grab things and you were not allowed to bring anything to the ghetto than what you can carry. </sentence><sentence id="1031">You know, there was no -- no carriages of any kind, or -- or bicycles, anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1032">Whatever you could car -- drag on your ba -- you know, hold on your back or suitcases and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1033">So there was no [indecipherable] like -- occasionally I think they may have been able to hire maybe a -- a -- a-- a Pole or a Ukrainian with a -- with a cart or something like that if they could a -- if you could pay for it, but generally you could see mass -- just procession of people just going into it with -- with their basic belongings. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1034">Q: How -- how did you find out that you were supposed to go into the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1036">A: All right, de -- there was announcements made, you know, there were pol -- you know, in -- in -- in Poland the basic announcement that was made was not made on the radio or anything that, they usually by -- by placards and by -- you know, they called aficias, you know, they put on -- on -- on kiosks, you know, on -- on walls and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And it was just an announcement made that as of that date, which was in November, everybody must -- must -- you know, they were -- they were establish a district, you know, which is down the Zulkeyewska- Zamarstynowska district, kind of a poor section of town, that everybody has to go into that area, that was the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1038">And -- and people were aware of the ghetto coming because there were ghettos already established in the other part of Poland, which was under the Germans for two years, you know, they started with the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1039">So that -- so it was not totally unexpected that you have to go into a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1040">But it was very traumatic because people just have to leave everything behind, you know, I mean even though they knew that -- they knew that they would, just the fact that they had to do it, and when you do it, when you leave all of your lifetime belongings, all your precious things, you -- you know, we didn't even have enough room for photographs, tha -- that -- I the -- there was no family photographs of when I was -- I remember I s -- I -- I had baby photographs, you know, like you know, with my bare bottom on a -- on a -- on a bare rug, and all these photographs taken as baby -- a ba -- and childhood pictures, nothing, I mean, because there -- because this was -- this was just a burden, you know, you had to -- clothing and -- and -- and whatever you could take with you, you know, you took, but you didn't take albums or -- or -- or - - or -- or books, or anything like that, you know, that was just a -- something that you couldn't -- couldn't handle even. </sentence><sentence id="1041">So that was totally lost, you know, all the family photographs, any kind of personal belongings, mementos, whatever, what you will. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1049">Q: So who made -- how much time did you have once you saw the notice? </sentence><sentence id="1050">Did you have weeks, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: They have about -- they ta -- they said originally I believe it was like 30 days or 40 days, 45 days, and I guess it was extended because they just couldn't handle all of it. </sentence><sentence id="1052">But by -- I would say by -- probably by mid-December, most of the -- most of the Jews were -- there were still </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1055"> some Jews left outside by papers, who had connections as it were, with the Judenrat or were specially singled out by the Germans as desirable to -- you know, to -- for want some work to be done, or -- or special work to be done and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1056">They were very selective about who they considered desirable and who not. </sentence><sentence id="1057">So -- so by, I would say, by the -- by the end of December or so, you know, close to that, most of the -- of the Jews were in the ghetto, but that was still left open, it was still open back and forth and -- and Jews with work permits could leave the ghetto, they wer -- worked outside the ghetto, they -- there were all kinds of laborer camps established, you know, within the city, to work for the German, you know, ni -- whatever it was, clothing manufacturer, all kinds of manufacturing. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Cause the Germans took advantage of every -- of every able body since all of their -- their men were in the army, you know, so they used Poles and Jews and Ukrainians, and -- for whatever labors -- requirements they had, or they felt was -- was necessary for the war effort, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1063">Q: Do you remember the day you left your house and went into the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1065">A: I don't remember the exact day. </sentence><sentence id="1066">I remember making two trips. </sentence><sentence id="1067">I remember one trip with -- with -- I mentioned to you, with my brother's grandmother, and then I came back and then I -- I may have gone maybe once or twice, you know, because you were able -- you were allowed to go in and out, you know, so you could make several trips before your domicile was empty and looted, or whatever, so you were able to -- to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1068">So I -- it may have been more than one trip, maybe several trips, bringing in as much as a -- you know, could by -- but by that time you see, there was no help, my brother was already in the camp, my -- my oldest was in the army, the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="1069">So there was just my father, Mose -- Genya, and -- and Helen, and then there was also a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1070">My brother's sister's son, Chana Koch was her name, from Tomaszow. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And so she was -- she was with us too, and so she kind of -- and she also spoke Ukrainian, and she kind of looked like a peasant, you know, with a kerchief. </sentence><sentence id="1072">You did everything to hide your -- you know, your identity, as it were. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And you took a chance by taking your armband off, and -- which I did several times, just to be able to move around, you know, to be more -- more -- more free. </sentence><sentence id="1074">And then eventually just ended up in the ghetto finally, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1086">Q: So how -- how were the decisions made as to what to take? </sentence><sentence id="1087">Or was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1088">A: Whatever you are allowed to take. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1089">Q: What -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1090">A: You were just allowed to take what you could carry with you. </sentence><sentence id="1091">And -- and if you could get some help, if you could get somebody to -- to -- to -- to -- to a cart, or he -- not your so -- not your own, but if you can hire somebody, and pay with whatever, with your watch or with your money, or with ev -- then they would do that, you know, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1092">Q: And you can bring more in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1094">A: Can bring more in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1096">Q: But now how -- how was it decided where you were going to stay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1098">A: Oh, that was basically you tried to -- my -- m-my father tried to find a place. </sentence><sentence id="1099">You tried to -- to get into the ghetto and locate a place, and we found a place which is like a -- an old house where we used a downstairs and another family used upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="1100">These were homes that were vacated, obviously by -- by the residents who -- who, you know, ventured out for much better quarters, and it was a good deal, you know, a good swap for them. </sentence><sentence id="1101">So there were a lot of them were just -- just left, even with some of the -- some of the old furniture, or old cots, or old, you know, straw mats, you know, mattresses and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1102">So we find that -- you know, you find that place that -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1108">Q: This is going to sound naive, but I'm -- | -- I -- 1 -- how does one just sort of say, well this is mine? </sentence><sentence id="1109">Do you put a sign on the door? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1112">A: Well, a -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1113">Q: [indecipherable] have it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1114">A: -- s-some of them were assigned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1116">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1118">A: And some of them, you know, some were just open and you just -- you just -- you just went -- got in there and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1119">Q: And stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1120">A: -- and took it, yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1122">Q: And the -- did the Judenrat have anything to do with the assignments of these places? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1124">A: Some of it did, I think they probably -- they -- they -- they tried to assign a lot of the people, able bodied workers, you know, into si -- into quarters that they felt were easier to access in terms of getting in -- you know, to f -- to work and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1125">So there were some -- some of it was by the Judenrat and some of it was a -- just on your own. </sentence><sentence id="1126">You just tried to find whatever you could on your own. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Because, you see, there was still a lot of movement available, you know, if you -- as long as you wore an armband at that time, you still could move. </sentence><sentence id="1128">You could move into the ci -- out and in -- out of the city and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Now, you had to have papers where you could have been stopped at any moment. </sentence><sentence id="1130">If you didn't have papers you were -- you'd have been taken away or shot or beaten up, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1131">You had to have work papers. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And the first thing that my father did, being entrepreneurial as he was, he got some work papers. </sentence><sentence id="1133">He never -- he didn't work, but he got the pap -- papers, he paid for them. </sentence><sentence id="1134">So he had always a work paper, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1135">Ar -- Arbeitschein, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1136">But he didn't work, no, no, he was able to get away with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1150">Q: Now, you said there were a number of times when you -- you'd leave the ghetto area, and take off your -- your badge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1152">A: Well, s-sometimes when I -- when I wanted to carry something, or -- or -- or get something, you know, like buy some -- some food or something, to be sure that I wasn't -- you know, that it wasn't taken away from me, I would take the armband off surreptitiously, and then once I was in the ghetto, I would put it on again, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1153">But I had to be very careful about that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I mean, if I had been spotted by somebody doing that, I would have been in real trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1155">But you know, again, when you're young, you -- you -- you -- you're fearless in a way, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And to me it was -- was daring and I -- I -- I mean, I feel like every time I would take it off, I feel like I - - like I vanquished some -- you know, like I was getting even, as it were, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1157">And I was proud of myself that I -- that I was able to do that, even though I was -- I was scared, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1158">So -- and -- so these are carn -- now -- now there is -- now I'm coming to a very, very traumatic experience, which is our very first close call in the ghetto, if may. </sentence><sentence id="1159">One day, the door burst open, a Ukrainian came in with his gun and said, "Come with me." </sentence><sentence id="1160">My father was away, he was doing something somewhere, was just Genya and Helen and I. Didn't allow to take anything with us, and was walking us to a transport. </sentence><sentence id="1161">There was a railroad station Zamarstynowska, and we know by the direction that we are going to a transport [indecipherable] there were -- at that time that was already starting to load people to wherever the destination they decided. </sentence><sentence id="1162">He -- and he pulled a gun, and with the gun he was walking us towards that. </sentence><sentence id="1163">That was one time when I felt it was -- was the end, was the beginning of the end. </sentence><sentence id="1164">Genya was holding Helen in her arms and started to speak Ukrainian to the guard, and begging him to let us go. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And she said, "For the fear of God, please let us go. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Look at this child in my arms, look at this young boy." </sentence><sentence id="1167">She said, "Do please let us go. </sentence><sentence id="1168">We don't," -- you know, "why -- why don't you do that?" </sentence><sentence id="1169">And then he spotted a gold watch on Genya's wrist, and he took the -- the watch and he said, "Go away." </sentence><sentence id="1170">We were about maybe 10 minutes away from the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Now that was one time when I cried, really cried, because I saw this poor Helen and Genya, and -- and I thought myself, what will my father do when he comes home and we're gone? </sentence><sentence id="1172">Cause this happened so often, you know, that a worker would go, you know, to a -- to a camp, to a labor camp -- these were workshops, you know, within the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1173">He would come home and -- and his family would be gone. </sentence><sentence id="1174">He'd never know - - you didn't know from one hour to the next. </sentence><sentence id="1175">You didn't know whether you would come back from work. </sentence><sentence id="1176">Because if you did something that they didn't like, didn't like the way you looked, or the way this, that was it, you know, they took you away, or -- or you never -- you d -- you disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1177">So this was one time when I really broke down. </sentence><sentence id="1178">So there's one -- one of many close calls. </sentence><sentence id="1179">But this was one that was a -- that was our really first call, especially with that gun drawn, you know, where we're facing, really facing -- and then we didn't even -- I didn't even know whether he was going to shoot us on the way to, which he could have easily done, because there were shootings all over, you know, I mean, it's almost like -- like hearing sirens, and the fire -- fire engines in New York City when you live in Manhattan, you know, after a while you just -- you just hear it, and -- and you don't hear it, you know, the gunshots and -- and -- and -- and screams, or whatever, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And -- so I thought -- I didn't know whether he was going to even bother with us -- taking us to the -- to the -- to the railroad station, to the yards, or whether he was going to shoot us right on the way to. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So that was really bad, that was really bad. </sentence><sentence id="1182">That was when I began to really, really began to feel the -- the -- the -- the depth of that -- of that -- of that atrocity, the depth of that -- of that human degradation, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1183">And that total feeling of helplessness, you know, totally -- totally helpless, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Totally at the mercy of -- of -- of a whim, of -- of a want, and you know, just as -- just -- just is -- is incredible when you think about it, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1185">That you could just -- anybody -- anybody that could just do whatever they wanted with you. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Whatever they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1187">With no restraint. </sentence><sentence id="1188">No restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="1189">So the life in the ghetto, you know, was -- was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Food was very, very scarce, people were starving. </sentence><sentence id="1191">My father, again, was able to scrape up things. </sentence><sentence id="1192">We did not -- maybe had one meal a day. </sentence><sentence id="1193">Frozen potato peels were at a premium. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Frozen potato peels. </sentence><sentence id="1195">The things that were discarded, you know, by the -- by the restaurants, or by the place, whatever, you know, by others. </sentence><sentence id="1196">But we managed. </sentence><sentence id="1197">We didn't starve to death. </sentence><sentence id="1198">I'd -- I was, you know, hungry at times, but -- but I didn't -- didn't really starve, per se, where I -- where I couldn't sleep because I was too hungry to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And -- and then there was a time, too, when my father establish a contact with a gentleman from Warsaw by the name of Zaremba -- Zaremba, who would come into the ghetto, and he would trade with -- in gold and in -- and in gold coins and all that, because the people trying to -- to buy -- be able to buy food on the black market, would sell whatever they could salvage of their personal jewelry, valuables, gold coins and sell it to [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So he would come into this -- to -- to -- into the ghetto, was still wide open, and my father would do business with him, you know, by trading, and then in some ways helping those people to -- to get money to be able to buy things, and also, of course, trying to make some money for himself. </sentence><sentence id="1201">So this Mr. Zaremba, that was the contact that I'm using -- mention [indecipherable] advisory, because that has a tremendous impact on my future survival, as it were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1254">Q: Before we go into the details of that, what is -- Eugenya -- is Eugen -- Eugenia or Genya -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1255">A: Oh Genya, [indecipherable] be called as Genya, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1256">Q: Was her voice -- when she talked to this Ukrainian guard, as calm as yours? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1258">A: It was a pleading voice. </sentence><sentence id="1259">I didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1260">I would -- I didn't know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1261">Q: So [indecipherable] yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1262">A: -- she was -- it -- it was a -- it was a really pleading, begging for mercy. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Just ya -- and saying to him, yeah I remember her say, "Boitishe Bokha," have fear of God, and I was appealing to his -- whatever religious, you know -- and they were religious, ironically, very religious, the Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="1264">That was the Ukrainian or -- Catholic Orthodox church, Catholic church -- Orthodox -- somewhat Orthodox -- Eastern Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And saying, "Please, please, let us go. </sentence><sentence id="1266">Why do you - - why do you n-need us? </sentence><sentence id="1267">Please let us go." </sentence><sentence id="1268">Says -- says, "Look at -- look at this baby here, and this little boy here." </sentence><sentence id="1269">And -- and he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1383">A: In L'vov. </sentence><sentence id="1384">Now I-I'm using this advisorly because -- because to -- to res -- to respond to your question about the strata of the social structure, there was -- there were all kinds of different structures, unlike the small shtetls where you had only maybe a few merchants and maybe a cobbler or something. </sentence><sentence id="1385">In the big cities they -- you had all classes of society, represented by the Jews, which is not ba -- maybe that well known. </sentence><sentence id="1386">So -- so as a result, these people who went into the ghetto were obviously the same -- same groups, of social groups. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And the ones that -- that -- that were poor obviously the ones -- the first ones to -- to -- too poor to die of -- of -- of -- of starvation, of san -- poor sanitation, of lack of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1388">You know, winters can be very se -- very severe in Poland, you know, it's got a severe, you know, si -- a kind of a -- you know, northern Canadian, if you will, climate, you know, like a climate of like a Winnipeg. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Very, very below zero temperatures. </sentence><sentence id="1390">In fact, I remember I got once frostbite, that was before the war, on my toes, just going to school and going back, because I -- because the school was closed and I insisted on going to school because I felt a sense of duty, I must go to school, I must go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1391">My parents insisted I don't go, well sure enough I went and by the time I came back, I had frostbite on two of my toes, you know, and I was sick for several days, you know, and long healing process. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So -- so that what happened, you know, the -- the ones that were -- and of course many [indecipherable] of the young men, maybe some of the poor [indecipherable] Jewish police of the ghetto, they felt that they could -- this is one -- there was one way of -- of also prolonging the survivals -- prolonging the -- the -- the -- the way of life, or trying to, you know, trying to -- to -- to manage not to be sent away. </sentence><sentence id="1393">So they were [indecipherable] they were policemen that they -- they used -- that they used by the Germans as Jewish police to keep order or carry out, you know, some of the orders that the Germans used, especially in rounding up people, you know, for -- for the labor camps and checking documents and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1430">He felt that they were just -- just being a mouthpiece for the Germans, or you know, trying to keep things together. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And so historically one could argue that perhaps they did help, you know, in some ways to prolong the -- the -- the agony as it were, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1434">Q: And did you notice people being selfish, corrupt, stealing from each other. </sentence><sentence id="1435">I mean, what did you notice about the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1436">A: Well, that -- ve been thinking about that all, and you know, I came to the conclusion that -- that a lot -- some of them just -- just trying to survive did some very unspeakable things. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Can you blame them for it? </sentence><sentence id="1438">I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1439">I don't know what I could really say that they did it on purpose. </sentence><sentence id="1440">They did it because they -- they felt that that --as that was one way of surviving. </sentence><sentence id="1441">And one of the things that I remember my father commenting about some of the Jewish police -- I didn't see it myself, but commenting, that actually they would, in rounding up old people, those </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1448"> are the priorities, getting the old and the sick and get ri -- getting rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="1449">That he actually saw it himself, that they were actually taking their parents and marching them off because they were told to round up old people and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1450">And that was -- I'm sure that was not done a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Was an aberration, but it only was a -- it was an example of -- of what can be done, how -- you know, to -- to the psyche of a human under -- under these terrible conditions, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1452">How it destroys any sense of -- of propriety, any sense of -- of reason and then -- and family feelings and you know, like that. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Self preservation, misguided, sick. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1501">Q: I mean even psychologically, not necessarily physically. </sentence><sentence id="1502">You say people didn't -- there was no humor. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Do -- do you remember your mood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1507">A: Well, my mood was basically one of -- of -- of anger, some fear. </sentence><sentence id="1508">Sometimes feeling of hunger, and basically also a feeling of loneliness, you know, I was -- I was -- I didn't have any friends, I didn't have anybody to -- to associate with, and I lost all my -- the contact with all my - - my playmates, my -- my classmates, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1509">So I was totally alone, you know, and when you're 13 years old, you need companionship, you need -- you need to -- to you know, you -- you want to -- to -- to play, you want to associate with somebody because you're not a grown-up, you know, you don't have much in common with the adults, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1510">So there was this feeling of isolation and loneliness, you know, this [indecipherable] living from one day to the next, not knowing what's going to happen next. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1554">Q: Where did the food come from when you went to Winniki, to -- to bring food to your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1556">A: Okay, now Genya would prepare some food, you know, she would make it and she would put in a -- ina cardboard container. </sentence><sentence id="1557">And then I would go out of the ghetto, the ghetto was still open at the time, and -- actually even with the armband, and I would go all the way out. </sentence><sentence id="1558">I would walk. </sentence><sentence id="1559">It was maybe 10 miles or so, but for a young kid 10 miles isn't that far. </sentence><sentence id="1560">Or more, maybe more, I'm not exactly the distance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1566">Q: One way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1568">A: But most of the time -- one way -- but most of the time it was not Winniki, it was -- it was actually -- in Winniki I think it was maybe once or twice, but maybe half a dozen times I went to the opposite direction, actually in the direction of the Janowska lager -- Janowska camp, I should say. </sentence><sentence id="1569">And there there was a quarry where my brother George was working in a -- with a group of other inmates, and as I said before, he -- by hand, you know, they were actually breaking up boulders and stones and crushing them to create the -- the -- the gravel for the -- for the roads because that's what the -- the Germans were always trying to keep their roads, you know, going, you know, for the -- for the armies, for the -- the troops and for the -- and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1570">So he was there, you know, and that was -- that was a terrible sight to see these men who were not -- you know, not even used to this hard physical labor, you know, they were -- to be able to all day long, can you imagine all day long standing there and -- and with hammers breaking -- breaking stones with very little breaks, you know, maybe four minutes at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1571">And like eight or 10 hours a day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1572">So many died, you know, my -- my -- my George relates the -- the -- the    fact that many who couldn't -- who were weak, you know, or cou -- or wou -- couldn't -- you know, couldn't make it, you know, were just shot and so I remember that, so that's why we got the food and that was -- that helped them a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1573">But then -- course when I -- when I left, and of course when they would -- they wouldn't allow food later on and he made some contacts with some local peasants where he -- they were helping him out a little bit too, but -- but he had a very, very rough time of it. </sentence><sentence id="1574">He had typhoid fever in the camp, he was almost shot because of that. </sentence><sentence id="1575">There was an outbreak of typhoid fever, which kind of decimated the camp that he was in and they brought in new people into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1576">So that's how -- that's what happened with the -- with that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1587">Q: Was it -- was it dangerous for you to walk on [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1588">A: At that time it wasn't that dangerous because the ghetto was still open, there was still a lot of communication. </sentence><sentence id="1589">And when I brought the food, at that time the guards allowed food. </sentence><sentence id="1590">They still allowed food at that early stage. </sentence><sentence id="1591">They just didn't bother, you know, with that, and I was a young kid, you know, so I just went over. </sentence><sentence id="1592">And -- and you can imagine what the other -- when they saw food, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1593">Of course my brother would share some of it with them, too, you know, because they were -- everybody was hungry there. </sentence><sentence id="1594">They gave them food but obviously nowhere near enough for the physical exertion and the fill of hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="1595">I mean you -- just incredible when you -- just the sight of those poor -- poor people doing that. </sentence><sentence id="1596">It was just like a deliberate way of -- of, you know, of killing them with -- with -- with -- with forced labor, because how much could they accomplish, you know, by -- by breaking up stones, you know, manually, you know, I mean there's just a -- we just -- but they did, you know, and they -- they built the roads and -- and my brother eventually ended up on a -- on a steamroller, you know, and so forth, he's a -- he has his own story to tell about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1696">At the bathhouse, one of the guys, he said, "Run away, run away." </sentence><sentence id="1697">Because they kind of -- there was another guard, there was one of the people there, because I was the kid, I was the youngest, there was nobody in my age in that group. </sentence><sentence id="1698">In fact, I guess they probably thought what is he doing here?

</sentence><sentence id="1978">With Warsaw English being clipped, sort of you know, short and clipped, whereas as you know the Brooklyn is the singsong and all those yishes, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1979">So they kind of identified almost the -- the L'vov Polish with Jews, with Jewish Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1980">And I caught this right away, they -- where they kind of started to kind of laugh at me, you know, they -- there's some jokes about that in Polish about the -- about the L'vov dialect. </sentence><sentence id="1981">And this was a dialect spoken not only by -- by, you know, lower classes, was just a -- a typical, you know, even -- even in the -- you know, in New York, a good New York English is not like a -- like a Midwestern English, even -- even the -- you know, among the intellectuals. </sentence><sentence id="1982">So I had to quickly learn the Warsaw dialect. </sentence><sentence id="1983">I was very conscious of that, I was very concerned because I knew I wou -- I was afraid that they may question that, that I may have -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="1984">And my biggest, biggest problem was again being circumcised. </sentence><sentence id="1985">That preyed on my mind virtually 24 hours a day, because when you live with young -- wa -- other boys, you know, and you associate with them, and you -- and you -- and you there, you know, boys tend to play games, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1986">They'd li -- sometimes they compare anatomies, you know, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1987">And I was very, very concerned about that because the minute that would happen, you know, I -- I often thought to myself, what would they do if they were to discover -- what would they -- what would they do. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And I didn't think that they would inform on me because they were very, very pate -- you know, Poles were very anti-German. </sentence><sentence id="1989">But they would definitely kick me out, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1990">I mean, they would not kick me, because I mean, they could be all killed for that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1991">Or maybe some of them -- maybe some of the, you know, workers would actually maybe even inform on me, because we lived in this place where there were -- at first there were three apprentices, and there were four journeymen as they called them. </sentence><sentence id="1992">These are the foremen, the journeymen, th-the ones that the -- that they knew their trade and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1993">And was hard to tell among them, who -- who would be, you know, who would be the one that would actually -- would actually denounce me or -- to the - - to the authorities being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1994">So that was constantly on my mind, and I was very concerned about that. </sentence><sentence id="1995">And fortunately I -- I -- we never got into that. </sentence><sentence id="1996">You know, I ended up with -- with only one. </sentence><sentence id="1997">There were two more boys, and there was one -- one apprentice by the name of Janek. </sentence><sentence id="1998">And he was kind of, you know, h-he -- he -- he was a little bit of a -- how shall I say?

</sentence><sentence id="2021">Except for my anatomy I was no more Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2022">And living in Warsaw at that time, I encountered a number of things -- that was even before -- before the following year, before the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2023">In other words, when you're on the streets of Warsaw -- after work, you know, | and this kid, we were just roaming around, you know, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2024">They had these -- the police was walking down the street and they would periodically stop people and ask for I.D.s and round-ups. </sentence><sentence id="2025">And what they were looking for basically is undocumented Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2026">They were looking also for resistance because Warsaw already had a strong resistance movement at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2027">And of course they're looking for Jews, or people that were trying to escape, Jews who tried to -- to -- to escape from the ghetto, who were -- were out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2028">And what they would do is -- oh, and incidentally, in addition to those placards which said harboring a Jew, you know, is -- i-it would be death penalty, they had placards showing how to identify a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2029">And they were showing -- presumably that was all developed by -- by this -- I think it was Rosenberg was the German guy who pr -- who apparently claimed that there are certain anatomical features in the Jewish face which are 100 percent Jewish, okay?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2549">A: Oh yeah, I -- I certainly did. </sentence><sentence id="2550">And -- and the interesting part too, speaking I -- I made a -- allusions to German, my German language. </sentence><sentence id="2551">I learned how to speak a broken German Polish, you know, just -- in other words, I -- just throwing in a word of German here and there, which was known that some kids would learn German in public school. </sentence><sentence id="2552">So instead of really speaking German the way I knew German, since I also lived in Danzig, you may recall, I would kind of speak a broken [indecipherable] German, which helped me also to get some bread, you know, from the Germans or some food when I had my -- my paper as a vol -- as a future volunteer, you know, in German army. </sentence><sentence id="2553">So that was also kind of -- I -- I kind of thought that was really funny in some times, because here I am trying to speak, straining to speak German, you know, a few words here and there, to ingratiate myself so I could, you know, get some food. </sentence><sentence id="2554">But then of course, trouble began again because the front was approaching. </sentence><sentence id="2555">Now, you may recall that the Russians deliberately stopped on the outskirts of Praga because the Warsaw uprising was not sponsored by the Communist Polish exiled regime, by the London regime, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2556">Which was -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2557"> which was the -- the -- th-the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2558">So they decided, and it's, I think, historically documented, to let the Poles kill themselves, you know, before they had their own Polish army, which is part of the Russian army, take Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2559">And of course, that was a complete catastrophe, disaster because of course the -- the Polish uprising finally failed, and the Germans regained, you know, the -- the -- the front and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2560">And while the uprising was finished by -- perhaps by beginning of October, started in August, the -- the pol -- the -- the -- the Russians began to advance towards the Vistula River, and we had to leave, you know, they had to evacuate all the civilian population. </sentence><sentence id="2561">And that's why really tough times started, too. </sentence><sentence id="2562">That was another period of great hunger for us, because we crossed the -- we had to cross the river, into -- onto the other side, you know, because the Russian was -- were advancing. </sentence><sentence id="2563">And that was still during the uprising it's se -- that happen, because the Russians were moving -- inching up. </sentence><sentence id="2564">And I remember like today, we are walking through a field and all of a sudden we saw these thousands of parachutes, what looked like thousands of parachutes, which was one of those big drops that the allied -- you know, the Americans dropped on Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2565">And as you know, 90 percent or more of it fell into the German hands. </sentence><sentence id="2566">That was one of those terrible, terrible blunders, you know, of the - - of the -- of this whole operation. </sentence><sentence id="2567">And wa -- where the -- where the Polish resistance hoped to get all of that -- all these ammunition supplies and the Germans got all pri -- virtually all of it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2568">And actually, we were wal -- as we were walking, we saw th -- the sky was almost dark. </sentence><sentence id="2569">There must have been thousands of these drop -- of the parachutes coming down. </sentence><sentence id="2570">So that was one -- another experience. </sentence><sentence id="2571">And -- and then we tried to walk from one village to another village, trying to get some food, we were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2572">In fact, I w -- the one episode is where we actually -- I slept on the cemetery, you know, on the na -- on the graves, you know, because we had no other place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2573">It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="2574">And -- and that was a very tough time. </sentence><sentence id="2575">We were very, very -- we had no </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2576"> food. </sentence><sentence id="2577">We maybe ate once a day. </sentence><sentence id="2578">Sometimes we would eat some -- some potatoes and -- and then -- and cucumbers there was [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2579">Q: And you were with Danka and her family [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2580">A: I was with the family, right, right. </sentence><sentence id="2581">The -- there was -- there was Danka and her sister -- younger sister. </sentence><sentence id="2582">The two oldest sisters went away and they -- they -- they went separately somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2583">And there were there just the parents and the -- and the two sisters and myself. </sentence><sentence id="2584">And there were other families, you know, sometimes we went a group together. </sentence><sentence id="2585">And sometimes the -- the -- the local farmers would take pity on us and let us sleep in the barn, you know, and there was no food, and -- and -- and I remember where there was a cow, soon enough the Germans came and took away the farmer's cow, you know, so there was no -- no milk, and -- and no food, so it was very, very tough. </sentence><sentence id="2586">And that lasted through that period of -- of -- of December and January, just the begin -- towards the end of December, and one night we wake up and who do we see? </sentence><sentence id="2587">Russians, on their trucks, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2588">Then I said to myself, okay, I'm alive. </sentence><sentence id="2589">I made it. </sentence><sentence id="2590">I made it. </sentence><sentence id="2591">January 1945 is when Warsaw is liberated, finally, after being totally wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="2592">And I never told the family that I was Jewish, but I did tell Danka that I was. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And she wasn't shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2594">Was surpri -- I would never -- she may have been s-surprised. </sentence><sentence id="2595">But I soon realized that actually this was not a -- a true lang -- lasting romance. </sentence><sentence id="2596">You know, she was older than I, and what was infatuation was not really a -- a real -- something that it was going to last, even though I would, if she were willing, I probably would have want it to last, maybe, at -- at that time, anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2597">And -- and there were different Russians from the Russians that were, you know, retreating in -- in 1941, I mean, those were victorious Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2598">And they were trying to give out food, and finally got -- we got some food from the -- from one of the -- some of the Russians, they were friendly. </sentence><sentence id="2599">They could -- they recognized right away the -- what the -- they didn't know whether they were Jews, necessary, but they -- they could see they're -- they're refugees and just hungry, starving people, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2600">So -- so that's how -- how I ended being Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2623">Q: And became Mundek -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2624">A: And became Mundek Wertman again, you know, later on. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2625">Q: But you had no papers to say that you were Wertman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2627">A: [had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="2628">I had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="2629">They had to take my word for it, the Jewish authority, Jewish agency, you know, had to take my word for it. </sentence><sentence id="2630">My first notion was obviously to try to find family. </sentence><sentence id="2631">And the movement of the front was such that the -- there was constantly Russians driving back and forth in their trucks, so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2632">So I left the fam -- the -- the -- the Bozym family, jumped on one of the trucks and just went east, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2633">And my intention was to go to Lublin because L'vov was already taken over by the Russians there, and they had a border, you know, they -- they -- they did not let people in, so L'vov became -- you know, they annexed L'vov to the -- to the Ukrainian Republic, even at that time they already established a -- a border. </sentence><sentence id="2634">But I knew I had an uncle in Lublin, one of my father's brothers, who had a bakery. </sentence><sentence id="2635">And of my father's four brothers and a sister, I only knew two of the -- of his siblings. </sentence><sentence id="2636">One was the uncle in Lublin, and the other one was the sister on to -- Tomaszow, because when I was a little boy I would visit her. </sentence><sentence id="2637">The other three brothers I never met. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And they were spread out, you know, in different parts of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And I remember checking into Lublin, and already at -- by that time -- and it may have been weeks -- few weeks after, they already had some established now, the Jewish agencies started to -- you know, to help out, you know, in establishing a registry of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2640">There was the HIAS, H-I-A-S, and the AJDC, you know, it [indecipherable] agency. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And there was a registry and I went into this re -- first | was asking about my uncle and they said no, he is de -- he is -- he is not al -- he perished, you know, they didn't have any record of him. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And then I checked with the registry and lo and behold I see my father's name. </sentence><sentence id="2643">I see Genya's name, I see my brother's name, I see Helen's name and I see my cousin's name, my -- my -- you know, my cousin's. </sentence><sentence id="2644">I just couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="2645">I thought maybe this was registry of the dead, not of the living. </sentence><sentence id="2646">And they had an address there, and I went there and sure enough, there was Genya, and there's Helen. </sentence><sentence id="2647">And my father wasn't in on that day. </sentence><sentence id="2648">And that was the first time that I took a real bath in I don't know how many years, three years, four years, a real bath, because I was really dirty. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And -- and then I found out the story as to how my father survived, and how my brother survived. </sentence><sentence id="2650">And I didn't know anything about my mother. </sentence><sentence id="2651">There was no -- no -- no record of it until -- much later I found out what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="2652">And the way my father survived was that before the ghetto closed in July, I believe -- in June, I believe, in 1943, when the ghetto was closed, just before it closed, my father arranged with a Polish vegetable gardener to be hidden. </sentence><sentence id="2653">And of course he paid them money for it. </sentence><sentence id="2654">But he had some money stashed away, he would pay monthly because he was afraid to give him up front because the guy would probably spend it and -- you know, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2655">And for 18 months my father didn't see the sun, the daylight. </sentence><sentence id="2656">He was hidden there with Genya, Helen was given away, and with that cousin, with this Chana Koch, in a small area, was like a cubicle. </sentence><sentence id="2657">And was given food maybe like once a day or something. </sentence><sentence id="2658">The gardener would bring food. </sentence><sentence id="2659">And in that same building there were German railroad workers that actually lived in that building. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And they were separated just by a very thin wall from the places where the German railroas -- railroad workers would congregate and -- you know, and have fun and have their -- their drinking parties and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="2661">So he had to keep very, very quiet when the workers were there. </sentence><sentence id="2662">There was no sanitation, there was no toilet. </sentence><sentence id="2663">They just -- whatever water they could get, they would use that, and -- so -- so they ha -- instead of using -- using a toilet, you use something else and then get rid of it at night, da -- in the dark of night. </sentence><sentence id="2664">My brother George was fortunate he was able to live outside the camp itself because he was on a steamroller that I mentioned before, working it. </sentence><sentence id="2665">But towards the end of the -- he knew what was going on because he was outside, so he could hear the -- what they were talking about, th-the guards and the -- the Germans and the Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="2666">He knew that the camp was going to be liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="2667">And he happened to know where my father was hidden because one of my father's friends, who had happened to be a Ukrainian, had some contacts [indecipherable] in the camp, you know, and he was -- communicated with him, so he knew where my father was. </sentence><sentence id="2668">And on the night that he was going to be -- when the camp was liquidated they were taking -- he escaped from the caboose of that steamroller while the Germans were waiting outside, asking to get dressed, he escaped through a rear little window -- it's on -- on -- it's on his tape -- and ran away and hid, you know, for a couple nights, and joined my father -- was able to join my father in that hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="2669">And he was with my father for a full year, until liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And the -- and -- and wa -- L'vov was liberated, I believe in July of "45. </sentence><sentence id="2671">No, not in July of 45, I'm sorry, no, no, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, cause the war ended in May of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="2672">It was liberated I think it was in -- if I'm not mistaken it must have been in the -- I have it written down. </sentence><sentence id="2673">I think in July of "44, possibly, deg44.He -- so they -- that was a very tough time for them, but they managed to survive in this hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="2674">And -- and what happened is they moved to -- to -- to Lublin, my father, you know, moved to -- moved to Lublin after -- after the -- the liberation, and established himself there -- tried to establish himself there. </sentence><sentence id="2675">And one of my cousins, who was a partisan in one of the forests of -- near Lublin, which was not far from Tarnogrod when my mother was there, he knew that my mother died in a -- in a mass shooting, liquidating the small remnant of that Jewish community in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2676">1943. </sentence><sentence id="2677">She worked as a nurse, apparently and then that -- so that's how I found out, cause he was one of the survivors, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2733">A: Right, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2734">These were very chaotic times and -- a-and just -- just -- just th-the remnants of the survivors and the chaos and the -- and the -- trying to find survivors, trying to look for survivors and -- and as | said before, you know, my father had four brothers. </sentence><sentence id="2735">They all were married, had children, and for the -- the two cousins, one cousin my father's brother's son, and they -- my father's sister's daughter were the only two other of the family that acta -- that s -- that survived of my father's family. </sentence><sentence id="2736">So -- so that was -- you know, of course, we all looked bad, you know, kind of emaciated and -- but fortunately not in terribly bad health at all, you know, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="2737">And when I heard of my mother's death, you know, that was very hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="2738">I was really -- it's kind of a -- hit me very hard. </sentence><sentence id="2739">Especially in the light of the fact that if she had stayed with my father, if my father didn't divorce her, because he did it, she would have survived. </sentence><sentence id="2740">You always think about that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2741">And she was so young, 38 years old, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2742">She was very good to me. </sentence><sentence id="2743">Bright, intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="2744">Very socially aware. </sentence><sentence id="2745">My father accused her of being a Socialist, which was -- was the strongest insult he could use, you know, cause he was obviously not. </sentence><sentence id="2746">And she st -- he always accused her of being too free thinking. </sentence><sentence id="2747">Too -- too -- too sympathetic to the -- to the strikers, to the laborers, you know, to the workers, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2748">So -- so that was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2749">That was a bitter pill, especially in the light of our very bad relations with the stepmother, you know, it was -- it was very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2750">That has caused me a lot of anguish. </sentence><sentence id="2751">And you never forget that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2752">And on the top of it all, after many years when my father separated from Genya, and they didn't live -- for [indecipherable] years they were separated, he would say, "If I could only bring your mother back alive." </sentence><sentence id="2753">And you know, I mean that was, you know, if I could only do that. </sentence><sentence id="2754">So, after so many years he had regrets, as it were, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2755">So it was -- it was pretty hard. </sentence><sentence id="2756">But -- but it's ancient history now. </sentence><sentence id="2757">Maybe not so ancient for those who still remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3327">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3329">A: Maybe some pocket money and food, that's about all. </sentence><sentence id="3330">See, I -- I had to get a salary, not very much, but I get a -- got enough, so I lived fairly comfortably then, and -- and then it -- where I began to re -- slowly began to feel maybe I'm getting back into a normal mode of life. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And then my father was sponsored by someone in Canada -- you see, you ha -- you still had to have sponsorship, which is kind of really tough because -- because on one hand here you're s -- you're a survivor and then you have to wait for a year -- or for two or three years, which is terrible, I mean that's something that I -- was very hard for me to understand as to why -- why these -- you know, the Canadian, American [indecipherable] people at that time were so reluctant to bring these people in, even though you were carefully checked medically, you know, if you had tuberculosis they wouldn't let you out, you had to be treated, and blood tests and all kinds of things because they didn't want to obviously bring in sick people into -- into the country, into Canada or the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3332">But you had that waiting period and these people in the -- in DP camps, while -- while it was a far cry from being in a ghetto, still 1 mean, they were -- they had food and they had some clothing, but that's about -- you know, they didn't have -- there was no work, you know, per se. </sentence><sentence id="3333">And there was just like waiting, waiting to -- to -- to -- to emigrate, and many of them I guess had to be absorbed, and then -- and then maybe in European countries and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3334">So this was -- it was going on for a number of years. </sentence><sentence id="3335">Because when I left -- left in 1950, when I emigrated Canada, the DP camps were still ac -- still -- still in existence. </sentence><sentence id="3336">So that's another aberration if you will, of -- of history and some sense that -- that these people were still sort of second class citizens, even though they were -- many of them were Jewish survivors and many of them were -- were others, you know, other nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="3337">So my f -- I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
