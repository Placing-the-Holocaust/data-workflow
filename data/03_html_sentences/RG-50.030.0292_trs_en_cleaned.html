were the 10,000 that were -- they -- they liquida -- so they actually cut by one-third, right away, the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="911">This was also in conjunction with the burning, and with the -- of the small ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="912">You see, when the ghetto was instituted, they had the large ghetto, and they had the small ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="913">What was the difference? </sentence><sentence id="914">The difference was that one main thoroughfare, one main road, run through the -- through the ghetto, between the small and the large. </sentence><sentence id="915">And what they did is -- what they -- what they did is they instituted a -- they built a bridge from the large ghetto to the small ghetto, which was also surrounded with wires, and that was

</sentence><sentence id="919">And one day what they decided is that -- that they felt that -- apparently that they don't need a hospital, and they don't need no sick people. </sentence><sentence id="920">So what they did is they surrounded the hospital, they surrounded that with haystack around. </sentence><sentence id="921">They poured gas. </sentence><sentence id="922">They nailed the doors

id="923">And right after that they had the -- the big aktia(ph), and then they -- they eliminated completely -- this small ghetto was completely, those few people who still were there were evacuated,

to -- to get out and get out as soon as possible because every -- every day was a matter that -- we knew exactly that -- what our fate was going to be. </sentence><sentence id="2054">So truthfully, we didn't have too much to risk because one way or the other way, I mean, we would -- we would not be able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2055">So I went to see my uncle and I told him that -- and

ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="2069">Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one, some meters, one behind the other one. </sentence><sentence id="2070">When we came through a -- through a -- with a bo -- to a place where we had to cross the highway, there was one person with a -- with a bicycle, and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lithuanian. </sentence><sentence id="2071">And suddenly he came out and approached us, say, stop, documents. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Raise your hands. </sentence><sentence id="2073">So when he did that, we start running in different directions. </sentence><sentence id="2074">It was only one person and we knew that he might shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2075">Besides that, his aim was not too good because I felt -- when I run, I felt like, a couple bullets passing me and then I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2076">I--I---I really ran like never in my life, and then I threw myself in the cornfield. </sentence><sentence id="2077">I know also that later on when I was laying there for quite a while, I know that they -- they had some -- some people with horses try to locate somebody, and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2078">But I, during nighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw ble -- flickering lights. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2079">And I say to myself, without these -- would that be headquarter -- would -- would that be quarters for the Germans or some barracks or something? </sentence><sentence id="2080">Then I stepped  Interview with Abe Resnick " September 22, 1994 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2081"> away and I found myself close to a small, small woods. </sentence><sentence id="2082">And there I slept over the night. </sentence><sentence id="2083">It was really -- it was a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with leaves and some other things. </sentence><sentence id="2084">And there was a little -- a little -- 1 wouldn't say a river, but it was little place with -- with water. </sentence><sentence id="2085">And then I -- I was hiding behind the bushes. </sentence><sentence id="2086">In the morning, I heard some voices in Russian, and I -- I watched that, and I saw that there -- there, a woman came and she -- apparently two friends, but one stayed with a -- with a metal thing, you know, what they -- they put here -- put in cloth. </sentence><sentence id="2087">And she started washing right there in this -- where there was li -- this was not even like a river, but it was a place that I remember that I had drunk water. </sentence><sentence id="2088">I had my hat, so with my hat I used to take and -- and -- and drink the water. </sentence><sentence id="2089">Because food was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2090">I -- I used to collect some -- some berries, you know, from wild berries, and this was my food. </sentence><sentence id="2091">So I was desperate. </sentence><sentence id="2092">I was very hungry and this woman was washing and I said to myself, let me -- let me approach her. </sentence><sentence id="2093">And I spoke perfect Russian, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2094">So I came out. </sentence><sentence id="2095">I said, look, I'm -- I'm escapee, and like you should help me with some food. </sentence><sentence id="2096">So I was not sure whether she was going to go -- first of all, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2097">I asked her what was there in this -- in this place, where I saw the flickering lights in the night. </sentence><sentence id="2098">And she said, no, that's a camp, a civilian ca- camp for civilian Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2099">An intern camp for civilian Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2100">But then she told me that she is going to come back and bring me some food. </sentence><sentence id="2101">And I -- I thought to

I'm an old, you know, the -- and I explained to her that I'm a refugee, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2104">And so she said to me, look, we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who -- who fled, and who are hiding in our -- in this -- in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="2105">And they also are going to -- they are planning to go to join the -- the freedom fighters, the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="2106">And where they are going? </sentence><sentence id="2107">They are going to Janava, Janava, Belder(ph), that used to be Janava, the forest of Janava, which was not too

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2113"> 104 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 exactly a certain spot. </sentence><sentence id="2114">First of all, th-the Russian prisoners were not treated

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2115">But of course, this -- that was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="2116">So he took us to the forms -- forest at one point and he -- then we met about three

top -- topographic plan, and they had all rolls. </sentence><sentence id="2119">So they said that they have received some supplies from -- from parachutes that they -- and they had some assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going -- if they are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do certain sabotage -- sabotage work. </sentence><sentence id="2120">We spent about, I would say, maybe about close to 20 days moving around from one spot to the other one, because we didn't want to stay in one spot. </sentence><sentence id="2121">And on few occasions -- I was not trained, I didn't -- I didn't know anything about -- about ammunition or anything. </sentence><sentence id="2122">They have done, basically, the work. </sentence><sentence id="2123">And the -- in -- in different cases, I was the look out. </sentence><sentence id="2124">They used me to be the look out. </sentence><sentence id="2125">They had some -- some light arms and knives basically, and they had some back packs with -- with ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="2126">We spent, I would say, about four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2127">And one -- one day, we heard a movement. </sentence><sentence id="2128">We put our ears -- normally, what we used to do is, we used to put our ears to the grounds, so we can detect -- that's a way of  Interview with Abe

that some -- based on our imaginations, some tanks. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And now we saw about three or four German tanks rolling not too far away, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2133">And then about a couple hours later, we heard some shootings, and an exchange of fire. </sentence><sentence id="2134">And this whole neighborhood vicinity became like a -- like a -- like a military, I mean, hell. </sentence><sentence id="2135">Because bullets and flying out the -- in the shrubs, and saw burning -- burning bushes and all this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2136">It was an incredible, incredible exchange of fire. </sentence><sentence id="2137">Then, it lasted for about an hour, an hour and a half, and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2138">Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, now we are going to be killed by -- by friendly -- by friendly -- our friendly power -- gun power. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Suddenly, it quietened down. </sentence><sentence id="2140">It was quiet like nothing -- I mean, like -- like nothing ever -- anything happened, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2141">And I say to the -- to one of Russians, I say, what -- what would that be? </sentence><sentence id="2142">I mean it's -- it's too quiet, I mean, we got used already to the -- to the -- to the -- to the incredible sound of -- of -- of explosions, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2143">And then suddenly we heard again, we put -- the Russian put his -- he put his ear on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="2144">He said, something is happening. </sentence><sentence id="2145">It's -- it's quite apparently, but something is happening. </sentence><sentence id="2146">And, like 45 minutes later, we heard -- we heard some movement of, like, troops. </sentence><sentence id="2147">Not too many. </sentence><sentence id="2148">And then we saw the first Russians approaching us. </sentence><sentence id="2149">And the first question was -- the first question was, have you seen  Interview with Abe Resnick aa September 22, 1994 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2150"> some tanks? </sentence><sentence id="2151">I sort of, yeah, we saw quite a few hours ago. </sentence><sentence id="2152">And he said, no, these tanks already finished. </sentence><sentence id="2153">Have you seen some other tanks? </sentence><sentence id="2154">And we say, no. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Right away it was -- I was amazed, you know, because right away I -- I was approached by -- by one of the lieutenants. </sentence><sentence id="2156">I think it was a captain, not a lieutenant -- captain, because he had three stars, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2157">It was a captain, and he -- he actually told me </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2158"> that -- he looked at me and looked at me and says, are you Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="2159">I say yes. </sentence><sentence id="2160">So am I, he said. </sentence><sentence id="2161">Okay, we embraced each other and he -- right away what he did is, he told us -- he said, look, this is the front line, and the line might change, because we don't know what -- what -- what -- what is ha -- what can -- what is going to happen a few kilometers from here. </sentence><sentence id="2162">My advice is, and what I want to see you, is to the till. </sentence><sentence id="2163">Till is towards the back, towards the [indecipherable], you know, towards the back, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2164">And right away, he called a-- a --a soldier and he said, take these guys and take them over. </sentence><sentence id="2165">And -- and in meantime, we was already approaching some Jeeps and some -- some other -- some other military units. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And he told us to move as far as possible towards the back. </sentence><sentence id="2167">He said, you went through already, it's sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="2168">I mean, it's -- and th-this was the -- this was actually the -- the -- the way that we -- so happy. </sentence><sentence id="2169">I mean, the first time we felt like -- felt like liberated, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And then he asked me -- another guy that he referred me to ask me some question. </sentence><sentence id="2171">He said me whether I want to join the army, or I want to do. </sentence><sentence id="2172">I said, no, no, first what I want to  Interview with Abe

id="2174">He said, that might take still a few days or -- or it might still take some -- some time. </sentence><sentence id="2175">So we were with the army for about -- I think about ten or 15 days til they have to [indecipherable] Kaunas and to liberate it. </sentence><sentence id="2176">I went right away to the -- to the -- to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2177">The ghetto was exploded. </sentence><sentence id="2178">Everything, all the houses were exploded. </sentence><sentence id="2179">They have -- some people came out from the hiding in some places. </sentence><sentence id="2180">Some people came out from hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2181">I went to this place where we were hiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs. </sentence><sentence id="2182">But supplies and other things that we had in -- in our -- in our house, and in the ground was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2183">It was like, everything burned. </sentence><sentence id="2184">And right away I went to -- to Kaunas. </sentence><sentence id="2185">This was Slobodka. </sentence><sentence id="2186">I went to Kaunas, I got myself -- right away I met with this officer, that he told me that he is going to -- he is -- I mean, that he is going to be coming to Kaunas, and he gave me a number where I can -- I can reach him. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And he told me that if I have some -- some kind of desire of some -- something. </sentence><sentence id="2188">I said, yeah, I would like to have -- I have some -- I have some relatives here, and I would like to see whether I can find them. </sentence><sentence id="2189">Where -- where are there -- I -- I am sure --I felt they were very optimistic. </sentence><sentence id="2190">I said maybe there are some relatives that I have. </sentence><sentence id="2191">And I start floundering around for quite a few days. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And then I found a family, that we were together in the ghetto and then later, they went to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="2193">But I used to send them  Interview with Abe Resnick ee September 22, 1994 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2194"> packages when I was in there -- when -- just a minute -- that I send them packages after, when I -- when I -- when I was in the army. </sentence><sentence id="2195">They -- I helped them to find a place -- a living place because the -- the city was -- was devastated, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2196">There -- there was not too many -- too big fights in the city, but it was many have escaped and left behind themselves apartments with furniture, and you know, like -- the same way like when the -- when the -- when the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="2197">So right away I found a --a friend of mine, who told me that if I would like to serve -- to serve in the -- in the Russian army because, due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium, and I speak the -- I speak Lithuanian, German, and -- an-and Russian, so I would be a good prospect. </sentence><sentence id="2198">He se -- he told me that there is coming a -- a group of -- a--a group of people to -- of military men to take some -- to take -- to -- to -- they are looking for some inper -- interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="2199">They need very badly people who speak Lithuanian and Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2200">Basically German is not, at this point, is not important, but it's going to become important later. </sentence><sentence id="2201">And at the same time, they promulgated a law that all these people from this and this year, they are going to be -- they are going to be from 1924, 1925, 1926, they are going to be taken to the army -- to the regular army. </sentence><sentence id="2202">And I say to myself, I would rather serve in a specialty unit than -- than to wait and then be recruited to the army. </sentence><sentence id="2203">They have like a place where they called wayan(ph) komat(ph). </sentence><sentence id="2204">This is a-- a--a military place, whereby they check out new -- they  Interview with Abe Resnick " September 22, 1994 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2205"> check out prospective soldiers, you know, health-wise and whether they have TB because there were many with -- with TB, you know, from those that survived. </sentence><sentence id="2206">So I actually signed up for this -- for this unit. </sentence><sentence id="2207">I remember a younger captain came in and -- and interviewed me and he was satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="2208">And then what he told me that he is going to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation -- military preparation of about six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2209">And I agreed. </sentence><sentence id="2210">In meantime, he told me I can -- I can stay there and he gave me a official paper where I can go and find myself a--a---a apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2211">So I found my relatives,

my relatives were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="2213">They had two children and -- and myself and I told them, look, I am going to be just here, and only temporary, and I am --I am going to be
