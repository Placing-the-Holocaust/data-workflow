<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: If I could just ask you, you were saying as you were making your way to your home town you would see Jews coming out of hiding and you know after all you had gone through in all those years of the war, I'm wondering if you could describe a little more, do you remember how, you know how you and your husband would react when you would see that. </sentence><sentence id="75">And how you would feel inside. </sentence><sentence id="76">And would you have encounters with these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Yes, it was a very chilling experience. </sentence><sentence id="81">The cities were mostly desolate. </sentence><sentence id="82">And there weren't too many people walking around the streets because the Germans had just passed through. </sentence><sentence id="83">We would come to a town where maybe there was a square. </sentence><sentence id="84">And on the square people would congregate. </sentence><sentence id="85">And somehow, we always felt who it was Jewish or not. </sentence><sentence id="86">These people were completely different. </sentence><sentence id="87">I mean living in Poland and knowing the Polish people, we knew how the Polish people behave and how they look. </sentence><sentence id="88">These Jewish people were like they are coming out from hiding. </sentence><sentence id="89">Their heads were down. </sentence><sentence id="90">They were sad. </sentence><sentence id="91">They still had the frightened look in their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="92">They were probably hiding someplace. </sentence><sentence id="93">Whether in the underground or being hidden in some kind of a shack you know. </sentence><sentence id="94">They did not appear like the other people do. </sentence><sentence id="95">And we kind of looked the same way I guess. </sentence><sentence id="96">And commonly we just like you know like dog to dog. </sentence><sentence id="97">We had something that pulled us to each other and we started to talk and it's the word to approach somebody was Am Who. </sentence><sentence id="98">Am Who means in Hebrew Am is Nation and Who meant are you from the same. </sentence><sentence id="99">And somehow we saw these people. </sentence><sentence id="100">We saw quite a few of those people. </sentence><sentence id="101">And Interview with Lucine Horn 4 we just rejoiced in seeing each other, but there was the sadness of having lost everything. </sentence><sentence id="102">So that was more or less what happened but we didn't stay on. </sentence><sentence id="103">We just kept on going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: So you didn't talk to them very </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Well we just briefly talked to them but everybody was just engaged in searching and doing his thing and we couldn't wait to get home. </sentence><sentence id="131">We had a knapsack and we were tired from walking and not sleeping and, and you know took us maybe ten days or two weeks to get to Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="132">Once we got to Lublin there was a Jewish organization and they were registering all the people that were coming back home. </sentence><sentence id="133">A lot of it was a great influx of people from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="134">And Russia allowed these people to come back. </sentence><sentence id="135">And there were some people coming out from, very few from concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="136">The majority from Russia and also some that were sent to Germany for work. </sentence><sentence id="137">Like the able bodied, not Jewish looking, females mostly. </sentence><sentence id="138">Because males could always be checked out for being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="139">Because of circumcision. </sentence><sentence id="140">So we met quite a few people, acquaintances and when we went to register ourselves at this Jewish committee, we found that nobody that from our families had been registered so we kind of already thought that there's nobody there from the family. </sentence><sentence id="141">But nevertheless we tried to establish ourselves in Lublin because we just didn't' know what to do with each other. </sentence><sentence id="142">And people were constantly coming. </sentence><sentence id="143">It was like every day when we went out to a town square you could see a few people coming here and there. </sentence><sentence id="144">And of course being a small town, maybe somebody that you knew. </sentence><sentence id="145">So some friends and acquaintances came. </sentence><sentence id="146">And some were in more need than others. </sentence><sentence id="147">Some were fighting with, on the Russian front and were wounded. </sentence><sentence id="148">Some were in very bad shape physically so we tried to help each other. </sentence><sentence id="149">Also none of us had anything. </sentence><sentence id="150">And my husband met some family, he met </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="172"> Interview with Lucine Horn 5 sometimes, he met an uncle that our experience with him was not very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="173">And he tried to help us at the beginning but then he was very busy with his own life, personal life. </sentence><sentence id="174">I don't want to get into it. </sentence><sentence id="175">So actually we were alone. </sentence><sentence id="176">And we just couldn't find a place for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="177">My husband wanted to go back to medical school. </sentence><sentence id="178">He was third year medical school and he just didn't know where and how. </sentence><sentence id="179">And the climate in Lublin was very unpleasant because the Poles were not happy that some Jews survived. </sentence><sentence id="180">And they were making some very nasty remarks. </sentence><sentence id="181">And I was confronted with this tremendous Polish anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="182">Mostly because I did not appear to be Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="183">And if people met me on the market, or on the street car or bus they would make these remarks to me that oh they are coming back from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="184">Hitler didn't kill them all. </sentence><sentence id="185">And in such a climate I just absolutely could not live even a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: What would you do when you would hear remarks like that. </sentence><sentence id="201">Would you </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Well let me tell you about a very particular encounter because where we lived, we lived always where the Aryans lived, we did, never lived in so called Jewish quarters. </sentence><sentence id="203">Cause my mother was a practicing dentist and we had a lot of Gentile patients and where we lived was almost a Gentile neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="204">And in the same building where we lived was a lady that was running the laundry service. </sentence><sentence id="205">And she had like a cleaning store. </sentence><sentence id="206">And right after the, right during the war, when the ghetto was finished and we ran away from the ghetto, my mother left a lot of things with that lady. </sentence><sentence id="207">Silver candelabras, all kinds of art objects. </sentence><sentence id="208">Things that were of value. </sentence><sentence id="209">Thinking that if anybody survives and needs the money to sustain themselves during the war, we would just go to her and get this stuff and be able to sell it. </sentence><sentence id="210">I knew all about it because my mother told me where these things were. </sentence><sentence id="211">I knew that I have these things with that lady. </sentence><sentence id="212">So I </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="224"> Interview with Lucine Horn 6 tried to get some things together and we knew that we have to go to Warsaw because Warsaw is a big town and nobody knows us. </sentence><sentence id="225">And I have to buy some false papers and we have to just go out. </sentence><sentence id="226">So I went to her like in an afternoon and this woman knew me since practically I was 4 years old. </sentence><sentence id="227">And when she came in she says oh my god where are your parents and she started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="228">Where is your brother and she was crying and crying. </sentence><sentence id="229">And then I said to her, can I get the things that my mother left with you. </sentence><sentence id="230">And she said oh it's all in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="231">If you come back at 2:00 P'll have everything ready. </sentence><sentence id="232">Well needless to say I came back at 2:00 and the Gestapo was there waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="233">Her cousin was working for the Gestapo, he was a secret agent. </sentence><sentence id="234">And I had a terrible, I don't want to get into it now but I had a terrible encounter with these people. </sentence><sentence id="235">And practically cost my life. </sentence><sentence id="236">Somehow, I got out of it. </sentence><sentence id="237">And after the war I just couldn't forget it. </sentence><sentence id="238">So when I came back to Lublin, there was you know a committee of crimes and, you could really talk about these things. </sentence><sentence id="239">Especially show people that were hostile in doing these things. </sentence><sentence id="240">And I went to, over there to first of all I showed my face to her. </sentence><sentence id="241">And when she saw me that I survived, I knew this woman practically almost dropped in what she saw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Can you still remember it today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: Yes, I can remember it and I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="263">My memory is still good. </sentence><sentence id="264">I can remember what she looked like and she just was very, very upset to see me. </sentence><sentence id="265">And I just said hello to her and I said and I remember what you did to me. </sentence><sentence id="266">And I left and then I went to this place which was run by Poles. </sentence><sentence id="267">But don't' forget that Poland was communist at that time. </sentence><sentence id="268">and it was Burjon Bespeki Vespechaestva and I talked to people there and I asked them what I can do. </sentence><sentence id="269">To this woman. </sentence><sentence id="270">Because she practically not only cost my life, but I was taking care of my little brother and my Interview with Lucine Horn 7 husband and they were completely helpless without me. </sentence><sentence id="271">And if something would happen to them I mean they could have never survived without, I was their outside contact. </sentence><sentence id="272">And they told me that there's nothing they can do because I have to have witnesses and if I don't have any witnesses I should just forget it. </sentence><sentence id="273">So I was very upset and then we stayed for a while in Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="274">And the situation was just very bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Let me just ask you, what did you want to have happen at this point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Oh I wanted her either arrested or to have some repercussions. </sentence><sentence id="292">I knew for what she was doing to me, she was probably doing to others and she could have been even doing it to the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="293">But nothing did happen. </sentence><sentence id="294">And we just tried to get our life together. </sentence><sentence id="295">We couldn't so because there was no money and I could not be in Lublin for too long because every stone and every home reminded me of my past. </sentence><sentence id="296">And reminded me of my parents and I just couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="297">That was in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="298">I was 19 years old. </sentence><sentence id="299">And we decided that we were going to try to leave Lublin because there was no use of waiting for anybody. </sentence><sentence id="300">We registered. </sentence><sentence id="301">They could find us. </sentence><sentence id="302">And my husband found out that the university that he attended before, he had no papers, everything was lost. </sentence><sentence id="303">That the university's moving from Lwow. </sentence><sentence id="304">Because Lwow was taken by Russia that they moved to Blievitz which is a German town. </sentence><sentence id="305">That Poland took over ok in the exchange for the eastern part of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="306">A little bit to the west was given to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="307">So we decided that we going to go, try to go there and see if he can get into the university cause that was the most important thing for us. </sentence><sentence id="308">He we got to Blievitz and as it turned out we spent there about 3 or 4 months and it turns out that the university is not coming there, but they are going to Breslau which was a much bigger Interview with Lucine Horn 8 university that they took over from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="309">The town and that university from Lwow with all the professors were coming back to Breslau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: And Breslau is in Germany or Poland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Now it's in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="333">Now it's called Breslau. </sentence><sentence id="334">It used to be German. </sentence><sentence id="335">So after living for about 3 or 4 months in Blievitz, we went to Breslau. </sentence><sentence id="336">And in October of that year, my husband met with some professors that knew him. </sentence><sentence id="337">And he was able to get in for 3"! </sentence><sentence id="338">year medical school. </sentence><sentence id="339">We considered ourselves very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="340">I tried to get a job and somehow sustain ourselves you know in order for him to continue but we knew it's not going to be on a long time basis, because we did not want to live in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="341">That was just an absolute N O. We felt that we just cannot live ina country that hurt us so much. </sentence><sentence id="342">And the memories are too painful and if you want to start a new life, it has to be someplace else, not in Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: There you are right after the war in this place, as you say where all these horrible things that happened and you say there were memories everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="355">I'm wondering it's just so hard today to imagine being in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="356">I wonder if you could describe a little more what your day to day emotions were like. </sentence><sentence id="357">Would you say today that you were depressed or would you cry. </sentence><sentence id="358">Would you turn a corner and see a certain place. </sentence><sentence id="359">I'm just trying to figure out what that would feel like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Well when we were in Lublin it was indescribable how painful and hard. </sentence><sentence id="367">Because to give you an example to add insult to injury was the fact that the Poles were so hostile. </sentence><sentence id="368">Would we have been embraced by the people that we knew and that we grew up with and with people that also </sentence></p><p><sentence id="369"> Interview with Lucine Horn 9 suffered, but not to that extent. </sentence><sentence id="370">It would have been maybe half way bad. </sentence><sentence id="371">But the hostility was just so tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="372">My best girlfriend was pregnant 9 months. </sentence><sentence id="373">She came into Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="374">Her husband was killed on the front. </sentence><sentence id="375">That now this is this woman giving birth to a child. </sentence><sentence id="376">The first child born after the war. </sentence><sentence id="377">In a Catholic hospital. </sentence><sentence id="378">And the nurses just damned this baby. </sentence><sentence id="379">God damn, Hitler didn't kill them all. </sentence><sentence id="380">We have to have a Jewish child now . </sentence><sentence id="381">It can't be helped. </sentence><sentence id="382">I mean this was just unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="383">But after we left Lublin I knew that we had to be strong to survive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="384">And the emphasis was mostly on survival and how and what to do. </sentence><sentence id="385">All the survivors were trying to just find a way, whether to go to the United States or emigrate or go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="386">Illegally but do something for yourself because here you are already surviving the war. </sentence><sentence id="387">And you got nothing but your life, nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="388">And now it's up to you to know which direction to take and which way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="389">It's like you're on an island and you want to save yourself. </sentence><sentence id="390">It was a matter of not saving your life, as much as knowing what to do with yourself. </sentence><sentence id="391">And because we had this one direction that my husband wanted to finish school. </sentence><sentence id="392">He didn't want to go into business. </sentence><sentence id="393">The easiest thing to do was to smuggle and to sell. </sentence><sentence id="394">Everything was still chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="395">So I just knew that we had to, that looking past is one thing and being hurt in it is another. </sentence><sentence id="396">But it's not going to help emotionally because you see we were very young and when you're young you're strong. </sentence><sentence id="397">You take life in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="398">And I just knew that we had to go on, make some right decisions and push forward and we were among people who had the same goal. </sentence><sentence id="399">Fortunately we were surrounded by students and academic people who had the same goals and wanted the same thing out of life, rather than making money and maybe amassing some fortunes by some illegal dealings and so forth. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="400"> Interview with Lucine Horn 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: It sounds like what you're saying is the survival that the drive for survival you developed during the war, it never let up. </sentence><sentence id="402">You just stayed in that condition. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="403">A: Definitely. </sentence><sentence id="404">Definitely. </sentence><sentence id="405">The power of survival even for people that were in concentration camps which I never was and even people that saw their dearest slaughtered, there is a certain think in the human nature that really wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="406">And you know and I cannot talk about it to other people, but this is what we felt. </sentence><sentence id="407">| And I knew that I have to help my husband and I gotajob. </sentence><sentence id="408">We gota little apartment and I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="409">And, in Bratswath, in Breslau and he went back to school. </sentence><sentence id="410">And we knew it's only temporary but we knew that he has to wait a year just to get his papers. </sentence><sentence id="411">Cause once he gets all his papers that he finished 3 years medical school, maybe wherever we go, to any country, he's got at least something to show. </sentence><sentence id="412">And maybe he'll be able to continue. </sentence><sentence id="413">So that's exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="414">We were in Breslau. </sentence><sentence id="415">We lived there almost a year. </sentence><sentence id="416">He finished medical school, third year, got all the papers and then we decided out. </sentence><sentence id="417">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="418">We really have to sever all our, our relationships with Poland and just erase it from our lives and just go on. </sentence><sentence id="419">And we had no gall. </sentence><sentence id="420">We didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="421">It was very hard at the time, you know to make any, any sense was, with your plans. </sentence><sentence id="422">But then we joined a Zionist group which was a student group. </sentence><sentence id="423">There was about 25 Jewish students, Zionist oriented and we thought that maybe if we go with a group it would be easier for us to be recognized wherever we go. </sentence><sentence id="424">Rather than one individual person. </sentence><sentence id="425">So with a knapsack, the BreiHa was helping Israelis, were helping the Jews out of Poland in that time. </sentence><sentence id="426">In a semi-legal way. </sentence><sentence id="427">Meaning that if you went to the border, to Czechoslovakia there maybe would be trucks there waiting for you and then taking you maybe to Italy or someplace, but it was all kind of semi-legal without any guarantees and with these papers in his hand, on with a knapsack and with very little money we decided to try and we went Interview with Lucine Horn 11 with this group. </sentence><sentence id="428">And there was maybe about 25 of us. </sentence><sentence id="429">We got into Czechoslovakia and then from Czechoslovakia, they took us, this BreiHa, they took us to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="430">Because Vienna was a big concentration of refugees and the American Joint has been sponsoring a lot of places. </sentence><sentence id="431">And it was like a transit place, is for people that were coming out of Poland and coming out of concentration camps, trying to go other places. </sentence><sentence id="432">And there was an awful lot of people at that time in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="433">And Vienna was occupied by all four, but the Americans had a great hand in deciding what to do at that time. </sentence><sentence id="434">And as we came to Vienna, we were aided already by the Joint Distribution Committee to and they, they really encouraged us not to go any further because they said that they would like to help the students. </sentence><sentence id="435">And they might have a way for the Austrians to allow these peoples to study. </sentence><sentence id="436">Under pressure, without tuition because as a, as a part of a reparation of what happened to these people. </sentence><sentence id="437">And that really happened. </sentence><sentence id="438">The Americans helped us to get into the university, get a very small stipend from the United States. </sentence><sentence id="439">Not to pay tuition at the university. </sentence><sentence id="440">We had to, of course, qualify. </sentence><sentence id="441">There was all kinds of Latin examinations and everything to go through it. </sentence><sentence id="442">And have some papers to show. </sentence><sentence id="443">But it was an opportunity for my husband to continue and he fell for it right away. </sentence><sentence id="444">That was 1946. </sentence><sentence id="445">October. </sentence><sentence id="446">They helped us with some living quarters. </sentence><sentence id="447">Of course it was very crowded and we had to share rooms and things. </sentence><sentence id="448">But most of the people were single. </sentence><sentence id="449">There was only another married couple. </sentence><sentence id="450">And us. </sentence><sentence id="451">And we were helping each other. </sentence><sentence id="452">You know and Vienna at that time also had no food. </sentence><sentence id="453">Everything was rationed. </sentence><sentence id="454">So you got a little bit of this and a little bit of that. </sentence><sentence id="455">You put it all in one pot and we had some soup at night. </sentence><sentence id="456">We felt kind of good about it because we knew that we had a goal. </sentence><sentence id="457">We knew that we're doing something for our future. </sentence><sentence id="458">And it wasn't very unpleasant because the Jewish student at that time, we came with a small group. </sentence><sentence id="459">But there were 400 Jewish students at that time in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="460">And we were all supported by the Americans through the Austrians that had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="461">  Interview with Lucine Horn 12 And we were a great group of people. </sentence><sentence id="462">And we spent 4 years there. </sentence><sentence id="463">It was kind of very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="464">Even though we didn't have any money, but Vienna is a wonderful place to live. </sentence><sentence id="465">Even so we felt that we never forgot that they were connected with Hitler and they

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: It, it differs a lot. </sentence><sentence id="670">Some of my friends went to Paris because they had uncles in Paris and they wanted to be with their family. </sentence><sentence id="671">Family was a big factor. </sentence><sentence id="672">Whenever somebody had a family they were really flocking to be with their family. </sentence><sentence

they had all kinds of social studies and other things where it would be very hard to apply it in a different country. </sentence><sentence id="682">You know. </sentence><sentence id="683">We were fortunate because medicine is almost similar or the same all over. </sentence><sentence id="684">So it was all different. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="685">The majority of, of our students went to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="686">Whoever had a chance not to go, opted probably to go someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="687">Some went to South America if they found sponsors. </sentence><sentence id="688">If they had maybe some relatives. </sentence><sentence id="689">Now my husband knew that when he will go to the United States he will have to repeat the whole thing and

Israel. </sentence><sentence id="695">And I knew that if I go to Israel I would go home. </sentence><sentence id="696">But I myself was very worn out from the war. </sentence><sentence id="697">I couldn't' take the burden of being a pioneer again and Israel was at the pioneering stage at that time. </sentence><sentence id="698">and maybe it was selfish on my part. </sentence><sentence id="699">But don't' forget that I was 13 when the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="700">I was the one that had to earn the living. </sentence><sentence id="701">I had the one that had to go to

burden, burden surviving. </sentence><sentence id="707">And I just couldn't' see myself. </sentence><sentence id="708">The thought of, of being shot or the thought of, of having the Arabs there doing all the things that they were doing at that time in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="709">There were still wars there. </sentence><sentence id="710">You know there was the 46 war and there was the 48 independence. </sentence><sentence id="711">And then there was another war. </sentence><sentence id="712">The thought of being in another war or, or hearing the shooting again. </sentence><sentence

id="718">But I have to have a rest. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="719">I just cannot do it anymore and he understood. </sentence><sentence id="720">He said ok let's try. </sentence><sentence id="721">We'll see how it works out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="722">We will you know we were in agreement. </sentence><sentence id="723">It was </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: He wanted to go to Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="725">A: He wanted to go to Israel because the thought of being

the hospitals there. </sentence><sentence id="728">You know private medicine was not there. </sentence><sentence id="729">I mean they never had private medicine. </sentence><sentence id="730">It was all socialized medicine at that time. </sentence><sentence id="731">But you could get a job and you would have to do things. </sentence><sentence id="732">And the thought of him to study another language and starting all over again it wasn't possible. </sentence><sentence id="733">But he gave in to, he knew that I just couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="734">He would have a basket case. </sentence><sentence id="735">As long as I was holding up it was ok. </sentence><sentence id="736">But I just couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="737">I was a child. </sentence><sentence id="738">And I said, I had such a burden and I needed, I needed some space. </sentence><sentence id="739">So he decided that we'll come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="740">And of course I had the full support of my family who really wanted us to come here. </sentence><sentence id="741">And my uncle sent affidavits and papers and we waited until my husband finished school. </sentence><sentence id="742">And we couldn't wait because ten days later we were already trying to get on our DP status and Interview with Lucine Horn 17 just take off and leave. </sentence><sentence id="743">And when we left Vienna there was still a lot of kids that didn't finish. </sentence><sentence id="744">Don't' forget he was one of the older students. </sentence><sentence id="745">So he there were kids that stayed and it took them longer to finish or even medical school longer. </sentence><sentence id="746">They were just starting at Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="747">He came in

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: How did you come over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="776">A: Well that was another story. </sentence><sentence id="777">You see we were DPs, displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="778">And displaced persons were being shipped to the United States on army transports. </sentence><sentence id="779">Ours was general Bletchford. </sentence><sentence id="780">And general Bletchford was supposed to be a transporter for 400 soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="781">We were 1200 people. </sentence><sentence id="782">And we were going in the middle of November and we had to be taken first from Vienna to a place in Bremerhaven. </sentence><sentence id="783">And there we waited, 3,4,5,6 weeks in a camp until these ships were bringing people over to the United States, back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="784">And there were maybe three or four ships but at that time there must have been 6, 7000 people waiting there in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="785">And of course we had to undergo a tremendous medical, physical examination because anything with a spot on your lung, right away you were ejected. </sentence><sentence id="786">It wasn't like today that people coming with TB, AIDS and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="787">It was unbelievable what kind of medical scrutiny we had to undergo. </sentence><sentence id="788">In order to be able to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="789">We waited about three or four weeks in Bremer and then finally we got on this ship. </sentence><sentence id="790">The voyage was so bad that we almost didn't make it because the, the ship was old and we had, we were 1200 people. </sentence><sentence id="791">The food was absolutely not, not even to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="792">And look it was for free, so I mean there was the bunk beds and everything. </sentence><sentence id="793">We just had to go. </sentence><sentence id="794">And we went to Halifax Canada. </sentence><sentence id="795">We had 400 Interview with Lucine Horn 18 people for Halifax Canada. </sentence><sentence id="796">So first we went, it took us about 12 days. </sentence><sentence id="797">First we went to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="798">Got off these people, that, that were for Canada and they all had papers and sponsors. </sentence><sentence id="799">And we had ten dollars but we had a whole big crate of medical books that my husband couldn't' part with. </sentence><sentence id="800">But became obsolete in a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="801">He had two microscopes that he wouldn't part with. </sentence><sentence id="802">And very little personal belongings. </sentence><sentence id="803">I have to mention that my uncle was very generous and he tried to help us during the our stay in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="804">He was very impressed with the fact that my husband wants to study. </sentence><sentence id="805">He felt it personally that he wants to help him, although he never met him. </sentence><sentence id="806">He was, my husband was the only one from the whole family that he was helping and trying to bring over here that showed any interest in, in his, in being a professional man. </sentence><sentence id="807">And he tried to help us as much as he could. </sentence><sentence id="808">He used to send us money through Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="809">My aunt used to send clothes and warm coats for me or whatever they could, they really did for us. </sentence><sentence id="810">It wasn't easy to send stuff over there but they were very nice and very generous. </sentence><sentence id="811">So that made our stay in Vienna much nicer. </sentence><sentence id="812">And we finally arrived at the United States. </sentence><sentence id="813">Well my first impression of the free world was 3:00 in the morning in Halifax in the harbor, seeing a seven or eight year old boy in the middle of the winter all bundled up selling newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="814">And trying to, to tie up the paper to a rope and throw the paper with the rope over to the ship. </sentence><sentence id="815">And then these people were, whatever people had was probably dollars because nobody was going with Austrian money. </sentence><sentence id="816">Then the people would in turn tie the dollar to the rope and throw it back to him. </sentence><sentence id="817">I never saw that before. </sentence><sentence id="818">I came from a well to do home and I really haven't encountered anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="819">And all I knew about the free world are things are so wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="820">I mean the idea of in Europe at that time was actually that in America people are finding money on the street. </sentence><sentence id="821">You know and you were very gullible. </sentence><sentence id="822">The thought of that boy at 3:00 in the morning just never left me. </sentence><sentence id="823">And that was like 50 some years ago. </sentence><sentence id="824">I said does a boy that age at 3:00 in the morning has   Interview with Lucine Horn 19 to sell newspapers like that. </sentence><sentence id="825">And he was very, very pushy. </sentence><sentence id="826">And people were dying to have a paper even so they couldn't read it. </sentence><sentence id="827">You know. </sentence><sentence id="828">But then we arrived in New York. </sentence><sentence id="829">And of course my family was waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="830">Also we didn't' know each other but we had all kinds of signs, with red carnations and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="831">And it was very cold in New York. </sentence><sentence id="832">New York was not very pretty at that time. </sentence><sentence id="833">It was very windy and we were just absolutely worn down. </sentence><sentence id="834">From this horrible, horrible trip. </sentence><sentence id="835">And everybody was taken to HIAS which was the Hebrew aid organization but my uncle did not want us to be there. </sentence><sentence id="836">Because living circumstances were kind, kind of hard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="900">Q: Can I ask you, do you remember or do you have any first impressions or memories of when you came into New York Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="901">What was that like. </sentence><sentence id="902">What time was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="906">A: Yes, first of all it was Thanksgiving so already on the boat we had turkey. </sentence><sentence id="907">And I didn't know anything about Thanksgiving and just one good meal was fabulous. </sentence><sentence id="908">And they were telling us the crew on the dock, that they were telling us it's Thanksgiving. </sentence><sentence id="909">And that's a holiday the Europeans don't' have. </sentence><sentence id="910">And I cherish this holiday til this very day and every time I have family for dinner we always talk about Thanksgiving because this is our anniversary of coming in. </sentence><sentence id="911">And, and unfortunately it was also Saturday or Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="912">We couldn't get off the ship but at least it wasn't shaking any more. </sentence><sentence id="913">You had to wait for the customs for Monday morning. </sentence><sentence id="914">There was all kinds of people with us you know. </sentence><sentence id="915">There were very religious people which were coming in with crates of china for holidays and china for, for meat and china for milk and china for this. </sentence><sentence id="916">And it was really funny when the customs opened up those crates and asked them and they really didn't understand what was going on because china in Europe, especially good porcelain was very    Interview with Lucine Horn 20 inexpensive and these people apparently had money and they tried to bring it all to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="917">I mean I didn't' have this problem. </sentence><sentence id="918">We had books and two microscopes. </sentence><sentence id="919">But it was very funny when these people tried to explain to the customs how they had this ritual. </sentence><sentence id="920">Of not eating from the same dishes you know all the time. </sentence><sentence id="921">And then of course it was gloomy. </sentence><sentence id="922">It was dark. </sentence><sentence id="923">But my aunt came and took us to a little hotel for which my uncle paid for. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="943">Q: I'm just curious and maybe this is just me from seeing, reading about immigrants and seeing these films. </sentence><sentence id="944">You always have this image of the boat coming in the harbor and the Statue of Liberty appears. </sentence><sentence id="945">And all that. </sentence><sentence id="946">Did you see that. </sentence><sentence id="947">Do you remember that at all. </sentence><sentence id="948">You're shaking your head. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="955">A: It was so windy that at that day when we arrived a brick fell from some big building and killed a person. </sentence><sentence id="956">You know. </sentence><sentence id="957">It was just a very gloomy unfriendly day on the 27" of November. </sentence><sentence id="958">And it was so mammoth to us. </sentence><sentence id="959">I mean New York. </sentence><sentence id="960">Just so mammoth. </sentence><sentence id="961">I've never. </sentence><sentence id="962">I lived in Vienna which is a big city but this was just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="963">And of course the language barrier too. </sentence><sentence id="964">I took a few, knowing that I'm going to be in the United States, I already took a few courses. </sentence><sentence id="965">At the University. </sentence><sentence id="966">But that's a differ, that's a different English. </sentence><sentence id="967">Maybe in London I would feel better with it. </sentence><sentence id="968">And because among all these people that came off the boat I was the only one that knew a few words of English, I always had people with me, trying to go wherever I go because my uncle got us a hotel room. </sentence><sentence id="969">But the meals, we were supposed to go back to the HIAS 3 times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we had to travel by bus. </sentence><sentence id="970">| And we had to find our way from the hotel to 425 Lafayette Street which I still remember you know. </sentence><sentence id="971">And there was some other people that stayed in the hotel and every morning and every afternoon I would have these Interview with Lucine Horn 21 cohorts with me and the taxi drivers were very unfriendly. </sentence><sentence id="972">When I asked them which way we can walk or can we take the bus, they said no if you take a cab we'll take you there, but they were very unfriendly. </sentence><sentence id="973">And while we were in the HIAS every day some American Jews tried to come in and ask us if we want to rent a room, communicating in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="974">And also because at the HIAS there were people from all over the world, Jews. </sentence><sentence id="975">Speaking all different kind of language. </sentence><sentence id="976">Well we encountered that in Vienna too. </sentence><sentence id="977">There were Romanian Jews and Hungarian Jews and they were Latvian Jews and Polish Jews and you know Jews just don't' get along very well. </sentence><sentence id="978">Everybody has a different culture. </sentence><sentence id="979">Everybody grew up in a different place. </sentence><sentence id="980">And there was a lot of fighting between them. </sentence><sentence id="981">And then all of a sudden a lot of people came with little children and the grownups had to look either for an apartment or for a job or anything. </sentence><sentence id="982">The children were completely lost and they needed a nanny for those children. </sentence><sentence id="983">So they got me to work with these children. </sentence><sentence id="984">Every day I would go there in the morning and have my breakfast in this mess hall. </sentence><sentence id="985">My husband would go to, to Park Row which was the physicians committee who was trying to find internships and residencies through the United States for these Jewish doctors, providing that a community would offer for about 2 years or so assistance, monetary assistance to these people because these people could not work. </sentence><sentence id="986">And some of them had families. </sentence><sentence id="987">So they had to find a community that wanted to support this given doctor while he is in training. </sentence><sentence id="988">So my husband had to go there in the morning and I was working at the HIAS with these children. </sentence><sentence id="989">And because I speak a few languages, I could communicate with these children. </sentence><sentence id="990">And for that I was compensated with $25 a week. </sentence><sentence id="991">Well that was already very good because with the $25 a week we could go to a movie and listen to English. </sentence><sentence id="992">First of all it was a great thing to go and listen what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="993">We also bought a radio because we were putting in quarters into a radio at the hotel and that paid for 20 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="994">So we figured out well it's an American idea you know. </sentence><sentence id="995">You put in Interview with Lucine Horn 22 a quarter and the radio plays for 20 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="996">We, we it took us time to figure it out but we wanted to hear. </sentence><sentence id="997">They told us just to listen to the spoken language. </sentence><sentence id="998">So finally we decided to buy a radio. </sentence><sentence id="999">We bought a radio for $25 and we listened to our own radio. </sentence><sentence id="1000">So we, we made an investment but we didn't have to put in the quarters any more. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And we just waited. </sentence><sentence id="1002">It was a waiting game at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Going to the hotel, coming back, getting a little bit acquainted with the area. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And of course my aunt and

id="1753">Because he still couldn't' get a permit to stay in New York state and get a license and he really wanted to get a license in New York state because he already had a lot of doctors that wanted him to work with them. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And we already knew a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="1755">And he did want to get licensed from New York State and they were

maybe he work on a salary to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1761">And we didn't want to do it in Rochester because we found some very dear friends in Buffalo New York which was about only 70
