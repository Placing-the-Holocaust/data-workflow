<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: I-It-- so like about 15 girls, we got together and we like di-- did things together. </sentence><sentence id="159">If we wanted to get some bread -- because we didn't have like what the Americans did on the American zone, a displaced persons camp where they fed you. </sentence><sentence id="160">With the   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regina Spiegel deg May 11, 1999 Russians you didn't have anything like this. </sentence><sentence id="161">The only thing what they did for you, we would go to them and say take -- let's go to a German bakery with us. </sentence><sentence id="162">And they would go with us and they would requisition from the baker, bread for us. </sentence><sentence id="163">So we -- and we, our type of eating was very crude. </sentence><sentence id="164">Bread and water, that's all we needed, you know, to keep us alive. </sentence><sentence id="165">So that's what we got, we got mostly bread and water. </sentence><sentence id="166">Because even when we got into a German house, even if we saw some food there, you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of German households became empty. </sentence><sentence id="167">Why? </sentence><sentence id="168">Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they were running towards the American zone. </sentence><sentence id="169">So they left a lot of their homes with no one there. </sentence><sentence id="170">So when we would go in, we would find maybe some food over there. </sentence><sentence id="171">I remember in one place, they had to spe -- these beautiful, you know, like fruits, apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits. </sentence><sentence id="172">We were afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it. </sentence><sentence id="173">So we wouldn't even touch this. </sentence><sentence id="174">But we would have the bread from the baker and the water and that's how we continued going towards Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Now, you would ask a Russian to requisition bread for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: A--well, we learned to -- to kind of counteract that. </sentence><sentence id="217">Let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="218">During the day, ess -- you know, I told you, we were 15 girls of us. </sentence><sentence id="219">As a matter of fact, we took out from one of these homes, a horse and one of those -- it was like a coach -- not a co -- you know, a horse and buggy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: But it's not a b -- it wasn't a buggy, it was like the most beautiful si -- here at the Smithsonian | walked in one time, in front was sitting this coach, you know, it was the most gorgeous thing if I would have kept it and would -- wouldn't have to had to worry about any finances because it probably was worth at -- a fortune. </sentence><sentence id="227">But we were   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regina Spiegel " May 11, 1999 traveling in this horse and buggy a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="228">During the day, let's say where we -- if we were in a certain town during the day, we would split up a little bit and go into different places to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="229">Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in -- in some kind of -- what do they call them, the barns, like. </sentence><sentence id="230">Or the pigs, or some others, because we were actually very much afraid of -- of raping, because during the war, you see, i-in Germany, I never worried about being raped by a German, because this was something that they were not allowed to do. </sentence><sentence id="231">If--if a German got caught raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="232">So they usually stayed away from us. </sentence><sentence id="233">They probably were raping more German women. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: What -- what was that about, that they were not allowed to rape Jewish women? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Oh, that's was the -- what they called the rassenschande. </sentence><sentence id="246">Rassen, the race, schande is the -- a-- you know, shame. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Shame. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: The -- the -- the race shame, you know, otherwise you -- you like committed the worst sin. </sentence><sentence id="252">I mean, you commit a sin when you rape anybody, but this, th -- it wasn't the raping that they were worried. </sentence><sentence id="253">So after the war we did have to -- the women, and I don't -- we got away -- we got away kind of lucky, but a lot of women weren't that lucky. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: It sounds as though you also were careful. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: So most of us were really looking out for these things. </sentence><sentence id="270">When we notice in a town that there were Russian soldiers, too many Russian soldiers, that they might go out on-- you know, at night, looking for women, we didn't stay in that town. </sentence><sentence id="271">We would march on. </sentence><sentence id="272">We - like I said, we had this horse and buggy, so we could move on a little bit more. </sentence><sentence id="273">And also, we met some Italian guys who must have been working in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="274">You know, they came to Germany to work. </sentence><sentence id="275">And they were also like trying to get back. </sentence><sentence id="276">So sometimes, you see, the Russians, if they saw you with a -- with another man, they would just stay away from you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: So we, during the day, we would like, if we were visible, we would go with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: So anyhow, after -- to tell you the truth, how long it took us to get to the Polish border, I really don't know, but I figure that it must have taken us like about three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="301">First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very -- from the bombs, she was a little bit more in -- and sh-she -- you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us. </sentence><sentence id="302">You know, like I had a little bit of a i-injury, you know, like a shrapnel? </sentence><sentence id="303">A piece of shrapnel got into my hand, but it wasn't -- you know, I never felt it. </sentence><sentence id="304">You know, it wasn't dangerous for me. </sentence><sentence id="305">But with her, we had to put her in in a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="306">So she actually stayed in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="307">We couldn't, you see, we couldn't keep on staying in the same town for too long because we were actually afraid of this. </sentence><sentence id="308">So we actually had to leave her in the hospital, but there was another friend that she met that stayed with her. </sentence><sentence id="309">So she was like more or less taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="310">But we kept on going and probably took us probably like about three weeks til we got to the Polish border. </sentence><sentence id="311">And when I got there -- and you know, as you were walking -- you see, when we were liberated, would you believe that most of us didn't realize that most of our families were murdered? </sentence><sentence id="312">We still were hoping that maybe somebody's gonna be alive because I   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="313"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regina Spiegel (c) May 11, 1999 will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, because that's what kept us through all the other times, kept us going, because if not we probably at one time or another, we would have given up. </sentence><sentence id="314">But that was, in a way, kept us -- hey, you stay alive because you promised that we're gonna meet at home. </sentence><sentence id="315">You know, like my boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate -- when they separated us in Auschwitz he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me in mine hometown. </sentence><sentence id="316">But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated -- you see, never thinking that what's going to happen, that it's going to be this mass killing, but just separated. </sentence><sentence id="317">If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she says, remember, after the war, we'll meet in our place, you know, in our home. </sentence><sentence id="318">So naturally, the first thing what I wanted to do is get back home. </sentence><sentence id="319">So I did. </sentence><sentence id="320">That's how --and most of us -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: Back to Radom? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Back to Radom, but by the time when I hit the Polish border, it was the city Poznan. </sentence><sentence id="323">That was like on germ -- Polish German border. </sentence><sentence id="324">I don't know whether -- you know, I think it's not any more Poznan, I think they call it now Wroclaw, because this became part of Germany, you know, ne -- I think so they call it   Interview with Regina Spiegel " May 11, 1999 Wroclaw, I'm almost sure. </sentence><sentence id="325">Or maybe it's still there, I haven't looked at the map. </sentence><sentence id="326">Maybe after I finish this interview I will take a look at the map. </sentence></p></dialogue>
