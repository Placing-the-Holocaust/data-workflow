<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Well, first of all, you'll have to bear in mind that we are dealing about a period where Jews were confined to their own cultural environment. </sentence><sentence id="176">And my father, for in-- to give you an example, was very friendly with the township judge. </sentence><sentence id="177">But being friendly with the township judge did not mean that the township judge invited my father for dinner, or my father invited the judge for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="178">But they were very, very friendly, you know, and th -- my father was very respected. </sentence><sentence id="179">As far as our material position in town, I would say we were considered one of the wealthiest people, and this had it's impact also. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So how did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="220">It's so unusual, it would seem to me, during that era. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes, yeah, yes. </sentence><sentence id="224">You have to bear in mind that for women to be involved in -- in the p -- in -- in -- in the task of earning a living was not unusual in Poland, because you have to understand that going back not too many years, not too many decades, it was the nicest thing. </sentence><sentence id="225">The best thing that could happen to a man is to sit and study Torah, and his wife was the breadwinner. </sentence><sentence id="226">But the breadwinner, she had a little stall, you know, and was selling a herring, or you know, or some flour, or some sugar, you know, and scraped out a living. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: This is not what my mother did. </sentence><sentence id="234">My mother ran a very, very large business. </sentence><sentence id="235">And it was difficult for th -- [indecipherable] I told you, it was difficult for them to conceive that a woman is on this level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Did she come from a family where they were business people as well, is this what -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Well, y-yes, my grandfa -- I remember my grandfather on the ma -- on the maternal side, he was at -- he had a -- he was mun -- he was in charge, he had -- I was gonna call it a factory, it was not a factory, it was a plant, where they were making wooden shingles, because wooden shingles were used, you know, for roofs, and this was th -- it's like having a -- a roofing business, you know. </sentence><sentence id="242">So, yes, they came from a business family, but not of the size, and not of the caliber that my mother developed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: So the kids of the family, did they help in the milling business of your father? </sentence><sentence id="246">Didn't you help more with your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: Depends. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Depends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: It depends. </sentence><sentence id="251">This was not the only business we had. </sentence><sentence id="252">We had a wholesale business of liquor, which is, you know, this -- this -- you needed special license for it. </sentence><sentence id="253">So, my brother, for instance, when he was in Tomashev, was in charge of the liquor business. </sentence><sentence id="254">My sister Peshe and her husband were in charge helping mother with her business. </sentence><sentence id="255">My older sister, Esther, and her second husband -- because she lost her husband at a very early age, were in charge of helping father with the mills. </sentence><sentence id="256">So everybody did something, you know, specifically, and mother and father were directing traffic, they were, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: And you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I -- I was in school. </sentence><sentence id="267">I was the youngest, you know, and my father died in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="268">Normal death, you know. </sentence><sentence id="269">When I say normal, it was not part of the Holocaust -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: No, this was -- my being the youngest was a plus, because everybody felt that they -- you know, I'm the kid, the kid brother, and they need to be good to me, and they need to be good with me, and they need to play a role in, you know, in bringing me up, because bear in mind that mother is, you know, the impressive person she was in the world of business, she was an extremely religious woman. </sentence><sentence id="301">She bought a shaitel, you know what a shaitel is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
