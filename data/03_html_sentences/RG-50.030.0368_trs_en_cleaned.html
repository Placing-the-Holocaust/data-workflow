" </sentence><sentence id="3375">I noticed the arm," she said. </sentence><sentence id="3376">And, and when I turned around after she called, "Carola," it was my sister. </sentence><sentence id="3377">And we hugged * Irma Grese deg Josef Kramer This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3378">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3379"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 and I wanted to know what happened to my parents, and she said they were all dead. </sentence><sentence id="3380">And that's where Grese was, Grese, "the Beast of Bergen-Belsen." </sentence><sentence id="3381">She witnessed this thing, she seen me speaking to my sister and hugging my sister. </sentence><sentence id="3382">And she stood there and cried. </sentence><sentence id="3383">Something nobody had ever seen before, and then she said to me, "Carola," she heard my sister call "Carola"; otherwise, she wouldn't have known. </sentence><sentence id="3384">She said, "You don't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="3385">Your sister is going to stay with you now." </sentence><sentence id="3386">And we hugged again, at least we are together. </sentence><sentence id="3387">And whatever happens, we are together. </sentence><sentence id="3388">And she said, "Okay, there is nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="3389">Your sister is going to be with you." </sentence><sentence id="3390">So I was trying to hold on to my sister, but she had to go through all kinds of different routines. </sentence><sentence id="3391">Having, being tattooed. </sentence><sentence id="3392">She was tattooed on the inside because I felt that she didn't have to have -- in case she would survive, she has a tiny little tattoo. </sentence><sentence id="3393">And I thought we would be together, but it was just a false promise. </sentence><sentence id="3394">They sent her to a different camp, and I didn't know where she went. </sentence><sentence id="3395">And once in a while, one of my friends who went around -- my friend, Claire,, one of the Frankfurt girls, she would go to the camp where she was in. </sentence><sentence id="3396">And she would come back, and she says, "Your sister is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="3397">Your sister is still alive." </sentence><sentence id="3398">She was in a different camp, and, I would hear from her once in a while. " </sentence><sentence id="3399">Not to worry, I'm still living." </sentence><sentence id="3400">And I had hoped that maybe, you know, maybe the Russians would come and we would, we would be free again, and we would get together. </sentence><sentence id="3401">But there was little hope, very little hope that we would be together. </sentence><sentence id="3402">So it went on,, the march that was in 1944 in, in August. </sentence><sentence id="3403">1945 in January, the big march from Auschwitz started, and I didn't know where my sister was. </sentence><sentence id="3404">I didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="3405">She was already so tiny and so skinny, I was afraid that she, she would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="3406">She would have been killed already then. </sentence><sentence id="3407">So we marched out of Auschwitz day and night, and late night and day. </sentence><sentence id="3408">And we were in cattle cars and we went to Ravensbriick. </sentence><sentence id="3409">And in Ravensbriick we stayed four weeks, and I had no -- no sight of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="3410">I didn't know where she was. </sentence><sentence id="3411">We marched out of Ravensbriick, and from Ravensbriick we went supposedly to Malchow. </sentence><sentence id="3412">We did go to Malchow, there was another march from Ravensbriick to Malchow day and night, day and night. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And I was already so weak, and we all were. </sentence><sentence id="3414">One helped me on one side, the other on the other side, and we slept walking. </sentence><sentence id="3415">And that's how we went on, and whoever didn't do it lay down and they shot them. </sentence><sentence id="3416">They didn't give them any chance; they shot the girls just right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="3417">So at one point I had to go to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="3418">I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3419">And I went out of my line and there was no bathroom, but there was barn. </sentence><sentence id="3420">So I went into the barn. </sentence><sentence id="3421">I said to the girls, "I have to go to the bathroom, it's impossible." </sentence><sentence id="3422">I went to the barn, I walked into barn. </sentence><sentence id="3423">My sister walked out of the barn. </sentence><sentence id="3424">And so I said, "Now, you're not going to be out of my sight anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3425">You're going to be with me." </sentence><sentence id="3426">And we did cling to each and she walked with me. </sentence><sentence id="3427">And everybody thought she was my little sister because she's small. </sentence><sentence id="3428">And we stayed together from that day on "til we were in Malchow, we stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="3429">We were never separated anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3430">So that was one good thing that I had to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="3431">That was a very unusual incident. </sentence><sentence id="3432">So from the march on, we marched into Malchow. </sentence><sentence id="3433">That was the camp where we hardly got any salt in anything. </sentence><sentence id="3434">But I had a chance to work in their kitchen, and in the kitchen what I did there is I did heat the kettles the to make the fire underneath, you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3435">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3436"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 know. </sentence><sentence id="3437">So what we really -- what the girls cooked there was water, potato peels, and a little bit of farina. </sentence><sentence id="3438">Not farina, oatmeal. </sentence><sentence id="3439">And that made sort of a soup, but it was better than nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3440">So at least I had a little soup I could give my sister and my friends, Claire, who was with me and Martha. </sentence><sentence id="3441">Two of the girls from Frankfurt survived with me. </sentence><sentence id="3442">We were together, and I had a chance to give them a little extra soup. </sentence><sentence id="3443">I added a little hot water and it was good. </sentence><sentence id="3444">But we got thinner and thinner every day because they took away the salt. </sentence><sentence id="3445">But that's where we laid around, and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and talked about better times which we felt we will never see. </sentence><sentence id="3446">And across from us was a camp with English prisoners, and they looked just as bad as we did. </sentence><sentence id="3447">It was just across from the camp we were in. </sentence><sentence id="3448">They were also laying around, like, you know, like, like dead animals. </sentence><sentence id="3449">You know, when you go to a zoo and sometimes and those animals look like tranquilized, that's what we all looked like. </sentence><sentence id="3450">We were just either waiting to die or being liberated. </sentence><sentence id="3451">Something had to happen to us, we couldn't go on anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3452">And then that was in February, and we talked about that maybe we're getting liberated. </sentence><sentence id="3453">Maybe the Russians were coming closer, but we had no newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="3454">Nobody knew anything. </sentence><sentence id="3455">All of a sudden at the beginning of May, the Nazis, the SS came running in and they kept screaming, "Get out of here you dirty Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3456">Get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="3457">Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="3458">Walk." </sentence><sentence id="3459">Now, we figured "where are we walking now?" </sentence><sentence id="3460">We could hardly move anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3461">They walked us into the woods. </sentence><sentence id="3462">We were so sure that in the woods they were going to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="3463">Because it was coming closer, the war was getting -- coming to an end, we felt. </sentence><sentence id="3464">And why in the woods? </sentence><sentence id="3465">So they marched us into the woods, and all of a sudden in the woods -- it was, I think it was May the 3rd, or was it -- maybe it was a different -- maybe May the 8th. </sentence><sentence id="3466">I think it was May the 3rd. </sentence><sentence id="3467">They all disappeared, there were no Nazi uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="3468">They were either they had their private uniform, their clothes in a package. </sentence><sentence id="3469">The SS men disappeared; there were none. </sentence><sentence id="3470">And all of a sudden we see a tank with three young American soldiers screaming from the top of their lungs, "You guys are free. </sentence><sentence id="3471">Hitler is dead. </sentence><sentence id="3472">You're free, you're free." </sentence><sentence id="3473">And they had -- I remember they had chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="3474">There was a quite a few of us. </sentence><sentence id="3475">They had chocolate and cigarettes, and they threw it out of the tank, and they threw it down for us. </sentence><sentence id="3476">It wasn't enough for all of us, and we -- my sister looked at me and said, "Did you hear that? </sentence><sentence id="3477">We're free." </sentence><sentence id="3478">I said, "Yes, but where are we going to be?" </sentence><sentence id="3479">We were free, we were happy, but no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="3480">But, we had more than other people because we had each other. </sentence><sentence id="3481">So while we were sitting around in the woods, we all got together and, "We got to do something. </sentence><sentence id="3482">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="3483">We're not going to go back to Germany." </sentence><sentence id="3484">So one of the girls, Slovak girls, said, "I lost two sisters in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3485">I'm not going home alone. </sentence><sentence id="3486">You two girls are going with me." </sentence><sentence id="3487">So we traveled from Malchow to Czechoslovakia, my sister and I. And we came there, and to our surprise her parents were still there. </sentence><sentence id="3488">Her little brother was there, and they greeted us with open arms. </sentence><sentence id="3489">For the first time we seen parents again and people who were good to us. </sentence><sentence id="3490">Gave us clothes, gave us food, and it was like such a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3491">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3492"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 relief. </sentence><sentence id="3493">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="3494">We stayed there four weeks, and they fed us. </sentence><sentence id="3495">And, of course, we had only one wish, to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3496">So no matter they did, my sister and I looked at each other and I, I remember my father, my mother had told me that I should remember an address in New York City. </sentence><sentence id="3497">It was "648 184th Street in New York City;" that was my aunt's address. </sentence><sentence id="3498">And I said to my sister, "You know, I know Tante Anna's address." </sentence><sentence id="3499">And she said, "No, you don't." </sentence><sentence id="3500">I said, "Yes, I do." </sentence><sentence id="3501">I said, "If I get only to that address, then we'll be fine." </sentence><sentence id="3502">Well, there no one -- you know, you couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3503">I mean, we went in the nighttime, early in the morning we went over the border from Czechoslovakia to Austria. </sentence><sentence id="3504">And the border was like a train -- what do you call the train, what the train goes on? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3665">A: A train track. </sentence><sentence id="3666">And on one side the Russians stood, and they wanted to shoot when they seen two little girls, two young girls coming there. </sentence><sentence id="3667">So I said to them -- I knew a little bit Russian, I said I was a Gypsy and I looked like one. </sentence><sentence id="3668">My hair had grown by then, and it was long and a comb I didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="3669">And I said I was Gypsy -- and it was pitch black because I was a blonde before. " </sentence><sentence id="3670">My father lives in Austria, and we want to go to Austria." </sentence><sentence id="3671">Would they let us through? </sentence><sentence id="3672">They said no, they had to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="3673">And we said, "No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="3674">We can't be shot. </sentence><sentence id="3675">We have to get through here and just close your eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3676">Turn around. </sentence><sentence id="3677">Let us go." </sentence><sentence id="3678">So they said, "Okay, close your eyes." </sentence><sentence id="3679">And we closed our eyes. " </sentence><sentence id="3680">Go right through, but when you get over the border there will be the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="3681">They're going to be shooting at you." </sentence><sentence id="3682">Well, there was no American shooting at us. </sentence><sentence id="3683">The Americans were fast asleep, it was five o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="3684">And we got into Austria. </sentence><sentence id="3685">Once we were in Austria, we went to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="3686">We figured that was the right thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="3687">And there we seen other survivors. </sentence><sentence id="3688">Why would we know that they're survivors? </sentence><sentence id="3689">They looked like us. </sentence><sentence id="3690">They had not much clothes, and they said to us, "You, you must be" -- at that time they were called "Ker," "concentration camp," you know. </sentence><sentence id="3691">And we said, "Yes, we are." </sentence><sentence id="3692">And they said, "We'll take you to a DP camp." </sentence><sentence id="3693">So they took us to a DP camp, and we lived in Austria until we were ready to come to America, in Gmunden, in Kammer-Schorfling. </sentence><sentence id="3694">And through the help of the American soldiers which we met in Austria, they were stationed in Austria, we wrote to my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="3695">And my aunt got the letter, and she was overwhelmed that we were alive, but, of course, everyone else had died. </sentence><sentence id="3696">My grandparents and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3697">And she sent us food and she sent us clothing, and we were saved. </sentence><sentence id="3698">We came to America in 1946 in July. </sentence><sentence id="3699">It was a year and three months after the liberation, which was good. </sentence><sentence id="3700">That's where -- and after I was here for a little while, my aunt thought it would be wise to put it in the newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="3701">Tell everybody that we are alive, but there was like the German Jewish newspaper called the Aufbau. </sentence><sentence id="3702">She, she put it in there, and my husband read it and he came to visit me. </sentence><sentence id="3703">And that's when we later on got married. </sentence><sentence id="3704">So the a Konzentrationslager [concentration camp] (German) degdeg Reconstruction (German); popular periodical of the German-Jewish community in America. </sentence><sentence id="3705">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3706">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3707"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 Gypsy was right, I married the guy I knew from way back when, and I had a son and a daughter. </sentence><sentence id="3708">And now I have five grandchildren, and I have a lovely daughter-in-law and a lovely son-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="3709">And I have my own family, thank God. </sentence><sentence id="3710">That's something I never would have dreamt of, something I thought it would never, so I marched into Auschwitz and I was one of the lucky ones who marched out. </sentence><sentence id="3711">Not many did. ... </sentence><sentence id="3712">Now, my friend, Martha, survived, and she lives here partly. </sentence><sentence id="3713">And the other one lives in Queens, and Zippy lives in Manhattan. </sentence><sentence id="3714">And I have the two other friends in Israel, and that's about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
