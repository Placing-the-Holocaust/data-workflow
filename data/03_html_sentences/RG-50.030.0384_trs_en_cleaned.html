<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Can you please describe the journey? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: The journey, we left Constanza(ph) at night. </sentence><sentence id="164">We were pulled out of the port by a tug, a Romanian tug and once they took us out into the sea, they disconnected and they left. </sentence><sentence id="165">Then, we tried to work the engines, we had a very, very hard time to make the engine work. </sentence><sentence id="166">It pop up and then stopped again. </sentence><sentence id="167">Anyway, I think it took us practically all night and the engine still didn't, didn't start. </sentence><sentence id="168">Then I understand that we had, start sending SOS's because the vessel was floating into the sea, but it was not moving anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="169">The captain send SOS's and eventually, now the, now the next day, the same tug, tugboat that took us, pulled us out, came back. </sentence><sentence id="170">It came back and we requested that they, if they could repair so that the engine can start. </sentence><sentence id="171">They tried and tried but they told us that it would cost us money. </sentence><sentence id="172">So we explained that we are left with no funds at all because the, the Custom took away everything we had. </sentence><sentence id="173">So then they requested that we, everybody that has a wedding ring, which were, miraculously we were allowed to keep. </sentence><sentence id="174">I didn't had one, but in any case, many, many, many people had. </sentence><sentence id="175">So we collected all the wedding rings from the people and we gave them to the crew of that tugboat. </sentence><sentence id="176">Then they went into the engine and they start playing around with the engine and they said, they, two conditions. </sentence><sentence id="177">If we give them enough money, they may be able to pull us all the way into the Turkish waters, which would take us about a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="178">But if we don't have enough money, then they said okay, we'll try to repair the engine and if the engine works, we are going to be with you, floating next to the vessel, into the international water, close to the Turkey, Turkish waters and then we will leave you there. </sentence><sentence id="179">So finally the engine start working and we start sailing towards Turkey and the tugboat was going next to us and then it went away and it took us about three, four days because it was very, very slow, until we reach the so called border with the Turkish territorial waters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: Did you know other passengers on the ship, did you talk to them during the journey? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Did you know Yakov Berkovitz(ph), the leader of Batar(ph) on the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: No, I did not know him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Did you feel that there was any organized or organization or organized life on the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: We, we knew that of course there is a Batar(ph) that organized everything, but we have very little communication with them, so and besides that, as I said, there was no way of moving around, so each one just stayed in it's quarters until we were allowed to go to, on, on the deck for a, for a, for a short time and then back there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: So basically everything that you knew about the trip, during the trip, was by way of rumors? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: So what happened when you got closer to Istanbul? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: When we got closer to Istanbul, the engine stopped working and the boat was floating, you know, towards the, the shore. </sentence><sentence id="224">It was right in the other opening of the Bosporus(ph) Straights and the rumor was that we were too close to mines, because the Turkish </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: So you are not close to the shore? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: No, we were pretty far away from both shores, but anchored right there in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="227">And of course we had then, Turkish police came on board and they came, they were constantly on board the vessel and we stayed there for about two months. </sentence><sentence id="228">From what we understand, that the Turks will not allow us to go into the Mediterranean. </sentence><sentence id="229">We couldn't go forward, we couldn't go backwards and the engines were irreparable on board ship. </sentence><sentence id="230">So finally I understand, we got permission for mechanics to come on board, remove the engine, take it ashore and try to repair it ashore. </sentence><sentence id="231">So they removed the engine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: So, if my understanding is correct, one of the problems was that you, you, the passengers didn't have an immigration visa for Palestine, correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Right, first we did not have any immigration visa for Palestine, secondly we had no visas for Turkey, we were not allowed to get out of the vessel and we had to stay aboard until somehow they would manage to repair the engine. </sentence><sentence id="241">Meanwhile of course there were all kinds of rumors that were going on. </sentence><sentence id="242">First, rumors that maybe there is a chance that they childrens will be allowed to disembark. </sentence><sentence id="243">And there were quite a lot of children on board. </sentence><sentence id="244">Then there were rumored that maybe they will allow us, they will make a camp on the Asian side of the Turkey and allow us to stay there, until somehow it will be resolved what to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="245">All these things never materialized, neither the children, neither going on board. </sentence><sentence id="246">But, what did happen is that finally nine people that were on board with expired immigration papers for Palestine, they got permission to be taken out of the vessel and then to be, to proceed to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="247">So the nine people, nine person disembark, were allowed to disembark during those two months that we stay there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: Did you ever see spokesman in Turkey? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: They were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="258">First of all, we had not enough food, we were just eating biscuits. </sentence><sentence id="259">Finally we understood that the Jewish agency in Istanbul got permission to export some food to the vessel, but it was all dried food and the only thing they allowed water to be, you know, water tanks to come and fill up that, the vessel's tanks and the sanitary condition was just, I would say atrocious because we had no opportunity to wash ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="260">A lot of people start getting fleas, there were a lot of sickness, vomiting and, and people crying and it was quite a, a very difficult position to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Do you remember a ship committee, on the ship during this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Yes, the Batar(ph) organized some kind of a committee and they tried to keep people from, from getting wild, like trying to get out on the deck and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="264">But actually, people were so, shall we say, flabbergasted by this happening, that it's like they gave up living. </sentence><sentence id="265">They, they, as the time was passing, they, we start believing that we never get out of this, because nothing is moving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="266">On top of it, we don't even have an engine, never mind going someplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: So the engine was gone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: It was ashore, in order to be repaired? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="278">And the engine was never returned to the vessel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Never returned? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Never returned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: How do you know this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Because we were very surprised on the twenty-third of February, a tug, coming and start pulling us out. </sentence><sentence id="288">First of all, we see a, quite a huge tugboat coming and trying to tie us up to the tug. </sentence><sentence id="289">Then we have, we see people coming and they did not pull the anchor, they cut the anchor. </sentence><sentence id="290">Now, the anchor is made out of steel, so they came and physically cut the anchor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Did you, did you witness this, or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: I saw it myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: You saw it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: First of all you hear it, you know, when they try to cut off the anchor and, and secondly, you  could see the boat, because the boat, trying to, when the boat, the tugboat tried, the people from the boat tried to attach the vessel, quite a number of people tried to prevent them from doing that. </sentence><sentence id="302">Obviously we had some suspicion about that, so we, we prevented them to come to attach it, so that the police start pushing us back. </sentence><sentence id="303">So quite a commotion for quite a while until the police manage to push us back into our, below the vessel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Did you see the Turkish police on the boat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="310">All the time and of course when this happened, we had quite a, quite an army of police to subdue us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: So you were on the deck when they pushed you back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: Yes, I was. </sentence><sentence id="316">I remember that they start pushing us back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: What happened next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: Well the next they managed to attach the, the tug, managed to attach the rope to the front of the boat and they start pulling us, that was already nighttime. </sentence><sentence id="322">They start pulling us back into the Black Sea, back to the Bosporus(ph). </sentence><sentence id="323">Took several hours, they pull us  0 yelling, help, help . </sentence><sentence id="324">Women, women and men, no I haven't seen any children  1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: No, I, I saw one, which I, dead, further away from the, from the, from the deck, but it was entangled in wires. </sentence><sentence id="326">That was a person there. </sentence><sentence id="327">I could not reach him because I was myself not very mobile. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: And that was it, the rest of the people were gone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: No more people. </sentence><sentence id="334">But, towards the evening I see a man, sitting on something which obviously it was a door, he was sitting on the door and paddling. </sentence><sentence id="335">So, he came towards me, so I pulled him up and sat him on the bench. </sentence><sentence id="336">And that was the chief officer, a Bulgarian. </sentence><sentence id="337">So he, at that time, started talking in Russian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: You knew Russian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Yes, it's my mother language. </sentence><sentence id="346">He told me that he happened to be on the deck in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="347">He was the, he was on duty on deck, when he saw something floating towards the ship, from the shore. </sentence><sentence id="348">It was like, looked like a torpedo anyway, that was coming towards the vessel, so he run from the deck towards the captain's cabin and as he was opening the door of the captain's cabin, the explosion took him in the air and when he landed in the water, he landed with that door in his hands, with the knob in his hands. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: This is the door on which he was paddling? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="356">So what he did eventually, he went on the door and that, that how he managed to stay in the water. </sentence><sentence id="357">So when I pulled him, I pulled him off this door. </sentence><sentence id="358">So, he says that the only way we can survive is really by us shouting all the time, so that we don't fall asleep, because if we fall asleep we will never wake up any longer. </sentence><sentence id="359">So we were sitting back to back on this bench and yelling all night. </sentence><sentence id="360">And as the, the night came, as the day came along, we were already exhausted of yelling. </sentence><sentence id="361">And then we stopped and, and then I felt that he is not any longer on my back. </sentence><sentence id="362">I turned around and he, he fell from the bench onto the deck and his head was in the water like on his belly. </sentence><sentence id="363">In other words, he could not possibly breathe any longer, he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="364">And, but he was very close to me, but just a corpse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: So you were in the water for? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: About 24 hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: You could see the shore? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: All the time. </sentence><sentence id="388">Soon as the, day, day, the daylight came, I could see the shore and you could  2 hear the noises of the shore, like an engine, pumping engine and things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: Did you think about trying to reach the shore? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="394">Then I decided, maybe I'll be able to swim to the shore. </sentence><sentence id="395">So I jump into the water. </sentence><sentence id="396">What happened is, if you take, from the bench and you land into the water, you are much lower into the water, now the shore was quite far away. </sentence><sentence id="397">So I swim a little bit and I could hardly move, so I turned around and went back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: To the deck? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: To the deck. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="668">A: They did not improve, but the fact that we were able to go on a deck, there we were able to get a little bit of water to wash your face, but very, very little of it and there were no facilities that you could use in order to, so you realize that you are going to stay that way until you are going to somehow leave the ship. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="716">Q: So they gave you papers in order to be able to transit toward... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="718">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="728">Otherwise, I had, they never give me any explanation why they keep me in prison, although I, I try not to antagonize them, but I said that, I did ask them, once they finish with the interrogation, "On what basis do you keep me in prison?" </sentence><sentence id="729">So they said, "Because you are illegal in Turkey, you did not have a visa for Turkey, so therefore we cannot release you." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="730">Q: I understand. </sentence><sentence id="731">Because we, before we go further away, I would like to ask you to tell us a few words about the main actors in terms of countries, of this tragedy, how do you feel about Turkey, how do you feel about Romania, how do you feel about Great Britain? </sentence><sentence id="732">I would like to know what do you think about the organizers of the trip? </sentence><sentence id="733">Basically, how do you see the various responsibilities and countries or organizations who are responsible for this tragedy? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: Well, let's start with the Romanian authorities. </sentence><sentence id="735">I understood there is a war and I understand, I understood at that time that Romania was allied to Germany, consequently they're going to behave about the same way as the Germans are. </sentence><sentence id="736">Killing of Jews start pretty early in Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="737">At random. </sentence><sentence id="738">We had the iron guard, guard . </sentence><sentence id="739">That was, behaved the way I understood, just like the Nazi's did in Germany and to keep away from them, to make sure that they don't get you. </sentence><sentence id="740">They can grab you in the street or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="741">Of course afterwards, when I had to wear the yellow band with the star of David on it, I realized that they can pick you up, doesn't matter what you do. </sentence><sentence id="742">The authorities, the first time that I got in contact with the authorities was of course when I, in the train in Constanza(ph), I was pretty, they behaved like wild people. </sentence><sentence id="743">In the customs, they were putting in their pocket anything that they could get hands on, which at that time I considered to be absolutely barbarian, really. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="744">Then, the more, then when I went to the ship and then I realized that unless we give them all our wedding rings, they are not going to do anything about it, more than ever that, we are like animals and they behaved like. </sentence><sentence id="745">Then in Turkey again, we just saw the  0 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="746">A: 760, I would say that 100 were children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: How do you see the British responsibility in this story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="756">A: We knew about British policy in Palestine and we expected maybe they will not allow us to land in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="757">Once the vessel goes into the Mediterranean, of course it will go towards Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="758">We expected, possibly, to be taken somewhere else instead of Palestine, but it's a chance that it's really worthwhile taking, even if we are taken to a camp, doesn't matter where, whether it is on Cypress or anything else, it still cannot be as bad as in the condition that we were there, that we were in Romania or on the vessel. </sentence><sentence id="759">Once I landed in Haifa, I was taken to the CID there, police station at the border between Lebanon and at that time Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="760">And of course there, that was the British police, they ask me a few question, they were quite polite, they, they just wanted to know some facts about where I am coming from and they say as soon as that, you can take a car and go wherever you want to go. </sentence><sentence id="761">So I was not, they did not, the British authorities in Palestine did not interfere whatsoever with my movements. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="804">Q: What do you think about the responsibility of the organizers of this voyage, the people who really organized the trip? </sentence></p></dialogue>
