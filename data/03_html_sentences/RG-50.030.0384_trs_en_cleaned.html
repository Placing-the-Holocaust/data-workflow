<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: The ship was very funny looking ship, in respect that there is, as you board the ship there is only one way of going down the ship and the ship was built sort of like cubicles and in order for you to go into your bunker, you had to crawl into it, there was not enough space for you even to sit and we all crawled into our spaces and we could not even move in the bunker, we were so close to each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: So there were several layers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Many, many layers. </sentence><sentence id="140">The top, I would say about six or seven layers, so that you had to pull yourself in and then underneath same kind, but the only thing you could see that there was steel, up was wood. </sentence><sentence id="141">So the lower portion was, you could hit the steel and upper portion, it was wood. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: So it was a huge, let's see, a big boat made from steel, on which they built a sort of superstructure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Superstructure, wood superstructure, correct. </sentence><sentence id="144">And of course we were too many of us on this vessel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: How many? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Over 700 people. </sentence><sentence id="150">So, because we were so many, they told us we cannot go up on the deck, all of us, so we were given times when we were, were, about maximum 100 people could be on deck, so we took shifts when we could go on deck and toilets were in, very few of them and it was just a terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="151">From the beginning we saw that it's, it would be worse than a prison because the air was difficult even to breathe. </sentence><sentence id="152">And yes there is one thing I would like to mention, that after we finished with the Romanian customs, then we passed through the people that organized the vessel. </sentence><sentence id="153">Now they restricted us exactly to 10 kilos of baggage. </sentence><sentence id="154">One piece, 10 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="155">Anything over that has to be left behind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Are you saying that these people who restricted you were not the Romanian Customs, but the people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: I don't know whether they were people, but anyway they were part of the organization of the, of the vessel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: We had no choice, no time to even to ask who are you. </sentence><sentence id="170">They told , "You're going to board now, but you have to, you have to leave everything above the 10 kilos." </sentence><sentence id="171">And they had, of course, a scale. </sentence><sentence id="172">You put your suitcase on a scale. </sentence><sentence id="173">My suitcase was, if I remember correctly, something around 15 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="174">They said, "You have to unload it." </sentence><sentence id="175">So we unloaded several things and then we put back, it was 12 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="176">Unload it again until it was 10 kilos, then we were allowed to proceed. </sentence><sentence id="177">So imagine so many people waiting, waiting. </sentence><sentence id="178">So it took us forever just to embark on this vessel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: Why do you think they did this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: I think they were afraid of overweight already. </sentence><sentence id="192">Already the ship was meant for less than half of the people that we were. </sentence><sentence id="193">When actually, in order to obtain more funds, they allowed more people to join, until it became 700, over 760 people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: Did you feel in any way that the ship was unstable, not very stable because of it's load? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: I doubted that we ever made anywhere and everybody, everybody was so flabbergasted, shall we say, that this, that a thing like what they call a vessel will manage to take us so far  away. </sentence><sentence id="200">We doubted that it will ever be able to leave the port. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: How big was the crew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: We haven't seen the crew until actually when we're all on board. </sentence><sentence id="206">We, we were told that the crew, it's a Bulgarian captain and a Bulgarian chief officer and several Bulgarian, the whole crew was a Bulgarian crew, about seven or eight people. </sentence><sentence id="207">And actually we seldom saw the, the captain altogether, but you see, we were so, so many of us, that we have, we were not manage, we were not managing even to walk around. </sentence><sentence id="208">We were glad when we were allowed to go on, on the deck for a few hours just to breathe a little bit of better air. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Can you please describe the journey? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: The journey, we left Constanza(ph) at night. </sentence><sentence id="216">We were pulled out of the port by a tug, a Romanian tug and once they took us out into the sea, they disconnected and they left. </sentence><sentence id="217">Then, we tried to work the engines, we had a very, very hard time to make the engine work. </sentence><sentence id="218">It pop up and then stopped again. </sentence><sentence id="219">Anyway, I think it took us practically all night and the engine still didn't, didn't start. </sentence><sentence id="220">Then I understand that we had, start sending SOS's because the vessel was floating into the sea, but it was not moving anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="221">The captain send SOS's and eventually, now the, now the next day, the same tug, tugboat that took us, pulled us out, came back. </sentence><sentence id="222">It came back and we requested that they, if they could repair so that the engine can start. </sentence><sentence id="223">They tried and tried but they told us that it would cost us money. </sentence><sentence id="224">So we explained that we are left with no funds at all because the, the Custom took away everything we had. </sentence><sentence id="225">So then they requested that we, everybody that has a wedding ring, which were, miraculously we were allowed to keep. </sentence><sentence id="226">I didn't had one, but in any case, many, many, many people had. </sentence><sentence id="227">So we collected all the wedding rings from the people and we gave them to the crew of that tugboat. </sentence><sentence id="228">Then they went into the engine and they start playing around with the engine and they said, they, two conditions. </sentence><sentence id="229">If we give them enough money, they may be able to pull us all the way into the Turkish waters, which would take us about a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="230">But if we don't have enough money, then they said okay, we'll try to repair the engine and if the engine works, we are going to be with you, floating next to the vessel, into the international water, close to the Turkey, Turkish waters and then we will leave you there. </sentence><sentence id="231">So finally the engine start working and we start sailing towards Turkey and the tugboat was going next to us and then it went away and it took us about three, four days because it was very, very slow, until we reach the so called border with the Turkish territorial waters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Did you know other passengers on the ship, did you talk to them during the journey? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: Oh yes, of course. </sentence><sentence id="252">First I had the girlfriend, my, we were actually engaged and she came with both of her parents. </sentence><sentence id="253">They were, their place was way below, in the vessel's belly, like. </sentence><sentence id="254">So and I was completely on different side of the vessel. </sentence><sentence id="255">But we managed to see each other from time to time, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="256">She was with her two parents. </sentence><sentence id="257">And I had also two friends from school that were also on the boat and several other people that I knew. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: Did you talk to them during the ? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Yes, yes I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Did you know Yakov Berkovitz(ph), the leader of Batar(ph) on the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: No, I did not know him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Did you feel that there was any organized or organization or organized life on the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: We, we knew that of course there is a Batar(ph) that organized everything, but we have very little communication with them, so and besides that, as I said, there was no way of moving around, so each one just stayed in it's quarters until we were allowed to go to, on, on the deck for a, for a, for a short time and then back there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: So basically everything that you knew about the trip, during the trip, was by way of rumors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: Exactly, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: So what happened when you got closer to Istanbul? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: When we got closer to Istanbul, the engine stopped working and the boat was floating, you know, towards the, the shore. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was right in the other opening of the Bosporus(ph) Straights and the rumor was that we were too close to mines, because the Turkish waters were mined and there were only certain passages that they can get through. </sentence><sentence id="277">So but we had no way of knowing how to get through. </sentence><sentence id="278">But suddenly a Turkish tug appeared, from the Bosporus(ph) and tied us up and pulled us through the Turkish water and took us right into the Istanbul harbor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: So let's summarize for one second. </sentence><sentence id="284">You left Constanza(ph), on the Black Sea, you left Romania on what date? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: That was eleventh, eleventh of December of 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: And you arrived in, in Istanbul? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: About fourteenth or fifteenth of December. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Okay, so what happened next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: In Istanbul we anchored, in the middle of Istanbul, which is quite a, quite a big area, between the Asian and the European sides, right? </sentence><sentence id="296">So you have, the port is on the Asian side, but as well as on the European side, we're right in the middle of that big water, like a lake. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: So you are not close to the shore? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: No, we were pretty far away from both shores, but anchored right there in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="299">And of course we had then, Turkish police came on board and they came, they were constantly on board the vessel and we stayed there for about two months. </sentence><sentence id="300">From what we understand, that the Turks will not allow us to go into the Mediterranean. </sentence><sentence id="301">We couldn't go forward, we couldn't go backwards and the engines were irreparable on board ship. </sentence><sentence id="302">So finally I understand, we got permission for mechanics to come on board, remove the engine, take it ashore and try to repair it ashore. </sentence><sentence id="303">So they removed the engine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: So, if my understanding is correct, one of the problems was that you, you, the passengers didn't have an immigration visa for Palestine, correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Right, first we did not have any immigration visa for Palestine, secondly we had no visas for Turkey, we were not allowed to get out of the vessel and we had to stay aboard until somehow they would manage to repair the engine. </sentence><sentence id="313">Meanwhile of course there were all kinds of rumors that were going on. </sentence><sentence id="314">First, rumors that maybe there is a chance that they childrens will be allowed to disembark. </sentence><sentence id="315">And there were quite a lot of children on board. </sentence><sentence id="316">Then there were rumored that maybe they will allow us, they will make a camp on the Asian side of the Turkey and allow us to stay there, until somehow it will be resolved what to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="317">All these things never materialized, neither the children, neither going on board. </sentence><sentence id="318">But, what did happen is that finally nine people that were on board with expired immigration papers for Palestine, they got permission to be taken out of the vessel and then to be, to proceed to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="319">So the nine people, nine person disembark, were allowed to disembark during those two months that we stay there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Did you ever see spokesman in Turkey? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Could you be so kind to describe the sanitary conditions on the ship during these two months? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A: They were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="348">First of all, we had not enough food, we were just eating biscuits. </sentence><sentence id="349">Finally we understood that the Jewish agency in Istanbul got permission to export some food to the vessel, but it was all dried food and the only thing they allowed water to be, you know, water tanks to come and fill up that, the vessel's tanks and the sanitary condition was just, I would say atrocious because we had no opportunity to wash ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="350">A lot of people start getting fleas, there were a lot of sickness, vomiting and, and people crying and it was quite a, a very difficult position to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: Do you remember a ship committee, on the ship during this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Yes, the Batar(ph) organized some kind of a committee and they tried to keep people from, from getting wild, like trying to get out on the deck and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="354">But actually, people were so, shall we say, flabbergasted by this happening, that it's like they gave up living. </sentence><sentence id="355">They, they, as the time was passing, they, we start believing that we never get out of this, because nothing is moving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="356">On top of it, we don't even have an engine, never mind going someplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: So the engine was gone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: Gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: It was ashore, in order to be repaired? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Never returned? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Never returned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: How do you know this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: Because we were very surprised on the twenty-third of February, a tug, coming and start pulling us out. </sentence><sentence id="378">First of all, we see a, quite a huge tugboat coming and trying to tie us up to the tug. </sentence><sentence id="379">Then we have, we see people coming and they did not pull the anchor, they cut the anchor. </sentence><sentence id="380">Now, the anchor is made out of steel, so they came and physically cut the anchor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Did you, did you witness this, or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: I saw it myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: You saw it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: First of all you hear it, you know, when they try to cut off the anchor and, and secondly, you  could see the boat, because the boat, trying to, when the boat, the tugboat tried, the people from the boat tried to attach the vessel, quite a number of people tried to prevent them from doing that. </sentence><sentence id="392">Obviously we had some suspicion about that, so we, we prevented them to come to attach it, so that the police start pushing us back. </sentence><sentence id="393">So quite a commotion for quite a while until the police manage to push us back into our, below the vessel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: Did you see the Turkish police on the boat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="400">All the time and of course when this happened, we had quite a, quite an army of police to subdue us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="935">A: Well, let's start with the Romanian authorities. </sentence><sentence id="936">I understood there is a war and I understand, I understood at that time that Romania was allied to Germany, consequently they're going to behave about the same way as the Germans are. </sentence><sentence id="937">Killing of Jews start pretty early in Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="938">At random. </sentence><sentence id="939">We had the iron guard, guard . </sentence><sentence id="940">That was, behaved the way I understood, just like the Nazi's did in Germany and to keep away from them, to make sure that they don't get you. </sentence><sentence id="941">They can grab you in the street or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="942">Of course afterwards, when I had to wear the yellow band with the star of David on it, I realized that they can pick you up, doesn't matter what you do. </sentence><sentence id="943">The authorities, the first time that I got in contact with the authorities was of course when I, in the train in Constanza(ph), I was pretty, they behaved like wild people. </sentence><sentence id="944">In the customs, they were putting in their pocket anything that they could get hands on, which at that time I considered to be absolutely barbarian, really. </sentence><sentence id="945">Then, the more, then when I went to the ship and then I realized that unless we give them all our wedding rings, they are not going to do anything about it, more than ever that, we are like animals and they behaved like. </sentence><sentence id="946">Then in Turkey again, we just saw the Turkish police. </sentence><sentence id="947">They were totally unconcerned about human life, or the condition of the human life and the more we were on the vessel, the more we realized that we'll never get out of this because they couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="948">That we are human being, it doesn't matter, really. </sentence><sentence id="949">It's just that we are an inconvenience to them and they are going to try to correct that inconvenience. </sentence><sentence id="950">The fact that we were hope that maybe they'll put us in a camp in Turkey, this disappeared very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="951">The only time that we had a little bit of hope is when they allowed the nine people to go ashore, then we said, maybe there is a possibility something will happen. </sentence><sentence id="952">We were watching whether they'll allow the kids, the children to be, disembark. </sentence><sentence id="953">But as long as they were on the vessel we knew that nothing would happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="973">Q: How many children do you think were on the ship from there? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="989">Q: How do you see the British responsibility in this story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: We knew about British policy in Palestine and we expected maybe they will not allow us to land in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="992">Once the vessel goes into the Mediterranean, of course it will go towards Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="993">We expected, possibly, to be taken somewhere else instead of Palestine, but it's a chance that it's really worthwhile taking, even if we are taken to a camp, doesn't matter where, whether it is on Cypress or anything else, it still cannot be as bad as in the condition that we were there, that we were in Romania or on the vessel. </sentence><sentence id="994">Once I landed in Haifa, I was taken to the CID there, police station at the border between Lebanon and at that time Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="995">And of course there, that was the British police, they ask me a few question, they were quite polite, they, they just wanted to know some facts about where I am coming from and they say as soon as that, you can take a car and go wherever you want to go. </sentence><sentence id="996">So I was not, they did not, the British authorities in Palestine did not interfere whatsoever with my movements. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1039">Q: What do you think about the responsibility of the organizers of this voyage, the people who really organized the trip? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1041">A: The organization, really the only thing they were interested is to get as many, as much money as possible out of this thing and irregardless of life conditions or anything like it. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Just like butchers, to take so many people into such a small space. </sentence><sentence id="1043">My, I consider it to be criminal, because there was, if you look, afterwards, if you look at the condition of the ship, there is no way that the ship would ever, ever, even manage to get into the Mediterranean. </sentence><sentence id="1044">With what? </sentence><sentence id="1045">You see, it was old engine, it was cracked. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Now, you have a cracked engine, it will be very difficult to make it work. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And yet, it was for them, for the organizer, this was like something is very normal, that the ship had no living conditions, they considered this normal, so. </sentence><sentence id="1048">Of course, I know, it's war time, but there is a certain limit that you can allow yourself to do things, even though it's war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1057">Q: I understood that the ship was built in 1830. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1059">A: It was, I wouldn't even call that a ship, really, it was just a, a piece of steel that they put some wood on top of it and superstructure and they thought that that would be good enough. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Actually I don't think the organizer even expected that this so-called vessel, will ever reach anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1061">But it was an excellent way of getting money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
