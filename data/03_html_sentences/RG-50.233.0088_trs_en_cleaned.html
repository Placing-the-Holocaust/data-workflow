<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Was he able to continue practicing medicine? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Well that's an interesting story -- because he served in the First World War and had been decorated for distinguished service the army kind of was able to protect their own as it were and Hitler couldn't do very much. </sentence><sentence id="16">So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better. </sentence><sentence id="17">So we stayed in Germany until 1939 which isn't to say that we didn't want to leave earlier. </sentence><sentence id="18">After Kristallnacht I don't think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the country. </sentence><sentence id="19">I wouldn't say the fate of all Jews because it wasn't known at that time. </sentence><sentence id="20">So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in Essen alone with my grandfather, my father's father, while they were getting ready in Berlin, they bought all this furniture that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="21">And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in Essen or my grandparents in Heidelberg while they would leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: So your grandfather in Essen, would that be on your father's side of the family? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: So the fact that he was a war veteran and a physician didn't make any difference? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: At that point it didn't matter anymore. </sentence><sentence id="66">At that point Hitler had taken over the army. </sentence><sentence id="67">And so the army was powerless. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Was this after you were born this happened or before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Oh, after. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was after Kristallnacht I guess. </sentence><sentence id="75">Oh yeah, that was just before the...probably "38 or something like that </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="542">A: My parents were the kind of people who would want to shelter their children from everything, any harm. </sentence><sentence id="543">And that happened until my father died last spring. </sentence><sentence id="544">Their attitude always was we want to shelter Ellen, we want to protect her, we don't want her to worry. </sentence><sentence id="545">So I think they made very sure never to discuss anything controversial or fearful or [indistinct] around me.[indistinct] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: Did they ever give you a reason why you were moving to Belgium and then eventually moving across the ocean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: No, I wish they had. </sentence><sentence id="554">Let me just go back. </sentence><sentence id="555">This was a story my father told over many, many, many times. </sentence><sentence id="556">My grandparents Hocher would have liked to have come to America and planned to. </sentence><sentence id="557">But it was a question of getting the papers together and everything. </sentence><sentence id="558">And they said to my father and my mother, my father was always the spokesman for the family, why don't you leave Ellen with us in Amsterdam? </sentence><sentence id="559">And you'll be free to settle and get yourself together because after all it's not easy with a little girl and you don't know what awaits you? </sentence><sentence id="560">And then we'll bring Ellen with us. </sentence><sentence id="561">No my father said no, no. </sentence><sentence id="562">No matter how bad things are there always will be enough for Ellen. </sentence><sentence id="563">Wherever we go Ellen will go with us. </sentence><sentence id="564">There will always be enough. </sentence><sentence id="565">And so we finally got out January 1940. </sentence><sentence id="566">May 10" was the invasion and all borders were closed. </sentence><sentence id="567">So the fact that I'm here talking to you is a double miracle, maybe a triple one. </sentence><sentence id="568">One is that my father didn't say yeah that might be a good idea, let's do that and then I would have been killed with my grandparents probably in Sobibor or elsewhere because I would have been too young to useful. </sentence><sentence id="569">The second is that our number came up before the invasion. </sentence><sentence id="570">It was just luck. </sentence><sentence id="571">We could have been sitting there and it could have been July and we might still not have our number. </sentence><sentence id="572">So that's a clear-cut two. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: 1940 going back. </sentence><sentence id="618">So that's three, but you thought of another one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="621">Q: Well not another one but what struck me was that you'd always been afraid that your parents would leave you behind and yet here your father had this golden opportunity to leave you behind and yet he said no and you weren't there to hear this. </sentence><sentence id="622">If you'd only heard this conversation then, there all of your worries and your concerns probably would have evaporated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="625">A: Yeah, yeah, because a lot of my memories from Holland was I'm supposed to take a bath and go to bed. </sentence><sentence id="626">And I decide I don't want to take a bath but I don't want anyone to get angry at me so I get undressed, I have the bath water drawn and I'm standing there but I figure if I don't put my foot in the water I'1l never have to take the bath and I won't have to go to bed and then my parents won't leave me in the middle of the night while I'm sleeping and never come back. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="657">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="658">It may have been at that time when that conversation came up. </sentence><sentence id="659">It was at that time I was fearful of taking a bath because I thought my parents would leave and never come back. </sentence><sentence id="660">And at that time I guess that's when we said our good-byes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: Do you remember saying good-bye to those grandparents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: No, I don't think I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: Nobody thought about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: I don't think people thought about these things. </sentence><sentence id="704">My father wouldn't go to Holland because he was a doctor and he didn't have any connections there. </sentence><sentence id="705">So we had some connections in America so we figured ... somehow my father didn't want to stay around because there was talk of Australia if we couldn't get into America. </sentence><sentence id="706">That was a possibility, to go to Australia. </sentence><sentence id="707">Never wanted to go to Palestine. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: It was my mother who said how things happened overnight. </sentence><sentence id="718">My father had tremendous ambivalence about leaving Germany. </sentence><sentence id="719">Germany had been a source of success, friendship and many things. </sentence><sentence id="720">And when we came here he says [spoken in German] which means we got to thank God every day that he brought us to this God damn country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: Meaning the United States of America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="728">And I used to hear in the beginning years after that how wonderful Germany was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="731">Q: Before the Nazis came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="733">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="734">So my father used to live in his stories to me more in what happened before the Nazis except for his overcoming. </sentence><sentence id="735">He never shared feelings vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="736">He never shared feeling Jewish, never talked about stuff like this, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="737">All he said is they thought he was a mad man and he would burn himself out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="743">Q: You're talking about Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="745">A: Hitler, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="746">He really felt that he could outlive Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="751">A: He was right, but only because he left. </sentence><sentence id="752">And he was very reluctant to leave. </sentence><sentence id="753">All he did was save us. </sentence><sentence id="754">We don't fight the language. </sentence><sentence id="755">He made me speak German. </sentence><sentence id="756">I'm bilingual. </sentence><sentence id="757">He said we're not fighting the language, just the people. </sentence><sentence id="758">And he used to talk about [in German]. </sentence><sentence id="759">So you had a sense of who was good and who wasn't good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: So it wasn't the people even, it was some people bad and some people good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="772">And he spoke about sometimes about friends who hadn't survived, people he was very close to who were very successful, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="773">But that was the irony of some people [indistinct] that their country would turn on them. </sentence><sentence id="774">So my father thought [indistinct]. </sentence><sentence id="775">Just my mother who said overnight you never knew what was happening next. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: Would you say that your mother was more eager to leave than your father was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: Well, you see my father's father was still in Germany and my mother's parents had gone to Holland so in a way perhaps but I think they both had really decided. </sentence><sentence id="784">The minute my father couldn't practice medicine he resolved to leave. </sentence><sentence id="785">And he also said many years later he would never go back to a country that had thrown him out. </sentence><sentence id="786">Never go to visit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
