<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Was he able to continue practicing medicine? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Well that's an interesting story -- because he served in the First World War and had been decorated for distinguished service the army kind of was able to protect their own as it were and Hitler couldn't do very much. </sentence><sentence id="16">So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better. </sentence><sentence id="17">So we stayed in Germany until 1939 which isn't to say that we didn't want to leave earlier. </sentence><sentence id="18">After Kristallnacht I don't think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the country. </sentence><sentence id="19">I wouldn't say the fate of all Jews because it wasn't known at that time. </sentence><sentence id="20">So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in Essen alone with my grandfather, my father's father, while they were getting ready in Berlin, they bought all this furniture that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="21">And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in Essen or my grandparents in Heidelberg while they would leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
