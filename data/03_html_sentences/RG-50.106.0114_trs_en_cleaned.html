<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: When did you start becoming aware of Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: I think because of the interest in reading we had, we were really quite young, because Mother's two spinster sisters had both been to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="138">Quite unusual at that particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had both been in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="139">My Aunt Agnes had -- had been in Germany a number of times and studied there. </sentence><sentence id="140">Aunt Belle had been with her also. </sentence><sentence id="141">But we would have, when Aunt Belle and Aunt -- Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and visiting about Europe. </sentence><sentence id="142">So really as younger people we were aware of at least Europe. </sentence><sentence id="143">Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly. </sentence><sentence id="144">And I'm speaking now    Interview with Richard Peterson " April 6, 1999 of -- of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="145">News-wise, later though, because it wasn't of course until I was getting into later grade school that the world news became more and more important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Did your parents talk that over with you? </sentence><sentence id="156">How aware were you of the situation getting worse in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: We were aware because first of all we had the "Des Moines Register," the state paper that the folks read avidly, they would discuss it. </sentence><sentence id="160">We had radio news basically as well, too. </sentence><sentence id="161">So I think probably as -- as things were beginning to develop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in the late 1930's. </sentence><sentence id="162">And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second of September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: What was your personal reaction when -- in September "39? </sentence><sentence id="168">Do you remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Yes, [remember quite clearly because that morning, I remember coming into the kitchen, the paper was there and Dad was very disturbed, having read the -- the war that -- the word had come that -- that of course as we remember, Germany had moved into the -- in-into -- into Danzig, and then that the British gave the ultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard Neville Chamberlain saying that they were given ultimatum, we have rece -- [indecipherable] undertaking, so    Interview with Richard Peterson deg April 6, 1999 we're therefore at war. </sentence><sentence id="172">I remember Dad being disturbed, Mother to a degree too, but I-I think -- I think maybe -- maybe Dad was more evident about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: And you were in what grade? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: Well, I would have been at that time, which was 1939, in -- I'd bega -- I began school as a five year old in 1930, so I-- I would have been about the eighth or ninth grade at that time, or in that period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: Did you feel threatened at all by that news? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: Not really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="182">That came a bit later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Okay, so you continued to go to school in 1939. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: And your life did not change immediately? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Correct, correct, but the real -- the real change came in April of 1940, the next spring, during the first [indecipherable] of course it was the so-called static war, nothing happening basically. </sentence><sentence id="192">But it was in April, the next April, when Germany moved into first Denmark and then the Scandinavian countries, and that was very -- very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to Grandma and Grandpa's, they're still living. </sentence><sentence id="193">This time they were in -- in the 80's. </sentence><sentence id="194">But I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the sun in the early morning as if he were stunned. </sentence><sentence id="195">The war did come. </sentence><sentence id="196">And I said in    Interview with Richard Peterson deg April 6, 1999 Danish, Bedstefar [Danish]. </sentence><sentence id="197">Yeah, da -- I'll put it sa -- put it in Danish again.[Speaks Danish here] The Germans have Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="198">And then in English he says, poor little Denmark, she couldn't do a thing. </sentence><sentence id="199">She couldn't do a thing. </sentence><sentence id="200">And he just -- he'd been in the German army, you se -- oh, I'm sorry, the -- the Danish army. </sentence><sentence id="201">And of course it was a great history in the 1860's when Grandpa was in Denmark growing up, of the first -- you know, th-the first war with Germany. </sentence><sentence id="202">And then of course the World War II is -- World War -- war was there also, but this was a really traumatic thing for them. </sentence><sentence id="203">And we -- we sensed that, we could see that in -- in--in their -- in their make-up, what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: And did you respond in any way, did you feel threatened then, because of the connection to your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Oh, I think -- I think not too much at that time. </sentence><sentence id="221">We knew things of course were getting much more so because following that of course we recall Norway fell, and then of course Germany moved into -- in to the low countries and on and then of course there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went through the Ardennes, to the great -- the great shock and surprise of the French and British. </sentence><sentence id="222">And then of course the -- the escape of the British at Dunkirk to get across, we -- that was a lot in the news, we were very, very aware of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: So this is a young -- as a teenager, you followed in the news. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="228">  Interview with Richard Peterson " April 6, 1999 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: Quite a bit, because in school we would also -- not by tha -- by this time we're getting into -- into -- into high school. </sentence><sentence id="230">I would have begun high school -- I began high school, it would have been in -- it had begun in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="231">I begun just that fall. </sentence><sentence id="232">In high school the current affairs magazines, the teachers were visiting about it back and forth, even though the war was still in Europe, of course, basically. </sentence><sentence id="233">But we were quite aware of it, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Up to that point, did you have any Jewish friends, were there any Jewish families living in your town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="242">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="243">Polish friends as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="244">I was in grade school with Marvin Richards, with Stanley Krazney(ph), both of Jewish -- and some -- and some girls, too. </sentence><sentence id="245">So we -- we -- we had good friends that were, yes. </sentence><sentence id="246">We were just youngsters, of course, but then on into high school we -- we had number of Jewish families in Council Bluffs, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: And did you read anything in the newspaper about what was happening to the Jews in Germany in the 30's and so forth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: To my recollection, nothing that I recall, no. </sentence><sentence id="256">Although I do recall Dad brought ho -- brought hom -- brought home a story once from the office, very facetious, a fun story. </sentence><sentence id="257">He had some Jewish clients and th -- interestingly enough, h -- Dad represented one side, the other attorney in his o -- the other people, and they were    Interview with Richard Peterson " April 6, 1999 visiting back and forth, the Jewish gentlemen ga -- came quite involved back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="258">And finally as they left, the first group left, Dad's client remained, leaned over and says, can you blame Hitler? </sentence><sentence id="259">Can you blame Hitler? </sentence><sentence id="260">But that -- that was a kind of a -- of a joke sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="261">But there had been word obviously at the time that things were happening in Germany as far as anti-Semitic things basically, but no greater awareness at the time, I would say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: And no evidence -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: As far as I would -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: -- of anti -- and no evidence of anti-Semitism in your town? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: Was it a frightening prospect? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="393">I--I think at that time there was so much -- so much patriotism. </sentence><sentence id="394">You know, remember Pearl Harbor and so forth, and of course Germany declared war right away too on this, as you recall -- as one recalls. </sentence><sentence id="395">So, I don't think -- I don't think wa -- it was a fearful project. </sentence><sentence id="396">Our feeling was everybody's in it, we will be too, and it's a part of party responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="397">It's a gr -- a gr -- a great sense of patriotism at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1261">Q: And you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1262">A: We were on the reverse, or south side of a hill, in strength, meaning we were -- we were -- we were actually well reinforced, the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1263">We -- A company at that time was the -- was in the lead. </sentence><sentence id="1264">To explain, I am the lead. </sentence><sentence id="1265">Normally in a battalion, if the battalion, for example is committed, two companies would be side by side, the third in reserve. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And the same with two bi-- there might be two ba -- battalions there, and the third in reserve. </sentence><sentence id="1267">At that time A company then, we -- we were leading in the attack into this town called Attendorn. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And the result was, up the hillside, I remember then around the c -- as we made the curve on a roadway and began working through the trees, we looked across and there was a treeburst    Interview with Richard Peterson %8 April 6, 1999 on the distant hill. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Let me explain treeburst. </sentence><sentence id="1270">Artillery shells are so constructed, either number one, they're solid shells, or secondly explosive shells. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Explosive shells are ones that have a very sensitive tip on the end. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And the minute that even touches any object, even a twig, it would explode. </sentence><sentence id="1273">Very sen -- and in a fa-- in an artillery barrage, if the barrage is going into wooded area, as it would hit the trees, it'd break and that's called a treeburst. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Very, very dangerous because of the -- the shell -- shrapnel just spins right down. </sentence><sentence id="1275">That was at a distance though, but --- "m speaking to you. </sentence><sentence id="1276">Then we came around the top of the hill and then ahead of us, red tile roof and so on, was this very sizable town, which was Attendorn. </sentence><sentence id="1277">We came up through -- I si-- the company, I mean basically, I remember we're coming past some of the units of our cannon company, the cannon company and -- the cannon company is a large, self propelled, it's a one-oh-five. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) of our company at that particular time, was our assistant company commander, but he also has some direction and control over the fourth platoon, the weapons platoon, he was helping on that too. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Weapons platoon then began setting up machine gun for so-called covering fire because then we got the order and our platoon, third platoon began going down a rather steep hill on the run, on the double, rifles up well, ther-there ha -- we call porter, to attack the town. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And then we began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s. </sentence><sentence id="1281">We learned afterwards that    Interview with Richard Peterson deg April 6, 1999 the entire Ruhr was so much attacked by allied aircraft that they had a tremendous amount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft material. </sentence><sentence id="1282">88s and 20-20s. </sentence><sentence id="1283">When there were no longer these air attacks because the stage the war, they would simply level those and use against the aca -- ca-- oncoming Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1284">So we had a lot of--a lot of 88s coming in, artillery. </sentence><sentence id="1285">There was a 20 millimeter ak-ak, and as we started down the hill, 3" platoon began taking casualties. </sentence><sentence id="1286">We had a sergeant who was killed, our lieutenant was injured. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Several others were injured down the late -- way, too, basically. </sentence><sentence id="1288">This was, as I said, our first real experience of combat. </sentence><sentence id="1289">And it's a strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="1290">You're there, it's happening to you, and yet fortunately, because of the discipline you've had, you -- you're scared, right down in the pit of your stomach, but -- but y-y-you do it, you go on. </sentence><sentence id="1291">Then into this house right nearby -- I sa --I say, then, a number of us. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And then Dave Sargent(ph) -- Sergeant Dave, a sergeant, I remember, was outside, he said okay, because then the next thing we had to do out of the house, Dave directed us down the hill, we went on down the hill to cross a river, a small stream, waist high. </sentence><sentence id="1293">Cold, though. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Up the other side basically and I -- I -- I'd had -- I forgot, basically, but my sergeant says, Pete, you're the first one across. </sentence><sentence id="1295">So I crossed the river, up onto the other side, cold, rifles held high to keep them dry, and there was sniper fire coming in over the railroad. </sentence><sentence id="1296">Then across the railroad, we got across okay, but you get -- for the first    Interview with Richard Peterson *deg April 6, 1999 time you're getting some vicious snapping -- you know, th-the -- or sniping, around. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Then it seems that the Germans must have pulled out. </sentence><sentence id="1298">We learned however, later on, that one of our men, fourth platoon was asked and did, because he had good German, go in with a white flag and their at -- their -- see if they surrender. </sentence><sentence id="1299">The company man who thought they might. </sentence><sentence id="1300">They wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1301">The name was Bob Oelke, o-e-I-k-e. The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him, tossed him in the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1302">With presence of mind he went into the next room, because they tossed in some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1344">But that we learned later. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Into the town and then we began moving through. </sentence><sentence id="1346">We, meaning the third platoon, we were still there. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Now, at that time, as we moved along, by this time it's probably three, four in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1348">Cobblestone streets, rifles on the ready, covering each other. </sentence><sentence id="1349">This is called a mopping up operation. </sentence><sentence id="1350">But the Germans seemed to have pulled out -- I mean, I don't remember anything more at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1351">And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone street [indecipherable] that we approached a factory area. </sentence><sentence id="1352">Obviously there was some -- and then behind this barbed wire fence were these people, unkempt, dirty, emaciated and Mac -- I'm sorry, MacGilvery(ph), in charge, I was behind him, went up and opened the gate. </sentence><sentence id="1353">Now, at this point I must explain that for some reason, for some reason, I do not personally recall Mac opening the gate, but I    Interview with Richard Peterson * April 6, 1999 have talked to him, I say Mac is Sergeant MacGilvery(ph) of Dallas, Texas. </sentence><sentence id="1354">He -- he had detail -- details I'd forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="1355">Strange about memory, some things you -- but Mac is very explicit that he'd opened the gate. </sentence><sentence id="1356">The people were in there. </sentence><sentence id="1357">They realized apparently we're Americans, uniforms ra -- they began crowding out and --and -- and -- and -- and trying to embrace us, and -- and -- and kiss us apparently. </sentence><sentence id="1358">I don't recall that. </sentence><sentence id="1359">But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was confirmed by -- by sar -- Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by Lieutenant -- then Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph), horrible, heavy, heavy stench and odor. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Again, I -- this I didn't recall and I'm surprised because "m normally pretty aware of olfactory things. </sentence><sentence id="1361">But it was there, amb -- obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1362">What I do recall though now, very clearly, myself. </sentence><sentence id="1363">We had gone into a nearby building, because Mac's determination was we gotta -- gotta watch out for whate -- there might be krauts around. </sentence><sentence id="1364">Kraut being the derogative name for German. </sentence><sentence id="1365">There might be krauts here, they gotta check it out. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And I remember stepping into the building now, and I think it -- it was a large room, maybe 50 by 50 or so. </sentence><sentence id="1367">And I do remember there were -- there were some bodies lying around and I remember Mac started to walk over across the room. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Now, in his detail, Sergeant MacGilvery(ph), Mac said that there was a skull that he recognized, it -- he -- he's from Texas. </sentence><sentence id="1369">It was horse's skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And walked over. </sentence><sentence id="1371">This I remember too, beca    Interview with Richard Peterson * April 6, 1999 -- he walked over and there was an old -- to me appeared to be an old woman, crouched down, holding something. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And -- and Mac was over there, paused for a moment, came back, fury in his eyes and said, now I'm being explicit. </sentence><sentence id="1373">Those goddamn fucking krauts, look how they treat these poor sons of bitches. </sentence><sentence id="1374">The lady is scraping out that horse's skull for food and eating it. </sentence><sentence id="1375">Gee, well. </sentence><sentence id="1376">He also said, forget about the goddamn horse, they've scraped all the meat off that too. </sentence><sentence id="1377">There was a heavy -- I remember it now, this at -- there was a heavy odor and -- and we walked past and -- and there was a body. </sentence><sentence id="1378">I'm not sure dead or alive, but -- but -- but Mac pointed out the face and he -- he -- look at that poor son of a bitch's legs, they were -- they were apparently gangrenous and this heavy odor must have been putrid-putri-putrefaction, I'm guessing. </sentence><sentence id="1379">Back out into the street, fresh air thank God, because all the other -- and on back out and I remember we got back out in the street and as our patrol got back out there, somebody behind me was throwing up, one of our guys be -- just -- just the impact of it. </sentence><sentence id="1380">And Mac said, and I did remember this, that a lot of -- they were laborers mostly, whatever, you know [indecipherable] people were out in the street, they just kind of wandered out, the gate was open. </sentence><sentence id="1381">A -- an officer came along and advised that we had to get them back inside because they needed attention, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And they could not be wandering the street by themselves, so somehow, and I don't recall, they must    Interview with Richard Peterson *s April 6, 1999 have been herded back in, because after that then we -- we moved ahead and we were on our way after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1495">A: Not long. </sentence><sentence id="1496">My own recollection was that -- that our -- our going into the room where the -- the horse's skeleton was, probably three, maybe five minutes at the outside, because it was, as I said, Mac got right over, saw what it was, and we just left pretty quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1497">There were no German soldiers at all to run -- there -- there -- there -- the Germans had pulled out apparently -- apparently. </sentence><sentence id="1498">So we were out of there within oh, I'd say probably five minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1499">A little longer, then probably get out of the compound, back out on the street again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
