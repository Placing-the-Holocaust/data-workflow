<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: It was. </sentence><sentence id="264">But I wouldn't venture out of the office, because most of the wounded were both Romania soldiers and some German. </sentence><sentence id="265">As I mentioned at this point, Jewish kids were kicked out of school and the community had organized it's own schools. </sentence><sentence id="266">High school was down the street from us and looking back, I could just . . . </sentence><sentence id="267">the incongruity of it that under such circumstances, every Jewish child studied music. </sentence><sentence id="268">Kept, every day you could see them walk  down to school with their instruments. </sentence><sentence id="269">I studied the violin and it kept us indoors and we had no radio or television or any other entertainment. </sentence><sentence id="270">This was something other than book... .books. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="713">A: Oh, I stopped thinking, now we started action. </sentence><sentence id="714">Having left a burning Europe and having seen where we wanted to go, we started organizing and preparing for whatever is needed of us. </sentence><sentence id="715">We started with the help of Israeli shlichim(tm), we started preparing paramilitary organizations and training and studying Hebrew and engaging or preparing to engage in escape from the camps. </sentence><sentence id="716">The camps were serviced by the British, but they employed Greek, Greeks for cleaning the camps, providing provisions to the camp, so there was a daily  9 exchange of comings and goings, of bringing in materials and taking out waste products and that was enough for our organization. </sentence><sentence id="717">By now we were organized with representatives from Israel and we were called the Haganah, and with contacts with these Greeks that like us in Israel, were trying to get rid of the British control of the island. </sentence><sentence id="718">So in exchange of their help for our escapees, for every one of us, they received a gun that the Israelis brought from Israel. </sentence><sentence id="719">That's the curiosity of arms tradings, the Israelis would buy them from the British and give them to the Greeks, so they can fight the British. </sentence><sentence id="720">That's how armaments travel. </sentence><sentence id="721">But we engaged in, first of all, observations of their movements. </sentence><sentence id="722">The camps were surrounded by two fences of barbed wire and in between, this concertina barbed wire rows. </sentence><sentence id="723">And we began to escape through the barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="724">My specialty was to crawl into the concertina, so that when we split it, it doesn't start running away, because every 50 meters there were guards posted on towers. </sentence><sentence id="725">So this is where we started taking out youngsters of military age, every week, every night, eight to 10 people, bringing back the wires and tying up the fence back so that nothing can be suspected. </sentence><sentence id="726">As the youngsters left the fence, they would walk to a road where the Greeks would pick them up and take them to an orange grove, many orange groves around there, and house them for a time, when we had 40, 50 escapees collected together. </sentence><sentence id="727">At that point, Israeli fisherman would come, with permits to fish in Turkish waters and by pre-arrangement with lights and signs, we were able to board them and take them on little fishing boats, to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="728">Many times we were caught by the British and the punishment for that was to interrogate you, for which they always got the same response, that nobody organizes us, we just get together and decide to leave. </sentence><sentence id="729">The punishment was to transfer you to the other camps. </sentence><sentence id="730">We thought we would be strangers there, but there we were waited for and after a month or so we would do the same thing there, so that in punishment we would be returned. </sentence><sentence id="731">After several times and many funny exploits, it turned out that the safest place to escape was through their camps. </sentence><sentence id="732">They would be sleeping in tents the British and we would pass through there and get out of the camps. </sentence><sentence id="733">Right through the fence, just the fence that bordered to their encampment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
