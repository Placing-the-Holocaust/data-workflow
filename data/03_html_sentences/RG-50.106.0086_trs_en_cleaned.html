was a lot of excitement and a lot of kissing and a lot of crying. </sentence><sentence id="744">And I got on the train. </sentence><sentence id="745">And as I was waving, I remember saying my raincoat isn't here. </sentence><sentence id="746">My raincoat isn't here. </sentence><sentence id="747">Well, even my cousin couldn't catch the train, but it really wasn't so terrible because Imy parents could have sent it to me. </sentence><sentence id="748">And anyway I got to Cologne. </sentence><sentence id="749">And it was a nice ride. </sentence><sentence id="750">I had pleasant company in the

me by car to the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="752">I had dinner there and went right to bed because I was tired emotionally and physically, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="753">Well I wasn't a dreamer normally, but in the middle out of nowhere, I heard my mother saying Tiaute, that's what she used to call me. </sentence><sentence id="754">And I thought I was dreaming. </sentence><sentence id="755">And then I heard something knocking on the door again. </sentence><sentence id="756">And I still thought I was dreaming, but I wasn't dreaming. </sentence><sentence id="757">My mother had taken the next train and come and rode all night through and got into Cologne around four or 5:00 in the morning to bring me the raincoat. </sentence><sentence id="758">And they decided to spendshe decided to spend the day with me in Cologne because my train wasn't leaving until that night. </sentence><sentence id="759">Well, to begin with, they didn't want to do it because it was costly, and they didn't feel like they should spend that money, but I guess they decided in the last minute that my mother wanted to do it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="760">So we spent the whole day in Cologne and it was really wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="761">We went sightseeing. </sentence><sentence id="762">We did everything together. </sentence><sentence id="763">It was sad, but it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="764">And forgive me. </sentence><sentence id="765">I'm a little tearyeyed. </sentence><sentence id="766">So then from there we went to the train station at night. </sentence><sentence id="767">And she put me on the train and all of the crying started again. </sentence><sentence id="768">Excuse the interruption, but it is very emotional. </sentence><sentence id="769">And we had to leave again so all of the kissing and the goodbyes went again. </sentence><sentence id="770">And I went off to Trias. </sentence><sentence id="771">And my mother took the train back to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="772">Well, we got to Trias, and there again were arrangements and the travel agent seen that we were takenthat I was taken to a hotel which was right in the

there. </sentence><sentence id="775">And I was really scared. </sentence><sentence id="776">But I managed okay. </sentence><sentence id="777">I locked my doors. </sentence><sentence id="778">I went to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="779">And the next morning I was supposed to in Trias get the boat, which was going around the ship of Italy, I mean, the shore of Italy, excuse me, the shore of Italy and my parents just felt like it was wonderful for me to take that trip because God knows when I ever come back to Europe, and they thought it would be a wonderful experience for me because it was a beautiful trip. </sentence><sentence id="780">Well, Hitler marched into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="781">That's what they told us. </sentence><sentence id="782">And they canceled the trip and left us in this horrible hotel. </sentence><sentence id="783">And I had to stay there for three days. </sentence><sentence id="784">They gave us just enough money for the meals, very badly. </sentence><sentence id="785">The whole thing was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="786">And then they put us on a train after three days and the train was like a cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="787">It stopped at every little stop. </sentence><sentence id="788">And we sat on the train all night until we got to Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="789">And I know it wasn't that long of a

a great big car. </sentence><sentence id="792">I really didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="793">There was one couple I got a little bit familiar with who were very kind to me. </sentence><sentence id="794">And when I went out for dinner, they took me. </sentence><sentence id="795">We went to dinner together, which helped a lot. </sentence><sentence id="796">Well, we got into this port in Geneva and they had on the track, right there waswas the alphabet and you were supposed to stand in line to wait for your passage for yourto get on the ship. </sentence><sentence

closed the office. </sentence><sentence id="799">And they made an announcement that everybody who is left has to go back to the hotel and wait there. </sentence><sentence id="800">Well, I was very,

</sentence><sentence id="803">They booked us into thetook us to the cheapest little hotel and they were horrible. </sentence><sentence id="804">And I just sat on my suitcase and everybody else was leaving. </sentence><sentence id="805">And I just sat on my suitcase and cried my eyes out. </sentence><sentence id="806">As I said I was spoiled and I guess I shouldn't have done that, but I did it. </sentence><sentence id="807">And some young man came up and asked me what was the matter. </sentence><sentence id="808">He was part of the ship line. </sentence><sentence id="809">And he said he was very sorry, he couldn't help me at all, but he'll call the manager of the department and I said well I'll sleep here. </sentence><sentence id="810">I'm not leaving. </sentence><sentence id="811">So
