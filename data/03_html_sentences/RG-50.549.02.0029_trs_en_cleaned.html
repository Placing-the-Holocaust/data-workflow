<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: -- first to start by saying your name and where you're from and where we're -- where we are right now, and the date. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Leon Chameides, originally pronounced Humeidis and we're now sitting at 65 Westbridge Drive, in West Hartford, Connecticut, my current home. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in Cutuvitsa, Poland in south -- southern Poland, in 1935. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Okay, now, Dr. Chameides, | -- I'd like to start a little bit -- just before the period that we -- we were planning to begin. </sentence><sentence id="10">Just at those -- those last days that you recall before liberation. </sentence><sentence id="11">Did you have an anticipation that something was -- was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="12">What -- Do you recall what your feelings were at thas -- that time just before -- just before liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: I think, first of all, I have to emphasize the fact that in 1944, I was nine years old. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I had been away from home for a little over two years, since August of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="19">And if you remember your feelings at nine years of age, it's very difficult to separate out, and to recall exactly what one's feelings were at that time and what occurred later and I'm very - - always very careful not to read in things that occurred later and attribute them to that time. </sentence><sentence id="20">I was in a small village by the name of Univ, which is near the large city of Lvov, now in the Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="21">Univ was very close to the extermination camp of Belzyce. </sentence><sentence id="22">But I was hidden in a monastery, the Univ monastery was the mother monastery of the stunite   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 3 monks of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. </sentence><sentence id="23">I was, by that time, a Greek Catholic in my -- in my approach really, but with fairly vivid feelings and recollections of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="24">And we, of course, knew that things were happening, because the front was coming closer and closer to us. </sentence><sentence id="25">There were the tremendous amount of warfare. </sentence><sentence id="26">The Ukrainian partisans were fighting on the German side and then saw that Germany was going to lose and there was a lot of confusion. </sentence><sentence id="27">So a lot of the village people were involved in the fighting, and the fighting -- the front came close and closer to us. </sentence><sentence id="28">We could hear it, we could see it's effects. </sentence><sentence id="29">I'm not sure that I had any feeling in terms of that I was going to be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="30">It was -- There was a certain amount of excitement in the -- in a war coming, but of course we had been through this so many times before, that the issue then was primarily how to survive and how to get the next meal. </sentence><sentence id="31">I think those were much more of immediate concern to us -- or to me, at least, than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="32">For reasons I'm not clear, we had one healer, I don't know whether he was a physician or not, but one person who knew something about medicine in the area, that I managed to become his helper at the ripe age of nine and we set up a -- a hospital in the church and we brought in -- the wounded were brought in from the -- and one of my jobs -- course, we had no medicines at all, and one of my jobs was after the battles, to run into the forest and to rummage around, find dead soldiers, particularly if they were German, because they would usually have bandages and first aid material on them, and get as much of that material as possible. </sentence><sentence id="33">If they were bandaged -- their wounds were bandaged, I would take the wou -- bandages off and then run back and wash them, so we could use them on the -- on the    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 4 Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="34">This helped me a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="35">It taught me a lot and also, it -- it helped me because on Sundays, the farmers, the families would come and then -- and they would -- to see their husbands and youngsters and -- and I would always be around and so I would get eggs and cheese and milk and so there was food. </sentence><sentence id="36">So, we knew something was coming, the front was coming closer to us, the bombardments were more common. </sentence><sentence id="37">One heard a lot of shooting a-around and so we knew something big was -- was about to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="62">And then, a-a-appreciating the fact that you were nine and that you're not going -- going to recall, of course, all the details or even, you know, looking back at -- those number of years to exactly what you were feeling at the time, and appreciating that fact that you don't want to reconstruct something, as you just said, what do you recall about those actual first moments of realizing that something was really changing now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Well, unfortunately for us, again, in my position, not that much changed, because when the Russians entered, I was on the wrong side, because almost as soon as the Russians entered, which as I recall was in June of 1944, Stalin, as you recall, was a firm opponent of the Greek Catholic Church. </sentence><sentence id="66">The Greek Catholic Church was a nationalist church, it was very much bound up with Ukrainian nationalism and with a drive for independence on the part of the Ukraine, from the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="67">And so Stalin, who eventually outlawed the Greek Catholic Church, imme -- almost immediately began persecuting the priests. </sentence><sentence id="68">And so, we would see now, instead of Jews being shot, we would see priests being shot. </sentence><sentence id="69">And so, one day, I had heard that there was a -- a horse drawn USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 5 wagon going to be going to the big city of Lvov and I felt that I had to get out of Univ and so I took one of the younger boys, who is now in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="70">His name now is Oded Amarand, but at that time, his name was Dodo, and we decided we would walk to this nearby village -- I have no i-idea of how much of a distance that was, in order to try to get this wagon, and on the way, we were stopped by Russian soldiers a-and a Russian patrol stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="71">And children were very often used as spies, so we were highly suspect. </sentence><sentence id="72">And I remember sitting in, behind a bush, crouched with my arms up in the air as this Russian was standing in front of us, not knowing -- with a tommy gun -- not knowing what to do. </sentence><sentence id="73">And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I talked them into allowing us to go to a farmhouse and -- which he did, and eventually he let us go back to Univ. </sentence><sentence id="74">A- And then, it was I think several weeks before another horse drawn carriage was going -- this time I think from Univ, if I recall correctly, and to Lvov, which is a ridiculously small distance when covered by car, but is incredibly lengthy by horse-drawn carriage. </sentence><sentence id="75">And I was able to get on that and went to Lvov, to the mother church, Santa Yura -- which is the Ukrainian for Saint George, in Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="76">And it was in Santa Yura, and I don't know how long I was there at this time, I don't get the impression it was a long time, but I really don't have a good concept of time, it could have been weeks, or might have been months, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="77">But i-it was during the morning mass that I remember, which was celebrated by Brat Yosef, Brother Joseph was his name, I remember the way he looked, a bald head with a white beard. </sentence><sentence id="78">And he was celebrating the mass and in the middle of the mass, in walked two boys who were dressed differently than I was. </sentence><sentence id="79">But the dress and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 6 their faces were familiar to me, but I wasn't sure from where. </sentence><sentence id="80">I was dressed at the time in pants made of burlap, because we had nothing, and shoes made of -- of wood, soles made of wood, because there was no leather. </sentence><sentence id="81">And here come these two boys, who are already better dressed. </sentence><sentence id="82">They're in short pants, in a western style, better material. </sentence><sentence id="83">And that was -- one of the boys was my brother and the other one was a young man who is now a chemist in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="84">And they motioned to me and -- and I went with them and I remember going to have something to eat first, because we didn't eat before mass and so we had something to eat and -- and they took me out of the monastery. </sentence><sentence id="85">So -- So that's how I got out of the monastery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: When did you realize that that was your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: | -- I think -- I think I realized almost immediately, but I wasn't a hundred percent certain. </sentence><sentence id="112">I hadn't seen him in a -- two and a half years and at that age, there's a big change that occurs in -- in people. </sentence><sentence id="113">But I -- I think I realized almost immediately that it was. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="114">Cause I had thought about him a great deal while I was in hiding and the -- the Studite monks made a tremendous effort to always keep us separated, because they were afraid that if we were ever together, we would not only give each other away, but they were in mortal danger themselves, because they were really -- would -- would have been killed had it been known they were hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="115">So -- And I remember once, I was in Univ, in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="116">I found a pair of pants that I was absolutely certain were his and that were hidden there, but I'm -- I'm not sure the -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="117"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Do you recall when you finally realized and when you did, you know, connect with him? </sentence><sentence id="119">Do you -- Do you -- Do you remember? </sentence><sentence id="120">Was it -- Was it sa -- Was there enough tension so that the -- the reunion wasn't particularly joyful at the -- at that moment or d- do you recall? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: You know, I don't, and I honestly don't remember emotions very well and -- and again, you know, we had been through so many eventful days and so many eventful months and years, that it seemed like I was almost numb and that nothing surprised me, so here it is. </sentence><sentence id="122">I mean, I -- I don't -- unless I don't remember correctly, which is also possible, but I do not recall a particularly strong emotion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: That makes me wonder whether, I mean, especially with children and you see children nowadays in Bosnia, for example, whether they -- di-di-did you have an idea that this was not normal, what you were going through, or did you just think this is what hap -- not that you would have consciously thought, but did -- do you recall if you would have thought, "This is not normal, this is not supposed to be happening?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: 1 -- I don't think I had -- I don't think I had sophisticated thoughts of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="127">I -- I think clearly, you know, at -- at least at the very beginning, I missed my parents tremendously. </sentence><sentence id="128">I was terribly scared a good portion of the time. </sentence><sentence id="129">But -- But the immediate things were hunger, were -- were loneliness, were trying to make sure that one didn't give oneself away by either saying one was Jewish -- we were particularly marked because it - - we were in a society where only Jews were circumcised, so I was always -- I had to be very, very careful, never go -- to go to the bathroom when other boys were there, never to </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="134"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 8 bathe together. </sentence><sentence id="135">So, I was always conscious -- so it was this type of peculiar thing, where on the one hand, you know, I followed the ritual of -- of the Catholic church, on the other hand, I -- there was a conscious part of me, because I had to be conscious in order not to give myself away. </sentence><sentence id="136">But, I think children have an incredible capacity to adapt and -- and I think only those who adapted remained alive. </sentence><sentence id="137">I think those who didn't adapt or couldn't adapt, didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="138">So, in a way, there's already a group that's -- there's a selection process there. [ </sentence><sentence id="139">sneezes] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Bless you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Excuse me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: So, what you're describing, in terms of -- whereas for some people in -- in other parts of Europe, there -- there was a liberation, there was a sense that, you know, this chapter is over. </sentence><sentence id="144">But in -- What you're describing is -- is at least up -- up through parts of 1946, exchanged one oppressor for another, such -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well, not through "46, because this was -- we did not stay under the Russians til "46, so -- so th -- what I'm describing now, is the immediate liberation by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="146">And again, you know, I think every person, of course, is different and -- and adapts differently, but also, I think the age makes a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="147">I notice, for instance, people who were just a few years older than I, had different reactions than I did, because they -- I think you develop a sense of perspective and -- and -- and knowledge of the world, which, I think at the age of seven, or even nine, y-you just don't have. </sentence><sentence id="148">So, y-you have a different, you know -- you may develop the skills for survival and the skills for turning </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="153"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 9 yourself into someone else and pretending to be someone else, but -- but -- but you can't put that into a perspective. </sentence><sentence id="154">So, I mean, to me it was very confusing, because my native language, my mother tongue was German. </sentence><sentence id="155">And -- And as I was a youngster, that was the height of culture. </sentence><sentence id="156">So -- So wh-when the German invasion came in, I thought this was great. </sentence><sentence id="157">Now, I'll be able to speak my language. </sentence><sentence id="158">So, you know, I was naive, I didn't know anything about the persecutions which had already -- I didn't know much about Hitler or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="159">I was in a different age frame and I had a different, you know, perspective on it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: I guess the reason I -- I mentioned "46 was not necessarily that it was going to be continuous oppression for you, but the events of -- I guess it was June "46, and the rampages in -- was it Kilsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Kelsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Kelsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: Well, I was already out of eastern Europe by that time. </sentence><sentence id="174">We, just to go back a little bit, after I was taken out of the monastery, we went to -- the person who was responsible for even knowing that we were in the monastery was Rabbi David Kahana, who became the chief Rabbi of the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="175">And he himself and his wife and two children were hidden in the monastery. </sentence><sentence id="176">He as a priest, his wife as a nun. </sentence><sentence id="177">He wrote a book called, "The Lvov Ghetto Diary." </sentence><sentence id="178">And he was a -- He was good friends with my father. </sentence><sentence id="179">And, in fact, the two of them went to metropolish -- metropolithishipditsky together, which eventually led to th -- him hiding us. </sentence><sentence id="180">So, he knew of our whereabouts. </sentence><sentence id="181">He also knew that our parents </sentence></p><p><sentence id="182">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 10 didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="183">And so he made it his business to make sure that we were taken out of the monastery, whereas, as you know, there were children, including a good friend of mine who was with me in Univ, whose parents not survive, who simply no one knew that they were there and they were just left there, and then became the object of a lot of post-war court cases for the community to try to get some of these children back. </sentence><sentence id="184">So, we went with my brother and -- and Nathan, who was the other boy, to Rabbi Kahana, and Rabbi Kahana told us at that point that our parents had perished and he had a -- a little note that my mother had written, which she gave to him for safekeeping, which he gave us. </sentence><sentence id="185">And then the question was, "Do you know what to do with us?" </sentence><sentence id="186">I was nine, my brother was 11 and a half and my brother had been placed with a family who had survived the war and there was a husband, wife and the young son of his age and they were willing to take him in. </sentence><sentence id="187">And they knew of a woman by the name of Tolla Wasserman -- her maiden name was Ashkenazi, who had been born in 1909, in Lvov and who had gone through the war, was hidden by her maid, she had a Polish maid who was able to cordon off one room in the apartment, very much like Anne Frank's thing, and they remained there for 18 months. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="188">And so she was the only one in the family who survived, she was alone and Mr. and Mrs. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="189">Frost, who were the people that my brother was staying with -- and went to her and asked her whether she would be willing to take me in, and she did. </sentence><sentence id="190">My brother did not remain with the Frosts, he -- he had a lot of difficulty in becoming a part of any new home at all, and -- and left, but I remained with -- with Tolla Wasserman from 1944, I believe </sentence></p><p><sentence id="191"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 11 November, until her death in 1964. </sentence><sentence id="192">And, it was really, I think a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="193">I think, thanks to her that Iam where I am. </sentence><sentence id="194">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Why do you think that -- wa-was it the age difference th-that made it so difficult for your brother, whereas it was possible for you to adapt, even thought it's only two and a half years? </sentence><sentence id="196">Perhaps a significant time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="198">You know, one of the difficulties we always have in -- in trying to ascribe any reasons for anything, is that we have no controls. </sentence><sentence id="199">And I don't know what would have happened to me had I been his age. </sentence><sentence id="200">I think part of it was age, but I don't think it was all age. </sentence><sentence id="201">I think I have had, since then, and -- and before, a tremendous ability to adapt to reality, which served me well, so I think part of it may have been age, but I don't think all of it. </sentence><sentence id="202">I think part of it has to do with personality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="210">So, when you -- I want to ask you to back up just a moment, when you learned of your parents death, was this something that you were almost anticipating learning, or were you shocked? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: No, I -- I was not shocked and I would have been, I think shocked had I learned otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="214">It -- It came as a -- when I think back on it in a very, almost unemotional matter of fact issue. </sentence><sentence id="215">Everyone was dead, I mean it's much more shocking to me now, looking back, than it was at that time. </sentence><sentence id="216">Perhaps that was a protective mechanism, but I didn't -- I don't remember, either shock or sadness, or any type of real feeling about it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="217">It's much more painful to me now than it was then. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="218"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 12 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Do you -- Do you recall at all, what your actual reaction was when you learned? </sentence><sentence id="220">What you said, what you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: I -- [don't recall, but I -- I don't -- I mean, I remember being in the room and I remember being told, and I simply don't remember any reaction at all. </sentence><sentence id="222">I -- I had -- I don't -- didn't have any reaction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="226">Do you f -- Did you feel that living with -- with Tolla Wasserman was -- was like being in a new family, being in a real family, or how did -- how did you feel about her, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Yeah, well, we -- we became very close. </sentence><sentence id="228">I started by calling her Chacha, which is the Polish word for aunt. </sentence><sentence id="229">And within a few weeks, I asked her whether I could call her mother, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="230">So, we became very close. </sentence><sentence id="231">And she had no one. </sentence><sentence id="232">She was a wonderful, wonderful human being, and so I was part of her family, although there was her -- she had lost her husband and lost her family. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="234">So, did you live in different places together or to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Well, in -- in Lvov, if you remember, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin met at the altar and divided th-the eastern sphere and Lvov was given to the Soviet Union when the map of Poland was redrawn. </sentence><sentence id="236">Part of that agreement allowed former Polish citizens to choose whether they wanted to remain there or to move into the western part of Poland, and of course, our intent was to move westward. </sentence><sentence id="237">So, I started going to school in Lvov on -- in Russian school and I did have some education in -- in -- during the war, in Univ, but not a lot. </sentence><sentence id="238">So, I think it was the first time that I really went to an organized school, and then </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="243">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 13 we were given the opportunity to -- to go by train to western Lvov -- to western Poland. </sentence><sentence id="244">We went there sometime in 19 -- I believe it was in the spring of "45 and we went by cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="245">Those were -- The only trains available were cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="246">And there were horrendous stories be -- circulating, of people who had gone before, who would be going on open cattle cars, a distance that before the war used to take maybe two or three hours to cover by train, taking two and three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="247">And the Russians would simply stop in the -- in fields and then -- and just refuse to go on. </sentence><sentence id="248">And there seemed to be no schedule, there was no control. </sentence><sentence id="249">Th-The war was still going on and -- and people were freezing to death in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="250">So there was a lot of fear about going on those trains, but we were very lucky for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="251">One is that Tolla Wasserman, my new mother, had befriended a person - - a doctor and each train had a -- one covered cattle car, which had a Red Cross on it and he suggested that we go in that car, so we had covering. </sentence><sentence id="252">And the second thing he did was, he bought, at enormous expense, a -- a bottle of -- a -- a case of vodka. </sentence><sentence id="253">And the first day we were out, the train stopped in the field and he called the engineer into this covered car End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Okay, continuing now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="268">He took a bottle of vodka out, showed it to the engineer and then heaved it out the open door, and it shattered. </sentence><sentence id="269">And the engineer showed his anguish and he said, "I want you to know that every morning, I'm going to take a bottle and I'm going to throw </sentence></p><p><sentence id="270"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 14 it out the door. </sentence><sentence id="271">Whatever is left in that case when we get to our destination, is yours." </sentence><sentence id="272">And we got there in two and a half days, which is absolutely amazing. </sentence><sentence id="273">So that's how we got there, but now that I think back on it, we celebrated the end of the European war, VE Day, while still in Lvov, because I remember, we were living at that time on -- in an apartment on 15 Mawitskago Street, in Lvov and the apartment was deemed too large for just my mother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="274">So they billeted a whole slew of Russian soldiers with us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="275">And many of the soldiers were wounded. </sentence><sentence id="276">There was a -- an elderly gentleman who was the father of one of the younger soldiers and then there were other young soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="277">Many of them had lost arms, lost legs and therefore they were taken from the front. </sentence><sentence id="278">And they had bought a case of vodka and mother said, "No, you're not going to get drunk here." </sentence><sentence id="279">And she locked up the vodka. </sentence><sentence id="280">And then they said, "No, no, we're going to celebrate, because it's the end of the war." </sentence><sentence id="281">And she said, "I don't believe you, but if it's really the end of the war, I will buy you another case." </sentence><sentence id="282">So, we went out to the main square, because no one had radios, we went out to the main square and after awhile, Stalin came on the loudspeaker and -- and announced the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="283">So the -- I think that was VE Day, so we were still in Lvov at that time. </sentence><sentence id="284">During that time also, I went to school, as I mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="285">I also worked after school in a cosmetics store. </sentence><sentence id="286">And I remember Russian soldiers used to come in and they would buy five bottles of Eau de Cologne and they would hit it against something, take off the tops and drink -- drink that down. </sentence><sentence id="287">They'd drink anything that had any kind of alcohol content in it. </sentence><sentence id="288">And I was at that time already, very cute. </sentence><sentence id="289">My hair had grown back, and mother made sure that I was always dressed </sentence></p><p><sentence id="290">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 15 meticulously. </sentence><sentence id="291">And so, I reminded many of them of their own children, I think. </sentence><sentence id="292">So they would very often come to the store and after buying something, they would ask me to come with them for a walk or to come and drink beer. </sentence><sentence id="293">There was a hotel by the name of Hotel Georges, and they used to take me to Hotel Georges to drink beer. </sentence><sentence id="294">And then I would always go with them, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: This would have been "40 -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: This was "44, beginning of "45, really "45, and I would go with them and on one occasion we were coming back and there was a street photographer and so he took a pho -- they asked to stop, and they took three photographs and one of those photographs of me and two Russian soldiers is hanging on my wall in the dining room. </sentence><sentence id="297">Often wondered where the oth -- soldiers are. </sentence><sentence id="298">And then, the other thing that used to happen to me again, to show you the adaptability, is that the Black Market was the only way you could make a living. </sentence><sentence id="299">You couldn't make a living any other way, so everyone was Black Marketeering. </sentence><sentence id="300">And the Black Market at that time consisted of soldiers who were stationed in Germany, bringing stuff back from the west. </sentence><sentence id="301">They would bring stuff back from the British or the Americans, who would barter for -- for stuff, and then they'd come back and sell it and then we would sell it further. </sentence><sentence id="302">And one of the big items was, for some reason or other, mother of pearl buttons. </sentence><sentence id="303">So we used to get a lot of mother of pearl buttons in the cosmetic store, which was a state run store and those would be held under the counter and then people would come in who knew about it and would buy them. </sentence><sentence id="304">And whenever there was a raid or anyone would come, they very often would put the mother of pearl under my    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 16 shirt, around me, because the soldiers were less likely to search children. </sentence><sentence id="305">And -- So I would find myself with mother of pearl buttons on a -- sewn on a -- on material wound around me. </sentence><sentence id="306">And one day they found it on me and they -- they took me to the Encoverdare, as the NVD was at that time called, Encoverdare headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="307">Mother came with me, she was very shocked and -- and she of course knew about it, but she was shocked that I was taken in. </sentence><sentence id="308">We went both. </sentence><sentence id="309">And no idea what was going to happen to us and the Encoverdare officer closes the door behind him and -- as we're shaking, and turns to us and -- and -- and says in Russian, "Veehad sheety zheets, yatazhoy." " </sentence><sentence id="310">You want to live, I also do." </sentence><sentence id="311">And so he became part of the smuggling ring after that and he got a cut. </sentence><sentence id="312">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="313">So -- So that's what life was like, you -- you adapted to -- there was one other episode that I remember from those days, and that was that the elderly gentleman I told you about, the Russian soldier, yeah? </sentence><sentence id="314">I don't know when I say elderly, what I really mean. </sentence><sentence id="315">He probably was 40, but to me he was elderly. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: Right, and -- and one of them was -- one of the young men was his son and I remember one day, it was the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur -- I -- I had no idea it was Yom Kippur, because I had just come out of the monastery. </sentence><sentence id="340">I -- I had brought from the -- from the monastery with me, and -- my clothes that I wore and three items. </sentence><sentence id="341">I brought my rosary, I brought my prayer book and I brought a blanket with which I covered myself during the two years and I learned never to give up that blanket, because that was the only thing that stood between me and the Ukrainian winter. </sentence><sentence id="342">Somewhere, the rosary and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 17 the prayer book got lost. </sentence><sentence id="343">My very strong suspicion is that Mother threw them out. </sentence><sentence id="344">But I'm not certain of that and maybe it's unfair to accuse her of that, but I suspect that. </sentence><sentence id="345">But my -- Oh, no, there was a fourth item I brought with me, and that was a picture of myself in front of the church, which I still have, but, the blanket I still have. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Well, again, it's taken on more meaning as I've gotten older. </sentence><sentence id="361">And we just had a grandson and we used -- we used that blanket during his circumcision. </sentence><sentence id="362">So -- where was I, where was I? </sentence><sentence id="363">Oh, I know wh-why I was telling you this. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Anyway, please continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: So, the reason I was telling you this in a roundabout way is because of this old -- probably 40 year old gentleman who had came to Yom Kippur, to the Day of Atonement and as I said, I didn't know that, because Mother was really not very observant -- religiously observant. </sentence><sentence id="375">So, we didn't celebrate that at that time. </sentence><sentence id="376">But, he came to me and he asked me if I would stand at the door -- at the kitchen door and look out and warn him if his sons or any of his friends came. </sentence><sentence id="377">And I said, "Why do you want me to do that?" </sentence><sentence id="378">And he said, "Because I'd like to say some prayers, but I'm afraid that they might turn me in." </sentence><sentence id="379">Because in the atheistic system in Russia, that wasn't allowed and he was afraid of his USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 18 own son, that he would turn him in. </sentence><sentence id="380">That made a big impression on me and I remember it to this day. </sentence><sentence id="381">The reason I mention this, is that -- is that I think another thing that I was very fortunate in was that I wasn't thrown immediately from one religious experience into another. </sentence><sentence id="382">If I had been, my suspicion is that I would have rebelled. </sentence><sentence id="383">But, as I mentioned, Mother was not particularly a religious woman. </sentence><sentence id="384">On the other hand, she took a tremendous -- she had a sense of responsibility which she took very seriously, to make sure that I was brought up in a religious atmosphere, because my father had been the rabbi of Katowice and she felt an obligation to bring me up in the way they would have wanted. </sentence><sentence id="385">And so I did, later on, but I'm getting ahead of myself, go in to go to Yeshiva and so on. </sentence><sentence id="386">But at that time, as I think back on it, it was very -- I was very fortunate not to have been thrown into a religious environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Well, we -- we -- again, we had difficulty making a living and -- and one of the things that everyone was doing was buying and selling and you'd go to the market and you would stand a-and you would see something -- with a few do -- few zlotys, and you would see something and you'd buy it and then you'd move two steps further and you'd try to sell it. </sentence><sentence id="472">And I remember one amusing incident was that we once bought what we thought was a lovely pair of shoes for very little money and when we looked at our most  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 22 magnificent find, we found that we had been sold two left shoes. </sentence><sentence id="473">And here we were, having spent a fair amount of whatever we had on these shoes, hoping to make a good profit and here we had two left shoes. </sentence><sentence id="474">So, the question then was, how could we sell two left shoes? </sentence><sentence id="475">And the feeling was that a child would more likely get away with it than an adult. </sentence><sentence id="476">So my brother ended up selling the two left shoes to some other poor sucker, who thought he or she had gotten a bargain. </sentence><sentence id="477">But that's the way life went, you know and -- and -- and so on. </sentence><sentence id="478">But the -- What happened next is that my mother's parents had lived in Germany and managed to get out of Germany in 1938 and go to England. </sentence><sentence id="479">And their son and dau -- two daughters, also were in England, s -- and my uncle, their son, they lived in Newcastle on Thames and in -- immediately at the end of the war, they began making inquiries about our family and found out that the children had survived. </sentence><sentence id="480">So they petitioned the religious council of England, th-the chief rabbi at that time was Rabbi Hertz, to try to get us to rejoin them. </sentence><sentence id="481">And there was a Rabbi Solomon Shunfeld, who was a strikingly handsome gentleman, with a red beard. </sentence><sentence id="482">He worked for the United Nations at that point -- for the UNRRA, the relief organization. </sentence><sentence id="483">He fashioned himself a uniform, which was a British uniform with a -- with a leather strap across his chest and -- and looked very, very elegant. </sentence><sentence id="484">And he basically made trips on behalf of the religious -- the chief rabbi's religious council of England, to Poland, in order to find Jews who had survived, to help them, to try to get children and see whether he could transport them to England, get permission, and they were able to get a certain number of visas from the British government. </sentence><sentence id="485">And so my uncle approached them to find us and -- and he in fact    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 23 did and I remember when he came to -- to Bittum -- and that was in 1945, probably mid or late "45, to inform us that we had grandparents and uncle and two aunts and that they were anxious to get us to England. </sentence><sentence id="486">And my brother said, "Great." </sentence><sentence id="487">And I said, "I won't go without Mother." </sentence><sentence id="488">And they had no permission for a visa for an adult, to they had a problem. </sentence><sentence id="489">They wired my uncle and my uncle said he wasn't ready to bring anyone else, but he wanted us, so they tried again. </sentence><sentence id="490">And I told him in no uncertain terms that there is absolutely no way in which they will get me into any kind of vehicle alive, and -- to go to England. </sentence><sentence id="491">So, he wired back saying that he would not participate -- he would not do that. </sentence><sentence id="492">And finally they got a visa for Mother. </sentence><sentence id="493">So, in the very end of 1945, I think it was December the 31st, of 1945, we left -- well, we first went from Bittum to Warsaw, stayed with Rabbi Kahana, who was -- then lived in Warsaw and every day we would go to the airport, because we now had permission to go to England, and every day we would be told that the planes were not flying because it was too foggy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="519">Q: Was this true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: And this wa -- yes, absolutely, because at that time, radar was in it's infancy and -- and these were Royal Air Force planes, which were basically troop transports, they weren't commercial -- you know, they had canvas seats and they basically transported troops. </sentence><sentence id="522">But they were willing to transport us. </sentence><sentence id="523">And -- So, for about two weeks, there became a standing joke, we would go in the morning to the airport, we'd be back in the afternoon and then finally one day we went and we took off and we went to Berlin and then from Berlin, flew to London, where we were met by my aunt, and then took a train </sentence></p><p><sentence id="524">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 24 to Newcastle. </sentence><sentence id="525">And we remained in Newcastle for the next -- well, in England for three and a half years. </sentence><sentence id="526">Oh, when we -- originally they gave us a visa which was valid for one month's visit. </sentence><sentence id="527">But our Polish passport, which I still had, states that it's valid only one way, so, I'm not sure how that worked. </sentence><sentence id="528">But when we came to the airport, the official said to us, "You only want to visit England for one month?" </sentence><sentence id="529">And we said, "Well, we'd like to visit for a lot more, but we're only allowed one month." </sentence><sentence id="530">So he crossed out one month and he put three months. </sentence><sentence id="531">And I still have that document. </sentence><sentence id="532">And so every three months, we had to renew our stay in England and we did that for three and a half years, until our number came up to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="533">So this was now 1946, I was 11 years old and I came to England, to Newcastle, and started going to school there and I didn't know a word of English and I had to learn another language and then -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: Which would have been your -- how many languages now, by the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="535">A: Well, my native was -- was German and then Polish and then of course during the war, Ukrainian and then after the war, Russian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="537">Q: Ukrainian and Russian are quite similar? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="539">A: Very. </sentence><sentence id="540">They're both Slavic language, but -- and they're both written in a Cyrillic alphabet, but they're are significant differences between the two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="543">Q: So you -- you were at your fifth language by 11 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="545">A: So -- Right, so I had to learn English and unfortunately England had a terrible system at that time, which they have since done away with. </sentence><sentence id="546">And that is that they had an exam called the elevenses. </sentence><sentence id="547">When you were eleven years old, you took an exam and if you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 25 passed it, if you got above a certain grade, you were destined to go to a university. </sentence><sentence id="548">And if you got below a certain grade, you were destined to finish your education at the age of 14 and to the factory. </sentence><sentence id="549">And I arrived there just before my 11th birthday. </sentence><sentence id="550">And so, I took my elevenses, not knowing how to read one word, and of course got zero. </sentence><sentence id="551">And so, I was placed in a school that would have ended at the age of 14, in a factory. </sentence><sentence id="552">But, again, Mother had other ideas and -- and in 1948, she left Newcastle with me and we went to London and she got a job as a maid in a home on Goldessgreen Road and enrolled me in a Jewish secondary school, because you could avoid that whole system if you went into a private school. </sentence><sentence id="553">And so from "48 to "49, I went for the first time, to a Jewish school and got a little bit of a beginnings of a Jewish education at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="564">Q: Let me ask you, as -- as we're moving forward in time and -- and it -- and it's getting a little bit further away from the horribly traumatic experiences that you'd had during the war, and you're getting older at the same time, at this point are you beginning to feel certain things, remember certain things, realize the -- the depth of -- of tragedy of what had happened to your family and -- and -- and to you personally, or -- or was this -- or were you just sort of going on in life and moving forward and you're living another life and going ahead? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="566">A: I think a little bit of both. </sentence><sentence id="567">I think, you know, our world was a world which was not normal, because the people, all of our acquaintances were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="568">People who -- who had been lawyers and professors in Poland and now were doormen and -- and -- and janitors. </sentence><sentence id="569">It was a world in which the topic of conversation was dominated by what was   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 26 and what was lost. </sentence><sentence id="570">So it -- So that was always, I think cloud that -- that was there. </sentence><sentence id="571">Whenever -- I don't remember one day that it, you know, became, but certainly, as I think back on my teenage years in this country and so on and later on, I never was the same as other kids. </sentence><sentence id="572">I could never let myself go, I was always separated, by my own volition. </sentence><sentence id="573">I could never participate in -- in something pleasurable for it's own sake. </sentence><sentence id="574">It had to have an ulterior purpose, it had to have -- there was always that serious element to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="597">Q: Well, you were talking about how -- how this has been helpful for you to be able to tap into -- tap into this knowledge that, you know, everything that's a challenge from now on, is nothing, compared to what you've been through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="599">A: Yeah, I think that everything always gets compared to that and no matter what crisis may arise, it -- it pales to insignificance when compared to what one has already been through, so you can always say to yourself, "Well, if I've gone through the worst, I can get through this." </sentence><sentence id="600">And -- And so no crisis seemed as great, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="603">Q: Now you're -- you were just mentioning that you felt -- now, if you're getting into "48 and "49, you're 13 - 14 years old, a -- a sense 0-o-of -- of not being able to do something fun for fun's sake, or joyful for joyfulness" sake, that you had a sense of responsibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>
