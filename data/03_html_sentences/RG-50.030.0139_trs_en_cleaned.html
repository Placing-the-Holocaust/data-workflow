<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Where did you go when you went to Holland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: We went to a small town in the eastern part of Holland called Borculo. </sentence><sentence id="213">It had about 40 Jewish families, 40, 42 Jewish families, a very religious town, conservative. </sentence><sentence id="214">And it was a wonderful life for me there. </sentence><sentence id="215">It was the first time in my life that I was accepted among my peers. </sentence><sentence id="216">It was probably the best part of my life that I have ever had was from 1936, end of "36, until "40 because uh I wasn't a Jew any longer, meaning I was just one of the boys, one of the kids which I never knew before. </sentence><sentence id="217">And there were children my age, Jewish and non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="218">It so happened that one boy was my age and became my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="219">He was killed during the war with the entire family. </sentence><sentence id="220">But we had a wonderful life there. </sentence><sentence id="221">It was very difficult for my father and mother because they came with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="222">They had left everything behind. </sentence><sentence id="223">We had a house in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="224">We are not people of means. </sentence><sentence id="225">My father had a hard life and he worked  hard and there wasn't an abundance of money. </sentence><sentence id="226">To the contrary it was a struggle. </sentence><sentence id="227">And not on my mother's side, they were affluent. </sentence><sentence id="228">But we never felt poor of course, we had a good life in the family especially. </sentence><sentence id="229">But in Holland it was hard for him to begin because we had to start from point zero and it worked out quite well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: What did he do in Germany and what did he have to do in Holland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: In Germany my father was in business with his father, in the cattle business. </sentence><sentence id="251">Most of the Jews in that area were in cattle. </sentence><sentence id="252">Most the majority were in the cattle business. </sentence><sentence id="253">My father learned the textile business when he was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="254">And when he came to Holland it wasn't possible to go in the cattle business, that would take lots of sums of money to pay and trade, so he went back in textile, which he knew. </sentence><sentence id="255">And first he worked very hard with a bicycle and suitcases and went from one farmer to the next for about three years. </sentence><sentence id="256">And my mother did the sewing. </sentence><sentence id="257">He sold dresses and aprons and whatever, and he came home with the measurements and my mother worked at night and during the days. </sentence><sentence id="258">She also had a vegetable garden and no help. </sentence><sentence id="259">But it was a good life. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then my father was able to buy a small store on the main street on this town. </sentence><sentence id="261">Somebody retired or died, something, a Jewish family, and the son I remember sold it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="262">I don't know the arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="263">And we lived behind the store which was a much better life for my father, he didn't have to go by bicycle every day. </sentence><sentence id="264">And then it developed that my father run the store. </sentence><sentence id="265">He went one day a week sometimes 2 days a week, to travel. </sentence><sentence id="266">And my mother did take a very active part in the business and did the sewing and helping in the store. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Did you work there too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: I had to work after school hours. </sentence><sentence id="287">I had to deliver merchandise to the people that bought. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was the delivery boy. </sentence><sentence id="289">It was nice. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then my grandfather came. </sentence><sentence id="291">He was living with us then. </sentence><sentence id="292">And then in 1938, Kristallnacht, my grandmother came to live with us, my mother's mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: What was her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Her name was Erica Soloman. </sentence><sentence id="303">My mother's maiden name was Soloman. </sentence><sentence id="304">She survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="305">She went to Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="306">I'm sure you'll ask me about that later, but she survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="307">And my uncles, her two sons, my two uncles were arrested in Germany by the local police in a small town, a very small town there. </sentence><sentence id="308">They were the only Jewish family there. </sentence><sentence id="309">They were born there. </sentence><sentence id="310">And they were in jail, but during the night a few neighbors took them out of jail and held up the policeman who was their friend actually, and they took "em by bicycles over the border, and took "em over the border to get "em from not being taken to one of the concentration camps, wherever they were taking them in those days, probably Dachau or Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="311">And they were immediately put under house arrest in Holland by the Dutch government. </sentence><sentence id="312">And they lived with another cousin of ours. </sentence><sentence id="313">My mother uh, my grandmother rather, I think and her two sisters married in Holland and had their children. </sentence><sentence id="314">And then the  Dutch put "em in a camp in southern Holland, and then from there they were building Westerbork which later became the transit camp. </sentence><sentence id="315">They were in Westerbork from about "38, "39 on. </sentence><sentence id="316">They stayed there during the war and they were liberated by the British or the Canadians, I forget now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Bill, between "36 when you arrived in Holland and 1940 do you feel that this was -- when you started to say this was the best time of your life up until then, it was a much more normal life for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, Holland is a very good country. </sentence><sentence id="335">It was a very good country even more so then than now. </sentence><sentence id="336">Things have changed in Holland too. </sentence><sentence id="337">But the Dutch were just wonderful to us. </sentence><sentence id="338">And I felt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total separation from my surrounding area, my surrounding community where I was born and where I grew up as a small boy. </sentence><sentence id="339">When I came to Holland I was accepted like an equal. </sentence><sentence id="340">I always remember that. </sentence><sentence id="341">The children in my class, the neighbors, that's like it should have been anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="342">But... So it was most revealing for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Then what happened in 1940 when the Germans came in, did it change radically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: No, it didn't change radically. </sentence><sentence id="355">It took about a year in general. </sentence><sentence id="356">Yah, there were, laws were made of course and we had to turn in our bicycles and there was a curfew at night for the Jews from 7:00 o'clock on. </sentence><sentence id="357">So not immediately, but very soon. </sentence><sentence id="358">Then of course we also couldn't go to school any longer, to public schools after about maybe eight, nine months to a year. </sentence><sentence id="359">So we went by bus to the next town over which was a large community and they had built a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="360">They took one of the schools that the city I think gave them and they made it into a Jewish day school. </sentence><sentence id="361">And we went by bus every morning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Were you frightened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Oh, sure. </sentence><sentence id="373">Because on the buses we had to wear a star. </sentence><sentence id="374">And when the Germans came on the buses, were public transportation systems, the rails were not running any longer. </sentence><sentence id="375">law. </sentence><sentence id="376">They had a bus system between all the different towns. </sentence><sentence id="377">And when Germans came in we had to get up and go in the back of the bus. </sentence><sentence id="378">And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish kids out of the bus, anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next bus. </sentence><sentence id="379">That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often. </sentence><sentence id="380">And then when we walked -- for instance when we got to the town where we went to school I remember it was quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no buses. </sentence><sentence id="381">And our classmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their bikes, and they picked us up and took us to the school. </sentence><sentence id="382">And then they had to turn in their bicycles, it was the end of that transportation system. </sentence><sentence id="383">But it was good for me because we could continue our education, and they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point. </sentence><sentence id="384">I had by then maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or seventh grade, I don't remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="385">It's a little different in Holland than it is here. </sentence><sentence id="386"> Then at one point Jews could not be in the buses at all any longer. </sentence><sentence id="387">So my father thought, and because he was told that we couldn't sit at home either that we had to keep busy, and my father called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a farm. </sentence><sentence id="388">I had to go every morning at 6:00, go to a farm. </sentence><sentence id="389">I worked there in the fields as a child. </sentence><sentence id="390">My father had the store still, but they were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier. </sentence><sentence id="391">So my father arranged that I went to work on a farm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Anything you do on farms from milking cows to harvesting the wheat and feeding the animals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Were there other children like you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: No, not on this farm. </sentence><sentence id="419">This was -- other children had to do it on other farms, yes. </sentence><sentence id="420">This age group. </sentence><sentence id="421">And even old people. </sentence><sentence id="422">This was mainly because information filters down and they said if you work they don't arrest you. </sentence><sentence id="423">They did anyhow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Did this apply to your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="433">My sister, no. </sentence><sentence id="434">She was a little too young. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="438">Q: Do you remember how you got your star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="441">An edict came down and you had to buy them. </sentence><sentence id="442">I remember that you had to buy them. </sentence><sentence id="443">I remember that my father had to sell them because he had a textile store. </sentence><sentence id="444">They had a J-O-O- D. Jood. </sentence><sentence id="445">That's a Dutch name for "Jew" But you could not pin them on. </sentence><sentence id="446">I remember them saying that you could not pin them on with a safety pin, you had to physically sew it on to your outer garment. </sentence><sentence id="447">That was very very important, I remember that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: Did your mother make these? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="459">they were printed by the Germans or by edict of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="460">No, no, you had to buy them from some whatever institution. </sentence><sentence id="461">And you had to sew them on of course, you had to do yourself. </sentence><sentence id="462">My mother did it. </sentence><sentence id="463">Most likely my mother. </sentence><sentence id="464">Excuse me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2540">A: Because they used to spread chlorine around for disinfectant and that smell was always overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="2541">And the burning of hair, I can't bear to smell that, for me. </sentence><sentence id="2542">Or flesh because it reminds you of the crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="2543">But you asked me have you been back to Auschwitz, I will not go back. </sentence><sentence id="2544">I will never go back to any camp, and I can't. </sentence><sentence id="2545">I don't want to wake up. </sentence><sentence id="2546">I think that's what it is. </sentence><sentence id="2547">I'm afraid to wake up, really wake up. </sentence><sentence id="2548">And since I'm having a very good normal life, and I think I can function quite well, I believe, maybe not everybody agrees with me, but I agree with me on that issue, I don't want that potential interference. </sentence><sentence id="2549">So I want it to stay the way it is. </sentence><sentence id="2550">That's why I've never done an oral history until now. </sentence><sentence id="2551">And look how many years, 48 years, right. </sentence><sentence id="2552">Yes, let's leave Auschwitz, and maybe something else will come to my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2553">But it's very deeply buried, it's very deeply buried, and let's leave it that way for the time being at least. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2554">Q: So let's talk about your friend coming to see you about going on this trip unknown. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2555">A: Yes, it's called transport unknown, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="2556">And we went on that, 300 men from Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2557">I believe they were all from Birkenau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2561">Q: And he's the one who helped you get on this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2563">A: He helped me indeed. </sentence><sentence id="2564">Without him I wouldn't be around there. </sentence><sentence id="2565">And how he did it I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2566">And it could very well be that part of the barracks I was in, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2567">I remember he said you must go on this. </sentence><sentence id="2568">Because I asked him -- no, I didn't ask him, he told me. </sentence><sentence id="2569">I said what should I do, and he said you go because I'm going on it and he took me. </sentence><sentence id="2570">And then we went back to the boxcars one day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2579">Q: Took the same kind of a trip? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2581">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2582">I remember they gave us a piece of bread when we got into the boxcar. </sentence><sentence id="2583">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2584">I don't know why I remember that, but I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="2585">Maybe I was very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2586">And then we went in a boxcar. </sentence><sentence id="2587">I don't know how long this trip was. </sentence><sentence id="2588">It couldn't have been very long. </sentence><sentence id="2589">If it was a day or two or one day, I don't know how long it was. </sentence><sentence id="2590">I know that we ended up in a very large railroad yard in the city, and then of course we found out it was Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2591">And this was in the summer of "43 I believe. </sentence><sentence id="2592">I don't know the dates because we didn't know dates. </sentence><sentence id="2593">The only reason we knew it was Sunday in Auschwitz was because it was selection day. </sentence><sentence id="2594">That's the only reason we knew that. </sentence><sentence id="2595">And then we were marched from the railroad yards in Warsaw to this bombed city, this bombed section of the city. </sentence><sentence id="2596">And there were fires still going, and there were many dead bodies laying in the streets and a lot of debris. </sentence><sentence id="2597">And I remember there were no barracks, that there were sections of barracks laying there. </sentence><sentence id="2598">They marched us into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2599">We found out later this was the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2600">And we marked in, and I think the first couple of days we slept outside somewhere until they built this barracks, a wooden barracks. </sentence><sentence id="2601">Better ones than we had in Auschwitz I must say that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2623">Q: And who built these, did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2625">A: Yes, the prisoners had to do most of the work, but it was German supervision. </sentence><sentence id="2626">There were foreman there who were not prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2627">But the prisoners did all of the labor. </sentence><sentence id="2628">Us guys. </sentence><sentence id="2629">And then when we started working, and the reason we were there, we were sent there to dynamite the ghetto, to destroy all the evidence, to dynamite all the buildings, to preserve as much raw material as we could find from transformers to cable, electric wiring, copper wiring, wood. </sentence><sentence id="2630">And a lot of prisoners polished bricks because those buildings, and I happen to be, for a reason that I don't know why, but I was on the demolition team and we had to plant dynamite, dynamite they called it, underneath the walls. </sentence><sentence id="2631">And then the Germans handled the plunger, the wires. </sentence><sentence id="2632">We had to set the wires. </sentence><sentence id="2633">And I remember a few occasions they, for joy  rides, they'd push the plunger before the prisoners got out and got away from the walls. </sentence><sentence id="2634">I got hit over my legs a few times. </sentence><sentence id="2635">We didn't run fast enough because we had nothing, we didn't have decent shoes, and couldn't walk that fast because we were not that well fed. </sentence><sentence id="2636">And that's what I did for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="2637">And then for a while I did, and another groups of maybe 30 guys, we had to find transformers in buildings, electrical transformers, and we had to put them on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And that also was part of the war machine. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And then I worked for quite a while in the railroad yards where the equipment was transferred to and from the eastern front, the Russian front. </sentence><sentence id="2640">So that was about what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And one day I remember -- oh, and my friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him, he once said I got a good job, he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a German army camp, army whatever, maybe we can get some food there because five guys maybe they feed you. </sentence><sentence id="2642">So he put me, and I remember, and I was reminded of it recently when two boys, two boys from Croatia, from Zagreb, they were very nice boys, you know, my age, and two others, and I forgot the others, I think one was a boy from Berlin, and we went there on a truck to this army post, German army post. </sentence><sentence id="2643">They were all SS troops, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And we dug fortifications. </sentence><sentence id="2645">We have to dig trenches. </sentence><sentence id="2646">And they beat us up terribly that day, just beat us up terribly. </sentence><sentence id="2647">And two of the boys were killed that day. </sentence><sentence id="2648">One of the brothers and one other man. </sentence><sentence id="2649">So out of the five only two walked out. </sentence><sentence id="2650">So that night when I found my friend I tell him don't do me any more favors. </sentence><sentence id="2651">And so that was Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2652">And then I worked in Laundry for a while. </sentence><sentence id="2653">And my friend he had a job of assigning detail sometimes so he was always helping me, he was always helping me. </sentence><sentence id="2654">And Warsaw was different because we lived in this ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2655">A camp, about two camps they was building. </sentence><sentence id="2656">And they give us one camp and then we built a new camp. </sentence><sentence id="2657">We all got to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2658">So out in the big ghetto there and the first camp, and then during the winter, in the spring, in January there was another camp, and 300 were amplified by several thousand, a lot of Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2659">And at the tail end we got out of Warsaw, there were 3,600 prisoners there. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And a lot of them died even during this period while we were there. </sentence><sentence id="2661">But 3,600 and they were mostly Hungarian Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2699">Q: All men? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2701">A: All men. </sentence><sentence id="2702">No, we never saw women. </sentence><sentence id="2703">The only time we saw women was when we were in trucks going to some work details on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="2704">In addition to that they also did a lot of shooting of Polish political prisoners in the ghetto in our camp and we had to burn the corpses. </sentence><sentence id="2705">There were a lot of corpses when we got there first. </sentence><sentence id="2706">We found basements full of corpses. </sentence><sentence id="2707">That's a prison they had there and lots of bodies we found. </sentence><sentence id="2708">We burned them. </sentence><sentence id="2709">There was stacks we had to build. </sentence><sentence id="2710">And one day we spend a few days in the Pawiak, I don't know about ten of us who got sent there for a detail, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2721">Q: Do you want to explain Pawiak? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2723">A: Pawiak was a fellow prison in the City of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2724">I don't know if it's still there. </sentence><sentence id="2725">But we were sent there for some work detail. </sentence><sentence id="2726">I remember spending there a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="2727">I remember, the only thing I remember this heavy heavy stone buildings. </sentence><sentence id="2728">And the fed us soup. </sentence><sentence id="2729">That shows  you what you remember, some odd things. </sentence><sentence id="2730">And it tasted like pure soap water. </sentence><sentence id="2731">So I asked them why is there so much soap in there, and the reason, this person explained, whoever it was, said apparently the soap, and I'm not talking about the Jewish people, I'm talking about the prisoners in this Pawiak, the reason they gave them this soap, they threw a bar of soap in every soup kettle because it would decrease their sexual desires. </sentence><sentence id="2732">Soap or whatever chemical, that's what they explained to us. </sentence><sentence id="2733">Because it tasted like soap, which was even delicious, better than what we had in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2734">But I remember they used that. </sentence><sentence id="2735">We didn't have that problem, the Jewish prisoners, believe me. </sentence><sentence id="2736">So Warsaw, we didn't have the hunger because we found a lot of food in the buildings, staples. </sentence><sentence id="2737">There were still staples to be found, barley, things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2753">Q: And you were allowed to keep these? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2755">A: If you could find it and could hide it. </sentence><sentence id="2756">If they caught you you were in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2757">But we also had other avenues, and while we were in the ghetto the Poles came in and bought the bricks, the polished brick, and we used to find clothes and save them bundled up and sold them the clothes for a piece of bread or a couple of onions or some garlic and even sometimes vodka. </sentence><sentence id="2758">And they brought things with them and they thought it was our's, those Poles who came in, they had this cart with a horse in front of it, so they brought in food, not because they liked us, only because it was a business deal. </sentence><sentence id="2759">I didn't speak Polish, but we had Poles who could speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="2760">And then there were what we found also was in the early days when we were in Warsaw, Jews were in the bunkers, who once had done the uprising, and they were still in bunkers and they came out when the dynamiting started. </sentence><sentence id="2761">And when the Germans of course saw them they shot them on site. </sentence><sentence id="2762">But I remember also one day there was a boy and a girl came out. </sentence><sentence id="2763">The Poles had been supplying them with food. </sentence><sentence id="2764">And they run out of money and out of gold and I saw a Pole kill this girl. </sentence><sentence id="2765">He killed her because he didn't want to have her alive so in case she would implicate him. </sentence><sentence id="2766">They weren't very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2767">And they were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2768">And so they didn't help us out of any human point of view, they helped us because it served them. </sentence><sentence id="2769">And I remember we worked in the railroad yards and they had Germany material like uniforms and shoes, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="2770">And we sold and traded, not so much traded, with the Polish railroad people, traded with them for food. </sentence><sentence id="2771">So the hunger was not as bad in Warsaw as it had been in Birkenau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2789">Q: What was the barracks situation like, you said it was better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2791">A: Well, it was more modern. </sentence><sentence id="2792">I'll use those words. </sentence><sentence id="2793">But they were a little better and there also was heat, there was a stove there. </sentence><sentence id="2794">A typical Polish stove out of stone I think they were made. </sentence><sentence id="2795">I remember there was heat in there. </sentence><sentence id="2796">Not always that we had something to burn, but there was enough wood laying around because of the demolition we did on those buildings, so it didn't cost anything to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2797">But there is one point I want to make that just came to my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2798">I happen to believe very strongly, and maybe that's in conclusion later on, that this entire issue of the Jews, Auschwitz, etcetera, the destruction of the six million of our people was a very large money-making event for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2799">That served and financed the biggest  part of the war industry. </sentence><sentence id="2800">Because a few realize how much we were told what to bring. </sentence><sentence id="2801">You realized that every person who went through Birkenau that I know of, and other camps I'm sure the same, and all the gas and all the crematoriums in the different camps, they looked in your mouth and if you had gold fillings -- had rings, my mother had a wedding ring and my father had a wedding band, so did everyone else who were married couples, there was enormous hordes of gold. </sentence><sentence id="2802">And I remember one day in Warsaw I found in a house, someone had found, and we had four diamonds, four diamond stones. </sentence><sentence id="2803">Was worth about, maybe 5-6 carats of diamond. </sentence><sentence id="2804">I didn't know anything about that, but somebody said it's a very good amount. </sentence><sentence id="2805">I sold it for a little piece of bread to a Hungarian because he only got there three days before. </sentence><sentence id="2806">He thought he made a big purchase. </sentence><sentence id="2807">Well, I had the bread and I lived and he had no bread that day or for two days, so he didn't get anything for two days. </sentence><sentence id="2808">So there was so much, I mean dollar bills, gold laying on the streets, silver. </sentence><sentence id="2809">But the wealth of just the clothing alone, you'll see the lists that we have at our museum, and the valuable things just pulled out of that ghetto, and that's done in many places, that financed the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2810">It was a money making event for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2811">It was a money making event. </sentence><sentence id="2812">Aside from they hated the Jews and wanted them all killed, but they made money on the deal. </sentence><sentence id="2813">The clothing, the hair was sold all over the world, recycled in some form. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2837">Q: When I mentioned whether you had seen yourself in Auschwitz you said no, but you didn't explain? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2839">A: We, we were working in all these buildings, while we were working there were some mirrors there and you saw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2841">Q: Were you surprised at what you saw? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2843">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2844">You didn't have much time for that. </sentence><sentence id="2845">It didn't make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="2846">It didn't make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="2847">What did a mirror mean to us, what did a piece of gold mean to us. </sentence><sentence id="2848">Gold had nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="2849">There was no one to sell it to or give it too. </sentence><sentence id="2850">It was almost laying on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="2851">It had no value, what could you do with it? </sentence><sentence id="2852">If you couldn't get food with it, it doesn't mean a damn. </sentence><sentence id="2853">So that taught me, and I've said it often to younger people, that wealth is only good if you buy a very fancy painting, it's only good if you can enjoy it and look at this painting. </sentence><sentence id="2854">But what happens if you need to sell it and there is no one to buy it, then whatever you paid for this write it off real fast. </sentence><sentence id="2855">It has no value if you can't sell it, if there's no buyer. </sentence><sentence id="2856">And that's what happened when I had those four pieces of diamonds in my hand. </sentence><sentence id="2857">I had one buyer and he didn't survive because he gave me his bread. </sentence><sentence id="2858">He was dumb enough to do it, but I was at that point seasoned, and I don't want to say smart, certainly seasoned that I knew I couldn't do anything with the diamonds except I needed a greenhorn to sell it to because I was hungry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2875">Q: Were the relationships among you as prisoners there, 3,600 you said, not that you had relations with 3,600 people, was it different than Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2876">A: No comparison. </sentence><sentence id="2877">Much much easier. </sentence><sentence id="2878">It was easier. </sentence><sentence id="2879">But we were under the treat of being killed by selection. </sentence><sentence id="2880">We died because there was typhoid in Warsaw by the way, and I had typhoid, but a very mild case, and I wasn't in the Krankenbau, in the hospital so-called. </sentence><sentence id="2881">But I got out not very much before when the Russians broke through and got out. </sentence><sentence id="2882">But I was in there for a while, not long. </sentence><sentence id="2883">And many died because there was typhoid in there. </sentence><sentence id="2884">That's why they kept shin the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2885">There were 3,600 left at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2886">And I think at one time there was probably close to 5,000 there. </sentence><sentence id="2887">The camps replenished. </sentence><sentence id="2888">That number is -- but I know it was more than 3,600. </sentence><sentence id="2889">And he was told to kill them all. </sentence><sentence id="2890">And I'm told, and this is all hearsay, that the Polish underground who was watching the camp very much so because they used to take, the Polish Resistance --brought them in the ghetto and shut them in there with us -- on one wall there and we had to turn them then. </sentence><sentence id="2891">The Polish underground allegedly told the Germans that if you kall all these people you'll never get out yourself, I'm told, because it was not difficult for them to do. </sentence><sentence id="2892">And we heard the rumblings of the big guns that was here already because the Russians were breaking through. </sentence><sentence id="2893">So one morning they had 300 in the beds still, who couldn't get out of the bed. </sentence><sentence id="2894">They shot them. </sentence><sentence id="2895">300, correct. </sentence><sentence id="2896">And 300 were kept there. </sentence><sentence id="2897">And the reason I know is because a fellow I was friendly with because he was my age, was a Berlin Jew, and he was selected to be and he had to stay there, that 300. </sentence><sentence id="2898">And those 300 were kept there to destroy all evidence, and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="2899">That we were told later on. </sentence><sentence id="2900">I don't know how I know, but I know. </sentence><sentence id="2901">And because they were killed while we were marching out already, they just burned the barracks or dynamited. </sentence><sentence id="2902">It was done very very fast. </sentence><sentence id="2903">And 3,000 marched out, and we marched and we marched and I remember two things very distinctly. </sentence><sentence id="2904">Number one, that you tried not to be in the back because we heard the machine guns going constantly and we were told that anybody who drops out is going to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="2905">And they left their corpses right on the road. </sentence><sentence id="2906">So they had maybe four or five machine guns in the back of some army truck and they shot those people. </sentence><sentence id="2907">All men, there were no women there. </sentence><sentence id="2908">They were all men. </sentence><sentence id="2909">And we marched and here is the thing I remember as much as anything else, we came, it was in the summer, it was very hot, no water, and for some reason it rained once and we were going like this with our soup pan and we tried to catch the raindrops. </sentence><sentence id="2910">We were very very thirsty, almost to the point of sanity. </sentence><sentence id="2911">People were going insane, people were drinking their urine. </sentence><sentence id="2912">And all of a sudden we came over on a bridge, and over the bridge we saw a river. </sentence><sentence id="2913">And they took us over the bridge and there was a huge field there, an open field and we went in that field apparently to stay overnight, but to wait for something. </sentence><sentence id="2914">And we pushed, the masses pushed so hard, and I happened to be in the earlier part of this grouping of 3,000. </sentence><sentence id="2915">Of course it was not 3,000 anymore, but I was in the first, maybe the second hundred or third hundred, very up front. </sentence><sentence id="2916">We got into this river, you could wade into the river and we drank and we drank and we drank. </sentence><sentence id="2917">But the masses in back of us were so anxious to get to that water they kept on pushing and they pushed us too far in the river so we couldn't walk, and they wouldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="2918">And the Germans didn't know what to do, so they thought that we would go in the river and get to the other side and escape. </sentence><sentence id="2919">So they start shooting from the bridge and from the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2920">They used machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="2921">They shot. </sentence><sentence id="2922">And I remember, because I wake up often, that river turned as red as blood. </sentence><sentence id="2923">And the Jews wouldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="2924">Our people would not stop. </sentence><sentence id="2925">They kept on pushing from the back. </sentence><sentence id="2926">And they couldn't stop the Jew and these people. </sentence><sentence id="2927">On the German side, they kept killing with bullets and they brought the dogs  in. </sentence><sentence id="2928">And the people in charge made those soldiers, those German SS go in the water with the dogs and when the dogs got into the water the Jews stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2929">They wouldn't stop for the bullets. </sentence><sentence id="2930">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2931">And then they stopped pushing. </sentence><sentence id="2932">I was out by then. </sentence><sentence id="2933">Because, you know, I got out because they pushed and it came up to here in the water so I got out. </sentence><sentence id="2934">None of us could swim. </sentence><sentence id="2935">I don't know how many could swim. </sentence><sentence id="2936">I know I couldn't swim. </sentence><sentence id="2937">I told you I couldn't go to the swim because I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2938">They never taught me how to swim. </sentence><sentence id="2939">So the soil was just bodies and blood, and I could only think about why they called it the Red Sea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3004">There's no connection there, but it was red as pure blood. </sentence><sentence id="3005">And they killed a lot. </sentence><sentence id="3006">They killed, in my estimation, at least 1,000 people there, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="3007">No one knows. </sentence><sentence id="3008">But there were very few who got into the trains. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And I don't remember if we walked much more, but in the end we got in boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="3010">I know the town, that much I remember, Zychlin. </sentence><sentence id="3011">That much I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3012">Because you could see the names on there, and I remember Zychlin, so I knew that we had marched due west from Warsaw and then we start trip in boxcars again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
