<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Where did you go when you went to Holland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: We went to a small town in the eastern part of Holland called Borculo. </sentence><sentence id="213">It had about 40 Jewish families, 40, 42 Jewish families, a very religious town, conservative. </sentence><sentence id="214">And it was a wonderful life for me there. </sentence><sentence id="215">It was the first time in my life that I was accepted among my peers. </sentence><sentence id="216">It was probably the best part of my life that I have ever had was from 1936, end of "36, until "40 because uh I wasn't a Jew any longer, meaning I was just one of the boys, one of the kids which I never knew before. </sentence><sentence id="217">And there were children my age, Jewish and non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="218">It so happened that one boy was my age and became my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="219">He was killed during the war with the entire family. </sentence><sentence id="220">But we had a wonderful life there. </sentence><sentence id="221">It was very difficult for my father and mother because they came with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="222">They had left everything behind. </sentence><sentence id="223">We had a house in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="224">We are not people of means. </sentence><sentence id="225">My father had a hard life and he worked  hard and there wasn't an abundance of money. </sentence><sentence id="226">To the contrary it was a struggle. </sentence><sentence id="227">And not on my mother's side, they were affluent. </sentence><sentence id="228">But we never felt poor of course, we had a good life in the family especially. </sentence><sentence id="229">But in Holland it was hard for him to begin because we had to start from point zero and it worked out quite well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: What did he do in Germany and what did he have to do in Holland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: In Germany my father was in business with his father, in the cattle business. </sentence><sentence id="251">Most of the Jews in that area were in cattle. </sentence><sentence id="252">Most the majority were in the cattle business. </sentence><sentence id="253">My father learned the textile business when he was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="254">And when he came to Holland it wasn't possible to go in the cattle business, that would take lots of sums of money to pay and trade, so he went back in textile, which he knew. </sentence><sentence id="255">And first he worked very hard with a bicycle and suitcases and went from one farmer to the next for about three years. </sentence><sentence id="256">And my mother did the sewing. </sentence><sentence id="257">He sold dresses and aprons and whatever, and he came home with the measurements and my mother worked at night and during the days. </sentence><sentence id="258">She also had a vegetable garden and no help. </sentence><sentence id="259">But it was a good life. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then my father was able to buy a small store on the main street on this town. </sentence><sentence id="261">Somebody retired or died, something, a Jewish family, and the son I remember sold it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="262">I don't know the arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="263">And we lived behind the store which was a much better life for my father, he didn't have to go by bicycle every day. </sentence><sentence id="264">And then it developed that my father run the store. </sentence><sentence id="265">He went one day a week sometimes 2 days a week, to travel. </sentence><sentence id="266">And my mother did take a very active part in the business and did the sewing and helping in the store. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Did you work there too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: I had to work after school hours. </sentence><sentence id="287">I had to deliver merchandise to the people that bought. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was the delivery boy. </sentence><sentence id="289">It was nice. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then my grandfather came. </sentence><sentence id="291">He was living with us then. </sentence><sentence id="292">And then in 1938, Kristallnacht, my grandmother came to live with us, my mother's mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: What was her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Her name was Erica Soloman. </sentence><sentence id="303">My mother's maiden name was Soloman. </sentence><sentence id="304">She survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="305">She went to Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="306">I'm sure you'll ask me about that later, but she survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="307">And my uncles, her two sons, my two uncles were arrested in Germany by the local police in a small town, a very small town there. </sentence><sentence id="308">They were the only Jewish family there. </sentence><sentence id="309">They were born there. </sentence><sentence id="310">And they were in jail, but during the night a few neighbors took them out of jail and held up the policeman who was their friend actually, and they took "em by bicycles over the border, and took "em over the border to get "em from not being taken to one of the concentration camps, wherever they were taking them in those days, probably Dachau or Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="311">And they were immediately put under house arrest in Holland by the Dutch government. </sentence><sentence id="312">And they lived with another cousin of ours. </sentence><sentence id="313">My mother uh, my grandmother rather, I think and her two sisters married in Holland and had their children. </sentence><sentence id="314">And then the  Dutch put "em in a camp in southern Holland, and then from there they were building Westerbork which later became the transit camp. </sentence><sentence id="315">They were in Westerbork from about "38, "39 on. </sentence><sentence id="316">They stayed there during the war and they were liberated by the British or the Canadians, I forget now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Bill, between "36 when you arrived in Holland and 1940 do you feel that this was -- when you started to say this was the best time of your life up until then, it was a much more normal life for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, Holland is a very good country. </sentence><sentence id="335">It was a very good country even more so then than now. </sentence><sentence id="336">Things have changed in Holland too. </sentence><sentence id="337">But the Dutch were just wonderful to us. </sentence><sentence id="338">And I felt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total separation from my surrounding area, my surrounding community where I was born and where I grew up as a small boy. </sentence><sentence id="339">When I came to Holland I was accepted like an equal. </sentence><sentence id="340">I always remember that. </sentence><sentence id="341">The children in my class, the neighbors, that's like it should have been anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="342">But... So it was most revealing for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Then what happened in 1940 when the Germans came in, did it change radically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: No, it didn't change radically. </sentence><sentence id="355">It took about a year in general. </sentence><sentence id="356">Yah, there were, laws were made of course and we had to turn in our bicycles and there was a curfew at night for the Jews from 7:00 o'clock on. </sentence><sentence id="357">So not immediately, but very soon. </sentence><sentence id="358">Then of course we also couldn't go to school any longer, to public schools after about maybe eight, nine months to a year. </sentence><sentence id="359">So we went by bus to the next town over which was a large community and they had built a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="360">They took one of the schools that the city I think gave them and they made it into a Jewish day school. </sentence><sentence id="361">And we went by bus every morning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Were you frightened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Oh, sure. </sentence><sentence id="373">Because on the buses we had to wear a star. </sentence><sentence id="374">And when the Germans came on the buses, were public transportation systems, the rails were not running any longer. </sentence><sentence id="375">law. </sentence><sentence id="376">They had a bus system between all the different towns. </sentence><sentence id="377">And when Germans came in we had to get up and go in the back of the bus. </sentence><sentence id="378">And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish kids out of the bus, anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next bus. </sentence><sentence id="379">That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often. </sentence><sentence id="380">And then when we walked -- for instance when we got to the town where we went to school I remember it was quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no buses. </sentence><sentence id="381">And our classmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their bikes, and they picked us up and took us to the school. </sentence><sentence id="382">And then they had to turn in their bicycles, it was the end of that transportation system. </sentence><sentence id="383">But it was good for me because we could continue our education, and they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point. </sentence><sentence id="384">I had by then maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or seventh grade, I don't remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="385">It's a little different in Holland than it is here. </sentence><sentence id="386"> Then at one point Jews could not be in the buses at all any longer. </sentence><sentence id="387">So my father thought, and because he was told that we couldn't sit at home either that we had to keep busy, and my father called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a farm. </sentence><sentence id="388">I had to go every morning at 6:00, go to a farm. </sentence><sentence id="389">I worked there in the fields as a child. </sentence><sentence id="390">My father had the store still, but they were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier. </sentence><sentence id="391">So my father arranged that I went to work on a farm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Anything you do on farms from milking cows to harvesting the wheat and feeding the animals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Were there other children like you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: No, not on this farm. </sentence><sentence id="419">This was -- other children had to do it on other farms, yes. </sentence><sentence id="420">This age group. </sentence><sentence id="421">And even old people. </sentence><sentence id="422">This was mainly because information filters down and they said if you work they don't arrest you. </sentence><sentence id="423">They did anyhow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Did this apply to your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="433">My sister, no. </sentence><sentence id="434">She was a little too young. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="438">Q: Do you remember how you got your star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="441">An edict came down and you had to buy them. </sentence><sentence id="442">I remember that you had to buy them. </sentence><sentence id="443">I remember that my father had to sell them because he had a textile store. </sentence><sentence id="444">They had a J-O-O- D. Jood. </sentence><sentence id="445">That's a Dutch name for "Jew" But you could not pin them on. </sentence><sentence id="446">I remember them saying that you could not pin them on with a safety pin, you had to physically sew it on to your outer garment. </sentence><sentence id="447">That was very very important, I remember that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: Did your mother make these? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="459">they were printed by the Germans or by edict of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="460">No, no, you had to buy them from some whatever institution. </sentence><sentence id="461">And you had to sew them on of course, you had to do yourself. </sentence><sentence id="462">My mother did it. </sentence><sentence id="463">Most likely my mother. </sentence><sentence id="464">Excuse me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1242">Q: Did that seem even more -- well, you wouldn't know by comparison, but urgent in a way to do that because life was so difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1244">A: It was urgent to the extent that you clung to each other because there was obviously a terrible loneliness in each person, and a terrible fear. </sentence><sentence id="1245">But I do remember that the friendships in the camp in dating, that you just mentioned as dating, friendships were very very deep and very sincere. </sentence><sentence id="1246">I didn't have anybody that I said I'm going to marry you, it wasn't even important in life to even think that, but as friendships either from before we were there or we met there and found friendships there, new friends, and you saw that among others. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And then there were movements, there was a whole movement in the camp of Halutsim" ...Zionist movement who met regular. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Who had only one dream, they all would go together to Israel and they stay together. </sentence><sentence id="1249">They all left together too, they all went to Auschwitz or the other camps. </sentence><sentence id="1250">So there was this Zionist movement, there was a cultural life for us to the extent, self-created, self- created. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2427">Q: Why does it remind you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2429">A: Because they used to spread chlorine around for disinfectant and that smell was always overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="2430">And the burning of hair, I can't bear to smell that, for me. </sentence><sentence id="2431">Or flesh because it reminds you of the crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="2432">But you asked me have you been back to Auschwitz, I will not go back. </sentence><sentence id="2433">I will never go back to any camp, and I can't. </sentence><sentence id="2434">I don't want to wake up. </sentence><sentence id="2435">I think that's what it is. </sentence><sentence id="2436">I'm afraid to wake up, really wake up. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And since I'm having a very good normal life, and I think I can function quite well, I believe, maybe not everybody agrees with me, but I agree with me on that issue, I don't want that potential interference. </sentence><sentence id="2438">So I want it to stay the way it is. </sentence><sentence id="2439">That's why I've never done an oral history until now. </sentence><sentence id="2440">And look how many years, 48 years, right. </sentence><sentence id="2441">Yes, let's leave Auschwitz, and maybe something else will come to my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2442">But it's very deeply buried, it's very deeply buried, and let's leave it that way for the time being at least. </sentence><sentence id="2443"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2467">Q: And he's the one who helped you get on this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2469">A: He helped me indeed. </sentence><sentence id="2470">Without him I wouldn't be around there. </sentence><sentence id="2471">And how he did it I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2472">And it could very well be that part of the barracks I was in, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2473">I remember he said you must go on this. </sentence><sentence id="2474">Because I asked him -- no, I didn't ask him, he told me. </sentence><sentence id="2475">I said what should I do, and he said you go because I'm going on it and he took me. </sentence><sentence id="2476">And then we went back to the boxcars one day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2485">Q: Took the same kind of a trip? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2529">Q: And who built these, did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2531">A: Yes, the prisoners had to do most of the work, but it was German supervision. </sentence><sentence id="2532">There were foreman there who were not prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2533">But the prisoners did all of the labor. </sentence><sentence id="2534">Us guys. </sentence><sentence id="2535">And then when we started working, and the reason we were there, we were sent there to dynamite the ghetto, to destroy all the evidence, to dynamite all the buildings, to preserve as much raw material as we could find from transformers to cable, electric wiring, copper wiring, wood. </sentence><sentence id="2536">And a lot of prisoners polished bricks because those buildings, and I happen to be, for a reason that I don't know why, but I was on the demolition team and we had to plant dynamite, dynamite they called it, underneath the walls. </sentence><sentence id="2537">And then the Germans handled the plunger, the wires. </sentence><sentence id="2538">We had to set the wires. </sentence><sentence id="2539">And I remember a few occasions they, for joy  6 rides, they'd push the plunger before the prisoners got out and got away from the walls. </sentence><sentence id="2540">I got hit over my legs a few times. </sentence><sentence id="2541">We didn't run fast enough because we had nothing, we didn't have decent shoes, and couldn't walk that fast because we were not that well fed. </sentence><sentence id="2542">And that's what I did for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="2543">And then for a while I did, and another groups of maybe 30 guys, we had to find transformers in buildings, electrical transformers, and we had to put them on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2544">And that also was part of the war machine. </sentence><sentence id="2545">And then I worked for quite a while in the railroad yards where the equipment was transferred to and from the eastern front, the Russian front. </sentence><sentence id="2546">So that was about what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2547">And one day I remember -- oh, and my friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him, he once said I got a good job, he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a German army camp, army whatever, maybe we can get some food there because five guys maybe they feed you. </sentence><sentence id="2548">So he put me, and I remember, and I was reminded of it recently when two boys, two boys from Croatia, from Zagreb, they were very nice boys, you know, my age, and two others, and I forgot the others, I think one was a boy from Berlin, and we went there on a truck to this army post, German army post. </sentence><sentence id="2549">They were all SS troops, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="2550">And we dug fortifications. </sentence><sentence id="2551">We have to dig trenches. </sentence><sentence id="2552">And they beat us up terribly that day, just beat us up terribly. </sentence><sentence id="2553">And two of the boys were killed that day. </sentence><sentence id="2554">One of the brothers and one other man. </sentence><sentence id="2555">So out of the five only two walked out. </sentence><sentence id="2556">So that night when I found my friend I tell him don't do me any more favors. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And so that was Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2558">And then I worked in Laundry for a while. </sentence><sentence id="2559">And my friend he had a job of assigning detail sometimes so he was always helping me, he was always helping me. </sentence><sentence id="2560">And Warsaw was different because we lived in this ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2561">A camp, about two camps they was building. </sentence><sentence id="2562">And they give us one camp and then we built a new camp. </sentence><sentence id="2563">We all got to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2564">So out in the big ghetto there and the first camp, and then during the winter, in the spring, in January there was another camp, and 300 were amplified by several thousand, a lot of Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2565">And at the tail end we got out of Warsaw, there were 3,600 prisoners there. </sentence><sentence id="2566">And a lot of them died even during this period while we were there. </sentence><sentence id="2567">But 3,600 and they were mostly Hungarian Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2659">Q: And you were allowed to keep these? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2661">A: If you could find it and could hide it. </sentence><sentence id="2662">If they caught you you were in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2663">But we also had other avenues, and while we were in the ghetto the Poles came in and bought the bricks, the polished brick, and we used to find clothes and save them bundled up and sold them the clothes for a piece of bread or a couple of onions or some garlic and even sometimes vodka. </sentence><sentence id="2664">And they brought things with them and they thought it was our's, those Poles who came in, they had this cart with a horse in front of it, so they brought in food, not because they liked us, only because it was a business deal. </sentence><sentence id="2665">I didn't speak Polish, but we had Poles who could speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="2666">And then there were what we found also was in the early days when we were in Warsaw, Jews were in the bunkers, who once had done the uprising, and they were still in bunkers and they came out when the dynamiting started. </sentence><sentence id="2667">And when the Germans of course saw them they shot them on site. </sentence><sentence id="2668">But I remember also one day there was a boy and a girl came out. </sentence><sentence id="2669">The Poles had been supplying them with food. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And they run out of money and out of gold and I saw a Pole kill this girl. </sentence><sentence id="2671">He killed her because he didn't want to have her alive so in case she would implicate him. </sentence><sentence id="2672">They weren't very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2673">And they were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2674">And so they didn't help us out of any human point of view, they helped us because it served them. </sentence><sentence id="2675">And I remember we worked in the railroad yards and they had Germany material like uniforms and shoes, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="2676">And we sold and traded, not so much traded, with the Polish railroad people, traded with them for food. </sentence><sentence id="2677">So the hunger was not as bad in Warsaw as it had been in Birkenau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2695">Q: What was the barracks situation like, you said it was better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2697">A: Well, it was more modern. </sentence><sentence id="2698">I'll use those words. </sentence><sentence id="2699">But they were a little better and there also was heat, there was a stove there. </sentence><sentence id="2700">A typical Polish stove out of stone I think they were made. </sentence><sentence id="2701">I remember there was heat in there. </sentence><sentence id="2702">Not always that we had something to burn, but there was enough wood laying around because of the demolition we did on those buildings, so it didn't cost anything to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2703">But there is one point I want to make that just came to my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2704">I happen to believe very strongly, and maybe that's in conclusion later on, that this entire issue of the Jews, Auschwitz, etcetera, the destruction of the six million of our people was a very large money-making event for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2705">That served and financed the biggest  8 part of the war industry. </sentence><sentence id="2706">Because a few realize how much we were told what to bring. </sentence><sentence id="2707">You realized that every person who went through Birkenau that I know of, and other camps I'm sure the same, and all the gas and all the crematoriums in the different camps, they looked in your mouth and if you had gold fillings -- had rings, my mother had a wedding ring and my father had a wedding band, so did everyone else who were married couples, there was enormous hordes of gold. </sentence><sentence id="2708">And I remember one day in Warsaw I found in a house, someone had found, and we had four diamonds, four diamond stones. </sentence><sentence id="2709">Was worth about, maybe 5-6 carats of diamond. </sentence><sentence id="2710">I didn't know anything about that, but somebody said it's a very good amount. </sentence><sentence id="2711">I sold it for a little piece of bread to a Hungarian because he only got there three days before. </sentence><sentence id="2712">He thought he made a big purchase. </sentence><sentence id="2713">Well, I had the bread and I lived and he had no bread that day or for two days, so he didn't get anything for two days. </sentence><sentence id="2714">So there was so much, I mean dollar bills, gold laying on the streets, silver. </sentence><sentence id="2715">But the wealth of just the clothing alone, you'll see the lists that we have at our museum, and the valuable things just pulled out of that ghetto, and that's done in many places, that financed the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2716">It was a money making event for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2717">It was a money making event. </sentence><sentence id="2718">Aside from they hated the Jews and wanted them all killed, but they made money on the deal. </sentence><sentence id="2719">The clothing, the hair was sold all over the world, recycled in some form. </sentence></p></dialogue>
