<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Before we were Bar Mitzvahed my parents pleaded with my brother and I to go to shul for the High Holidays and we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="123">And we compromised. </sentence><sentence id="124">We said well we'll get dressed and we" ll walk around temple so everyone will see us but we're not going in because we didn't know Hebrew and also being refugees and being survivors we felt in a way alienated from the Jewish community about us. </sentence><sentence id="125">And that is something that is very typical of people with our story. </sentence><sentence id="126">In some way we were met with a lot of not understanding. </sentence><sentence id="127">I always have felt very alienated from Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="128">I knew when I grew up in Brooklyn there were times where I would be beaten up for being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="129">Easter would roll around and the Italian kids, boys, would come from Avenue X and we lived on Avenue Z and Avenue Y was a dividing line and you had the Italian people living on Avenue X and the Jewish people living on Avenue Z. And as what was popularly known then Jewish boys did not fight. </sentence><sentence id="130">They did not fight. </sentence><sentence id="131">So Easter would come around and I with my friends would be playing outside and Italian boys would come into the neighborhood and they would tell us we killed Christ. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I didn't know who this boy Christ was, I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I certainly knew that I and no one had killed anybody recently. </sentence><sentence id="134">So they would attack us and beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="135">We didn't know about fighting back. </sentence><sentence id="136">So that happened a few times. </sentence><sentence id="137">And I guess that was one of many punctuation marks in my feeling not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="138">And for many years I did not in some way come out as being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="139">I did not come forward with it. </sentence><sentence id="140">I did not cultivate my social relationships based on people being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="141">I had friends from all kinds of groups as I do now. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Well, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="165">We came to America in 1949, my parents, my brother, who was really my step- brother as I'll go on to tell later, my aunt and uncle and their two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="166">We lived in Far Rockaway. </sentence><sentence id="167">First few months we had an attic and we all slept on cots in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="168">And then at some point we got an apartment in Rockaway. </sentence><sentence id="169">We got two basement apartments which were about three blocks from the ocean which us kids in the family absolutely loved because it meant  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection our summers we had a lot to do and to play. </sentence><sentence id="170">But in the spring when the rains came the basement would always be flooded and we'd always have to buy a new rug. </sentence><sentence id="171">So it was a sort of immigrant story. </sentence><sentence id="172">And then in 1951 when Beachhaven which was one of the first projects that Fred Trump built (which is the Donald's father) built in Brooklyn, my parents moved out there. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was a very big step. </sentence><sentence id="174">It really was an attempt for my parents to start to build something for us. </sentence><sentence id="175">At one point they talked about wanting to move to Long Island which was also considered a step up and buy a home there which they never did. </sentence><sentence id="176">I as of late come to understand that there was a subtext to our life which was around the matter of denial and that had to do with getting on with life and putting all that stuff behind us, just get on with life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: I hate to stop you but could you tell me what happened to your family during the war? </sentence><sentence id="193">We started with your birth so there are two more years at least. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: There's plenty. </sentence><sentence id="197">So I was born on August second. </sentence><sentence id="198">This was the time when people were already being deported to Vestaburg which was a transit camp in the north of Holland, in the moors, God forsaken nowhere place. </sentence><sentence id="199">From Vestaburg every Tuesday the transport went east. </sentence><sentence id="200">People went either to Auschwitz, to Treblinka, to Sobibor, to Chelmo where most of my grandparents, aunts and uncles perished. </sentence><sentence id="201">Because our name was Trompettor and as I said not like Cohen or a lot of typical Dutch Jewish names my father who belonged to a butcher's union which was taken over by the Dutch Fascists, the Jewish names would all be crossed off. </sentence><sentence id="202">Trompettor was not crossed off which meant we would continue to get their news letter but this time with the National Socialist masthead on it. </sentence><sentence id="203">So my father would conspicuously leave it on a little side table by the door in case there were raids and people would come in they would see this and think my father was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="204">Upstairs though in the same house lived my mother's parents. </sentence><sentence id="205">During this time the Jewish Council in Amsterdam as there were in many countries had a list of all the people who were in Holland who were Jewish and the list was made available to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="206">And I know there is much argument about the role of the Jewish Council. </sentence><sentence id="207">Because my parents were, I guess, working class people and sympathetic to the left of the political spectrum they had a certain kind of savvy about what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="208">In Holland from "33 on you had over 25,000 German Jewish refugees so stories got around. </sentence><sentence id="209">People got a sense of the brutality that was there. </sentence><sentence id="210">When my father was arrested and beaten up as he tells it, he was of course among other things shocked. </sentence><sentence id="211">Something like this never happened to him and he felt that with this kind of brutality it was going to get worse and nothing would stop the Germans and that if they were capable of this no one was safe. </sentence><sentence id="212">And that's what he felt. </sentence><sentence id="213">Before that happened there was the curfew, there were people being taken away, there were street fights in Jewish neighborhoods. </sentence><sentence id="214">Dutch fascists would come into the Jewish neighborhoods, the ice-cream parlors, the tea houses and start fights and there would be these altercations. </sentence><sentence id="215">But when he was beaten up he understood how bad it was and he decided then he was going to go underground. </sentence><sentence id="216">He was not going to register. </sentence><sentence id="217">My mother's brother, Shok who is the name I was given, Jack, in honor of him, I think he was a very active Socialist and as my mother tells the story right before or after I was born she's in my parents" home and my mother's brother Shok is still living there she enters into his room and sees him with a tallis and he's praying. </sentence><sentence id="218">And she is shocked because she's known him as a what should we call it an agnostic, an atheist. </sentence><sentence id="219">My mother says what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="220">And he says, well he's praying so his parents won't be taken away and has decided that he will go and register in their place. </sentence><sentence id="221">Throughout the early period of the German occupations and the subjugation of the Jewish community there were continual regulations that were tended to deceive people. </sentence><sentence id="222">One of them was that if the young people in the family would register, the old people would not be taken. </sentence><sentence id="223">This was of course a way of sabotaging and undermining any form of resistance and many, many people believed it. </sentence><sentence id="224">You have to  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection understand and appreciate that. </sentence><sentence id="225">What some people might see as stupidity or cooperation isn't quite that. </sentence><sentence id="226">It has to be understood in the context of Holland is a country that's very much concerned with law, with rules, with order. </sentence><sentence id="227">I always feel that they're kind of caught between the anvil of Calvinism and the hammer of Anarchism and the reason for that is because cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam are international cities and the Dutch have been for a few hundred years an international merchant people. </sentence><sentence id="228">So not to register was considered an illegal act even though it was clear to many that those who were in power, who made the law, were evil. </sentence><sentence id="229">But my father decided he was not going to register, he was going to do something else. </sentence><sentence id="230">That was a very big step. </sentence><sentence id="231">It was the first step to resistance. </sentence><sentence id="232">Many people of course had no idea what was going on in the east after the transports. </sentence><sentence id="233">People really believed they were going to be settled in some farm somewhere to dig potatoes and till the soil. </sentence><sentence id="234">But because my father had a certain political savvy he knew what German Fascism meant as people did. </sentence><sentence id="235">So he decided he was not going to register; he was going to go underground. </sentence><sentence id="236">The problem was what does that mean? </sentence><sentence id="237">How do you do it? </sentence><sentence id="238">Who do you make contact with? </sentence><sentence id="239">Who do you trust? </sentence><sentence id="240">And it was all luck. </sentence><sentence id="241">So my mother's brother Shok decides he's going to register to save the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="242">He registers. </sentence><sentence id="243">He is sent to Vestaborg. </sentence><sentence id="244">At some point from Vestaborg he sends my mother a card, my mother and father a card that says don't bring the red baby wagon which was their code for saying do not come, do not bring Jackie as I was known because even in Vestaborg which was not as horrible as the camps in the east there was constructed to deceive people. </sentence><sentence id="245">Actually when I say this I am stunned at how remarkable the deception was, to be deceived. </sentence><sentence id="246">In some way I know this is in hindsight I get very angry at it. </sentence><sentence id="247">How could people be so stupid? </sentence><sentence id="248">And on the other hand how can I say that? </sentence><sentence id="249">And all of it is a, it's a mix of feelings one has, I have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: I think you pointed it out when you said how the Dutch people were concerned with order and all that and they say they came in so fast to Holland and people were in shock and they just rounded up and took them out. </sentence><sentence id="307">I don't think they had time to really think. </sentence><sentence id="308">That was my impression. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Yeah, but you know they had people coming in from Germany from 1933 with stories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: True. </sentence><sentence id="315">True. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: Hitler and Hitler did not have a reputation other than terrorism, cajoling, bullyism. </sentence><sentence id="319">He's the ultimate form of European bullyism. </sentence><sentence id="320">So my father comes home; I am born. </sentence><sentence id="321">They decide they're going to go underground. </sentence><sentence id="322">And one of the terrible things that also happens is that one considers the older people, the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="323">What do they do? </sentence><sentence id="324">How do they go underground?And the family is kind of in some way the younger people start to provide for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="325">This is a question my cousins and I have often wondered about. </sentence><sentence id="326">What about the grandparents; what do you do? </sentence><sentence id="327">And I understand it's a terrible question and it's one I have asked my mother and never really gotten any kind of a satisfactory answer and I'm a little bit ashamed to even pursue it. </sentence><sentence id="328">But I wonder about it. </sentence><sentence id="329">I can tell you one story, terrible story. </sentence><sentence id="330">My father has the newspaper with the National Socialist masthead left at the table. </sentence><sentence id="331">There is a raid one day. </sentence><sentence id="332">The Dutch police, the green police which were the German police come in. </sentence><sentence id="333">They know the people who live upstairs are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="334">They come to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="335">It turns out to be my mother's parents and it is my mother's mother's, my grandmother's birthday that this happens. </sentence><sentence id="336">And my mother of course is beside herself in shock, terrible, terrible. </sentence><sentence id="337">You can imagine how terrible something like that is. </sentence><sentence id="338">My father gathers his wits; he goes to the police. </sentence><sentence id="339">He says, we've known our neighbors for a long time could we please say goodbye to them? </sentence><sentence id="340">The Germans say yes. </sentence><sentence id="341">So here are my parents saying goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="342">My father is saying goodbye to his in-laws, my mother is  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection saying goodbye to her parents as if they were just neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="343">It's a terrible thing and I often wonder what my mother has done with that pain and that grief. </sentence><sentence id="344">She has written it all down. </sentence><sentence id="345">So my mother's parents are taken away. </sentence><sentence id="346">I don't know whether at this point before or after my father's parents are taken away. </sentence><sentence id="347">Some of the brothers and sisters have been taken away, some have not. </sentence><sentence id="348">Those that remain decide to go underground and it means you don't tell anyone else where you're going because it's unsafe. </sentence><sentence id="349">All you could do is tell your parents goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="350">When people went underground at the time they had no idea for how long this would be. </sentence><sentence id="351">No one knew. </sentence><sentence id="352">Some people thought weeks, months. </sentence><sentence id="353">No one thought of years. </sentence><sentence id="354">My parents had saved some money so they had money that they knew they would need to provide for their keep while they were underground. </sentence><sentence id="355">They made a connection through someone they knew who knew someone who knew someone to two people whose names are Cory and Jan Van Nomberg who are people who I now know as my aunt and uncle who live in Tilburg who we have been very close to since the war; people who I'm very, very fond of. </sentence><sentence id="356">He was in the Dutch cavalry. </sentence><sentence id="357">He was a sort of, I wouldn't say monarchist, but he was a very good Dutch patriot. </sentence><sentence id="358">They came from Tilburg, a Catholic family. </sentence><sentence id="359">Holland is kind of divided like that. </sentence><sentence id="360">The people in the south are Catholic, the people in the north are Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="361">They came from a good Catholic family but he hated the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="362">Not that he hated National Socialism but he hated the Germans because they invaded his country. </sentence><sentence id="363">He wanted to do something. </sentence><sentence id="364">My parents ended up with them. </sentence><sentence id="365">At first the story was that my father was on the run; he didn't want to serve in the army. </sentence><sentence id="366">I don't know, what you would call a deserter. </sentence><sentence id="367">So they were taken in by Cory and Jan based on that. </sentence><sentence id="368">But there is a sense that Cory and Jan did kind of know that that was not the story, that they might be Jews. </sentence><sentence id="369">At some point early on in their underground experience it becomes apparent, it's talked about and Cory and Jan decide well we've gone this far with you we're not going to turn you away. </sentence><sentence id="370">And my parents spent from November of 1942 till the liberation in May with these people. </sentence><sentence id="371">I went underground about a week, a few days or a week before they went underground. </sentence><sentence id="372">I was three months old when I went underground. </sentence><sentence id="373">You can imagine, if you can imagine what it was like for my mother to give up her child with the hope that she is saving my life with always the knowledge of the possibility I'm being offered up to destruction. </sentence><sentence id="374">We were one of the lucky families. </sentence><sentence id="375">We all survived. </sentence><sentence id="376">My parents survived. </sentence><sentence id="377">I survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: I was circumcised. </sentence><sentence id="444">It's something I don't understand why people would take the chance of doing that, would take the chance because when there were raids the Germans would pull down the pants of the men in the street to see if they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="445">Remarkable, remarkable, crude to say the least. </sentence><sentence id="446">Yeah, but you know I guess you circumcise your child to show your fealty. </sentence><sentence id="447">It's a practice that I have real questions about. </sentence><sentence id="448">I'm afraid that I've gotten lost in some -- I'm not ina track. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1578">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add about your own experience or that of your family, your relatives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1580">A: Well at the expense of sounding whiny, I would say that my family like many, many people got screwed by Europe and we came here in 1949 and my parents had to start from scratch again and never could quite build it up to where they had in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1581">They worked very hard in Holland and they did well for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And I do marvel actually at my parents the ability to go into hiding, provide for themselves and survive. </sentence><sentence id="1583">When I was in my teens and going through my rebellion I pooh-poohed my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1584">What did they know? </sentence><sentence id="1585">I knew much more than they did. </sentence><sentence id="1586">And now, of course, I think what a little snot-nose I was to think that. </sentence><sentence id="1587">They had to live through and make life decisions through something I have not had to and hope to God I and no one else will ever have to make. </sentence><sentence id="1588">And they were ordinary people, simple people and they rose to the occasion and the people that hid them were ordinary human beings and they rose to the occasion. </sentence><sentence id="1589">Those were the heroes. </sentence><sentence id="1590">My parents were the heroes. </sentence><sentence id="1591">The people that hid them were the heroes. </sentence><sentence id="1592">And the stories they tell of what they did during the war to survive is remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="1593">My mother taught Cory how to sew. </sentence><sentence id="1594">What they did -- they would get clothing and they would take it apart and remake things out of it and they would sell or exchange that for foodstuffs. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And when my parents were hidden underground no one on the street in the town, of course, knew they were being hidden. </sentence><sentence id="1596">The parents of Cory knew but not her younger brother. </sentence><sentence id="1597">It was too dangerous to let people know. </sentence><sentence id="1598">And Jan would get food. </sentence><sentence id="1599">He had those wide pants at the time, very wide flair pants, very popular then, like bell-bottoms in some way and they sewed these cloth bags to the inside of their pants that they would fill with foodstuffs and he would bicycle home with them. </sentence><sentence id="1600">They also had to be careful because they couldn't trade for food that would be evident that there was more than two people in the household eating so it had to be all done in different places and as my mother tells it they were never hungry during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1601">They always had enough foodstuffs. </sentence><sentence id="1602">And she would take great pleasure going down to the cellar and looking at the shelves and seeing what food they were able to store. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1626">Q: Interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1628">A: It is interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1629">I know I lived on a farm from 1977 to 1980. </sentence><sentence id="1630">Actually I did farming in New England from 1973 to 1980 when I lived with someone and we raised, we had a milk cow, we raised hogs, we raised chickens, we raised sheep, we raised a lot of our own foodstuffs. </sentence><sentence id="1631">And I would go down to the cellar and I would put up forty quarts of applesauce, sixty quarts of tomatoes, freezer filled with meat, freezer filled with vegetables, cords of wood stacked up -- very New England. </sentence><sentence id="1632">And I would go look at all this and stand there like a proud man with my hand in my suspenders looking at it and not at the time understanding what was going on was some kind of replication of some need that my parents went through. </sentence><sentence id="1633">My parents went back to Holland in 1972 because they wanted to retire and they could do it there rather than here and it was also the year that I went to live in Vermont during the summer and ended up staying there and ended up actually having left New York City and shortly after ended up in a farm situation and I do wonder now how I had replicated my war experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1634">In a way it makes me feel very bad that my agenda was so unconscious that my going into this farm and farming was a matter of going into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1635">I had a big beard, I had long hair, I looked very different than I do now. </sentence><sentence id="1636">I was in hiding and it makes m feel very badly that I still had to act this out and it happened at the same time as my parents decided to go back to Europe and again it was a kind of a split with my family, a separation. </sentence><sentence id="1637">I understand it now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1648">Q: What motivated them to actually -- you said because they could retire there now. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Have you </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1652">   decided to continue this interview after all? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1653">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1654">I want to read this little piece, that is what my wife and I translated from my mother's journal that she spent seven years writing about her and the family's wartime experience. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And what's interesting is she has said that in writing this it made her feel much better. </sentence><sentence id="1656">She's really the only one in her family that even talks about this stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1657">For years my brother and I even after we moved out of our parents" home when we'd come home to visit would ask them about the war. </sentence><sentence id="1658">And inevitably every time we got together the conversation would come back to that and there were questions. </sentence><sentence id="1659">My brother and I always had to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1660">At one point we finally decided let's get Mom a tape recorder and see if she'd really do this. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And she did. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And she spent seven years writing this stuff down. </sentence><sentence id="1663">And it was done without a typewriter, without a personal computer, just by hand. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And she got so involved with it that when Cory wanted to go out with her shopping or something Celene wouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1665">She really wanted to do this and complete it and as I said she felt in a way that a burden was taken off her chest. </sentence><sentence id="1666">There's one little piece I want to read that could give you an idea of what it was like at the time that my parents made the decision to go underground and to provide and look for a place for me. </sentence><sentence id="1667">On the fifteenth of November Eddie (which was my mother's other brother) visited us with great sadness because of what had happened to Father, Mother and our brother Jack. </sentence><sentence id="1668">During this visit he told us he had an underground address for Dad and myself and a separate one for you, Jack. </sentence><sentence id="1669">It's written for you because this whole manuscript was written for my brother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1670">So that's the form it takes. </sentence><sentence id="1671">Very distressed with the idea of parting from our baby, Eddie tried to convince us that your chances, Jack were better without us. </sentence><sentence id="1672">If we were captured he explained at least you might survive. </sentence><sentence id="1673">He also knew it would be easier to find a separate place for a couple without children. </sentence><sentence id="1674">They would not bring to the underground family the additional burden and security risk of children crying or needing medical attention and such. </sentence><sentence id="1675">All night Eddie talked with us. </sentence><sentence id="1676">What an extraordinary demand -- give up our three month old child to perfect strangers and without opportunities to visit. </sentence><sentence id="1677">We had no idea how long such an arrangement would have to last, a month, half a year, longer, who knew. </sentence><sentence id="1678">The next day we talked with my brother Maritz. </sentence><sentence id="1679">In the serious way that's so typical of him he asked Dad and me to consider the following : imagine the German police catching you, he said, this could happen at any moment. </sentence><sentence id="1680">The baby will fall into their hands. </sentence><sentence id="1681">Wouldn't you rather have a child with Ollie and me (Ollie was his wife) until Eddie takes them to a hiding place? </sentence><sentence id="1682">Dad and I found a lot of truth in what he said. </sentence><sentence id="1683">Here was a chance so many people wanted but had no opportunity of getting. </sentence><sentence id="1684">How could we pass it up. </sentence><sentence id="1685">We felt that no matter what we did we would be doomed if we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1686">Already the families of several of our brothers and sisters had been torn apart by arrests and deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1687">A few months ago, Case, the husband of Dad's sister, Bepe, had been taken to Camp Westerbork leaving Bepe at home alone with their two year- old daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Westerbork was located in Northern Holland and the Jews were sent from there to the different concentration camps, Auschwitz, Sobibor. </sentence><sentence id="1689">Maritz Trompettor, who was my father's brother, had been in the same camp for half a year by then. </sentence><sentence id="1690">His wife, Femma and their daughters were still at home. </sentence><sentence id="1691">The children's home in which Femma worked was soon seized by the SS and the Green Police. </sentence><sentence id="1692">They captured the Jewish infants and sent them with their mothers to be gassed or destroyed in one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="1693">But Femma protected herself and her daughters and then found underground addresses for each of them. </sentence><sentence id="1694">This is my Aunt Femma who died a year ago. </sentence><sentence id="1695">She was very active in finding hiding places for children. </sentence><sentence id="1696">She was a very brave and very strong and feisty woman. </sentence><sentence id="1697">The thing is many people were brave and feisty and strong and everything but in some way it was luck. </sentence><sentence id="1698">It was luck that you survived but it didn't necessarily mean that you were lucky or that being lucky meant you were better than anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="1699">My brother Maritz and his family were still intact and living at the Transvaalstraat. </sentence><sentence id="1700">My mother's brother Maritz   was born in England because his parents took a trip to England and he was born there so he had dual citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1701">He had British and Dutch citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1702">He eventually ended up in Bergen- Belsen but Belsen was not an extermination camp and because he was a British citizen they didn't kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1703">It also allowed for his wife Ollie to bring food packages to him which helped him to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1704">Eddie, another brother, because he was involved with the resistance moved around from one temporary hiding place to another. </sentence><sentence id="1705">He never went permanently underground. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Indeed with his pure blue eyes and curly blond hair he thought he would be taken for a German rather than a Dutch Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1707">Brazen as he was he had been riding trains filled with Germans and these experiences gave him this idea. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Of course he did not know that in time he would be the victim of betrayal. </sentence><sentence id="1709">He was betrayed. </sentence><sentence id="1710">My close friend Marie which is my brother's/cousin's mother which is Andy's mother, another of Dad's sisters was still at home with her husband, Cheel and their six month old infant Andy. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Like us they lived with all the worries and fears of keeping Andy out of the hands of the pack of thieves. </sentence><sentence id="1712">By now Dad's other sister, Judith, her husband and their four year old daughter Laney had been underground for three months. </sentence><sentence id="1713">With great difficulty and sadness we struggled over our decision to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1714">There was not even a guarantee that all would go well underground. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Inasmuch as no guarantee was to be found with any choice we made we finally decided to go ahead with Eddie's plan. </sentence><sentence id="1716">He promised that within a week we would be told all the details. </sentence><sentence id="1717">This was the best of the worst of situations. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Maritz's wife Ollie also had to agree with the arrangement because she would be also responsible for caring for our son, me. </sentence><sentence id="1719">No one knew for how long. </sentence><sentence id="1720">It could take two days, it could take a month. </sentence><sentence id="1721">But Ollie agreed without talking to us. </sentence><sentence id="1722">It was good enough for her that my brothers wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="1723">We have always been grateful to her. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Ollie died two and a half months ago and I wrote her daughter and her step-daughters a letter saying something like this about what a decent person she was and how we owe our thanks to her and I wrote this letter as -- it was ostensibly a condolence letter but I wanted to say something to her daughters about what a fine person she was. </sentence><sentence id="1725">We cared a great deal for our family. </sentence><sentence id="1726">Sisters, brothers and children were heavy on our hearts and particularly the old people. </sentence><sentence id="1727">What did one do with the old people. </sentence><sentence id="1728">Grandma and Grandfather Trompettor were still living at home. </sentence><sentence id="1729">They were fortunate for the moment because Shuls, one of their sons, one of my father's brothers, and his family lived nearby allowing them to help his parents through thick and thin. </sentence><sentence id="1730">But with his loving attention to them and his recent service period away from home (he had to serve in the army) he hadn't been able to find an underground address. </sentence><sentence id="1731">The old people understood that for them life was finished. </sentence><sentence id="1732">One sees this now on the photographs taken of them for their identity papers. </sentence><sentence id="1733">Even if they went underground, which seldom happened, their chance for survival was very slim. </sentence><sentence id="1734">As long as the war continued it became clear to them that they would eventually be left by themselves, most likely never again to be with the people they so dearly loved. </sentence><sentence id="1735">Often enough there was talk of the underground and so with great grief they began to live with it (meaning the children going underground). </sentence><sentence id="1736">Thus was something we simply could not continue to think about. </sentence><sentence id="1737">If one became too sensitive and afraid then one might let an opportunity go by. </sentence><sentence id="1738">We grew resolute. </sentence><sentence id="1739">We did not tell anyone about our plan other than Father and Mother Trompettor. </sentence><sentence id="1740">You, Jack and I had recently visited them and I did not expect them to say goodbye to us again. </sentence><sentence id="1741">From their gestures at our departure I saw that for them it was a real goodbye, not just a good-day until the next time. </sentence><sentence id="1742">Clearly they suspected something. </sentence><sentence id="1743">Every evening for years Dad visited them for a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1744">Now he went to tell them of our decision. </sentence><sentence id="1745">How does one present such a sad prospect. </sentence><sentence id="1746">Like their other children we too kept the details for ourselves for the sake of security. </sentence><sentence id="1747">You took nobody into your confidence. </sentence><sentence id="1748">This was what the bad society had made of us. </sentence><sentence id="1749">Later as it turned out all those who were still at home except for Uncles Jules eventually went underground but it consoled us little to learn that we were not the only ones who had to leave parents. </sentence><sentence id="1750">This is a very telling piece which always perplexes me. </sentence><sentence id="1751">For me the leaving was not so    difficult because my parents were not here anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1752">This is my mother talking because her parents were already taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1753">What I have left if they were still at home. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Dad asked himself this question. </sentence><sentence id="1755">No good answer was found. </sentence><sentence id="1756">Today, forty years later, I do not think I would have made this choice again. </sentence><sentence id="1757">The twentieth of November 1942 arrives. </sentence><sentence id="1758">It is early in the morning and I am home alone when Eddie comes to our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1759">We must be ready before eight o'clock that night, he says, to begin with the first part of our journey into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1760">As we had originally agreed he himself--------- (let's see if I can find the other piece of that). </sentence><sentence id="1761">Eddie himself would bring us. </sentence><sentence id="1762">Everything was planned that way. </sentence><sentence id="1763">Jackie, that's me, would be picked up by my brother Maritz at seven o'clock in the evening and from thereon a place would be found in the children's house in Neimachen. </sentence><sentence id="1764">This was just as Eddie said it would happen from the agreed upon plans made earlier on. </sentence><sentence id="1765">We were expected to pay 300 guilder a month to the children's house. </sentence><sentence id="1766">We did just this even though in this time this amount of money was a large amount for working class people. </sentence><sentence id="1767">It was organized so that we would have a particular amount with us and Eddie would hold on to the rest. </sentence><sentence id="1768">In case something went wrong with us there would still be enough money for a definite time to pay the kinder house. </sentence><sentence id="1769">In the beginning we could know if we had enough money or not for the duration of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1770">We naively thought it would be possible. </sentence><sentence id="1771">As I have said as soon as I knew the plan that morning Chait ver Kike the neighbor and I delivered our household goods to her apartment with the help of her husband. </sentence><sentence id="1772">This is a neighbor who was very friendly with my parents who agreed to buy their furniture so my parents could raise money and they knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1773">When you went underground and you left you couldn't leave abruptly because then immediately someone would be on your tail so my parents planned this over time so they could slowly leave.. They would leave someone paying some of their bills and it would be months before it was realized that they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1774">And my mother has often talked about how she felt she had to be like a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="1775">She had to think like a criminal because the law was in the hands of the criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1776">She as an ordinary person had to think like that to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Dad was quickly warned at work I do not know by whom. </sentence><sentence id="1778">At four o'clock he came home which was very unusual for Thursday when he usually came home about eight o'clock or later. </sentence><sentence id="1779">He just told his boss he had to go away for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1780">Because it was so busy on Thursdays this boss told him to be quick and come back as soon as possible but Dad knew better. </sentence><sentence id="1781">He then went for the last time to his mother and father who were in a dejected mood and not without reason. </sentence><sentence id="1782">They had just before found out that their daughter Judith, her husband and child, Yope and Laney were betrayed and handed over to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1783">We will never know if the Trompettor grandparents knew that Laney was in fact still with her benefactor having gotten away from her executioners. </sentence><sentence id="1784">This is my cousin Laney who lives in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1785">I'm almost absolutely certain they did not know otherwise we would have heard it from Uncle Jules. </sentence><sentence id="1786">For Dad at the moment while this was indeed a grim message he tried not to be disheartened. </sentence><sentence id="1787">On the contrary this news of his sister strengthened him in his resolve to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1788">In answer to your question about their character. </sentence><sentence id="1789">You never really know the full depth I suppose of your character until something extraordinarily intervenes and then if you're lucky you rise to the occasion. </sentence><sentence id="1790">Dad also told his parents what we were going to do that night but what could these poor people do but accept our leaving them. </sentence><sentence id="1791">This was the last time that Dad was ever again to be with his parents. </sentence><sentence id="1792">Here was the new episode between parents and children finished under the saddest of circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="1793">Still to come were many more moments of separation. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Dad came home and told me that what he had just learned from his parents about his sister and her family. </sentence><sentence id="1795">I felt very sad but now realized that we had come this far and we definitely had to continue with our plans, the sooner the better. </sentence><sentence id="1796">And this of course then is my mother's moment when she too becomes resolute. </sentence><sentence id="1797">We ate something and got dressed as if we were going out. </sentence><sentence id="1798">We put on our best clothing because you never knew. </sentence><sentence id="1799">Seven o'clock in the evening November 20, 1942 my brother Maritz came to take Jackie away. </sentence><sentence id="1800">What   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection amoment. </sentence><sentence id="1801">Would we ever see you again? </sentence><sentence id="1802">We embraced you; it had to be. </sentence><sentence id="1803">It was for us to say the least the only chance. </sentence><sentence id="1804">We had to try but how do you do something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1805">Who gives you the strength to hand over your three month old child a bundle that you love so much and have learned every gesture in those three months. </sentence><sentence id="1806">When we gave you to Uncle Maritz Zomerplaag we knew there would be a place prepared for you in the Catholic children's home. </sentence><sentence id="1807">Later as it turned out we found out it was a non-denominational. </sentence><sentence id="1808">It was a Quaker house where the director took in various children but mostly those in Catholic families. </sentence><sentence id="1809">My brother Eddie found that he made more of an impression on us when he said it was a children's home. </sentence><sentence id="1810">I surmised this at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1811">It did indeed make a better impression on us. </sentence><sentence id="1812">Eddie said that it would still take a few days before there would be a permanent place for you there. </sentence><sentence id="1813">Later we learned that those few days turned into a month but it was a good thing that we didn't know that at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1814">In those four weeks of waiting you were almost a fatality. </sentence><sentence id="1815">I will return to this later. ( </sentence><sentence id="1816">This is where I talked about that). </sentence><sentence id="1817">It's remarkable to me. </sentence><sentence id="1818">It helps to explain what I feel about my anxiety and insecurity in the world that as a baby I took in all this near destruction of stuff and from what we know now about children take in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1819">It was our wish to survive this drama with Jack back with us. </sentence><sentence id="1820">Therefore it was necessary to arrive at our destination safely. </sentence><sentence id="1821">This wish was for us so strong and so consumed us that it became for us the strength needed to give you over to fulfill this unbelievable and horribly sad task. </sentence><sentence id="1822">Without exaggeration from that moment on we thought about you every day. </sentence><sentence id="1823">I would like to read a little bit more. </sentence><sentence id="1824">I don't know if there's a...... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2025">Q: With regard to him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2027">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2028">As soon as Maritz took Jackie out of the house we too went on our way to the Umstel train station just as we had planned. </sentence><sentence id="2029">This took ten minutes. </sentence><sentence id="2030">We closed the door on the largest part of our household's possessions and most of our clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2031">Obviously they must not have had their yellow star on because they could not have been out. </sentence><sentence id="2032">In the meantime Dad had left a half-year's rent money behind with our landlord. </sentence><sentence id="2033">The landlord knew we were going away but not when. </sentence><sentence id="2034">If this helped us we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2035">It did give us the idea that we would say the lease not be looked at for six months although certainly not out of dispute with the landlord although betrayal or discovery was always naturally a possibility. </sentence><sentence id="2036">In any case later on we heard of the first raid of our apartment and that it was sealed up by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2037">Thus we were not searched for in the first raid. </sentence><sentence id="2038">From this we conclude that paying the landlord that way we did serve our purposes well. </sentence><sentence id="2039">I would like to read about when my father found me. </sentence><sentence id="2040">I feel I need to have my voice back again. </sentence><sentence id="2041">That's the problem with this. </sentence><sentence id="2042">My brother and I were instrumental in getting   my mother to do this and it means a lot to me and I'm very pleased she did it but in reading it, it also pushes my button about what about me -- now. </sentence><sentence id="2043">Dad felt it was now time for him to begin his own search for you. </sentence><sentence id="2044">We are reading now about the part where my parents have been liberated and my parents decide to look for the children, to look for whatever children are still alive. </sentence><sentence id="2045">We had no idea how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2046">We had no guidance but our patience was up and we could not wait for information that would inform us about what happened with you and Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2047">Because of the behavior of your step parents we later understood that they would not take any action making known that during the war-time they had hidden a child. </sentence><sentence id="2048">Many people like them were attached to the children in their care, very understandable. </sentence><sentence id="2049">The family De Chot presumed that Dad and I were no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="2050">We now know that in our situation regarding you that you would have then been returned to us. </sentence><sentence id="2051">What happened during the war too is people did get attached to their children and there were many legal cases in Holland after the war where the families who survived had to go to court to get the children back. </sentence><sentence id="2052">The nature of some of these cases is very telling about Dutch ethics because after the war the way people survived was through the black market. </sentence><sentence id="2053">There was no doubt about it, that's how you survived. </sentence><sentence id="2054">My mother feels embarrassed about it. </sentence><sentence id="2055">She thinks it's shameful. </sentence><sentence id="2056">She prefers I not saying anything about it but the fact is that's how people survived. </sentence><sentence id="2057">Gentile families who did not want to return their Jewish children would often use that as an argument why the parents were not responsible parents and could not have the children back and in many cases did not get the children back because of that. </sentence><sentence id="2058">Many of the people who hid the children also had a religious agenda. </sentence><sentence id="2059">They felt they needed to convert these children and it wasn't always a self-serving sentiment. </sentence><sentence id="2060">It was also the sentiment of how to save the children. </sentence><sentence id="2061">To convert them would be to save them, so it was mixed. </sentence><sentence id="2062">The reason there was a high percentage of Dutch Jewish children who were able to go underground was because to save the people of the Book would be considered a mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="2063">The Jews were known as the people of the Book and for many of the Protestants in Holland they took their bible literally, it's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2064">With Andy it would have turned out differently because his parents were no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="2065">More about that later. </sentence><sentence id="2066">Dad didn't want to wait any more while the information just dribbled in and as I said went out on his own. </sentence><sentence id="2067">After enquiring he found out where to go to the military authorities and get a special pass that allowed him to hitch rides on military transport. </sentence><sentence id="2068">There was no other transport at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2069">You didn't have buses, you didn't have subways, you didn't have zip. </sentence><sentence id="2070">This meant only army vehicles. </sentence><sentence id="2071">The fact is there simply wasn't any other transport yet. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Still this meant quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="2073">Again Dad left the house with nothing but a little money for necessities which themselves weren't easy to buy. </sentence><sentence id="2074">The military authorities gave Dad very good advice. </sentence><sentence id="2075">The told him he must begin his search north of the rivers because Holland is in the middle divided by a bunch of rivers. </sentence><sentence id="2076">Because there was known that in the province Overeisel there were children who had been bought for hiding so the story goes light haired children above the rivers which wasn't true of you at all. </sentence><sentence id="2077">What Celene is talking about is that the people who hid children during the war had a policy that dark haired Jewish children would go to the south of Holland where most of the people were Catholic and were darker and the lighter skinned, lighter haired Jewish people would go to the north because there were Protestants who were lighter. </sentence><sentence id="2078">So Dad began with the purpose in front of his eyes, good or bad from one empty army truck or another finally ending up in the city of Naivadol in Overeisel. </sentence><sentence id="2079">We had never heard of this place before. </sentence><sentence id="2080">Once in Naivadol Dad immediately went to City Hall. </sentence><sentence id="2081">There he spoke to several bureaucrats. </sentence><sentence id="2082">One of them, Mr.Bucker, sent Dad on the way to Mrs. De Fries Andy's foster mother on the large street in Naivadol. </sentence><sentence id="2083">The man knew that there was a young boy that had been hidden. </sentence><sentence id="2084">When he arrived at Mrs. De Fries's home Dad was allowed in and saw to his stunned surprise a little boy of whom he though thought this could well be Andy, his nephew. </sentence><sentence id="2085">He had the family face and the age was also right. </sentence><sentence id="2086">Dad spoke with Mrs. De Fries. </sentence><sentence id="2087">He explained his relationship telling her his name    which at the moment was unknown to her. </sentence><sentence id="2088">After a while and for different reasons she understood that Dad was the brother of the mother of this child who she had taken over under her protection and who she was very fond of. </sentence><sentence id="2089">Dad was very lucky to have found Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2090">For Mrs. De Fries this was not a happy day. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Dad could see that it would not be easy to get Andy from her but that's a tale apart. </sentence><sentence id="2092">It got to be late in the day and thus Dad was invited to supper and slept there. </sentence><sentence id="2093">The few hours that were left Dad played with Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2094">Andy sat on Dad's lap and began to play with his ear lobe. </sentence><sentence id="2095">This was a habit that Dad's younger brother Yope one out of eight brothers and sisters always did as a little kid. </sentence><sentence id="2096">Mr. Bucker from City Hall also knew to tell Dad that a few kilometers between Naivadol and the town of Chaino stood an old small farm where there was also a young boy brought underground. </sentence><sentence id="2097">He suggested that Dad should check this farm out because that in any event he left Mrs. De Fries and planned to return for Andy. </sentence><sentence id="2098">She actually didn't give Dad any indication that she understood that she had to be separated from Andy at some point in the future. </sentence><sentence id="2099">Dad departed from Andy with mixed feelings from this complicated situation. </sentence><sentence id="2100">It was early in the morning when Dad continued his search for you. </sentence><sentence id="2101">He had to travel the long kilometers on foot. </sentence><sentence id="2102">He often said to me how he walked and walked and in the evening dead tired arrived somewhere on the side of a road in the village of Chaino. </sentence><sentence id="2103">He rang the bell of the farm. </sentence><sentence id="2104">It was already dark and about ten o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="2105">He waited for someone to answer the door which didn't happen right away. </sentence><sentence id="2106">They were people who were used to going to bed early and they were by then fast asleep. </sentence><sentence id="2107">Dad kept ringing the bell and finally a man stuck his head out of the attic window and asked what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2108">In the hope that the sound of a child crying was your crying Dad screwed up his courage to begin a conversation with this man. </sentence><sentence id="2109">He told the man who he was and why he had come. </sentence><sentence id="2110">They didn't plan to open the door right away answering Dad. </sentence><sentence id="2111">The child's parents died and that's why we took him through the intervention of our pastor. </sentence><sentence id="2112">At this point Dad asked to be let in, in any case. </sentence><sentence id="2113">He wanted them to know who he was by comparing something he had with him. </sentence><sentence id="2114">Oh I guess from reading this I see that they brought me to him that evening. </sentence><sentence id="2115">I thought that he slept over. </sentence><sentence id="2116">Dad was allowed in and right away showed the man a lamb's wool baby shirt because a similar one had been left with the baby boy when he was sent underground. </sentence><sentence id="2117">This was from the lamb's wool bathing suit that they had made. </sentence><sentence id="2118">The organization that provided contact with underground hiding places had told the family to save it in case the child had to be brought to another place. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Luckily in your situation this advice was heeded. </sentence><sentence id="2120">After comparing the two pieces this was evidence enough that the truth was being spoken here. </sentence><sentence id="2121">Only then did they bring you forth, a crying young boy of about two years old. </sentence><sentence id="2122">Dad saw in the blink of an eye that it was his son. </sentence><sentence id="2123">What a moment it must have been. </sentence><sentence id="2124">It was and is to value how these people didn't clam up but in one night were made 100% certain before believing something of the parental bond that was being talked about here. </sentence><sentence id="2125">This is understandable. </sentence><sentence id="2126">Here I could write some things but that I won't and don't want to. [ </sentence><sentence id="2127">ll leave that to imagination. </sentence><sentence id="2128">The truth is I don't know what she's talking about here and I'd really be curious. </sentence><sentence id="2129">What Dad told me about this after he took you in his arms that is not to be described except by Dad himself. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And so that was the first contact for Dad with the family who played a large role in your and our lives. </sentence><sentence id="2131">After an emotional discussion Dad was allowed to sleep there overnight. </sentence><sentence id="2132">You and the family slept upstairs while Dad was given a hay mattress and a small room downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="2133">From everything that Dad could see these people were very simple farmers, in fact poor people who notwithstanding the poverty knew how to hold themselves together. </sentence><sentence id="2134">The family consisted of a sixty five year old man who looked like he was eighty. </sentence><sentence id="2135">His wife who was also in her sixties wore a wig which was very unusual in those years. </sentence><sentence id="2136">They had an unmarried son who was about twenty eight years old who could be mistaken for forty and an unmarried young daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2137">When I saw them later I could see that they were a very stiff but decent people. </sentence><sentence id="2138">When she says stiff she means that they were Dutch Reformed, very conservative. </sentence><sentence id="2139">The people were as good for you as they could be because with them there   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was also great hunger which was readily apparent. </sentence><sentence id="2140">They had one horse and a few chickens left over. </sentence><sentence id="2141">The woman told Dad that her man still had to work on the land for other farmers. </sentence><sentence id="2142">For this he would every day get a plate of oatmeal and once in a while an egg. </sentence><sentence id="2143">You Jack, would sit by him and he would share his oatmeal and egg with you. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Mrs. De Chot told how she took apart one of her bedspreads and used the thread to make a coverall for you because all of your clothes were too small. </sentence><sentence id="2145">She also said she cut the tips of your shoes off so that they would still fit.(Laughter) Remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="2146">You know I haven't read this in a few years. </sentence><sentence id="2147">This can be seen from a photo that she made of you, her son and herself. </sentence><sentence id="2148">When I look at the photo and when I had first seen it I had the impression that she had made this coverall for the occasion of the photograph for which she derived great pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="2149">I've never seen this photo. </sentence><sentence id="2150">Not knowing that she would have to give you up. </sentence><sentence id="2151">Later at our first meeting she said that she never would have given you up had it not been your real parents who claimed you. </sentence><sentence id="2152">She had planned to have you baptized but our appearance had prevented this. </sentence><sentence id="2153">Too bad I would have been covered there too. </sentence><sentence id="2154">There was no doubt at all that these people were very fond of you and the son played the role of father even more so than the older man. </sentence><sentence id="2155">This became quite clear later on. </sentence><sentence id="2156">The family came out of a Reform Protestant background. </sentence><sentence id="2157">They were very formal and lived just like Mrs. De Fries with her bible on the table. </sentence><sentence id="2158">Almost everybody in Overeisel lived like this. </sentence><sentence id="2159">I just want to interrupt this reading by saying something that I have found out in the last half a year that there was in fact a group in Holland, there was a group of young people, 17, 18, 19, 20 who were instrumental in providing hiding places for Jewish children like myself and this group was called the NV which literally translated means the unknown holding company, the anonymous holding company which is a wonderful surrealistic title I think. </sentence><sentence id="2160">And my cousin Yanika from California has been receiving this information and recently sent me an article about an older man who is very pivotal in this group who was captured and killed and in the article there is a list of children's names of their name, the date they were born and where they were hidden and my name is in there and I saw it and it was a remarkable experience to get this. </sentence><sentence id="2161">I called my cousin Yanika and I said to her I got this, this is wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2162">And she says to me what did you feel like when you saw your name? </sentence><sentence id="2163">And I said well the truth is I felt wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2164">It confirms all these things and I said and how did you feel and she said well I wept and I wept and I wept. </sentence><sentence id="2165">She is 57 so she's older than me and she remembers our grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="2166">She remembers going out every day when she was hidden underground waiting for her parents to come back so she has that experience. </sentence><sentence id="2167">But for me it was a remarkable experience to see my name Isaac Trompettor and then Overeisel which is the province where I was and then a question mark next to Overeisel that may mean we don't know where in Overeisel. </sentence><sentence id="2168">It was a stunning experience for me to see that and it was all the result of me spending the last years of searching this out. </sentence><sentence id="2169">I know my parents were very resistant to that for a long time and I feel very vindicated that I pursued this and stayed with it, that I got this. </sentence><sentence id="2170">It's very important to me. </sentence><sentence id="2171">I would emphatically encourage other people who have similar or like stories to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2172">When you do find out real documented pieces of what you've always heard in your family it's emotionally very fulfilling and powerful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2323">Q: Iimagine. </sentence><sentence id="2324">Do you want to choose maybe one or two more things to read. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2327"> A? </sentence><sentence id="2328">Sure. [ </sentence><sentence id="2329">ll just read this last page. </sentence><sentence id="2330">In the few days that it was necessary for Dad to stay there, there was so much conversation from which Dad had heard that in the beginning there was also another young boy about twelve years old who they also hid. </sentence><sentence id="2331">Mrs. De Chot had noticed that when she was away and came home to you, you were crying and the young boy had frightened you and the crying got worse instead of better. </sentence><sentence id="2332">It turned out that he would light the stove and put me head first into the stove, this boy. </sentence><sentence id="2333">I'd rather not believe it but it was enough for them to   bring this boy somewhere else because they wanted to keep you. </sentence><sentence id="2334">So I can imagine seeing this other young Jewish kid who was out of his mind and took it out on me. </sentence><sentence id="2335">He had to go somewhere else and who knows what happened to this boy. </sentence><sentence id="2336">I think this accounts for some of my having a nervous breakdown after the war, being fricasseed. </sentence><sentence id="2337">Now it was time for Dad to figure out how to come home. </sentence><sentence id="2338">He knew that I didn't know what was going on nor did he have an opportunity to inform me. </sentence><sentence id="2339">You know there were no phones then that were working. </sentence><sentence id="2340">The next morning Dad went to the church, spoke with the pastor. </sentence><sentence id="2341">What Dad told him was sufficient enough for Dad to take you without any official authorization. </sentence><sentence id="2342">The church had a lot of influence with people. </sentence><sentence id="2343">You could go to the church and make it clear to them you were the parent and the church would go to the people and talk to them and convince them. </sentence><sentence id="2344">From there we went to the local military authority who provided him with a transportation pass so that when transport went south both of you could go on it. </sentence><sentence id="2345">It took four That's my Mom.jpgThat's my Mom.jpgdays before an empty truck came your way. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Those four days were actually very necessary because you two got to know each other. </sentence><sentence id="2347">The morning when the truck arrived Dad and you left for Tilburg promising the De Chots to keep in touch and he would let them know how you were doing. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Naturally we kept our word. </sentence><sentence id="2349">We did. </sentence><sentence id="2350">We were in touch and visited those people up until we went to America. </sentence><sentence id="2351">It was also the time at least according to my parents that they got to be very pushy and obnoxious about wanting to convert me. </sentence><sentence id="2352">I suspect that this was not entirely so and maybe what my parents had to flush out in order to make the necessary separation from these people. </sentence><sentence id="2353">I mean it's complex and subtle stuff with this last little chapter. </sentence><sentence id="2354">What Dad clearly remembers about this trip was that as long as the ride took, you sat in your wet pants on his lap and he got wet, too. </sentence><sentence id="2355">You also cried often during the trip. </sentence><sentence id="2356">How could it be otherwise sitting in the back for hours with the feeling of wet pants, no food or drink, as well as the crowding of many other people around you. </sentence><sentence id="2357">While you possibly had been so used to the quiet all of a sudden such a huge change. </sentence><sentence id="2358">I have often thought about this especially if I had been the one to carry you instead of Dad. </sentence><sentence id="2359">I have also often thought about how I would have felt if I had been the one to see you first at the De Chots. </sentence><sentence id="2360">To understand that I could see you in front of me to spoil you and take you with me. </sentence><sentence id="2361">What would that have felt like? </sentence><sentence id="2362">This will always be a question. </sentence><sentence id="2363">The other question that should always be a question and unfortunately didn't get addressed in our family was what was it like for me to be adopted by my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2364">Powerful stuff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
