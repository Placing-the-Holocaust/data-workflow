<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: And tell me just a little bit about your -- your family background, and your childhood, just a bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: I grew up in a Boston Jewish family, non-Jewish, no temple, as my son will say now. </sentence><sentence id="24">And I stayed in Boston til I was 17 and went to the University of Wisconsin for undergraduate school, finished my graduate studies at Columbia University. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was certainly satisfied growing up in Boston, but anxious to get away, as any teenager might be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: And were you always interested in history? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="32">I did actually begin with a -- after the traditional dinosaub session as a young child. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: And when you went to University of Wisconsin, was George Masse there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: George Masse was there, my decision to go to Wisconsin was dictated in part by the desire to get away, and in part by the strength of the history department there. </sentence><sentence id="49">And I worked with a scholar on the Nazi regime, and particularly, the particular interest in the SS, Robert Kale. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Who had been teaching at Wisconsin until very recently -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: -- he retired just a couple of years ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: So did you t -- also take any courses with George Masse? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: I didn't take any courses with George Masse and that was because I decided to take a junior year abroad and took most of my German history courses in Germany at the University of Bohn. </sentence><sentence id="61">By the time I came back and was eligible for the upperclassman courses for -- that Mosse and Hammereau, who was also another major scholar at the University of Wisconsin, were teaching, I had already run out of my requirements, and had to take other than history courses or non- European history courses to complete the degree. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: Did you ever sneak in and watch him lecture? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Yes, on occasion, on occasion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: And what did you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: I thought he was great. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: He was a wonderful lecturer and I certainly used his source material at the time. </sentence><sentence id="75">At that time he was perhaps most famous for his book, "The Crisis of German Ideology," which came out in the mid-60's. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: And this book was in part instrumental in educating me as to the root of the nat -- roots of the Nazi ideology, that is the intellectual roots of the Nazi ideology. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="83">So when you went to Columbia, why w -- why the choice to Columbia, not to stay at Wisconsin, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: [had wanted to stay at Wisconsin, but at the time my professor, Professor Kale was going through a difficult personal time, and he -- as it turned out wisely for me, said that he was not going to take on any new students at this time and advised that -- advised strongly that I should go to Columbia. </sentence><sentence id="87">At Columbia I worked under Professor Ishtvan Dayak, who was an east European scholar, but had excellent contacts in the former countries of the hap -- the former countries that made up the old Hapsburg monarchy. </sentence><sentence id="88">And between the Columbia University name and Dayak's contacts, it eventually opened up some doors in central and eastern Europe that might not have been opened had I stayed at Wisconsin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: And how did you continue your work at Columbia? </sentence><sentence id="93">What was your major -- this -- this -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: I came to Columbia with the idea of majoring in central and east European history. </sentence><sentence id="97">There was more financial aid available for east European history. </sentence><sentence id="98">This was the early 70's, in the time of detente, and it was very -- very important that young people study the history of this region, in fact there were national defense scholarships for study of east European languages and I obtained one for studying Romanian. </sentence><sentence id="99">But primarily I went with the idea of studying German policy in Austria and in eastern Europe and that became my field of concentration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Let me go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="105">Was there any -- besides the intellectual connection, and -- and the interest starting from Shirer's book, was there a personal connection in your family to World War II and the Holocaust that wa -- was also important for you, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: No, no, this was -- this was purely coming at it through history, and -- and frankly through military history. </sentence><sentence id="107">My family had, for the most part, had the good fortune, or perhaps the bad fortune to be the victims of pogroms or Tsarist draft notices, and fled to the New World at the beginning of this century. </sentence><sentence id="108">So with rare exceptions, particularly some cousins in Romania, who managed to survive the war in Romania, most of the family was over in the United States before World War I. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Oh, I see. </sentence><sentence id="110">So when -- you graduated Columbia when? [ </sentence><sentence id="111">indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: I got the PhD in 1981. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: 1981. </sentence><sentence id="114">And you decided not to teach, or -- si -- wa -- I had [indecipherable] you moved into -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Well that -- that -- that wasn't my decision exactly. </sentence><sentence id="116">The 70's was a very difficult time for new graduates coming out and obtaining teaching jobs. </sentence><sentence id="117">I had had a couple of the -- they call them thousand dollar courses now, at that time I think they were 500 dollar courses. </sentence><sentence id="118">I'd taught a course on early modern European history, and I was scheduled to teach a course on World War II and on eastern Europe at Columbia when I was called by a representative of the U.S. attorney's    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="123"> office in New York, and asked whether I would be interested in working for a short term period, gathering evidence for a case against a Nazi offender. </sentence><sentence id="124">In this particular case it was a Latvian auxiliary policeman named Boleslaus Maikovskis, who -- whose case had been publicized on "60 Minutes" some six months earlier, in the spring of 1978. </sentence><sentence id="125">So I was not only aware of the case, I was also -- I was also interested in the work, and should -- little anecdote that goes with that call, at the time I received the call, I was working in a fairly dead end job putting data onto computer sheets on the other side of the justice department's suit against the telephone company at that time, the AT &amp; T, which was the telephone company at that time. </sentence><sentence id="126">And it was a pretty dead-end job and I was home sick, suffering from a kidney stone, and about ready to go to the hospital when the call came in. </sentence><sentence id="127">And I had been feeling very sorry for myself, and thinking idly that it was too bad that I was too young to have been around at the time of the Nuremberg Trials. </sentence><sentence id="128">So it was almost like a stroke of a -- a divine stroke that that call came in at that time, and when asked if I was interested in working on such a project, I said, just let me pass the kidney stone, I'll be right in for an interview. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Le -- let me ask you a question a bit about graduate school, just t -- t-to know what the texture was at the -- at the time. </sentence><sentence id="136">Were there a lot of people studying World War IL, and the Nazis and the -- the Holocaust, or the structure of the Nazi regime, or were you an oddity at the time at Columbia? </sentence><sentence id="137">I mean, what -- what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Columbia didn't have at that time, a specific World War II scholar. </sentence><sentence id="142">It did have a strong eastern European department, but its modern -- its eastern European modernist, Voytek Mastney, who was my professor my first year at Columbia didn't get tenure and had to leave at the end of 1972 - 1973. </sentence><sentence id="143">He went on to post-war studies in Communism. </sentence><sentence id="144">And that was the focus at Columbia University, but that doesn't mean that there weren't -- there wasn't a generation of scholars, not studying the Holocaust per se, because that was still very much a political term, and not the term of [indecipherable] for this period as yet, certainly not in academic parlance. </sentence><sentence id="145">But there were a group of scholars who had been spawned and encouraged by the availability of captured German records on microfilm at the national archives. </sentence><sentence id="146">They were first available in an easy to use format on the microfilm in the early 1960's. </sentence><sentence id="147">And this was also the time in which the originals, which had been captured by the U.S. army, were returned to the Federal Republic of Germany in the mid-60's, according to treaty. </sentence><sentence id="148">And we -- I was sort of at the tail end of that generation of young scholars who were interested in the Nazi regime, and interested in the organizations of the Nazi regime, and also fascinated with the personnel files of the individuals, fascinated with the ideas of -- of motivate -- what made these people tick, and how did they operate as individuals and as an organization. </sentence><sentence id="149">And that spawned my interest in the SS, and my interest in doing a biography. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Was -- was Hillberg's work important to you at that time, or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: It was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: Hillberg's work came out in 1961 -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: -- and he was one of the earliest part of that generation. </sentence><sentence id="169">Hillberg had actually worked with the captured German records, analyzed as a document analyst in the late 40's and early 50's, and wrote his book based on that documentation before it was microfilmed, and you can tell that from the citations in his book, he still has the original file folder numbers there. </sentence><sentence id="170">And his book first came out in 1961 and by the time I was ready to get serious when I started college in "68, a paperback version was out, and easily available even to a poor graduate student. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Right, right, that Bible -- that Bible-looking -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Yes, it was a Bible even then. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Right, yes. </sentence><sentence id="177">All right, so you get the call, and you obviously passed your kidney stone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: I did, not without difficulty, but I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="183">So then what happened? </sentence><sentence id="184">What's the next -- what's the next step? </sentence><sentence id="185">Your -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Well basically I went in to the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of New York in south Manhattan, was interviewed by an attorney there, and he gave me the information a -- his name was Tom Balout, was a lawyer from Connecticut who's long since gone into private practice. </sentence><sentence id="187">And he told me a little bit about the Maikovskis case, and about the problems with the Maikovskis case, and he explained to me that the members of the special litigation unit in Washington, D.C., which had been formed the year earlier, 1977, and which had recently, in the spring of 1978 expanded to a staff of approximately four lawyers, two paralegals and one part- time historian, needed someone who was based in New York, who could conduct research in the archives in New York, the main one of which was the Yiddish institute for Jewish research, which at that time was located on the corner of East 81" Street, and I believe it was Fifth Avenue. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: And they had been canvassing a-around in Washington for contacts, and one of the attorneys at the time, George Parker, had talked to my first advisor at Columbia, Voytek Mastney, who was on a stint with Johns Hopkins at the time. </sentence><sentence id="191">And Mastney recom -- recommended me as a possibility, that's how they got my name. </sentence><sentence id="192">And I came in, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: So did you go down to Washington to talk with these folks, or did you s -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: No, I was hired from New York. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: From New York, so -- okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: And I was based in the New York office from -- from my start date in September "78, until shortly after the office was moved from the immigration service, was called the special litigation unit, under the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and it was moved into the criminal division in May, 1979. </sentence><sentence id="199">Six months after that I had already requested a transfer, and I requested also to be able to work pa -- full time. </sentence><sentence id="200">And they were interested in me, and they brought me down on January first, 1980. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: And by that time Ryan, Alan Ryan was -- was -- was OSI formed at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: OSI was for -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Was taken out of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: -- OSI was formed in May 1979, and -- under a temporary director, Walter Rockler, who had been a Nuremberg prosecutor. </sentence><sentence id="209">I believe -- I'm not sure, I believe he was a prosecutor in the Deutshe Bank case at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="210">And he was brought in by the criminal division to reorganize the special litigation unit, expand its staff, and deploy it effectively as a central agency to investigate and if necessary litigate all of the Nazi offender cases in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="211">Rockler was the director from September -- I'm sorry, he was the director from May 1979 until approximately March 1980. </sentence><sentence id="212">I believe it was a nine month detail, or a 10 month detail. </sentence><sentence id="213">And Ryan was brought on as the deputy sometime in -- he was there when I moved down to Washington, so it must have been sometime in 1979. </sentence><sentence id="214">And then he -- he came -- Ryan came from the solicitor general's office in the Department of Justice, and he took over as director when Rockler withdrew and went back to private practice in March 1980. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="223">So tell me a little bit about this first case that you did in New York. </sentence><sentence id="224">What -- what -- what were they asking you to do? </sentence><sentence id="225">They were asking you to go to the archives and find -- can you talk about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Well, they didn't -- they didn't really know what to ask me to do. </sentence><sentence id="231">They asked me to find evidence about this case, and I wasn't quite sure what they wanted me to do either, so I did -- what I did know how to do was go to then -- go to the published records, the Nuremberg trial records, and put together, I think it was about a 10 ora 15 or 20 page essay on the Latvian auxiliary police in -- in -- under German occupation in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="232">Maikovskis was accused of having been a precinct chief in an eastern region of Latvia, around Rezekne, Rossitten in German. </sentence><sentence id="233">And he had been accused of participating in killings of local Jews in the summer and autumn of 1941.And I went to some of the basic sources, there's a lengthy Nuremberg document which was written by the commander of the security police, in SD in the Baltic States, the former Einsatzgruppen chief, Walter Stahlecker, which was a lengthy report of about, oh, 250 pages dealing with the German occupation of the Baltic States and the operations of the police, in particular the auxiliary police. </sentence><sentence id="234">We also had in New York, copies of the Einsatzgruppen reports, which were on microfilm at the time, and I reviewed those and gathered the material that were relevant to Latvian auxiliary police killings of Jews and others in Latvia in the summer of 1941, and I put it together in a basic historical essay that I would write as a college paper at that time. </sentence><sentence id="235">This was before I had the PhD., and in fact it was at the time when I was writing the PhD. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: And the attorney was pleasantly surprised, and particularly by the speed in which it was gathered. </sentence><sentence id="246">It wasn't such a big thing to a historian, but it was obviously something that was very helpful to the attorney. </sentence><sentence id="247">And the reason for that was that the case had run into a snag. </sentence><sentence id="248">The original allegations had come from witnesses, primarily Israeli witnesses, who had Maikovskis little -- literally in every location in Latvia, killing people. </sentence><sentence id="249">And the U.S. attorneys had gone over to Latvia to take depositions of former Soviet -- Soviet Latvian citizens who had been Maikovskis's comrades, and who placed Maikovskis solely in one area of Latvia, in southeastern Latvia by Rezekne. </sentence><sentence id="250">And the judge in the case was extremely hostile to the idea of deporting someone for Nazi offenses. </sentence><sentence id="251">Not -- and th-th-there's no reason to believe that he was sympathetic to the Nazis, he just didn't like the idea of throwing someone out of the United States on the basis of old evidence and evidence that had came in part from the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="252">And the judges hostility made it difficult for the attorneys to use the witness evidence, which, as it turned out, was a good thing for the Maikovskis case because the government eventually withdrew the charges against Maikovskis in the complaint, in -- in the order to show cause, Maikovskis was a alien, he wasn't a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="253">The -- the charges that placed Maikovskis anywhere outside of Rezekne were withdrawn, and the case then focused solely on what was going on in Rezekne. </sentence><sentence id="254">And with a combination of documents in U.S. archives, which gave the general picture of what was going on in the Soviet -- in -- in -- in German occupied Latvia, in that region, and the statements, the depositions, complete with cross examination of Soviet witnesses -- that is Soviet citizens who had been comrades of Maikovskis, who described from their eyewitness point of view what had happened, enabled us to secure Maikovskis's order of deportation. </sentence><sentence id="255">If I remember correctly, we lost -- the judge was hostile enough to rule against us, but we won on appeal, at the board of immigration appeals. </sentence><sentence id="256">And Maikovskis eventually fled to West Germany before he was actually deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Deported, I see. </sentence><sentence id="271">We -- do you know if he was ever tried in Germany? </sentence><sentence id="272">Or did he si -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Th-The German -- the -- the Germans investigated Maikovskis, and here -- I'm not sure, I think they actually -- I'm not sure if they indicted him, but he was placed under investigation, and the investigation was still ongoing when he died. </sentence><sentence id="277">He was an older man, | think he was born in 1909, if I remember correctly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="281">Did you go to the hearing on the -- in this particular -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: The USS. -- </sentence><sentence id="283">the U.S. hearing, yes -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: -- I was present at the hearing, which was -- took place in -- in New York in -- I -- it was either the summer of "81 or the summer of "82. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: W-When you first got involved in this, had -- di-did you know about the legal basis on which all of these cases were going to be tried, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: I knew nothing more because I -- I'm -- I was not a great newspaper reader at the time, and I knew nothing more than what I had heard on the "60 Minutes" program. </sentence><sentence id="290">I don't remember what I heard on the "60 Minutes" program, but I suspect it probably wasn't too erudite about the legal ramifications. </sentence><sentence id="291">I learned most of what I learned about the law on the job. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: So te -- tell me what -- what the tri -- the trials, or the ability to -- I don't -- do one -- does one call it an indictment, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: -- bringing a case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: It's not a criminal procedure? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Lused the word indictment for the German case because it was a criminal proceeding -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Criminal pro -- right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: -- in -- in Germany, but the proceedings in the United States are all civil cases, and there -- they're of two types. </sentence><sentence id="303">There's a denaturalization, if the individual is a U.S. citizen, there's a denaturalization process, and -- and the equivalent of the indictment is called a complaint. </sentence><sentence id="304">The government makes a complaint, and the government is the plaintiff, and the defendant is the person against whom the -- in this case the Nazi offender. </sentence><sentence id="305">If the individual is a -- just a permanent resident, is -- is an alien, then it's -- it's an order to show cause for deportation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: The complaint is filed in the U.S. District Court, because the U.S. District Court has the authority to confer and revoke citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="313">And the -- the order to show cause is filed in immigration court, because it becomes a immigration and naturaliz -- I-Immigration and Naturalization Service matter for non-citizens. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: So that's why these are separate, be -- because the jurisdiction over this particular kind of process -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="317">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: -- is in one place, and the other is in the other place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Yes, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="321">And -- and there -- a --a citizen has different rights than an alien, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="322">And there's a procedure -- i-in terms of a citizen, we -- we, that is the OSI had to go through a process of denaturalization, and then the whole set of appeals and then deportation. </sentence><sentence id="323">After the denaturalization, appeals had been exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="324">If a person had been denaturalized, and the appeals were exhausted, and those appeals could go all the way up to the Supreme Court, then the process would start again, because the person was now an alien. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: The process would start again in immigration court, and go through that series of appeals, which could again go up to the Supreme Court before someone was actually deported or removed from the country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: The -- this particular process, to not have it be a criminal prosecution, is this because of something in international law, or was this a decision the United States government made, not to make this a criminal proceeding, but rather to talk about willful misrepresentation, that someone misrepresented who they were, and we wouldn't have let them into the country before. </sentence><sentence id="335">Why not try these people for what they actually did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: I think there were a lot of factors involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="339">One clearly was, unlike the -- the Great Britain, which decided to go the criminal route, the Australians and the brit -- and the Canadians also decided, with total lack of success, to go the criminal proceedings route. </sentence><sentence id="340">The United States had a Constitution of 200 years, and to create a criminal jurisdiction for trying these cases in the United States, under criminal procedures would -- was, as I understand it, possible, but would have involved considerable difficulty, and considerable delay in setting up the apparatus. </sentence><sentence id="341">It also would have held the government to an extremely strict standard, as it did in the cases of Australia, Great Britain and Canada, of proving potentially, an individual case of murder. </sentence><sentence id="342">The -- on the other hand, the immigration procedures were in place, and had been in place, particularly since many of the offenders had come in under the Displaced Persons Act, and the Refugee Relief Act of the -- the -- the legislation that was extant in the late 40's and early 50's. </sentence><sentence id="343">And there was legislation on the books already that if these applicants for immigration, and later for naturalization gave willful, false statements about their past, that they could be denaturalized, and ultimately deported. </sentence><sentence id="344">They would return to their pre-immigration status. </sentence><sentence id="345">That is, as an alien, which now the truth was known, was ineligible to enter the United States. </sentence><sentence id="346">And an ineligible alien    face -- who is in the United States, faces deportation. </sentence><sentence id="347">U.S. immigration law, sometimes for many of the wrong reasons, is extremely harsh, and does not make many exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="348">And it was evidently decided -- this is not first-hand knowledge of -- of mine, it was evidently decided that this would be an appropriate process to deal with the issue of Nazi offenders living in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="349">It was hoped, I think initially, that for many of these individuals, that the nations where they had committed their offenses, would request their extradition. </sentence><sentence id="350">And in fact, there was some precedent for that. </sentence><sentence id="351">There was an outstanding request on the part of the former Yugoslav government, for the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich, since the early 50's. </sentence><sentence id="352">And in 1972, the West German government requested and obtained the extradition of a Long Island housewife named Hermine Braunsteiner-Ryan, who had been a camp guard at the Lublin Majdanek concentration camp, and who had evaded justice afterwards, married an American serviceman, and had come over to live in the United States, and who was sort of the epitome of the quiet neighbor that Allan Ryan tried to reflect in the title of his book in 1983. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: So it's a -- it's an -- I'm -- yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: So there's some precedent for the idea that the nations on whose soil these individuals had committed their crimes, would want these people back in order to try them. </sentence><sentence id="372">And of course, we found -- we, that is the United States government, found very quickly that most of these nations, regardless of whether they made bellicose statements about dealing with Nazi offenders, were not terribly excited about having them back, and this is something that we found out quite quickly in the Trifa case, where the Romanians really had no interest in having Valerian at the time, Viarel Trifa back to Romania to try him for anything. </sentence><sentence id="373">The Soviet Union was often prepared to take people back in the 1970's and 1980's, but the United States government was not prepared at that time to send individuals back to the Soviet Union. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: So this had to be somewhat frustrating, because th-the results are -- could be seen as kind of minimal. </sentence><sentence id="378">People could escape to other countries if they were not extradited back to the original country to be tried. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A: Yeah, the opportunity to escape was quite available to anyone, particularly to citizens. </sentence><sentence id="382">There was no authority to the uni -- for the United States government to imprison a citizen of the United States during a denaturalization proceeding. </sentence><sentence id="383">The immigration and naturalization service can imprison an individual who is about to be ordered deported, and of whom it can be surmised that he will se -- seek to flee to avoid deportation. </sentence><sentence id="384">The INS can put someone in the slammer for that. </sentence><sentence id="385">But the United States government did not have the authority to imprison an individual who faced denaturalization proceedings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: And so those individuals could leave, in fact, with their citizenship, and the worst they faced was a in absentia denaturalization proceeding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: So you wa -- you might continue -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: We would continue the proceedings -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: -- the com -- the -- cedure -- procedure, uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: -- to denaturalize, regardless of whether the individual was in the United States, because it was our intention that in the cases of those who fled, they were ineligible to enter the United States, and denaturalization would render them, now under the Holzman amendment, ineligible to ever return -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: To return. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: -- to the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: Just a -- just as a technical point, if you would do a case like that, would there be a defense attorney there, or you would simply do your case before the judge with -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Often there was a defense attorney, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="405">Q: -- and -- uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="407">A: Often there was a di -- an attorney representing the interests of the defendant, who sometimes still had property in the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="409">Q: I see, I see. </sentence><sentence id="410">Can you talk a -- a bit about how you understand the -- the law, starting with the Displaced Persons Act, and until you get to actually -- well, when is it, the Holzman amendment is in 1980 passing -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: Holzman amendment is passed, if I'm correct -- if I'm correct, it was passed in -- by Congress in 1978, and ratified in 1980. </sentence><sentence id="412">So it became effective in 1980. </sentence><sentence id="413">It really goes back to United States immigration policy at the end of World War II. </sentence><sentence id="414">The United States clearly saw that it had been remiss -- the United States government at the time, and -- and -- and this was backed by popular support, that it had been remiss in granting sanctuary to refugees prior to World War II, and there was a concerted effort to provide special immigration legislation for refugees after World War II, that would exceed the narrowly restricted quotas which developed out of the 1924 Immigration and Naturalization Act. </sentence><sentence id="415">And the first of these special -- first of two -- actually three special laws, was the Displaced Persons Act, which was passed in 1948, and took effect from 1948 until the last day of 1952. </sentence><sentence id="416">And it created a separate category, over and above the quotas, of displaced persons who were eligible beyond the quotas to receive visas to immigrate to the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="423">And if memory serves me correct, some 400,000 people -- I think just under 400,000 people immigrated to the United States under the Displaced Persons Act from various countries in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="424">There were -- the Displaced Persons Act also provided for the establishment of a DP commission, which operated in Europe and administered displaced person's camps to provide sanctuary for survivors of the Holocaust, refugees from Communist takeovers in eastern Europe, and displaced persons uprooted by the Nazis during their occupation of eastern Europe who could -- could not, or would not be repatriated, to give them a place where they could find shelter and food, and in the case of kids, find some education and training, while they awaited the completion of the application process for a visa. </sentence><sentence id="425">When the Displaced Persons Act expired, the U.S. Congress, and again, backed by considerable public support, and this was -- keep in mind this was the time of the McCarthy era, despite the concerns with Communism, a refugee relief act was passed, which permitted further refugees, some of those who were ineligible under the Displaced Persons Act, to come to the United States on special visas that went over and beyond the numbers and the quotas. </sentence><sentence id="426">And these visas, the last big blup of visas, came in December 1956, and spilled over to January 1957 to accommodate the refugees from Hungary, from the Hungarian revolution of 1956. </sentence><sentence id="427">Now each of these decrees, each of these laws, as well as a 1945 regulation, if I remember correctly, there were increasingly less strict restrictions on eligibility to those who were either German, or received some benefit from the Nazi regime, or had collaborated with the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="428">There was a regulation -- a -- a State Department regulation already in 1945, barring Nazi collaborators from coming into the United States. </sentence><sentence id="429">The Displaced Persons Act had fairly stringent restrictions on Nazi collaborators, those who assisted in persecution on the basis of race, religion and national origin, from entering the United States. </sentence><sentence id="430">The Refugee Relief Act also had similar, except somewhat vaguer language, but still had language that excluded persons who personally participated in persecution from entering the United States. </sentence><sentence id="431">Now, initially, as an example of how the legislation was relaxed in this aspect is the following; under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, SS membership rendered one ineligible from entering the United States, regardless of what you had done in the SS -- what -- what an individual had done as a member of the SS. </sentence><sentence id="432">Membership in the SS alone, was enough to exclude from the United States. </sentence><sentence id="433">In -- under the amendment of 1950, which mems -- mere membership in the SS was no longer sufficient to exclude. </sentence><sentence id="434">One had to, as a member of the SS, have participated in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="435">The amendment in 1950 also allowed for nationals of, for instance, the Baltic States to enter as displaced persons, even if they had served in collaborative units, like the Latvian legion of the Waffen SS. </sentence><sentence id="436">Latvians could come before, through the Displaced Persons Act, but they can -- could not have been affiliated with Nazi organizations. </sentence><sentence id="437">Under the DP Act as amended, they were now no longer ineligible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: And why -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: But their membership -- they did -- they were required to tell the truth -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: About the membership. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: -- about the membership, so as not to cut off an avenue of inquiry about their activities. </sentence><sentence id="460">So in other words it -- it remained against the law for a Latvian who had been a member of the Waffen SS to say that he was a bookkeeper during the war, when in fact he'd been a member of the Waffen SS, even if it had -- it w -- would later have been found that he had done nothing more than been a combat soldier. </sentence><sentence id="461">If he had admitted under the DP Act as amended that he was a Waffen SS combat soldier, and nothing more could be found against him, then he was eligible to enter the United States. </sentence><sentence id="462">But having concealed that information, that was already concealing, omitting, giving false statement, to obtain a federal benefit, which -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="464">A: -- brought a whole other exclusionary process to bear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="466">Q: So, before we get to the -- the -- the next amendment, why do you think they made this change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="468">A: I-I'm sure there were many factors involved. </sentence><sentence id="469">The one that comes to mind is that there was a -- a shortage of agricultural labor in the United States, and a lot of the east European refugees from Communism were farmers, and farmer's sons. </sentence><sentence id="470">And the -- and al -- and many of them were also ethnic Germans from eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="471">And I have no doubt that the idea of providing sanctuary to individuals who were escaping Communist regimes was a significant factor in amending the Displaced Persons Act. </sentence><sentence id="472">There was also a feeling even at the time that for those who served in combat units that were affiliated with Nazi Germany, that particularly for Ukrainians, for members of the Baltic states, whose annexation by the Soviet Union the United States never recognized, that these people had had very bad choices, and that the one that they chose was only marginally less worse than the -- the other that was available to them. </sentence><sentence id="473">And so I think i -- th -- a combination of factors led to the amendment of the Displaced Persons Act, and also led to the -- the slight differences in the Refugee Relief Act. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="480">Q: And so then what is the next change that happens? </sentence><sentence id="481">Is it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="482">A: After -- after the Refugee Relief Act expired, at the end of -- in 1952, and a new Immigration and Naturalization Act had been passed, which was slightly less restrictive, and here I'm -- here I'm speaking off the top of my head -- slightly less restrictive than the "24 act, but it was a quota act again. </sentence><sentence id="483">And that came back into force, and remained in force until 1986 or "96, the new immigration act -- the new immigration act, I think it was 1996, replaced the "52 act. </sentence><sentence id="484">Under these acts, all of these acts, the "52 act in particular, but also the other special immigration legislation, that an individual who was ordered deported, could apply for what was called discretionary relief, for a number of reasons, whether they've been a good citizen, and they were -- when they </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="488"> -- while they lived in the United States, if their wi -- were married to US. </sentence><sentence id="489">citizens, if they had children who were US. </sentence><sentence id="490">citizens, if they had close relatives who were dependent on them who were USS. </sentence><sentence id="491">citizens. </sentence><sentence id="492">And another very important and applicable one in these cases, if by deportation to the country from whence they came, they would be subjected to political persecution. </sentence><sentence id="493">And this was a particularly applicable part of the statute for the Communist regimes, and was applied in the case of the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich who came in the -- into the United States under a false name, was clearly involved in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="494">He came even before the DP act, he came under the 1924 act, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="495">And he was actually ordered deported in 1953 at the conclusion of a proceeding, but the order of deportation was stayed because he was successfully able to argue that he would be persecuted in a Communist Yugoslavia, and would not get a fair trial. </sentence><sentence id="496">And this very much stems from the -- the -- the Cold War atmosphere of the time, and this was an atmosphere that continued affecting the few cases that actually were prosecuted, or were litigated during the 50's and 60's, until the Vietnam era. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="506">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="507">And what was the change with the Holzman Amendment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="510">A: The Holzman Amendment, which was passed in 1978 radically changed this in that for persons who participated in persecution on the basis of race, religion, national origin and political opinion, they added political opinion under Holzman, under the aegis of Nazi Germany or its allies, or in territories occupied by Nazi Germany between January 30", 1933, and May eighth, 1945, if found to be deportable, if found to be ineligible to enter the United States, could not apply for discretionary relief on any basis. </sentence><sentence id="511">And so this there -- this therefore opened the door for an actual result to these cases, you didn't have to go through the litigation only to find that the individual could apply for and get discretionary relief, either because his children were U.S.citizens, or because he could claim political persecution from a Communist country. </sentence><sentence id="512">Now, did it mean that we were -- we, the U.S. government were willing to deport these people just to any country, as a practice? </sentence><sentence id="513">Not yet, but at least legally the possibility was there to obtain an order of deportation and actually carry it out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="520">Q: And the Cold War is still going on, so what allowed Holzman's amendment to actually be passed when people still had a very -- I don't know, shall we call it a rigid view, or at least a Cold War view of eastern European countries under the Soviet Union? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: Again, I think it was a combination of factors. </sentence><sentence id="523">Clearly important was the precedent of the Braunsteiner-Ryan case in 1972, which sparked questions about how many other Nazi criminals were living in our midst, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="524">And that created a certain degree of public pressure, in part from Jewish groups, and survivor groups, which unlike 1945 - 1950, where they were immigrants with no -- no confidence to say what they wanted, and no strong desire to relive the immediate past as opposed to dealing with creating a new life and a future, were now established USS. </sentence><sentence id="525">citizens, quite conscious and aware of their rights to lobby congressmen, to get some results on this. </sentence><sentence id="526">A second key factor was the development of a -- the process of detente between the United States and the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="527">The year that Braunsteiner-Ryan was extradited, 1972, was also the year that President Nixon visited Moscow and ushered in the era of detente, which lasted more or less until the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. </sentence><sentence id="528">This was also a time at which we in the United States, and to a greater degree, prosecutors in West Germany were beginning to see glimpses of the types of usable evidence, credible evidence that existed behind the iron curtain. </sentence><sentence id="529">In the 50's this stuff just was not available in any way. </sentence><sentence id="530">In the 60's, particularly in the early 60's, trickles of documentary material captured by the Red army, came into the public domain through west German trials, and also through Soviet propaganda pamphlets in the late 60's and early 70's, denouncing the western powers for harboring Nazi criminals. </sentence><sentence id="531">Now the pamphlets were -- were -- were nonsense, and -- and often many of the statements in the pamphlets were nonsense, as well as the interpretations. </sentence><sentence id="532">But the documents that were photocopied, if genuine, and one couldn't tell if they were genuine unless they subjected -- subjected them to careful forensic testing, were not only interesting in themselves, but fascinating as examples of the type of material that had survived the war, and that was in Soviet hands. </sentence><sentence id="533">One of the key driving forces behind the office of special investigation's success, was an early agreement in 1980 with the Soviet Union to take videotaped depositions from Soviet citizens, all of whom were comrades of the defendants in the United States, and of whom, while it might be questioned what kinds of pressures they were in the Soviet Union, it couldn't be questioned that they knew the defendants involved, whereas with the survivor witnesses, defense attorneys could raise questions as to how they could possibly know that this was the man who did this, that and the other thing. </sentence><sentence id="534">The comrades who worked with them on a daily basis, and who may have known them from their hometowns couldn't be questioned. </sentence><sentence id="535">They -- their knowledge of the defendants as members of these units was much more credible, even if it was coming from behind the Iron Curtain. </sentence><sentence id="536">We also were unable at that time to get unrestricted access to Soviet records, but we were able to get access to copies of documentation, at least pertaining to our defendants at that time, and in response to the general objection of the defense that these documents were always forged by the Soviet Union, the Soviet authorities quickly understood that in order for the United States government to be credible, that they would have to fork over the originals. </sentence><sentence id="537">And this started already in 1980 - 1981, where the Soviet authorities would have the original document sent to the Soviet embassy or Soviet consulate, depending on where the trial was taking place, in the United States, where the document could then be examined by the government's forensics examiners for handwriting, for paper, for typing quality, for signatures. </sentence><sentence id="538">And also by teams hired    by the defense. </sentence><sentence id="539">And at no time did the Soviets ever represent to OSI that a document was genuine when it was not genuine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="560">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: Never. </sentence><sentence id="563">Never. </sentence><sentence id="564">In some of their pamphlet literature, they would leave things out, but when we -- when we in the United States government asked where's the beef, the Soviet Union always provided the beef. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: So from all of these laws and amendments, the essential question, if I have it correctly, when you make a complaint, is was there willful misrepresentation of a person's past in connection with the Nazi regime, is that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: A basic -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="570">Q: Is that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="571">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: -- in general. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: That's a little too general. </sentence><sentence id="575">It's not simply willful misrepresentation. </sentence><sentence id="576">It i -- it's actually material misrepresentation, and the materiality must go to the fact that had the information been known, it would or might have led to an investigation that would or might have uncovered facts that would have re -- rendered the defendant ineligible. </sentence><sentence id="577">So in other words, there had to be some basis that would render the individual ineligible beyond the simple fact of lying. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="584">A: Beyond the simple fact of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="585">Q: It wasn't lying about anything, it had to be lying about that which was materially relevant. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="587">And in the Nazi offender cases, that involved participation and persecution on the basis of race, religion, national origin or political opinion. </sentence><sentence id="588">Now that -- that -- that's how the    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="589"> immigration statute read, and that -- the natu -- the natural -- denaturalization complaints were worded somewhat differently, you had to prove that a person was of bad moral character because they materially misrepresented, because they illegally procured a visa, having materially misrepresented, and that misrepresentation was material because it concealed information or data that might have led to uncovering this person's participation and persecution. </sentence><sentence id="590">So it was a participation and persecution that was the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: That was central. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: -- vital issue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="594">Q: So it's not -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: You never -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="596">Q: -- not membership? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: So if one is -- was a member of the Nazi party, that's not sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="601">If -- if they -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="602">A: If it's something -- if it was something as general and as amorphous as the Nazi party, or even the SS, or even a given military unit, yes. </sentence><sentence id="603">But there were some units whose raison d'etre was involved in persecuting people in the basis of race, religion, national origin and political opinion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="606">A --a-- a example that the Supreme Court examined in the Federenko case was that of a concentration camp guard. </sentence><sentence id="607">And the Supreme Court ruled that by the very daily duties of a concentration camp guard, even if he did nothing personally against a prisoner; never shot a prisoner, never beat a prisoner, never so much as looked at a prisoner, by standing there on the perimeter of the camp with a rifle in his hand, he is acting as a deterrent fra -- for the prisoners from escaping, and that this was participation in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="608">So there were certain units that if you could prove, if we the U.S. government could prove that the individual was a member of that unit, and carried out the normal daily routine of that unit, we would -- that -- that person could be proven, if we could prove those facts, a judge could make a finding that that person participated in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="609">Or that that person was a -- a person of bad moral character because he participated in persecution. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="616">So different from a criminal trial. </sentence><sentence id="617">Had -- had the United States government gone to do criminal trials, you would have had to prove the actual event of the person doing something, whereas within the context of the naturalization trial, if you could prove the connection with a type of action that was common, even if you couldn't prove this person did it, but if they were concentration camp guards, they were part of the Waffen SS, if they were -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="618">A: It -- if it was understood that by carrying out his daily duties -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="619">Q: He could be. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="637">A: Advocation, no, advocation, the Trifa case was based a lot on advocation of persecution. </sentence><sentence id="638">But acquiescence alone usually didn't cut it as a matter of discretion on whether to file a case. </sentence><sentence id="639">But in    terms of participation and assistance, a gar -- a cordon guard at a mass killing, or a camp guard, is certainly helping the leadership of that tex -- mass killing, or the leadership of that camp to persecute people, and that was assistance in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="640">Now had the United States gone the criminal route, it's hard to know what would have happened, and it's a route not taken, but the standard of evidence would have been beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas the standard of evidence in the civil cases was clear and convincing. </sentence><sentence id="641">Judges often held the United States government fairly close to a beyond a reasonable doubt, but we could make this culpability as a reflection of membership, or membership being culpability, membership in an organization that did as its daily business the persecution of individuals on the basis of race, religion, national origin and political opinion. </sentence><sentence id="642">That we could do. </sentence><sentence id="643">It's conceivable that in a criminal case, with the way we have conspiracy -- you know, prosecutions against conspiracy where the -- where the driver of the escape vehicle is as much guilty as the individual who fires the gun of the murder that's committed in the bank, it's conceivable we might have gone that way, but the standards would have been higher, and it may well have been very difficult to obtain convictions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="669">Q: That would not be considered -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: No, no, we would not have, to best of my knowledge we wouldn't -- and I certainly would have advised against -- as a historian I would have ad-advised against on the basis of the evidence, filing a case against, for instance, a bystander who watched an execution. </sentence><sentence id="671">Now, a bystander who took a rifle and -- and started shooting, that's -- that's a little bit different, that becomes participation or assistance. </sentence><sentence id="672">There might be other problems with the proof in that case, because if it was just a by -- i -- if we're just dealing with a bystander, his connection to an official organization would be difficult if not impossible to prove. </sentence><sentence id="673">But in terms of just standing and watching an act of persecution take place, this was not sufficient by itself. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="770">A: I-In terms of the professional staff support staff at this point we were, in fact, the low persons on the totem pole. </sentence><sentence id="771">Generally the United States government when it -- when it prosecutes, it has investigators develop cases, and then attorneys prosecute them. </sentence><sentence id="772">And in many ways the attorneys and the investigators, most of whom were very, very good, came with those ideas in mind of how things should run. </sentence><sentence id="773">And I remember being interviewed -- the historians were originally under the investigative wing, and I was interviewed by the chief of investigations in the new unit, when I was applying to come down as a full time worker, to move to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="774">And his question to me -- or, it was more of a statement than a question, well you're not going to be able to write any books down here. </sentence><sentence id="775">And the idea, the implication was that what a historian did was go to a library </sentence></p><p><sentence id="776"> and read books. </sentence><sentence id="777">And unfortunately he was even wrong on that particular thing because see that tome -- I wrote that Trifa tome -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="778">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: -- within a year after he made that statement. </sentence><sentence id="780">But what happened was, as we got the cases, we began to investigate them as a historian would investigate them. </sentence><sentence id="781">And in order to -- they were like little biographies, and I ha -- of course, had written a biography for my dissertation, and it was a biography of an individual, the chief of the Nazi security police SD, Ernst Karltenbrunner, who had left very little of himself behind. </sentence><sentence id="782">And I had to go at his biography by dealing with the organizations to which he belonged, and by dealing with the individuals with whom he associated. </sentence><sentence id="783">And in many ways, OSI, on a much lower level, dealt with that type of investigative process. </sentence><sentence id="784">And so what the historians started to do, and now again my colleague, my former colleague David Marlowe and I talked about this quite a bit when we were both at OSI as young historians, what we started to do was to gather documentation, primary source documentation. </sentence><sentence id="785">We understood, as historians what kinds of documentation bore what weight of reliability. </sentence><sentence id="786">We'd gather documentation on the institutions that were relevant to the charges in the complaint. </sentence><sentence id="787">We'd gather information on the individual, but we'd also gather information on the comrades of the individuals. </sentence><sentence id="788">And this served two purposes. </sentence><sentence id="789">On the one hand we wanted to talk to those comrades if they were still alive, because they could tell us things that the victims of the defendant couldn't, and they could also tell us about the daily routine, which th -- which information the defendant was not going to give us. </sentence><sentence id="790">We couldn't get it from any other source other than the hints that were left in the documentation. </sentence><sentence id="791">And for a second reason is that the personnel material, and the administrative material of the organization that these people belonged to, whether it was a concentration camp, or a security police unit, or an auxiliary police unit, gave us a fairly accurate, and fairly reliable picture of what the daily life of this defendant was, so that an expert witness could get up in front of a judge and say with complete conviction that on a daily basis, on a normal day, so and so rotated into these particular guard assignments, and this was part of his daily duty. </sentence><sentence id="792">Now, maybe he didn't do it on this day or that day, but if you take a period of time, whether it was a week or three months, he was doing it in this order at least some time, and that this was part of the daily routine, the standard operating procedure of this particular unit in this ti -- particular place. </sentence><sentence id="793">And so in gathering this type of documentation, we were able to put together cases that were based on paper. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="810">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="812">A: And were not subject to the inaccuries -- inaccuracies and shifts of personal memory. </sentence><sentence id="813">The attorneys and the investigators were often used to working primarily with live bodies, with witnesses, whether it was an expert witness, an expert historical witness, and expert forensic technician, a survivor witness, even a -- a perpetrator witness. </sentence><sentence id="814">But a live body who could say what happened, meaning more than the paper documentation. </sentence><sentence id="815">And because of some of the problems with the early witness statements, particularly survivor statements, we came to rely on in part, I think, because the -- of the historians work, more solidly on the documentation and the witnesses, particularly the survivor witnesses became much more important to show to the judge what it was the victims underwent as a result of the defendants participation, assistance or advocation in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="816">And it changed remo -- this was something that historians and attorneys in particular, and invest -- investigators to a certain degree, sort of worked towards without consciously saying this is how we're going to change it, this was just -- it just became a - - a-- I won't say instinctual dynamic, but a professional dynamic in that the historians wanted to know everything they could about the way a place operated, and how the people operated within a place. </sentence><sentence id="817">And the attorneys and the investigators wanted to win cases. </sentence><sentence id="818">And the combination of those two elements produced cases that we could put on that were based primarily on paper, that went through an expert historical witness. </sentence><sentence id="819">But the witness's testimony alone was usually not enough. </sentence><sentence id="820">We tried as much as possible to have the elements of the expert witness testimony backed at every point by a specific piece of paper that the judge could read and say yes, I can see why he comes to that opinion. </sentence><sentence id="821">So that the judge, if the judge chose, could go back and pick apart the component parts of the expert's testimony. </sentence><sentence id="822">And that was the idea that we developed. </sentence><sentence id="823">And by we, I say both historians and attorneys working together, that we developed, in terms of putting together a case that we felt would be as airtight as possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="837">Q: I don't want to keep saying that we're going to go back, but in a way I'm going back. </sentence><sentence id="838">Ho- How in heaven's name do cases come? </sentence><sentence id="839">Wi -- did it change over the years, or what -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="840">A: That's a good question. </sentence><sentence id="841">Yet -- i-in the early days, in -- in some of the more famous cases that came about in this way, it could come either from rumors from the old country, like Trifa was -- charges surfaced against Trifa both from the ra -- Communist Romanian regime, but also from Romanian emigres from the moment he stepped off the boat as a displaced person in 1950. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="844">Andrea Artukovich was uncovered by, I believe, I -- I can't remember, but I think he was actually seen and denounced by someone. </sentence><sentence id="845">There were people who would pick up on rumors. </sentence><sentence id="846">The Soviets would float pamphlet literature in the United States denouncing this person or that person. </sentence><sentence id="847">Maikovskis was denounced in the early 60's, after having been tried and sentenced to death in absentia, in a typical Soviet style trial in the early 1960's. </sentence><sentence id="848">And the response of the early authorities in the seven -- in the early 70's was to follow these leads and be reactive to what was coming in from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="849">When the OSI hired full-time historians to work on the cases that were floating around, and the OSI inherited 300 -- approximately 350 from the INS, many of    which had been kicking around since the 50's and the 60's uninvestigated, particularly after the Artukovich fiasco in the mid-50's. </sentence><sentence id="850">The historians, in their search for documentation relating to the place or places where the defendants served, and relating to the units in which the defendants served, came across rosters of individuals, many of them with birthdates and birthplaces. </sentence><sentence id="851">And early on, beginning even in 1980, the investigators were running lists -- post-war lists developed by American authorities of war crime suspects through the Immigration and Naturalization Service to see whether matches had taken place, or whether there were hits, we called them hits. </sentence><sentence id="852">That the indi -- an individual of the same name, and same birth year at least, and it's o-often the same birthdate, of this war crime suspect had actually entered the United States on such and such a date. </sentence><sentence id="853">Once we started collecting rosters, this became a -- a -- a fairly large operation, and we were the first and only unit outside of the federal republic of Germany, and the Soviet Union to investigate in this way. </sentence><sentence id="854">And so we began, I would say, certainly by 1982 - 1983, 95 percent if not better of our cases originated in this way. </sentence><sentence id="855">The historians would gather rosters in the course of one a -- investigation, in order to identify other members of that unit, in part as potential sources for witnesses, and in part as potential evidence for that particular investigation. </sentence><sentence id="856">And then would run those names through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to determine whether these people came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="857">And if we could determine whether they came to the United States then th-they either became witnesses themselves that we wanted to talk to about their comrades, or they became -- and in most cases they did become subjects. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: You would think that, and it -- it certainly happened in the case of Artukovich, he did change his name, and he did get in under a false name. </sentence><sentence id="882">However, most of the people who came in were small fry. </sentence><sentence id="883">Most of them were certainly aware that there was some documentation about themselves, had existed at one time. </sentence><sentence id="884">Some of them were under the impression that the Nazis destroyed personnel documentation. </sentence><sentence id="885">Others understood that in the late 40's and the early 50's, that where the documentation was, was in a place that at that time was inaccessible to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="886">Q: Uh-huh, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: -- to western investigators. </sentence><sentence id="888">And at the time of the Displaced Persons Act and the Refugee Relief Act, those who applied would have to go through a background check to determine whether they were eligible. </sentence><sentence id="889">And these background checks were conducted by the counter- intelligence corps of the United States army. </sentence><sentence id="890">And they would make a check to the usual sources of documentation that were available at the time. </sentence><sentence id="891">These included the Berlin document center, and the German armed forces information agency, as well as regional German police agencies. </sentence><sentence id="892">Now, most of these people, most of the OSI subjects, 90 percent if not better, were from eastern Europe and most of them were small fry, and most of them were either non-German, or were ethnic Germans from the east. </sentence><sentence id="893">So if they were not at a certain level, or had not been members of the SS or the Nazi party, the Berlin document center check would surface nothing, and the armed forces information check would surface, if anything, possibly and -- the name of an army unit or a police unit, and nothing more. </sentence><sentence id="894">When the individual was called in, if all the inve -- all the vice consul had, or the counter-intelligence corps investigator had was the number of a police unit, well, the investigator was essentially at the mercy of what the applicant had to say about what those duties were. </sentence><sentence id="895">I mean, you could be guarding buildings in a police unit, and under the amended Displaced Persons Act, that would not render you ineligible. </sentence><sentence id="896">There was just no access to the type of documentation that became available only beginning with the west German trials in the 60's, and to the United States investigators after the period of detente in the early 70's. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="908">Q: I don't know if you can comment on this, so obviously you" ll say no if you can't. </sentence><sentence id="909">We've known, I don't know for how many years about Operation Paper Clip, and the ways in which certain people were brought in by the government in order to help us, especially in science. </sentence><sentence id="910">And their past was whited out. </sentence><sentence id="911">Was it ever -- was there ever a time that you got -- as OSI got -- somebody slipped the information and that you were now in a position to know that we were protecting a Nazi, and then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="916">A: With Operation Paper Clip, we actually did have one case involving an Operation Paper Clip subject, Arthur Rudolf, whom we did end up -- he denaturalized himself essentially, by default. </sentence><sentence id="917">The difference with Operation Paper Clip, and the problem with Operation Paper Clip for the -- for proc -- litigation in this context was that these individuals were brought specifically to the United States, not despite what they'd done, but because of what they'd done. </sentence><sentence id="918">And this, if you go back to the context of that time, the purpose of bringing them to the United States was number one, to obtain whatever missile expertise they might have, and also to deprive the Soviet Union of that missile expertise. </sentence><sentence id="919">Which, whatever the morality of the situation is, looking back at it at that time, it was not an unreasonable decision given the national security interests at the time. </sentence><sentence id="920">This, obviously, did present a problem in the 1970's and 80's when we were looking into these investigations, because one could not say that the person gave false information. </sentence><sentence id="921">Another issue that was problematic is that many of these people had, in the broader context, a rather marginal connection with the persecution. </sentence><sentence id="922">The connection was generally at its worst responsibility for forced laborers, perhaps denouncing a forced laborer for -- for not working hard enough, as a result of which that forced laborer would be sent to a concentration camp, or sent to a worse concentration camp, or a worst case scenario, executed. </sentence><sentence id="923">This was clearly something that was not a priority for U.S. officials in the 40's and 50's when they were trying people, they were trying people who were shooting people. </sentence><sentence id="924">They were trying people who were direct, hands-on killers, and they had plenty of them. </sentence><sentence id="925">By the 1980's, because the big fry were either already tried, or die - - had died, there was a broader and more intensive public and legal concentration on different types of connections with Nazi crimes, and the connection with forced labor was clearly one of those. </sentence><sentence id="926">The ro -- for the roc -- for the majority of the rocket scientists, their connection with the forced labor was in comparison to that of a concentration camp guard, or a police official, relatively marginal. </sentence><sentence id="927">So the cases were that much tougher to prove, even without the problem of why the men were brought in. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="953">A: No, it's -- it -- it -- it's much more systematic than that. </sentence><sentence id="954">Cases are developed through the OSI research and development department. </sentence><sentence id="955">This is a department that grew out of the investigative wing of the unit in the mid-1980's, and it is responsible for the -- it -- 1-it -- it functions among many other things, as a transmission belt for these names that are dredged up by the historians, based on the original documentation to and from the INS. </sentence><sentence id="956">Ifa hit occurs where a person of the same name and same birthdate as someone who is a suspect of being a member of a unit involved in Nazi offenses, has also entered the United States, the research and development unit also takes several other steps to determine whether the person is still in the United States, whether the person is still alive, and whether the person is in good health. </sentence><sentence id="957">And also to make certain that the individual who resides in the United States is identical with the individual whose name a-appears on the roster that -- that was originated in the Nazi era. </sentence><sentence id="958">Once all of those bases are covered, so to speak, then the research and development -- the chief of the research and development, I think her -- her name is Elizabeth White, we had Dr. Black and Dr. White, and she then opens a case, gives it an OSI number and it becomes an investigation. </sentence><sentence id="959">The case is then assigned to an attorney and to a historian, and to a paralegal. </sentence><sentence id="960">And together the historian does the investigations, and OSI has some minimal investigative personnel to locate people, locate witnesses, locate files from federal agencies. </sentence><sentence id="961">But the historian does the investigation, works at the investigation to a point where the attorneys consider it ready for what we call a pre-filing interview. </sentence><sentence id="962">Cause we assume that all defendants are innocent until proven guilty, and that there could be some explanation for whatever it is we've put together. </sentence><sentence id="963">We obviously, if we get to the point where we want to talk to someone, we obviously feel that we have a -- a good -- we being the U.S. government, feels that we have a good case, that we can litigate if necessary, but there's always a possibility that there's a reasonable explanation for the documentation that we find in our hands. </sentence><sentence id="964">And so we usually attempt to interview the subject of the OSI investigation prior to filing a case. </sentence><sentence id="965">And as citizens -- if they're citizens, the subject can refuse to speak to us. </sentence><sentence id="966">Doesn't have to come. </sentence><sentence id="967">It's a civil case, the subject does not have to appear. </sentence><sentence id="968">If the subject is an alien, the subject must appear, but he does not have to say anything to us, other than name, rank and serial number, if he wants. </sentence><sentence id="969">Based on that pre-filing interview, depending on what the unit gets, and depending on what that means for the case, the direction of OSI makes a determination of whether a case, a complaint, or an order to show cause should be filed. </sentence><sentence id="970">And then once that determination is made, the -- the documentation is drafted, and a case is filed in court. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="990">Q: Let me a -- let me ask you how the priorities are set. </sentence><sentence id="991">You've got a -- you can have hundreds of rosters, maybe thousands of rosters, and maybe you can make hundreds of possible connections. </sentence><sentence id="992">Who is the person who decides? </sentence><sentence id="993">Is there sort of a hierarchy of importance? </sentence><sentence id="994">Or is it simply whatever comes up first, well this works, let's -- let's take it, I mean how -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="995">A: It -- no, this -- generally the hierarchy of importance revolves around the likelihood of an individual belonging to a specific unit that is in its daily routine involved in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="996">So we will go the u -- the United States government will push names for instance, of concentration camp guards before they might push the names of a -- an obscure police unit in an area that we're not sure that there was persecution, at least Holzman type persecution. </sentence><sentence id="997">We will push Trawniki train guards fairly quickly, though if we have Trawniki train guards who came in late 1943 or early 1944, they might not have the same priority as a Trawniki train guard who was at Belzec. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="998">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1006">Q: But the -- the role of the historian here, because at least in the beginning, I'm assuming that the lawyers and the paralegals don't know much of this history, and that you historians are the ones who can say look, this is really more important. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Or am I -- or am I wrong? </sentence><sentence id="1008">Did -- did they come in with a lot of knowledge as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1012">A: They're -- OSI has several attorneys who've been around for -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1013">Q: Now for a period -- right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1014">A: -- a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1015">So they have -- they have a good sense -- and -- and they've prosecuted a lot of cases, and so they have a good sense of what constitutes a winnable case. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And they can also impart that good sense to the newer attorneys, who -- there's much more turnover among the attorneys than there is among the historians. </sentence><sentence id="1017">But the process of opening cases is a process that's more or less run by my former colleague, Elizabeth White. </sentence><sentence id="1018">She is the one who makes a determination on whether a case should be opened or not. </sentence><sentence id="1019">It does go through her superior, her direct superior who is the director of the office, Eli Rosenbaum, and he -- he needs to approve, but I don't know of any cases where he has rejected a recommendation from her that a case be filed. </sentence><sentence id="1020">She's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1021">Q: Would -- would she go to you and -- and ask your advice on whether a case should be opened, or did she really -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1022">A: She's been around long enough -- she was a -- she was trained in German and European history and she's been with the office since 1983. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And she's been running the R and D section since the departure of David Marwell in 1988. </sentence><sentence id="1024">So she's quite capable -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1025">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: -- and knowledgeable in her own right to know what constitutes a -- a -- a unit, based on the documentation that exists, what constitutes a unit that -- who's an -- individuals are likely to participating in persecution. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1044">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1046">A: But I -- I didn't -- I -- I feel I should explain why that tome is so big. </sentence><sentence id="1047">It has to do with some of the specifics of the Trifa case. </sentence><sentence id="1048">Trifa was not a case which was developed by OSI. </sentence><sentence id="1049">It was a case that was developed through denunciation. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And Trifa in his defense was able to make statements that were half-truths, that required a significant amount of documentation to develop an understanding among the attorneys of what the actual truth was. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Trifa, for example, was able to say he was incarcerated in a concentration camp during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And what did that mean? </sentence><sentence id="1053">He was able to say that the Romanian Iron Guard was anti-German. </sentence><sentence id="1054">What did that mean? </sentence><sentence id="1055">He could say that the Germans didn't trust the Iron Guard. </sentence><sentence id="1056">What did that -- all of those things were -- were truth, but they weren't the whole truth. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And the whole truth was dependent on a rather acute analysis of what the documentation was, what the conditions were like for the Iron Guards when they were in German captivity. </sentence><sentence id="1058">It was clear from the documentation. </sentence><sentence id="1059">But it took 40 pages of that particular part of the case to explain to the prosecuting attorneys, and also -- who would then explain it to the judge, through the expert witness, of what exactly was the nature of the persecution of Trifa. </sentence><sentence id="1060">The same is true for the Iron Guards anti-German behavior, or the Iron Guards rebellion against the Fascist Romanian military dictatorship which was backed by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And for Trifa's own particular role in persecution, which was -- had to be shifted from the original emphasis on physical mistreatment of individuals, which came from witnesses, many of whom didn't, as it turned out, pan out, to a more -- persecution based more on advocation, particularly within the student rubric, and student organizations of exclusion and discrimination against Jews and Gypsies and Greeks in Romania. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And also towards a print advocation of -- with intent to instill hatred of these minority groups, and to help to create an atmosphere in which the authorities could, with reasonable support from the general population, engage in physical persecution of these individuals. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And if you'll notice in that particular tome at the end of each section, there is a contrast between Trifa's statements, and what evidence exists, based on the historical context in the chapters, that would contradict what Trifa -- Trifa's version of events. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And that was an unusual case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1085">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1087">A: A -- amuch more normal type of reporting, and in fact it became institutionalized in the 90's when courts began demanding an expert witness report, which was essentially a historical biography of the official duties of the defendant. </sentence><sentence id="1088">And I -- I don't remember exactly which year we -- the courts began to require these reports, but I think it was in the early 90's. </sentence><sentence id="1089">A much better example is the Schellong report, Conrad Schellong, who was a -- who was a concentration camp guard and security officer at Dachau in the years before the war, and I can tell you now that someone in OSI when I first at -- was assigned to the case was disappointed that he was only there before the war, and even said something to the effect, well before the war they were just like prisons, weren't they? </sentence><sentence id="1090">And that signaled to me as a historian that even before we went outside to deal with judges and defense attorneys, we had to lay a context for what Dachau was, and a context to prove, in a sense, that the people who were in Dachau, despite Nazi euphemisms    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1091"> and misstatements about who they were and why they were there, were in that camp for reasons of race, religion, national origin and political opinion -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1092">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1093">A: -- and were being persecuted for those reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And a key hooker to that was dealing with the instrument, the legal police instrument of schutzhaft, or protective detention is the loose translation. </sentence><sentence id="1095">And by dealing with the regulations of protective detention, which was imposed by the Gestapo outside the concentration camp, and had little to do with the individual's sojourn within the camp, except to bring him or her in, or bring him or her out if he or she managed to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1096">But the schutzhaft provided the proof that the people who were in that camp were in that camp because of their race, because they were Jewish in 1938, because of their national origin, because of their religious convictions, Jehovah's Witnesses, or because of their political opinion; Socialists, Communists and -- and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And that was quite clearly expressed in schutzhaft orders and in the discussion of what schutzhaft was and how schutzhaft was supposed to be applied in the documentation of the Gestapo, of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and of the concentration camp commandants themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And so we -- we as historians were responsible for putting together a context of how the prisoners came into the concentration camp, by what pseudo-legal means they came into the concentration camp, of how the guards were recruited, of what their duties were, and of how their daily duties involved keeping these people in a place where they were being persecuted on the basis of race, religion and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And through that, if we could prove all of those facts, and we could prove that the defendant was a member of this unit, then we could prove -- then -- then a judge could reach a finding that this individual persecuted, or assisted -- participated in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="1100">And the purpose in writing a report, and people always used to joke about my long reports -- the purpose of writing the report was not only to inform the attorneys, but also to solidify in the mind of the historian, what the framework of this inquiry was going to be, and so that the historian could be sure that all relevant documentation, some of it -- some of which was often obscure and by itself meaningless, how it fit in. </sentence><sentence id="1101">And y -- we could use the report even though we didn't show the reports to the expert witnesses until the courts began to require us to provide an expert witness report, we didn't show -- these were work product. </sentence><sentence id="1102">But we would use the framework established by that report to work out the testimony of the expert witness, and then test it against the expert witnesses, cause after all, he was an independent individual, or she -- a-and I think most of our expert witnesses were male. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1114">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1116">A: I think all of them were male, I can't remember a female expert witness. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1118">Q: W-Would they even get the report, or would they just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1119">A: No, they wouldn't -- in the early days they would not get the report. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1120">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1122">A: The report was work product for the attorney and for the historian. </sentence><sentence id="1123">But the attorney -- the areas that the attorney wanted to cover in the testimony were informed by the contents and context that was reflected in the report. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1126">Q: Let me ask you a question of detail, cause it just struck me the other day as I was reading through the requirements for what kind of persecution or torture, or advocacy, it never includes sexual preference. </sentence><sentence id="1127">So that when you talk about those people who were put into the concentration camps, especially before the war, there -- and I'm just wondering, is there a connection betw -- because the United States is not letting in people who said they were homosexuals at a certain </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1130"> point, and that -- so it didn't matter that there were homosexuals who were being persecuted in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1131">Cause there's no reference. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1132">A: You know, again, and here's something that I don't -- I don't -- I -- I'm not sure of why it isn't in there. </sentence><sentence id="1133">I -- certainly in 1978, when the legislation was drafted, the focus on sexual preference, and on persecution for sexual pref -- on the basis of sexual preference, was unfortunately not as consciously not this -- not of the same conscious concern to U.S. authorities or anyone else, frankly, as it is today. </sentence><sentence id="1134">We -- there's also, if you notice in the legislation, there's no provision for the persecution of people who were engaged in what the Nazis called asocial behavior. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1144">A: And part of the problem, no doubt, rests with -- the drafters of the legislation may well have felt, well we're probably not going to pass this legislation at this time if we say that it's wrong to persecute homosexuals when we have many states that still have sodomy laws on the books. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1146">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1148">A: And we're certainly not going to be able to pass this legislation if we count locking up panhandlers, or flashers or what have you, whatever asocial behavior you choose to -- to focus on, you're not going to be able to pass this legisla -- we want to pass this legis -- we want to pass this legislation in very clear and convincing areas that we know at the time, in the context of the 70's that there will be a consensus among Americans that this is wrong, that we don't want people who engage in this activity, persecution of these people, for these reasons in our United States. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Do I know that for -- do I know that for -- whether that was really behind -- in the minds? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1150"> I don't know, it's speculation. </sentence><sentence id="1151">But I suspect that wherever there was the possibility that we the United States might prosecute the same things, this would clearly present an argument for any defendant to say you [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1152">Q: And where do Gypsies fit into those categories? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1153">A: Gypsies would have -- Gypsies in -- in terms of that, we could have fit that into racial persecution. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1244">A: That is not to be -- that they didn't want to be occupied by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1245">But they were also blowing up bridges, and shooting German soldiers, and with the Vietnam experience fresh, and the parallel often drawn by our own attorneys, some of whom had served in Vietnam, and certainly drawn by judges who had handled civil cases involving problems dealing with Vietnam, this was obviously an issue that we weren't going to able to win a case, even if the Communist happened to be a Jew, and the -- and the Communist Jew blew up a bridge, that an army occupying a country, unfortunately it has the right to kill people who are blowing up bridges. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1257">Q: Peter, can we talk about the -- the -- the way in which evidence is gathered? </sentence><sentence id="1258">For instance, in the Trifa case, did all the -- the huge tome that you wrote, was that all information you got from the archives in the United States, or were you able to get things from Romania? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1261">A: There was a combination. </sentence><sentence id="1262">Actually, I was not the first assigned to the Trifa case, it had pre- dated OSI, and in fact pre-dated the SLU, the Special Litigation Unit in the INS, had actually been filed in the U.S. attorney's office in Detroit, I believe it was, in 1975. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Some of the early research for the SLU, in records both in the national archives and in Romania, were done by none other than Paul Shapiro, who worked as a contractor for the SLU for a short time in "78 - deg79. </sentence><sentence id="1264">I'm -- maybe "77 - "78. </sentence><sentence id="1265">When I was hired and brought down to Washington, I had a look at the existing evidence, and there was still a s -- a number of gaps that needed to be filled at that point, primarily from material that was held at the United States National Archives, and primarily from captured German records, SS records, and German foreign office records. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And what I did was to gather the rest of that material and pull that material, together with the material that had been gathered from Romania, and with some newer material that had been gathered from the Library of Congress, which had the monetoral officiale, which was the legal gazette of the Antonescu regime in Romania. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And -- cause we weren't at war with Romania during the period that the Iron Guard was in power in the autumn and winter of 1940 and 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And I integrated the information from these various sources, into a narrative that was broken down into the topics that were relevant to our -- the components of our complaint and the defenses that Trifa had made against the charges of the government. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: So how is that huge document used by the lawyers? </sentence><sentence id="1278">You -- you would write this, and then they would take it over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1281">A: In this particular case, the lawyers used it as a cheat sheet in a way, for developing a line that -- their line of questioning of the expert witness on direct examination. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And they also used -- it was written in such a way so that the attorneys could use that which they needed, to deal with rebuttal questions that came up on cross-examination, the -- the questions, if he says this to this, or if the pro -- if the defense attorney asks the expert to explain this, this is what -- this is a -- a reasonable response if the independent expert agrees. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And sometimes the defense attorney would not ask the question, and you wouldn't need to introduce the e -- there was no reason to introduce the evidence on direct examination. </sentence><sentence id="1284">Let me see if I can think of a good exa -- good example. </sentence><sentence id="1285">We could argue -- here's an example, I -- I don't remember if this exactly was in my mind at the time, or this be -- was an issue at the trial, but Trifa claimed that he was persecuted by the Nazis, that he was a concentration camp prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Our direct examination involved his sojourn with the other Iron Guard leaders in the Birkenbrook SS house, where -- from where he had a special vacation for his stomach ulcers, where he was at spas, and going to movies, and writing home about -- home to his buddies at Birkenbrook about his stomach illnesses, and his medicines, and what the weather was like, not -- not exactly the regular concentration camp prisoner's life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1293">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1295">A: After Coriasima, the Iron Guard leader escaped from Birkenbrook, and was tracked down in Rome and brought back. </sentence><sentence id="1296">At the behest of the foreign ministry, the SS did put the -- the Iron Guard leaders in a concentration camp, I believe it was at Buchenwald, but I can't remember where -- which camp at the moment. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I think Seymour went to Sachsenhausen and the rest of them went to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1298">But even here, and this was the issue that was brought up for rebuttal; if he says, oh I was in a concentration camp, and I was treated poorly, even here there is evidence that the Iron Guard leaders were clearly prominent persons, kept in a separate compound, they had a radio they could listen to, and they even had a -- a -- Jehovah's Witness as a -- as a -- a person who would clean their -- their rooms, and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1299">Again, it was not the typical concentration camp existence, and they were clearly not in there because of Nazi persecution of their politics, they were in there because the Nazis needed to keep tabs on them for foreign policy reasons, and they also wanted to keep them in reserve in the event that the Antonescu regime ever tried to desert the axis, as it did in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1300">So it was that type of evidence that I felt, and other historians working on their cases felt that the attorneys ought to have, either for rebuttal purposes, or for their general background. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And in some cases it was information that the expert witness might not have, but might be able to evaluate in a useful way, to frame his or her testimony. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1310">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="1311">Wh-When the law -- when the lawyers would get this information from you, like -- like with the big book, would you then have a conversa -- would they sit with you and say, I don't quite understand what this means, or how I can use it, I mean, was it transparent to them, how to use these things, or would there be conversations between you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1312">A: This would be an ongoing -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1313">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1315">A: -- it would be an ongoing conversation that we would have, and it would often be a conversation that we would have in the context of selecking -- selecting specific documents, and giving them priority as to how we ought to use them. </sentence><sentence id="1316">As I remember it, in our cases, in the cases I worked on, there were four levels of priority. </sentence><sentence id="1317">We selected documents that we were definitely going to introduce as evidence on direct examination, through the vehicle of the expert witness. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And this involved a whole procedure of making sure that they were properly translated, making sure that they were properly certified as to the chain of custody, which was particularly for materials from the Soviet Union, and the eastern bloc, these were -- this could be a very, very complicated process. </sentence><sentence id="1319">The second level required similar preparation because these were documents that were selected to be used if necessary to rebut possible defenses, or documentation submitted in support of possible defenses. </sentence><sentence id="1320">So in other words, you had to have these documents ready as if you wanted to move them into evidence, whether you moved them into evidence or not. </sentence><sentence id="1321">But a decision to move them into evidence would be made, perhaps very close to trial, or maybe during the trial itself. </sentence><sentence id="1322">The third level of priority were those documents that we felt that the expert witness should see. </sentence><sentence id="1323">That we would not use them as evidence, they were not appropriate as evidence, either because they were not relevant, or because, for instance, they involved a witness statement where the witness was no longer alive and couldn't be cross examined, and it was not an old enough document to come in under an ancient documents exception to the hearsay rule. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Or it was simply general background and general context that the expert witness should either see for the first time, or refresh his memory and have it as part of the context of the case, but it was not necessary to introduce as evidence. </sentence><sentence id="1325">It was something that the expert could talk about without having to document it. </sentence><sentence id="1326">An example of that might be -- an example of that might be a report about a specific event that occurred in 1941, that was written in 1944, either by the government that perpetrated the event, or that was presiding over the event, or by the successor government. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Was something that the expert probably should be aware of, but it was not something that was appropriate to use as evidence. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And then the fourth rung were those documents that were either exonerating, or in some way that could potentially adversely affect the case, so that the expert witness would have an opportunity to know what they were, and to reconcile them with the theory of the case as developed through this cooperation between the expert witness and the prosecution team. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1345">Q: Wa -- I want to ask you more about that, but can you explain the hearsay rule? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1409">A: -- the expert offers evidence -- excuse me -- on what the unit did, o-on the big picture, first of all, so we -- usually the -- the -- the way it's laid out is we deal with ideological issues, what the German aims were at the very top, what the specific conditions and administrative structures    were in the particular region involved, and then getting down to the particular organization or organizations in chronological sequence as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And then going down as far as the documentation permits the expert to make a judgment. </sentence><sentence id="1411">For instance, if the expert sees a month's worth of guard rotation assignments at a concentration camp, that expert can talk about those rotations, because he's seen enough evidence to convince him of how -- or -- or to define for him what the daily routine was like. </sentence><sentence id="1412">If there's no evidence, he can speak about -- if there's no evidence -- well, let me -- let me retract that. </sentence><sentence id="1413">If there's -- if we don't have the daily rotations, but only have evidence of the concentration camp within the system, then the expert, if he feels so comfortable in doing so, can talk about how -- what the normal routine was within the concentration camp system, and how in his expert opinion there's no reason to assume that for this particular concentration camp, it went any way differently. </sentence><sentence id="1414">He cannot -- or I wouldn't, as an expert witness, try to get into the detail as to who was rotated where at what time, or even what the specific places of rotation were. </sentence><sentence id="1415">That you'd have to do on the basis of the evidence. </sentence><sentence id="1416">You can't know that if you don't have the -- i-if -- if there's a gap in that documentation. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And for instance, to give you an example, in the Schellong case, we didn't have that documentation for Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1418">We only knew that he was a security officer, and we knew that there were regular functions for security officers in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1419">And the expert testified as to that. </sentence><sentence id="1420">We did have rotation rosters for the guards at Sachsenburg, where Schellong was at before he went to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1421">And there the expert could talk very specifically that Conrad Schellong, on such and such a day, was outside the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Or that he checked in on the bunker as security officer every three or four hours, whatever the -- the case might have been. </sentence><sentence id="1423">For instance in the Hajda case, we could talk because we had, through a three tiered level of documentation, contemporaneous documentation of individuals who were in the Trawniki system, and who served at the Treblinka labor camp, individuals who after the war testified in western countries, where there was -- where you didn't have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like, that they had indeed been there, and done this, that and the other thing, and then of course, the Soviet protocols, in so far as the information contained therein was consistent with the original documentation, and the testimony in the western protocols. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And through a s -- a combination of those three types of sources, we were able to identify where virtually every single individual who served at the Treblinka labor camp between March 1943, and its dissolution in July 1944, where they were. </sentence><sentence id="1425">We were able even to determine what happened to the people who appeared on one roster and were no longer on the other roster. </sentence><sentence id="1426">One was sent back because he was a chronic drunk, and we had documentation -- his own testimony in that case, that he became an alcoholic at Treblinka one. </sentence><sentence id="1427">A post-war testimony in a German proceeding, a west German proceeding. </sentence><sentence id="1428">In another case, an individual deserted, and we found the -- the German wanted list, indicating that this indi -- individual had deserted and was being sought at a time between the dates of the two rosters. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And so the expert was able to speak in significant detail about who was at Treblinka one, when, and what they were doing there; and in a way that was very convincing to the judge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1453">Q: W-What is unique about the Trifa complaint in your -- in your view? </sentence><sentence id="1454">Is it not common that one is making a complaint against someone who is an advocate, but not necessarily who actually did the persecution, but was so -- is that what's interesting about that case? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1457">A: I think Trifa's -- the interest for Trifa -- we had a couple of journalists. </sentence><sentence id="1458">Trifa was primarily a journalist, he was also a student leader. </sentence><sentence id="1459">He was unique among OSI subjects -- well not u-unique, but rare among OSI subjects in that he was in the highest level of leadership. </sentence><sentence id="1460">He was next to the - - he was in that group that was close to the -- the leader Horia Sima himself. </sentence><sentence id="1461">But he was -- he was unique in that much of what he said in his defense, in contrast to it being an outright lie, did contain a grain of truth. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And -- but was significant more for what he omitted to say, than what he actually admitted. </sentence><sentence id="1463">In other words, Trifa was a concentration camp prisoner, or was ca -- I take that back, I'm going to withdraw that. </sentence><sentence id="1464">He was, for a time, confined in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1465">He was in the custody of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1466">He was a member of a movement that the Germans didn't fully trust, and that rebelled against the regime that the Germans supported. </sentence><sentence id="1467">All of these issues -- I can't think at the moment of another defendant that, given the hope of prosecutorial ignorance, had a better defense in that he could rely on half-truths, rather than simply claiming to be in another place other than he was, or claiming to have been a combat soldier when he really was a concentration camp guard, or simply denying ever having served with the Germans, or in the Hajda case, as you saw, rather unwisely claiming that the information, though accurate as to his person, wasn't him, that somebody else was using his birth data, for reasons that no one could ever explain. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1494">Q: At both times? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1496">A: At both times. </sentence><sentence id="1497">Shortly before denaturalization, Trifa voluntarily turned in his certificate, and renounced his citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Didn't stop him from appealing the decision afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1499">His attorney,    a -- am -- aman by the name of Woods, I think, I can't recall his first name, at that time wrote a gigantic tome in defense of Trifa, and criticizing Trifa for withdrawing, and bitterly attacking the government for persecuting Trifa, which was another issue that we -- we had to deal with in putting together the deportation case, because we had every reason to believe that once Trifa appealed the denaturalization decision, which came as a result of his voluntary act of throwing in the towel, we had every reason to believe that he would fight at deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And he did take it to trial at deportation, and I'm still convinced -- I was at the trial, I'm still convinced that due to the tremendous talent of the lead attorney on the case, Kathleen Coleman, who still works for the Justice Department, and the way she was orchestrating -- well, I co -- wouldn't say orchestrating, the way she was permitting the expert witness, Bayla Vargo, to explain the context of what this documentation relating to Trifa really meant, that of everyone in the courtroom, Trifa probably knew best where the testimony was going. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1509">A: And after two days of it -- the expert was on the stand for two days, Trifa's lawyers approached Allen Ryan who was at the trial and again ultimately offered to throw in the towel and agreed to an order of deportation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1618">Q: Were expert witnesses rehearsed, or were they supposed to be to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1619">A: They were prepped the way any witness would be prepped in any kind of civil or criminal case. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Our witnesses -- w-we'd go over the questions we wanted to ask them, and listen to their answers, and there were often times when the answer we were expecting was not one that the expert was comfortable with, and there was a dynamic, and h-here the historian played a significant role, often in the evening before trial, and in the evenings between the -- betwe -- between testimony of the expert witness in finding a common ground where the prosecution and the expert witness could both be comfortable with what the expert witness was saying, because </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1623"> there would be disputes and the expert witness was truly an independent witness and if he wouldn't say what the lawyer expected him to say, that was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And none of the OSI attorneys wanted to be accused of coaching a witness to say something that wasn't true. </sentence><sentence id="1625">And the staff historian often played a role, using his or her knowledge of the documentation at finding something that both expert witness and prosecuting attorney could feel comfortable with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1629">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1630">So of course, the attorney doesn't want to be surprised at trial. </sentence><sentence id="1631">You need to have a real sense of what's going to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1635">A: Absolutely, absolutely, and there is also a process of preparing the expert witness for cross examine questions -- cross examination questions that he might get, and they -- the whole process of prepping for that. </sentence><sentence id="1636">But this is something that's not unusual and happens in all proceedings and the defense does it with their witnesses as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1639">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1640">Not -- not that I'm going to ask you to name names, I'd never ask you to do that, but I would imagine you folks had favorite expert witnesses, and people you said we're not going to use this person again, or this is -- were there qualities that you needed in an expert witness besides his expert -- or her -- not that you had any, but in this case, males, their expert -- knowing something doesn't mean they will be effective in the courtroom. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1643">A: Yes, th-the expert had to be comfortable enough with the material to be able to speak, offer his opinions with confidence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1645">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1647">A: And -- and in a sense that's really what it was, it was an issue -- the expert had to be an expert, had to be comfortable enough with the data to be able to get up there and speak with confidence. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And you can't just, in my experience -- and I worked well with all of the experts that I worked with, the one I worked with most often was a gentleman named Charlie Sidmore, and I worked with him in the Hajda case, as you saw from the transcript. </sentence><sentence id="1649">But it -- it had to -- there had to be enough knowledge, enough familiarity with the material on the part of the expert, which meant the expert really had to do some work, and independent work, so that he could get up on the stand and feel really comfortable about what he was saying and even if he did make a mistake, which we're all human and we do make a mistake, that we could make sure that it was cleared up on a follow-up question, or on redirect examination, if the mistake was made on cross examination. </sentence><sentence id="1650">Cause the -- the -- the nature of these cases, and the level at which the information was relevant -- most historians deal with the upper levels of an agency, and where we were dealing with people on the ground that are -- is generally not of much historical -- broader historical significance, given the complexity of the documentation, experts would forget this or that, or the other thing, and a follow-up question was often all one needed to trigger off what the expert already knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1656">Q: I'm interested to hear what happens to you when you're an expert witness, and I'm wondering if you can comment on this. </sentence><sentence id="1657">Most people you have as expert witnesses are academics, I imagine, of -- of some kind. </sentence><sentence id="1658">Am I right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1662">A: All have an academic background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1664">Q: Academic background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1666">A: All are trained as academics. </sentence><sentence id="1667">We had at least one expert witness who was not -- did not hold a university position in the most recent 10 years of his career, but he continued to be academically active. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1670">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1672">A: In other words, they were all experts in the sense that they continued to work with primary source documents, they continued to write history, they continued to analyze documentation, and they kept up on the latest research in the field in which they were expert. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1674">Q: Is it uncomfortable in some ways for academics to do it in a court setting, because ambiguity is not what you're looking for, you're loo -- you're looking for a very specific kind of clarity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1676">Now maybe it's my bias, because I was a philosopher, being -- living with ambiguity is sort of the rule, and maybe as an historian that's not quite as true, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1677">A: | -- I think -- i-it's been my experience, at least from what I've observed with experts on the stand, that there are times when the moo -- th-the rules of the courtroom, as to what gets in, what -- what -- what doesn't get in, can be frustrating to the effort to explain the context of a situation. </sentence><sentence id="1678">But I noticed in -- and I'm thinking of at least two or three expert witnesses, who were able to overcome quickly, that discomfort and work with the rules of -- of evidence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1681">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1683">A: And in a sense, 1-it just requires you to know your material very, very well. </sentence><sentence id="1684">To get a sense of the dynamic of the questioning. </sentence><sentence id="1685">To not be flustered by interruptions by the defense, because the defense attorney's job is to try to disrupt as much as possible, the train of thought of the expert, and to try to -- even the most decent of defense attorneys -- to try to catch the expert witnesses -- witness, in errors of fact or interpretation that would serve to undermine his whole testimony. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And those experts who accepted that, were competent enough in their material not to get flustered by those interruptions and kept going back and kept listening to, and following the direction of the questions, usually got most of what the -- they intended to say, out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1691">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1693">A: And in -- in -- in that sense, the expert testimony, taken together with the trial record offered a fairly good picture of the history of this particular defendant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1695">Q: Now what about the use of survivor testimonies, or I don't know how you call them, other kinds of witnesses, they're not considered expert witnesses, but experiential witnesses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1697">A: Eyewitnesses, in a sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1699">Q: Eyewitness, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1701">A: W-We use two types -- actually three types of eyewitnesses. </sentence><sentence id="1702">There were two -- there was a traditional type of eyewitness, whether it was a survivor, or a fellow perpetrator who actually saw specific events at hand. </sentence><sentence id="1703">We also used, a-a-and in this case survivor witnesses who may not have probably i-in many cases, most cases, didn't know the defendant, had no idea what the defendant did, but could talk in general about what his or her perception of what the guards were doing was, and also more important, what life was like. </sentence><sentence id="1704">There's no one, no book, no perpetrator testimony, no historian can possibly get across with the same intensity as a survivor talking, what it felt like to the survivor. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And it -- when the survivor talks, in that sense, if one ac-accepts the testimony as being no more than what it is, that survivor's memory, some of the inaccuracies that inevitably come up in human memory, even when they can't be reconciled with an explanation, still don't detract from the image of what life was like in a concentration camp, or in a line waiting to be shot at a pit. </sentence><sentence id="1706">That this is something that -- this kind of testimony lends an immediacy that the dry documentation just can't give. </sentence><sentence id="1707">But it also is less immu -- less vulnerable to attack than testimony, I saw him do it, because that raises all sorts of questions of how the witness knew who he was. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And remember, he was most often wearing a uniform, and a cap, and looked pretty much like the next him and the next him after that. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And how does this witness remember this particular person as opposed to anyone else? </sentence><sentence id="1710">And in a trial with a dynamic where    the defense attorney has the opportunity and must have the opportunity to question that witness's memory, to try to trip that witness, to try to ask questions, well isn't it possible that you could be mistaken? </sentence><sentence id="1711">How do you really know that it was this person and not someone else? </sentence><sentence id="1712">And in that ki - - type of dynamic, that kind of testimony, unless there was some reason for the survivor witness to have known the man, the way you would -- the way you would judge the credibility of any eyewitness, in any criminal case, the eyewitnesses -- the survivor testimony was often much more effective to give a picture of the climate of persecution, to offer evidence as to the identity of the people who are being persecuted through their own persons. </sentence><sentence id="1713">This was stuff that they knew. </sentence><sentence id="1714">This was stuff that they would not be mistaken about and could not be mistaken about. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Then we had a third type of witness, we had to develop how the process of certifying refugees, and how the refugees applied for visas, we had to establish that particular process. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And we did that by locating individuals who had actually worked on those processes. </sentence><sentence id="1717">In other words, displaced persons -- officials from the displaced persons commission. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Officials from the counter- intelligence corps, state department visa officials. </sentence><sentence id="1719">In -- in -- I -- I can't remember a single case frankly, where any one of these officials remembered the specific case that they were asked to testify. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Well, after all, during the DP act there were 400,000 visas. </sentence><sentence id="1721">That meant 400,000 investigations and 400,000 pre-application interviews. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And no reasonable individual could be expected to remember one person as opposed to another, particularly if there wasn't a -- a specific hooker about that -- that case. </sentence><sentence id="1723">But what we could ask them about was what was the regular procedure? </sentence><sentence id="1724">Did you swear it was -- was -- was the applicant required to swear to the truth of what he was saying? </sentence><sentence id="1725">What did the applicant need in order to become eligible to be a displaced person, to receive a visa? </sentence><sentence id="1726">What were the exclusionary measures? </sentence><sentence id="1727">How were they implemented?And in that way, the witness could take -- offer the judge testimony on how things actually worked. </sentence><sentence id="1728">And we used those witnesses -- the OSI used those witnesses to introduce documentation regulations of the international refugee organization, regulations of the d -- Displaced Persons Commission. </sentence><sentence id="1729">Visa regulations, advisory reports and what have you, that were relevant to the process of how a displaced person entered the United States and what information he was required to offer about his person in order to complete his application. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1762">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1763">We're not -- it's Hajda, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1766">A: Hajda, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1768">Q: Hajda. </sentence><sentence id="1769">In the Hajda case you had two survivors from Treblinka, who interestingly enough could mention the names of two other guards, but of course did not know -- Hajda was -- was interesting, and th-the emphasis on the testimony was apparently not very much. </sentence><sentence id="1770">There was an argument about inclusion of the testimony and the judge agreed to include it, but then didn't use it very much in the final decision. </sentence><sentence id="1771">And so, was it to give it a -- a taste of what this place was like, so that one could make a connection between what Hajda must have been doing, had he been there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1776">A: | -- I -- I think the judge wanted to hear that. </sentence><sentence id="1777">And -- a-and that certainly was the purpose of those witness -- they couldn't say anything about Hajda personally, neither of them, as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1778">They -- they -- even though it was a small camp, there were only roughly a hundred, 120 guards there at any one time. </sentence><sentence id="1779">I-In that particular camp, the -- the commandant was a psychopath who often personally took pleasure in torturing individual prisoners, so he was a person who was fairly well known, even by name, to the prisoners of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1780">It was a small prison camp too, there were under a thousand people in the camp, under a thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1781">And there was one guard, a particularly cruel guard, who had the bad luck to have a patch over his eye. </sentence><sentence id="1782">And so he was remembered, not necessarily by name, but they all remembered the one with    the patch over his eye, and that's natural. </sentence><sentence id="1783">And in fact, the one with the patch over his eye, bad as he was, often got blamed for virtually everything because a -- a -- a -- a survivor witness, in remembering bad things that happened also remembered the guy with the patch over his eye, and that the guy with the patch over his eye was a bad guy, and so the connection was made. </sentence><sentence id="1784">And in many cases they were right, and in some cases they weren't right. </sentence><sentence id="1785">But Hajda was just one guard among many and it -- in -- in that case it was very typical of the survivor's relationship to the normal -- normal in quotes -- prisoner guar -- the normal guard, that he was a person in a uniform, that unless there was some reason to know him on a daily basis, like a prisoner worked in a tailor shop and the guard commonly came to the tailor shop to get his boots fixed, there was some relationship that was ongoing. </sentence><sentence id="1786">But just a guard on the perimeter was someone that the witness, after 40 years, couldn't be expected -- it wouldn't be fair to burden the witness with trying to remember that particular person. </sentence><sentence id="1787">And so in this particular case it was made easy for us because the defendant stipulated to all of the horrors in the Treblinka one camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1801">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1803">A: He stipulated to that, he said, okay I can see all of that. </sentence><sentence id="1804">The issue was, was Bronislaw Hajda the person who was listed as Bronislaw Hajda in the -- in the documentation. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And this is why the judge was so concerned about the prosecution's efforts to document exactly what happened to each person who was on those two and -- and -- and later three and four when you take Battalion Streibel into the process, rosters to document their whereabouts, to convince as in this case the OSI did, to convince the judge that the information ab -- of the -- i -- contained in these rosters, the personal data and the information as to where these people were, was accurate, and did refer to these particular people. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And the judge was convinced of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1811">Q: Do you ever remember a case where an eyewitness, who was a survivor, who was at the place, was actually able to identify a particular person and be accepted for that, not because it was a vague remembrance, but was there ever an instance where that was the case, th-that it worked, people -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1812">A: There was one case that I was on, the Bruno Blach case, where I was personally convinced that the survivor knew -- identified correctly, the individual as a guard. </sentence><sentence id="1813">I was never quite certain that he correctly identified the individual as the person who committed a killing, which he did identify. </sentence><sentence id="1814">But the reasons that his particular recognition of this person struck me as viable, and I saw him -- I saw him look at the photo spread, and in fact was -- when -- when the person was extradited to West Germany, the defendant was extradited to West Germany, I had to testify as a witness, an eyewitness to that identification process. </sentence><sentence id="1815">There was no question that the face, the likeness of that picture registered with the -- with the witness in that case, in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1816">I was watching him when he looked at the photo spread, and I knew which photo was the defendant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1822">And I was not asking the questions, an investigator was asking the questions, I was watching. </sentence><sentence id="1823">And I saw him -- I -- I saw him when he hit that particular photo, flinch. </sentence><sentence id="1824">And this was a very small camp, it was a sub-camp of Mauthausen, about 2000 prisoners, maybe a hundred guards and a small squad of guards with canines, about 15 of them. </sentence><sentence id="1825">And this was one of the guys with a canine. </sentence><sentence id="1826">He was a Sudaten German, and he also had a particularly handsome face. </sentence><sentence id="1827">He was -- he was just striking looking. </sentence><sentence id="1828">He was someone that one might remember in the context of a small group of people in a small camp, where the individual who was a Polish prisoner was -- was there for two years, both in -- both prisoner and guard were there for two years. </sentence><sentence id="1829">The prisoners all worked in one factory, the guards all escorted them every day to that one factory. </sentence><sentence id="1830">I don't know to this day whether the identification of this person as the killer in this case, was accurate. </sentence><sentence id="1831">I don't know to this day. </sentence><sentence id="1832">Under interrogation later in the West German proceeding against this individual, the evidence became so contradictory, even as to the identity of the victim of that shooting, that the defendant was ultimately acquitted in a criminal trial of the specific murder. </sentence><sentence id="1833">But there's no question in my mind that that face was known to the witness. </sentence><sentence id="1834">But that was the only case that I worked on in which I was convinced completely that an eyewitness recognized the defendant. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1868">Q: Is the denaturalization process answering a question, is this person of moral character? </sentence><sentence id="1869">And is the lack of moral character based on the fact that there was a material misrepresentation in the denaturalization process -- or the naturalization process? </sentence><sentence id="1870">Is that where it comes from, or is it a judgment of who they were during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1874">A: No, it's the -- the bad moral character is a judgment based on the material misrepresentation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1875">That because one lied, the violation is that one made false statements to obtain a federal benefit - </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1876">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1877">A: -- which citizenship is. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And that that indicated that this was a person of bad moral character. </sentence><sentence id="1879">But the false statements, again, had to be material. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1883">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1885">A: And in these specific cases, they had to cons -- they had to relate to information concealed that could have or would have led to -- led to the uncovery of persecution. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1887">Q: Now this -- this I know is a hypothetical question because I'm not sure it ever -- it ever happened, but I'm wondering what you -- you think might happen in a case like this. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Suppose somebody was in some sense a war criminal. </sentence><sentence id="1889">They were members of these organizations which if they identified themselves as part of them, would have denied them citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1890">So let's say they did come under false pretenses, and you find this out, and you start a complaint, and what the </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1895"> person does is confess, but also talk about how they hated what they did, or they changed their what -- that they -- they're a different person. </sentence><sentence id="1896">Is there ever -- could there ever be an instance where somebody could be considered -- I don't know, do I say becomes -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1897">A: Reformed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1899">Q: -- reformed? </sentence><sentence id="1900">Would that matter, or if someone tried to become -- admitted who they were honestly, and said, but I renounce that. </sentence><sentence id="1901">They say it honestly to the people who -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1902">A: Now if it -- there's really two questions. </sentence><sentence id="1903">If someone is at -- and i -- this goes for any immigrant, there's -- there's nothing special about the Nazi cases in this. </sentence><sentence id="1904">If someone admits to an activity or an affiliation that would make that person ineligible to enter the United States, and if it was a long time ago, or if the person could convince the -- the consular official that he or she did in fact renounce that, there's obviously discretion. </sentence><sentence id="1905">There's -- there's dis -- there's discretion to permit, to give a visa anyway, the -- each official has discretion. </sentence><sentence id="1906">Now, if the person lied and got in on the basis of concealing the information, the theory as I understand it, and it's probably best to ask the attorneys when you do interview them, the theory as I understand it is that because you lied, in theory if we prove that you lied, your status goes back to where you were before you obtained the visa, which is as an alien about which we can then determine whether you are eligible to enter the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1907">Now, the burden of proof is on the government once you're here. </sentence><sentence id="1908">In other words, the OSI always had the burden of proof in its cases against individuals who are here. </sentence><sentence id="1909">But if you're an alien seeking entry into the United States, the burden of proof that you're eligible is upon the alien. </sentence><sentence id="1910">So the alien must convince and demonstrate to the immigration official, and to the consular official, that he is a person, or she is a person eligible to enter the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1911">We've never had to my knowledge, and I can -- I've never had a case that I worked on where individuals -- I should maybe strike that, there was one individual who </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1922"> confessed and said that he was sorry, but I couldn't be sure that he wasn't just saying that because now he was caught, and that this was an effort to sort of get some mitigating circumstance. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I've never had a situation here in the United States where we ran into an individual who was torn up about what he had done because of what it was that he had done -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1924">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1925">A: -- not because of the situation he found himself vis-a-vis the immigration authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1926">May have played a role, but we have not had people actually come in without us finding them to confess and say that they wish they hadn't done it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1929">Q: Is -- was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1930">A: So it's hard to separate -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1931">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1933">A: -- the confession from the circumstance in which the defendant or subject finds himself. </sentence><sentence id="1934">Been through some rocky times, and there have been some instances where the families of defendants had no idea, had no clue what the father had done, or had been during the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And this is certainly a hard thing for the families to suddenly have to deal with this, and they deal with it -- and they've dealt with it, at least as far as I've seen, in very different -- in different ways, from outright aggression against the government to really despair over who they are and where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="1936">But no, we've never had a situation where we could be sure -- where I could be sure, I can only speak for myself, that the remorse was unconnected to the situation of having been caught in the lie. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1941">Q: I hadn't thought about the families, now that you mention it. </sentence><sentence id="1942">In most cases, would you say that the families resent the government and are angry at the government and don't believe the government? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1945">A: In some cases. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1947">Q: Some cases. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1949">A: I-I think it varies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1951">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1953">A: I think it varies. </sentence><sentence id="1954">What -- what I was saying was that in some cases the children and -- and possibly even the spouse, particularly if the subject met the spouse after the war, or met her here in the United States, they have no clue that subject X -- that husband and father X was a concentration camp guard, or was a shooter in a -- in a police squad in the east. </sentence><sentence id="1955">And it's got to be shocking information if you had no idea before that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1959">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1961">A: There are some cases where the spouse at least knows, or suspects, and perhaps there are some cases where the children know to a c -- to a certain degree, but I have seen cases where they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And that this was a complete surprise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1965">Q: And th -- and you've seen cases where the -- the children or the spouse had to separate out themselves from the father, that -- that this was so awful that they couldn't -- or were they always filled with ambivalence because -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1966">A: That -- that's pretty hard to determine -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1967">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1969">A: -- because the only time that we -- we the historians, at any rate, saw the families, if at all, was at the pre -- in -- pre-filing interview, if there was one. </sentence><sentence id="1970">At the post-filing deposition, where the testimony of the defendant is -- is obtained on the record, or sometimes at trial, but sometimes not. </sentence><sentence id="1971">So often we -- if -- if a spouse or a son, wa -- who would now be grown, was -- was present, we'd sometimes see the reaction of the spouse or the son to what they were hearing. </sentence><sentence id="1972">And sometimes it was -- seemed apparent, or sometimes it seemed likely that they were hearing this for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="1973">But it's hard to know what would happen, at least in my ey -- since I didn't follow the families in many of the -- these cases, it's hard to know what their ultimate -- what the ultimate affect of this case was on the family life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1979">Q: In most of the cases, if not all of the cases that you were a part of, since people were here in this country for a number of years before you made a complaint against them, were most of them living honest, upright lives? </sentence><sentence id="1980">Not members of racist groups, or neo-Nazi groups, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1981">A: Most of them were living fairly ordinary middle class, or lower middle class lives. </sentence><sentence id="1982">There were a few that had made it quite well, and there were a few that were sort of on the margins. </sentence><sentence id="1983">But with rare exceptions, they were not, as such, lawbreakers, in the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1984">Q: And -- and did you -- do you folks working at OSI sort of have little question marks in your head? </sentence><sentence id="1985">I mean, what does this -- what does this mean about that particular era? </sentence><sentence id="1986">These people come and they radically -- they become -- I don't want to say normal citizens, cause I don't know what in heaven's name that really means, but they're not criminals any more. </sentence><sentence id="1987">And they live a life that is not a bad life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1992">A: Well, that -- that's an interesting question. </sentence><sentence id="1993">The way I look at it is -- is another way, in that it's important for all of us, I think, as ordinary, if that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1994">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1995">A: -- is a meaningful word, as ordinary citizens of a society, that there be at least the potential, if we do something like what was done during the second World War, regardless of the circumstances in which the individual found himself, whether he was compelled to do it, or whether he did it out of his own a -- a -- as a volunteer, that there be some possibility of legal consequence for that, no matter how many years go by, in terms of that type of crime, I -- I feel - - in a recent news reports of the proceedings against the Chilean -- former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, that this -- though there are legal problems at every stage, there's serious legal problems, the idea that our world, as a world society now, is no longer prepared to sweep responsibility for crimes in an official position, where an official abuses the law and causes death and suffering to people in his care, or her care, if in the future, that -- that there shouldn't be some, somewhere down the line, the possibility of legal consequence for that. </sentence><sentence id="1996">So I'm quite comfortable with that for these particular crimes. </sentence><sentence id="1997">It doesn't mean that I'm -- I'm a believer that people can't -- that I believe that people can't be re -- rehabilitated, but I do believe that people need to take responsibility for what they've done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2002">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2004">A: Even if it's something that they were compelled to do. </sentence><sentence id="2005">I guess the ideal for me personally, would be to get to a point where each one of us has a sense that there are certain things that we're not going to do, that it -- it's better to die than to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2008">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2010">A: And there was one statement, Soviet protocol of a former Trawniki man, who made this statement, and regardless of what you might say about Soviet protocols, this clearly wasn't -- it was so unusual that it clearly wasn't canned. </sentence><sentence id="2011">The individual involved had been a Soviet soldier who was captured and was selected out of a Soviet prisoner of war camp, where he probably would have starved had he not been selected for service at Trawniki. </sentence><sentence id="2012">And he stated, after having served as a Trawniki trained guard -- and I can't remember where he served, he stated to his interrogator after the war, to his Soviet interrogator, that it would have been better for me had I died in that prison camp. </sentence><sentence id="2013">And if we are at a stage where there are things of that nature, that we as human beings will not do to other human beings, even faced with death, dictatorships are going to have a hard time carrying out mass murders. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And one element of that is at least having some potential of legal consequence for participation in that kind of crime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2021">Q: Now, I know you're not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but the other part of the question is -- and I -- y-you certainly don't even have to try to answer it if it doesn't make sense, is how do people do that kind of thing, and then become a non-criminal, and -- do you -- do you know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="2022">It's a -- it's -- it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2023">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2024">Q: -- what -- what is it about what you see in these people? </sentence><sentence id="2025">Is it just -- it's -- it's opportunistic. </sentence><sentence id="2026">I don't mean that they took the opportunity -- or some -- some well may have, to do certain things, but it's opportunistic within a certain situation. </sentence><sentence id="2027">It's not opportunistic, it's not the best way to be in another situation, so they become like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="2028">So it's -- I-I -- I don't -- I haven't actually thought about this before reading all this stuff, but it's curious to me, the sort of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2029">A: I -- is the question you're asking, how can someone who's done something like this -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2030">Q: Just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2031">A: -- just turn it all off -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2032">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2034">A: -- and become a normal citizen? </sentence><sentence id="2035">Obviously it's different -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2036">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2037">A: -- for different people, but clearly this was an extraordinary time. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And many of those who participated in it as perpetrators, as well as those who experienced it as victims, recognize that it was an extraordinary time in which things were done that you don't normally do. </sentence><sentence id="2039">Many of the perpetrators, certainly most of the perpetrators that were prosecuted by OSI were youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="2040">Teenagers, or late teens, early 20's when this process began for them. </sentence><sentence id="2041">So it was, sadly, a part of their maturing process, and it wasn't necessarily a part of their quote normal unquote behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2042">Once it was over, once there was no authority, no compuls -- no authority to encourage, or compulsion to compel to participate in those acts, for many it was not that hard to rationalize what had happened, and even to say, well from now on I'm going to be a good citizen. </sentence><sentence id="2043">From now on -- even perhaps because of this past, I'm going to be very careful about the laws in my new country. </sentence><sentence id="2044">For the perpetrators, in many ways, those who came to the new world, they were starting, particularly the young ones, they were starting as much of a new life, sadly, as the survivors, with much less right to do so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2054">Q: Yeah, right. </sentence><sentence id="2055">The tri -- trif -- Trifa case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2058">A: Trifa, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2060">Q: Go back and forth in my pronunciations. </sentence><sentence id="2061">That is a case about -- primarily about a propaganda, so what I'd like to do is see how we can contrast each of these four -- for what's sort of at the center of the accusation to get a -- a sense of the range of OSI [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2062">A: Well, I -- I -- I thought of these particular four cases, in fact three are fairly similar. </sentence><sentence id="2063">Schellong is a concentration camp guard at an officer level. </sentence><sentence id="2064">Bartesch is a concentration camp guard at -- at the grunt level. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2065">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2067">A: And Hajda is also a concentration camp guard at the grunt level in a different system. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2069">Q: That's true, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2071">A: When I chose those cases, the -- the thing they had in common, other than the fact that I was assigned to them, and they were meaningful to me because I was with each one of them, in a sense, from beginning -- well, Trifa not quite, but from beginning to end, was that each in its own way reflected a rather unique feature of advancing the role of the historian, or advancing the nature of the research that went into dev -- the development of these cases. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Schellong was the first concentration camp case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2076">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2078">A: The -- that -- the first WVHA concentration camp case -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2079">Q: Really. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2080">A: -- that we had. </sentence><sentence id="2081">We'd had -- Federenko was a Treblinka guard before that, we'd had -- I don't think we'd had another concentration camp case before that. </sentence><sentence id="2082">So the whole WVHA system, the whole concept of protective arrest, the camps in the era before the war, this was something that historically new ground had to be broken in terms of how we presented that evidence. </sentence><sentence id="2083">It was also my first case, so it was the first -- it was my learning process, and I worked together with two excellent attorneys, Joe Lynch and Janet DeCosta, who were very flexible about giving me the autonomy to do what I felt needed to be done. </sentence><sentence id="2084">It was an excellent working relationship, and I -- for me, it developed the model of the working relationship between the do -- two professions, which despite all the names and epithets we call one another, look at evidence in not always so dissimilar ways. </sentence><sentence id="2085">A-An-And certainly are capable and have in many cases, collaborated quite well in the presentation, not only of a good case, but of a fairly good historical record as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2092">Q: How would you characterize that relationship, since it became a model for you? </sentence><sentence id="2093">What -- what -- what are you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2094">A: The attorneys that I have worked with on cases, it's a very good relationship, it's based on mutual respect, it's based on a mutual understanding of what each of us -- and -- and each of us as representatives of our profession, can contribute to the development of this case, and the p- present -- an-and the successful presentation of the case before a judge. </sentence><sentence id="2095">And it's a good dynamic, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2096">It worked -- it -- it worked very, very well from the first case, the Schellong case, to the </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2100"> last case I worked on, which was the Hajda case, there were rarely -- I-I'm not -- that's not to say that there weren't arguments and -- and screaming matches from time to time which were -- were -- were a part of the workplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2102">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2104">A: But there was always a -- a mutual understanding that we needed one another -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2105">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2106">A: -- very much, in order to do what our common aim was, was to u-u-uncover the individual's responsibility for the violation and to make possible the appropriate adjudication of the case. </sentence><sentence id="2107">And that was a common goal, and despite whatever conflicts there were, there was always that return to the cooperation, and in -- in my case, I -- I have to say there were relatively fle -- few conflicts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2110">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2112">A: I mean, that it -- it was a -- a normal and healthy working relationship from -- for 20 years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2114">Q: Was the Schellong case a difficult case? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2116">A: The Schellong case was actually a fairly simple case. </sentence><sentence id="2117">It was -- it's -- it's -- I think it, if I remember correctly, Schellong was identified as being in the United States in approximately March 1980, and he was removed from the United States in "83 or "84. </sentence><sentence id="2118">That was after denaturalization, deport, and all the -- all the -- all the appeals processes in between. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Which is a relatively short time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2124">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2126">A: The trial was in the summer of 1981, it's 18 months, which isn't -- it isn't a very long time to put together a case. </sentence><sentence id="2127">So the mechanics of the case -- most of the material was in the United States, some of it was in the Federal Republic of Germany, but most of it was in the United States, easy to get ahold of, easy to have certified, easy to have translated. </sentence><sentence id="2128">What was special about the case from my perspective, was the fact that it was this learning process, of learning what was needed of me, as a historian, to make this case go. </sentence><sentence id="2129">And learning -- learning to understand the perspective of the attorneys, to understand, at least in what they would call a minimal way, how the rules of the courtroom affect the presentation of evidence, and how to reconcile, as much as possible, the historical record with the rules of evidence. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And I think where we were successful in doing that, we had not only winning cases, but cases that -- that offer something to history as well. </sentence><sentence id="2131">With Trifa, I -- I mentioned it earlier, that -- that Trifa had special aspects to his defense which required a much broader and deeper analysis of each particular segment of that case, and they were broken down essentially into the 10 segments that you -- that you had to carry around and read over the last couple of weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2139">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2141">A: With Bartesch, which we haven't talked much about -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2142">Q: Cou -- cou -- li -- before we get to Bartesch, I want to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2143">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2145">Q: -- ask you something about Schellong, because it was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2146">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2147">Q: -- interesting to me in reading the judgment about Schellong is that he was training people. </sentence><sentence id="2148">He was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2149">A: Yes, at Dachau. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2150">Q: Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="2151">And -- however, it was very clear in the judgment that there was no proof that he did anything to a prisoner, that he had anything to do -- he was not part of the commandant's staff, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2154"> and so I wonder -- suppose he had trained these people outside of Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Would that have been as much of a problem? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2156">A: If the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2157">Q: I mean -- or more -- it wouldn't create a -- a -- more of a problem in terms of making a complaint against him. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2158">A: If the purpose of the training was to train concentration camp guards, if the concentration camp guards are assisting in persecution, certainly the person who trains them is also assisting in persecution. </sentence><sentence id="2159">It s -- would have been an issue if, as a practical matter -- that's a -- that's theory, as a practical matter, if he had been training them in basic guard detail, where the guardi -- i-it could be guarding prisoners or guarding buildings at a site away from the concentration camp, that would have been a harder case to make. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2162">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2168">Q: Who ra -- I'm now trying to remember, I don't know whether you remember who raised the question of the fact that he never -- there's no evidence that he beat a prisoner, or that he was actually having much to do with prisoners at all. </sentence><sentence id="2169">Was it your side, or was it that he [indecipherable] can't remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2182">A: And that was the issue that was ultimately decided in Schellong, and that was the issue that -- that -- that form that pr -- precedent comes from Federenko that formed the precedent for the e -- every subsequent case that involved a concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2184">Q: Okay, let's go to Bartesch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2186">A: Bartesch was unique for me in that it was the one case where there was credible evidence, perhaps not beyond a reasonable doubt evidence, but certainly clear and convincing evidence that he, Martin Bartesch shot someone on whom a name could be pinned. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And it was also interesting in how that evidence came up, and how it was found. </sentence><sentence id="2188">We had a series of concentration camp cases related to Mauthausen, and th -- and this is a -- a good example of how OSI operates. </sentence><sentence id="2189">The Bruno Blach case, which I was assigned to, involved a sub-camp of Mauthausen, and that case was already under investigation as early as 1980. </sentence><sentence id="2190">In investigating that case during the mid-80's when I investigated it, I went to the National Archives, to look through each of the U.S. military trials of Mauthausen personnel, that U.S. military personnel had conducted at the site of the Dachau concentration camp, in the records of the Judge Advocate General. </sentence><sentence id="2191">Here -- at that time it was downtown here in -- well, no, I'm -- I'm sorry, at that time it    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2192"> was at Sootland, at the Sootland repository, now they're up in College Park, Maryland. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And in the process of looking through all of that stuff, Bruno Blach was never at the main camp except for one day, he was transferred right away to a sub-camp called Wiener Neudorf. </sentence><sentence id="2194">But in the process of identifying everyone whom I could, who went through the Mauthausen system, I gathered documentation from all of the Mauthausen and sub-camp trials so that I could put together an effective report eventually on how a person like Bruno Blach would come from Dachau, where he was before, via Mauthausen to Wiener Neudorf. </sentence><sentence id="2195">Among the records that I found and didn't pay too much attention to at the time was a -- oh, it must have been about a hundred, 120 page document called an unnatural death book, unnatiirliches Todesfalle. </sentence><sentence id="2196">U-Un -- c-cases of unnatural death. </sentence><sentence id="2197">Which was a log kept by the authorities of the central camp of Mauthausen of all unnatural deaths that were unplanned unnatural. </sentence><sentence id="2198">That didn't mean that they weren't planned, but it meant a -- a prisoner -- if some guards were having fun, and pushed a prisoner towards the wire, the guard shot, he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="2199">That was recorded. </sentence><sentence id="2200">I found it useful, has - - has names of guards, I copied it, but filed it because there were -- I did actually do more than file it because there were a couple of cases of shootings in Wiener Neudorf. </sentence><sentence id="2201">Not by Bruno Blach, but by others and that's evidence that if an expert witness wants to say prisoners were shot trying to escape at Wiener Neudorf, and the judge or the defense asks well, what do you base that on? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2202">What evidence? </sentence><sentence id="2203">And then you have this log. </sentence><sentence id="2204">Here so and so was shot on such and such a day, and by the way by this ga -- by this particular guard. </sentence><sentence id="2205">Not Bruno Blach, but we have records of this. </sentence><sentence id="2206">Now as it turned out, during that search I also found a Nuremberg document, 2176 PS, which was a collection of records that Mauthausen camp prisoners secured from destruction after the war, upon liberation, and turned over to the U.S. army investigator investigating crimes at Mauthausen from the day that the camp was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2207">He was a major named Eugene Cohen, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2208"> who we actually found after the war and talked to after the war, although this case never went to trial, and so he -- therefore he was not a witness. </sentence><sentence id="2209">But among these records were a series of rosters of Mauthausen guards, both at the main camp and at some of the sub-camps. </sentence><sentence id="2210">And those rosters contained birthdates and ranks, and even last known addresses, what address that they had before they came to Mauthausen, before they entered German service. </sentence><sentence id="2211">And so -- a-and again in -- in accordance with standard operating procedure at OSI we turned these over to the research and development department, and they ran them through the INS. </sentence><sentence id="2212">And Martin Bartesch came up along with three others as a hit. </sentence><sentence id="2213">And we then, in going back -- I had the Mauthausen cases originally, in the mid-80's. </sentence><sentence id="2214">In going back through the documentation, I came back to this book of unnatural cases of death, and started reading each of the entries. </sentence><sentence id="2215">And sure enough, Bartesch, Martin was assigned as a guard who shot a French Jewish teenager on such and such a date, I think it was October 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2216">Bartesch himself was a teenager at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2217">Bartesch was born, I believe in October 1926. </sentence><sentence id="2218">I think it was October of "26, and so he was not quite 17, or just turned 17 when he shot a teenager, who I believe was 15 or 16 or 17, about the same age. </sentence><sentence id="2219">And we also found another one of the cases, another one of the subjects who had come up on the roster was also on the list as having shot another French Jew at around the same time. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And in that other case, which was the case of Stefan Riley, that individual actually confessed to having shot at a person whose name he didn't know, when confronted with that information. </sentence><sentence id="2221">Both cases never went to trial because both individuals I believe -- Bartesch before -- Bartesch went without a lawyer, quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2222">In fact, I think it was the same lawyer who later turned up in the Hajda case. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2223">Bartesch was also from Chicago, so the fact that this guy represented Bartesch, made him known to Hajda as well, later, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2224">I don't know -- I don't know that for sure, but I do -- I do think </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2225"> Collins was also Bartesch's lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="2226">Bartesch pled -- refused to talk to us, as was his right as a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="2227">And was protected from doing so by his attorney, and fled to Austria before -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2228">Q: Before the denaturalization? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2229">A: -- I think even bef -- it's conceivable that it was even before we filed, but it might have been after we filed, just don't remember any more. </sentence><sentence id="2230">But he did flee to Austria, and I believe he was denaturalized after -- yes, he was a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="2231">I believe he was denaturalized after his departure. </sentence><sentence id="2232">Riley, who was the other concentration camp guard, both each at different sub-camps, I believe - - no, they both shot at Mauthausen, but they each went to different sub-camps later. </sentence><sentence id="2233">Riley went to Bavaria, where he was, as I understand it, briefly investigated by the Bavarian authorities. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2239">Q: And Bartesch? </sentence><sentence id="2240">What happened to him there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2243">A: Bartesch, I don't -- I think the Austrians -- I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="2244">I think the Austrians did a pro forma, opened a pro forma case, but Bartesch died shortly after, even though he was still a relatively young man. </sentence><sentence id="2245">Riley, I -- I -- is presumably dead by now, but at the last I heard he was still alive, which would be late 80's. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2249">Q: And the Hajda case is an interesting -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2250">A: The Hajda case was significant for me for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2251">Three reasons, really. </sentence><sentence id="2252">It was the first case that I as a historian with the attorney, the partner this time was someone I -- one of my very best and closest friends in the off -- in the OSI, Ned Stuttman. </sentence><sentence id="2253">This was the first case that we had actually gone to trial with using primarily evidence that came as a result of the collapse of the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2254">This case was built, not exclusively, but at least three-quarters -- 75 percent of the evidence was evidence that was taken from witnesses, or found in documentation that had been held behind the Iron Curtain since 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2255">And it also represented our first, as an office, our first extensive use of post-war Soviet </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2262"> protocols, of witness interrogations, where we no longer had the witness alive to be cross- examined. </sentence><sentence id="2263">And we used them very, very carefully in that we didn't accept them all at face value. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2264">We were up front about our doubts about the conditions under which this testimony was taken. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2265">We were also up front about the possibility that Soviet investigators at that time had specific information that was going into that protocol whether the witness said it or not. </sentence><sentence id="2266">But we used them where the evidence contained in them was consistent with documentation, whether it was testimony given in the west, or captured German documentation, either captured by the western powers or by the Soviets, where the information was consistent, we could regard this evidence in the protocols as cooperative evidence. </sentence><sentence id="2267">In other words, it didn't stand alone, but just because it was protocols taken, quite frankly, by Soviet intelligence agents, didn't mean necessarily that we as investigators could, a priori say this is all phony, this is all fake. </sentence><sentence id="2268">We had to look at that evidence the way any historian -- and here in a sense the lawyers went the way of the historians, the way any historian looks at any evidence, with no a priori preconceptions, a priori suspicions but testing those elements of the testimony that made good historical sense, and being aware of those elements of the testimony which one should rightfully have doubts about. </sentence><sentence id="2269">And I can give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="2270">There were statements of former Treblinka guards, who identified Hajda, and there was a whole issue, as you probably saw, about the spelling of Hajda, because the Polish -- the s -- the -- the sound of Hajda, there's no H in Russian, and the interrogations were always in Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2271">There's no H. The Russians replace H with the Cyrillic equivalent of the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2272">Q: G. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2273">A: -- the English, or the Roman G, and so it was always Gajda, and there were any variation of Gajda, it could be G-a-i-d-a. It could be G-a-y-d-a, it could be G-a-y apostrophe d-a. And there was any number of variations of that. </sentence><sentence id="2274">And then of course there were the obvio -- the -- the misspellings, and the mistranslations, and the -- the misspellings in the translation. </sentence><sentence id="2275">But there were certain testimonies that identified Hajda as a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="2276">Now the Russians -- the Soviets didn't have Hajda. </sentence><sentence id="2277">Hajda was in the United States, they didn't have him. </sentence><sentence id="2278">He was only of interest to them in that he was a name, another identification. </sentence><sentence id="2279">There's no evidence that they even knew that he was in the United States, although the Soviets knew about many of the emigres who were in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2280">There was no interest because he was Polish, and because Poland was also a Communist country, that the Soviets were interested in extraditing him. </sentence><sentence id="2281">But there were some witnesses who testified that Hajda was a Pole, even though most of the rest of the people -- a Pole was an anomaly among the Trawniki men. </sentence><sentence id="2282">There were very small Polish recruiting drives, and there were only two of them who ever served at Treblinka one, two Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2283">And not every witness said Hajda was a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="2284">If every witness had said Hajda was a Pole, then one would have been suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="2285">If every witness had gotten the first name right, one would be suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="2286">But some of them got the first name, some didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2287">Some got the wrong first name. </sentence><sentence id="2288">Some didn't remember a first name at all, they just remembered a g -- a Hajda who was a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="2289">And ina group of a hundred guards, that is more credible. </sentence><sentence id="2290">On the other hand, you would get testimonies where the Soviet interrogator was clearly asking to identify what people were involved in the massacre of the surviving Jewish prisoners when the camp was evacuated in July 1944. </sentence><sentence id="2291">And there you'd have a list of 40 names. </sentence><sentence id="2292">So and so -- I know so and so participated in the murder of 350 prisoners on the day that the camp was evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="2293">The next guy would -- the s -- the exact same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2294">The next guy would the exact same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2295">And then you get Hajda's name, the exact same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2296">As a historian, I tended to discount. </sentence><sentence id="2297">Didn't mean that Hajda didn't participate, but I discounted that evidence as something that Soviet interrogators were interested in getting it because of the r -- the repeated question, it was just plugging a name into this statement, that they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2298">It was the oddities, the things that were different, that could be corroborated by other evidence, and Hajda's Polish origins were corroborated by personnel documents, and his place of birth. </sentence><sentence id="2299">That could be used in these statements. </sentence><sentence id="2300">We, in prosecuting the case, never charged that Hajda personally participated in the killings. </sentence><sentence id="2301">We did charge that he was there at the time the killings happened, and we did describe, as you read, in -- in some detail, what the guards, the hundred of them, you know, there were a hundred, hundred and 10, were doing while these killings were taking place. </sentence><sentence id="2302">So the judge had the data to make a judgment that well, we don't know what Hajda was doing, but we know he was participating in some way, because guards weren't sitting around. </sentence><sentence id="2303">They were all doing one thing, either guarding the people who were guarding the perimeter of the camp while the people were being taken out to the woods in groups to be shot, guarding those who were left in the camp while the rest were being taken out to be shot, escorting groups to the camp, or actually shooting them. </sentence><sentence id="2304">It was one of those things, all the guards were involved in that because that's what they were doing on that day. </sentence><sentence id="2305">And that was based on the Soviet protocols, and the primary source documentation. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And we were able to prove that Hajda was there because of a group of documents from the successor unit of the Trawniki training camp, the Battalion Streibel. </sentence><sentence id="2307">There was a group of 20 men, all still working with the commandant of Treblinka one, who as well was evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="2308">Every one of those 20 men were on rosters at Treblinka one. </sentence><sentence id="2309">So it made no sense, it made no common sense, this was a common sense issue for Hajda not to have been there at the time of the killings, and still be on that post- evacuation roster with 20 other men who are all at the camp throughout, from 1943 through its evacuation in 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2349">Q: Now, his lawyer, Collins, if I remember correctly, was making a big deal that on the personnel [indecipherable] you don't have a fingerprint and you don't have a phot -- a </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2487">A: Almost exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2489">Q: I don't want to -- I don't want to ask this question so all I get is a yes or no answer, I'm trying to make it a little more complicated, but do you have a -- a real sense of pride in having worked with OSI, that there's a kind of service that you've done, as small as it might be given all the people who may well have been criminals, that this is an important service to m-more than the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2491">A: Yes, I do take a -- a strong professional and personal satisfaction in having worked at OSI. </sentence><sentence id="2492">I learned a lot at OSI. </sentence><sentence id="2493">I learned through, as I said when I -- at my good-bye dinner, and -- and there may have been some surprised to hear it, I said that working with the attorneys over that many years had taught me how to be a better historian. </sentence><sentence id="2494">And certainly the need to prove things from scratch had taught me how to question assumptions that we so easily take for granted, that may or may not be based on actual evidence. </sentence><sentence id="2495">And to really look at the evidence, and draw one's conclusion from the primary source evidence. </sentence><sentence id="2496">To give you an example of that, it's common knowledge -- and I put that in quotations, that the Nazis like to give their auxiliaries alcohol before sending them out on a mission. </sentence><sentence id="2497">Everybody says that, and in fact, witnesses talk about auxiliaries being drunk while they were shooting. </sentence><sentence id="2498">But, in all the hundreds of statements of Trawniki men that I read, and in all the documents of Trawniki -- relating to Trawniki trained guards, there's nothing about issuing of alcohol rations prior to an operation. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And in fact, when you think of it, it makes no sense. </sentence><sentence id="2500">You don't give men whom you're going to put rifles in their hands, and whom you may not entirely trust, alcohol to drink, for fear of nothing else that they" ll shoot each other, or they" ll shoot you instead of the people they're supposed to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="2501">But why were -- why did witne -- were witnesses wrong when they saw some of them drunk? </sentence><sentence id="2502">No, not in the cases of the Trawniki men, because of during the shooting and during deportations, the Trawniki were constantly extorting on their own whatever valuables, whether it be cash or booze that the victims had. </sentence><sentence id="2503">Sometimes it was cash and they turned it into booze, so that some of the auxiliaries did have booze, and did partake of booze prior to a operation, and that's -- so what the witnesses saw, what the survivors saw, what they perceived to have seen was not entirely inaccurate. </sentence><sentence id="2504">But the assumption that was drawn, that everybody just kind of believed, was inaccurate. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2529">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2530">Yeah, I wanted to continue i-in terms of professionally satisfying, it was professionally satisfying cause of reasons that I had discussed, in terms of learning how to become a better historian, in terms of getting access to records that might not have thought, or been able to get access to had I not been with the Justice Department. </sentence><sentence id="2531">Becoming interested in areas such as the auxiliary police, and Poland, and the Trawniki trained guards that might not have come across my radar screen as serious interests had I not been at OSI. </sentence><sentence id="2532">The a-ability to put these pieces together in -- in original formulations. </sentence><sentence id="2533">Subjects that nobody had written about because there was no public evidence available for people to construct a thesis on. </sentence><sentence id="2534">This was all professionally very satisfying as a historian, I think prepared me in many ways, broadened me in many, many ways, that made me perhaps better pra -- prepared to take over the position of the senior historian at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. </sentence><sentence id="2535">Personally, I find it very satisfying because as a federal civil servant I felt that 1 was doing a service to the American people in the sense that, having grown up in the Vietnam generation, I was contributing to a process where individuals who committed crimes during wartime, with all the excuses that one has to commit acts of atrocity during wartime, were being called to account, despite the fact that they were small fry. </sentence><sentence id="2536">Despite the fact that in some cases they were compelled to be in the positions where they eventually committed their crimes. </sentence><sentence id="2537">Despite the fact that decades and decades had passed, and that there was some reason for them to feel that this would never come back to haunt them. </sentence><sentence id="2538">That this was a process, a judicial process, a fair process by which people who had committed crimes could be called to account. </sentence><sentence id="2539">And if there is a potential for that in the future, conceivably the perpetrators of the future might stop to think twice before perpetrating crimes along the lines of these crimes that were perpetrated during the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="2540">And if that potential of legal consequence even works to prevent one killing, I feel that it would be worth that effort, both for the future in terms of prevention, and in terms of bringing closure to the past. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2562">A: -- the severity of that as a punishment. </sentence><sentence id="2563">Clearly, deportation -- denaturalization and deportation is -- is symbolic in comparison to a prison sentence, but it's certainly much more effective that simply deciding well, too many years have passed -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2564">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2565">A: -- we shouldn't go back to these things. </sentence><sentence id="2566">I feel, in a sense, that a certain degree of justice has been done, not only to the victims of these perpetrators, but also in the process of immigration as an American , these people, by posing as displaced persons took a slot that might have gone to a person who was really in need, who was not fleeing prosecution, as opposed to persecution -- or who was fleeing prosecution, excuse me, rather than persecution. </sentence><sentence id="2567">And that this is something that if we are going to have the immigration laws that we do, that we shouldn't make an exception, a lenient exception for Nazi offenders. </sentence><sentence id="2568">There are some of these people who were real small fries, and | -- I can't say that I feel glee that their lives in America are destroyed by the processes that we institute against them. </sentence><sentence id="2569">And frankly for their families, particularly the families that knew nothing about what the defendant had done, this is -- this can be really tragic. </sentence><sentence id="2570">On the other hand, I go back to the people -- if people are going to kill in a wartime situation, and they're going to lull illegally, at some point it's very important for all of us who survive those things, and who might have to undergo them in the future, that we know that that won't ever go away, that there will be some consequence for that action during the second World War, that there will some consequence for those who commit crimes during the Yugoslav civil war, that there will be some consequence for those who committed crimes in Rwanda. </sentence><sentence id="2571">If that becomes a habit of political behavior, if that becomes a habit of judicial behavior in the 21" century, and prospects seem better than ever before, and if the proc -- if OSI's success for 20 years, and for my colleagues who are still there, I hope another 10, this will be a wonderful service that we've done for the United States and for the world at large. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2603">Q: Right, right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2605">A: And it's -- Lieutenant Calley is clearly a reflection of how difficult it is for a nation to police itself while it's in the heat of the fray. </sentence><sentence id="2606">It's one thing to start to police oneself 40 years after the events, when the people who are responsible are no longer in power, and maybe no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="2607">But it's quite another to stop the process while it is happening. </sentence><sentence id="2608">That being said, the fact that Calley was tried at all under those circumstances is also a significant event. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2613">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2614">So let's talk about truth, justice -- truth and justice. </sentence><sentence id="2615">Or truth -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2616">A: Slash justice. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2617">Q: Slash justice, or dash justice, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2618">Or -- when you think back about the Nuremberg trials, and the subsequent Nuremberg trials, the Dachau trials and all of the national trials that happened, and then you think about the numbers of people who committed crimes, most of whom were not indicted, but even the thousands who were indicted were never put to trial </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2621"> because there was not enough evidence even if you were convinced that they were truly guilty. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2622">What does this mean about what justice does to the truth of the nature of war crimes, and the nature of war criminals and the ability to actually convict -- have a legal process against them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2623">A: 1 -- I -- I think that efforts to represent a judicial process as a history of the events that are relevant to the crime is a mistake, although it's one commonly made. </sentence><sentence id="2624">I certainly came to OSI, or the SLU at that time with the excitement of being able to write history and convey history to a broader public, to historians, but also to a broader public through the legal process, and I've come to realize that a legal proceeding is just that, it has a specific purpose, and that is to ascertain a violation or a crime, a civil case violation and criminal case a crime, to ascertain a defendant, to assign or determine what the responsibility of the defendant is, and to determine an appropriate punishment for the crime. </sentence><sentence id="2625">I think as a result of that, or at least as a result of an investigation, a part of the historical record, whether it's through witness testimony, perpetrator or survivor, or through documentation that otherwise would not have been uncovered, or would not have been uncovered as quickly, can push forward a broader but different process of trying to understand and analyze what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2626">I think a trial deals with an individual, or in rare cases a small group of individuals, to determine their responsibility for very specific events, and to understand a broader historical process requires a different process. </sentence><sentence id="2627">And to expect the justice system to fulfill that latter purpose, to understand why things happened on a deeper level, those who expect that are going to be disappointed by the judicial process because they" re putting too much on it, that this is a subject of a broader and more intensive inquiry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2633">Q: But suppose I would say to you, most of the guilty never get tried, for-forgetting maybe in most crimes, but in this particular kind of crime, in war crimes, they don't get tried. </sentence><sentence id="2634">So ho-how well can it function? </sentence><sentence id="2635">What does it -- what does it really do? </sentence><sentence id="2636">Does it really issue fear in the next </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2660">Q: And hence, are you in favor of an international criminal court, rather than having sp-sp-Spain and England saying, we're going to -- your -- your -- we're going to extradite you, whoever you are, whether it's Pinochet or it's somebody else, that it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2661">A: It -- it would be great if there were an international criminal court that could review all of these cases. </sentence><sentence id="2662">I think when that fails, one should use the systems that one has in process. </sentence><sentence id="2663">It would have been great if the United States could have tried these criminals as criminals -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2667">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2669">A: -- under criminal proceedings. </sentence><sentence id="2670">But the chances, because of the way our Constitution is written, because of Constitutional precedent, because of real concerns about expos facto prosecutions, about jurisdiction, the chances that a criminal trial of these individuals could have taken place in the United States may have ended up as an excuse for doing nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2671">What was there was immigration legislation, and a -- a -- a legal response to violations of immigration legislation that did ultimately provide a framework in which perpetrators of Nazi offenses could be uncovered, tried in a process that allowed for extensive appeals, a-available to any immigrant and could ultimately have a process where they would be removed from the United States because as Nazi offenders, they were ineligible to enter at the time they entered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2675">Q: Wou -- would you if you -- if you could advocate, would you advocate that the United States sign the international tribunal agreement that other countries have signed? </sentence><sentence id="2676">Would you think that that was -- or are you not sure? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2679">A: I'm not -- I -- I would prefer to have an international criminal tribunal. </sentence><sentence id="2680">I'm not sure at this point that such a one would be any freer of the international and political pressures that a national tribunal is subject to. </sentence><sentence id="2681">And I'm not certain as well that the precedents are strong enough yet for an international criminal tribunal to really have teeth, the way a national tribunal -- Pinochet will probably -- if he is ever punished, will probably receive perhaps a more appropriate punishment in Chile, more than anywhere else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2685">Q: Well, but one is not in conflict with the other because if the country wishes to prosecute someone like they're doing in Chile, then the international court would not come into play. </sentence><sentence id="2686">Isn't -- isn't the idea if the national country is will to do it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2687">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2695">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2697">A: The Spaniards -- if you interpret that law, i-if you interpret that yo-you -- that murder against one citizen, that a country has a right to protect its own citizens -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2698">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2699">A: -- that a nation can try someone, even the head of a foreign state that kills its citizens illegally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2701">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2703">A: And in a sense the Spaniards used what was existing legislation. </sentence><sentence id="2704">Never been tried before, but it was existing criminal legislation to make an extradition request that set off a chain of events that ultimately, without an international court, has led to an investigation in Chile that might -- might end in an indictment. </sentence><sentence id="2705">And even if Pinochet isn't punished, in my mind the fact that there is such an investigation for these events, a generation later, is an important thing. </sentence><sentence id="2706">It wouldn't have happened a generation ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2807">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2808">But you know it better than I do, that the world we live in now is probably going to be very easy to declare that's a civil war, that's a civil war, that's a civil war. </sentence><sentence id="2809">This is not like Kuwait, this is not like Germany marching into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2810">I want to say Austria. </sentence><sentence id="2811">S -- and so consequently, the murkiness gets built into a decision not to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2812">It helps -- it -- it helps to say it's murky, when if you actually look at the situation, why shouldn't one go into certain so-called civil wars? </sentence><sentence id="2813">Do you know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="2814">I think if -- I think that the term is used as an -- as an excuse not to do something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2823">A: I-I don't think that Nuremberg, that the Nuremberg trials really provides much of a precedent of what to do with a nation that is breaking up. </sentence><sentence id="2824">The nur -- the international military tribunal was established to deal with a nation that planned and conceived and waged an aggressive war -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2825">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2826">A: -- against other nations. </sentence><sentence id="2827">You've really got to look at this as -- as a progression. </sentence><sentence id="2828">Prior to World War II there was no international apparatus to deal with that. </sentence><sentence id="2829">After World War IL, with -- with all its ineffectiveness, we do now have a United Nations which is going to respond when one country attacks another. </sentence><sentence id="2830">Now, the next step is what do when a country disintegrates, or when one minority in a country starts butchering another minority in a country. </sentence><sentence id="2831">That's something that perhaps the development of an international court, and the devel -- certainly the development of more cohesive international reaction. </sentence><sentence id="2832">Certainly the development of a quicker response in terms of providing shelter for refugees, which is something we ought to have learned from the last world war. </sentence><sentence id="2833">That all of these initiatives are going to have to come into play in the future. </sentence><sentence id="2834">Whether we'll be able to prevent all killings, we as human beings, I'm not talking about we as the United States, but we as citizens of the world, will be able to prevent killings is something no one's going to be able to guarantee. </sentence><sentence id="2835">But to work towards mitigating killings, to work towards providing sanctuary -- speedy sanctuary for people who might be the victims of killings, and that -- that is something that we certainly could have done more quickly in Rwanda at least, and quite probably in Yugoslavia as well. </sentence><sentence id="2836">But there -- each situation is different, and we, as citizens of the world again, not just we the United States, or we the west, we as citizens of the world are going to have to work towards strategies for dealing with internal disturbances, internal civil wars, internal persecution, in a way that is effective. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2849">Q: I mean, when you mentioned Rwanda, that becomes even more complicated. </sentence><sentence id="2850">It's not just that there was a genocide in the country, then the genocidiers leave and go to the Congo and become </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2851">A: And spilled into another country. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2852">Q: -- helped by Novato, and then Rwanda supports Cabilla going in and then bi -- Cabilla becomes who he is. </sentence><sentence id="2853">And now you have incursions back and forth, so it's no longer a so-called civil war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
