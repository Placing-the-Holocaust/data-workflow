<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4098">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4100">Q: ... in some significant way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4102">A: There were four children. </sentence><sentence id="4103">Two boys and two girls. </sentence><sentence id="4104">Unfortunately, we lost one son. </sentence><sentence id="4105">He was wonderful boy, he was only 20 years old. </sentence><sentence id="4106">And he was a wonderful student at the University of Pennsylvania. </sentence><sentence id="4107">Went to Wharton School and was a year ahead in school. </sentence><sentence id="4108">He went to Arizona. </sentence><sentence id="4109">Eleanor has a sister, a married sister in Phoenix, Arizona. </sentence><sentence id="4110">And from there he went up -- Eleanor's sister's son was planning to enroll at the University in Colorado. </sentence><sentence id="4111">So instead of his parents staying, they asked Jim to take him. </sentence><sentence id="4112">This was in August, you know, "76. </sentence><sentence id="4113">That would be 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="4114">In August "76. </sentence><sentence id="4115">He would call us every other night, saying we had a good time, this and that. </sentence><sentence id="4116">And his cousin would call his parents every other night, so we always knew where they were. </sentence><sentence id="4117">He called us on a Friday night, we're having dinner, and he says, you know, he had such an experience. </sentence><sentence id="4118">He met some old guy and told him certain stories. </sentence><sentence id="4119">He was a very lovely personality, very great, great person. </sentence><sentence id="4120">He called us he is coming on Sunday and what plane -- told us what plane, flight number, and we are supposed to pick him up. </sentence><sentence id="4121">Saturday late afternoon around 4 o'clock, we had a call. </sentence><sentence id="4122">Jimmy drowned. </sentence><sentence id="4123">What happened is -- it's ironic. </sentence><sentence id="4124">He was on the swimming team at the University of Pennsylvania, and a very accomplished swimmer. </sentence><sentence id="4125">He didn't do anything wrong, but there was next to the University a few miles away, they had bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="4126">It was a hot day. </sentence><sentence id="4127">There were many kids there, University students. </sentence><sentence id="4128">It's a reservoir, but it had some -- it had three coves for swimmers. </sentence><sentence id="4129">On the waterway, they permitted boats, people were skiing, so one boat came into the cove where Jim was swimming. </sentence><sentence id="4130">And when he saw the boat coming in, he took a dive and waited for the boat to go away. </sentence><sentence id="4131">Because the boat came in very fast, and all of a sudden and made a curve into it. </sentence><sentence id="4132">So when he came up, the skier hit him in the head, and the skier said she didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="4133">She didn't think, she didn't see anybody. </sentence><sentence id="4134">Then she said what she thought was a ball or a dog or something. </sentence><sentence id="4135">The boat didn't even stop. </sentence><sentence id="4136">His cousin was watching while this was happening, and -- but he was talking to some friend or girl there. </sentence><sentence id="4137">They didn't yell to stop the boat, and Jim never came up. </sentence><sentence id="4138">It took several days to find him. </sentence><sentence id="4139">So it seems that -- that was devastating especially to Eleanor. </sentence><sentence id="4140">To me, too, but she couldn't -- she still can't take it. </sentence><sentence id="4141">Why? </sentence><sentence id="4142">You always ask why did it happen to him? </sentence><sentence id="4143">You know, why me?There's no answer to it. </sentence><sentence id="4144">You search for an answer, but there's no answer to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4318">Q: When did you start talking in detail and why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4320">A: [had -- almost had a guilt feeling not to talk about it, you know, and even my children, I talked -- I remember talking to them and Eleanor would elaborate maybe to them. </sentence><sentence id="4321">Because I remember our older son was six years old, he wanted a certain bicycle that his friend had, our neighbor, his friend. </sentence><sentence id="4322">And Eleanor and I took him on a Saturday morning to buy a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="4323">And he showed us which one, then he saw made in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4324">He said, "Dad, I don't want you to buy this bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="4325">It's made in Germany." </sentence><sentence id="4326">So he already -- he was six or seven -- if he knew it, the other siblings knew it, too. </sentence><sentence id="4327">And I was telling them. </sentence><sentence id="4328">When I went back to Poland only about seven, eight years ago, I told them about it. </sentence><sentence id="4329">I took our son along and one of my nephews. </sentence><sentence id="4330">Maurice, my brother's, Maurice's son, two cousins. </sentence><sentence id="4331">We all went for the first march of the women, you know, from Auschwitz to Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="4332">I couldn't believe what they did to us, but I consider myself a very responsible individual. </sentence><sentence id="4333">And I look out for the underdog and I pray for a better world. </sentence><sentence id="4334">And never again, it should never happen again to any nation or to any people, wherever they live, whoever they are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
