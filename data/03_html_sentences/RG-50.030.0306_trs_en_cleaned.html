<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: How long were you in Paris? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Only 48 hours I think--72 hours. </sentence><sentence id="127">Because we--they-- didn't want to have Jewish refugees in Paris, and so they evacuated and we went with other Belgian non-Jews into-- we ended up after a long ordeal on the train and buses in central France, in the Ardeche. </sentence><sentence id="128">It's a small state, a small department, which the capital had about 4,000 inhabitants and we ended up in a hamlet where we stayed for three months over the summer. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was a farm, I became a farm boy. </sentence><sentence id="130">As a matter of fact, I keep in touch with the farmer I met. </sentence><sentence id="131">I have been several times to this hamlet 50 years later. </sentence><sentence id="132">He's still alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: How did you get the information about this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: I don't know, the rumor mills were just incredible. </sentence><sentence id="459">And everybody always--we used to have these code words like, we had a--we knew that, one or two things we knew is--one of my, as I mentioned to you, the oldest sister of my mother and her husband, their girl--daughter and their granddaughter had been near the Pyrenees in a camp and they were repatriated. </sentence><sentence id="460">We also knew that another sister of my mother, who also never came, went to Auschwitz and was--never came back. </sentence><sentence id="461">The third had been sent to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="462">That's all we knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: How did you know this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: Because the daughter, because the daughter of the oldest sister of my mother, she managed to get--to smuggle out with her daughter, to get from Belgium to the occupied area and from the occupied area to the non-occupied and because of that cousin of mine, Michael, who was in the army, everybody knew, had followed him. </sentence><sentence id="471">Because they went to Theonville and then they went to Nevers and then they knew that they were in Montpellier and she showed up one day in Montpellier--she had smuggled out. </sentence><sentence id="472">And then she told us that her parents had been told to report to Moulins. </sentence><sentence id="473">That's the way it was and they disappeared and the same thing the other sister, that she disappeared and then the brother of my mother, the younger brother of my mother also was reported to go to Moulins and we knew that the son of one of my--had also reported, and then one of the other sons, who is still now in Belgium, he jumped off the train--from the train--and came back to Belgium and told that woman, that daughter, and then she subsequently was deported from Lyon. </sentence><sentence id="474">So that's how we knew what happened to our family in Belgium, and we all knew that they were sent from Moulins to various places in Poland, so that's how we--but also the, there were some people in Montpellier that my father was in touch with, Jews, and not the French. </sentence><sentence id="475">The French Jews kept apart. </sentence><sentence id="476">They thought they were not going to be touched; it was only the foreign Jews. </sentence><sentence id="477">But the foreign community in Montpellier knew about it and the rumor mill went and you see when we had my cousin Hela, the one that came from Belgium, and she told us about all these people who had been deported. </sentence><sentence id="478">They always said they had to go to Moulins and from Moulins they were sent away and we also knew about that boy, my cousin, who was my age, just a little younger, that he had been--he jumped from a train when he was, and he came back to Belgium, where he hid. </sentence><sentence id="479">We had another cousin who's husband--who had just been married just before the war--who's husband had been again sent to Poland, so we knew about those things, but we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="480">I mean, we all had this picture of Dachau and Buchenwald, which we knew from before the war. </sentence><sentence id="481">The horrible things happened, the people starved to death, you know and they're worked, and also two of my cousins had been in work camps and again the one that jumped from the train told us about it, so we knew about it, but I can't precisely know how it happens. </sentence><sentence id="482">And then we saw Agde, and Agde was a horrible camp and we knew also that the majority of the people who had been sent to Rivesaltes had been deported to Poland, too. </sentence><sentence id="483">Again, the rumor mill knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="484">It's funny thing is--because I didn't hear from Rivesaltes after that and then I had a book here about the camps in France and they say the result is the major source of deportees of the zone libre"*--non-occupied. </sentence><sentence id="485">All right? </sentence><sentence id="486">And we go on and then when we got in in July of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="487">My father and I were again summoned to go to Agde, to Agde, to the camp, not the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence id="488">I--but when I got the summons, I also had heard about--I was being, I was working. </sentence><sentence id="489">I had already registered with the mandatory rule group from-- as students. </sentence><sentence id="490">I was registered in high school. </sentence><sentence id="491">Actually I had, I successfully got my baccalaureate from there, which was a miracle, and so I had actually applied even to pre-medical school, was refused. </sentence><sentence id="492">I had that certificate that I was turned away because of--I didn't meet the quota of Israelites. </sentence><sentence id="493">And so I'd registered with all the students for mandatory work in France. </sentence><sentence id="494">I was working at that time near Montpellier, in a big communal garden, together with Indo-Chinese. </sentence><sentence id="495">It was the Indo-Chinese former soldiers that they had. </sentence><sentence id="496">It was called the camp of Nam Phong for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="497">Nam Phong: the five--I think Nam Phong means "the five provinces." </sentence><sentence id="498">And I was there, working there, and fortunately I had registered with that so that I went to--when I came to Agde, I also managed to get some kind of a certificate from my father--a medical certificate that he was ill, so when they couldn't get me, the young guy, because I was, I was, they couldn't supersede the ruler, the government's rule of service. </sentence><sentence id="499">They let me go, so I didn't go to Agde, I went to Agde the second time, but they let me go and since they couldn't get me. </sentence><sentence id="500">They let my father go, too. </sentence><sentence id="501">But Agde then had just been a sort of a holding camp to send to Rivesaltes out again. </sentence><sentence id="502">And so I went back and I went to the mountains with my group. </sentence><sentence id="503">Did a stupid thing because I went without the pass, and when I was there working in the farm in the mountains, all the French boys gradually gave up because it was too tough, but I stayed there, so the farmer liked me. </sentence><sentence id="504">And I continued and then I got the letter from my family that they were in hiding because they had heard about--no-- they've come to be notified that we have to report and that's when the father said he wasn't going and he hid on the other side of the city. </sentence><sentence id="505">They all went to one room claiming that it was a woman who was renting out rooms for people who had patients in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="506">It was near a hospital, Saint Eloi, and so they were hiding there, and I got a letter in the mountains that they were hiding because they were living there near the hospital because they were going to send them to where they send my Aunt Dora, which was the one that was sent to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="507">And so I came back, stupidly, because I came without the--I didn't have a pass. </sentence><sentence id="508">I had to have a--I wasn't with my group any more and I needed to have a pass, but I managed to get out of the station where I noticed that 4 Free zone (French). </sentence><sentence id="509">there was a group of the black-shirted militia checking everybody on the train, and I had no pass, but there was a strange thing that the farmer had given me a chicken, a scrawny chicken, and you know, we didn't have food and I was bringing a chicken. </sentence><sentence id="510">There was a law at that time; France had still internal customs called an octroi! </sentence><sentence id="511">&gt;, and suddenly I said, "Well, I have to get that chicken through the octroi," and so I went to another exit where there was no black guards and that's how I got out of the station. </sentence><sentence id="512">I didn't realize at that time that that chicken saved my life and as I came out, I noticed a friend of mine, by the name of Jack--Jean-- Ginsburg from Belgium and I said, "Do you know, by any chance, where my family is?" </sentence><sentence id="513">He says, "Yes, I know, because I helped them move." </sentence><sentence id="514">He was sort of--at that time he was dating my sister so he knew and he was a boy that I went to school with in Antwerp, Jean Ginsburg. </sentence><sentence id="515">And so he showed me where my family was and that's when I had this big idea, I said, "Oh, we can't be crowded like that," my parents said, "But you know there are seals on our house, we can't go back." </sentence><sentence id="516">I said, "Well, I know--I have, I know where the key is of one of the farms where I lived, I worked, and why don't we take my two sisters and myself?" </sentence><sentence id="517">and we walked to the other side of the city, about eight kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="518">I took my bicycle and we walked and so I crossed the city, crossed the cemetery and ended up--but I forgot to tell--there's a bridge again, the octroi, the internal customs and there was a militia man standing there and stopping us and saying, "I have orders to round up all the foreign people," and asked us, "Are you Jewish?" " </sentence><sentence id="519">Yes." " </sentence><sentence id="520">So I have to round you up." </sentence><sentence id="521">I have no--I think the Belgian people don't have to be--and I had only a--my ID was an ID from school; it says I was born in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="522">It didn't say any nationality, but I had an older sister who was born in Holland and he didn't know the tules, so he took us in and we found out that that was the big round-up of Jews, French and foreign, that day. </sentence><sentence id="523">That was the 26th of August, 1942, where the majority of the Jews of the free zone had been rounded up by the French and all deported. </sentence><sentence id="524">And we came there and we found the police station was full of people and he came, it was after midnight, he says, "Oh, I've got one more of them," and that's when the person asked me, "Where..."-- the policeman-- "Where do they live?" </sentence><sentence id="525">He says "That's why I caught them. </sentence><sentence id="526">I checked. </sentence><sentence id="527">They lived where they were caught, at the bridge," and he said he would be willing to go to my house and check and I said, "Don't," because I knew that the seals were there. </sentence><sentence id="528">He took us there and that's when we had this man sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="529">There was a commission sitting there, three people. </sentence><sentence id="530">One obviously was a German. </sentence><sentence id="531">I don't--the reason why I think he was German is because he used a strange word for our ID items. </sentence><sentence id="532">The French used the word " coordonnee!(r)," the Germans used the word "Personalien."!" </sentence><sentence id="533">and he used the word "Personalien," you know. </sentence><sentence id="534">He says, "Take that person out and let him go." </sentence><sentence id="535">And he asked me, "What is your confession?" </sentence><sentence id="536">I said, "What's a confession?" </sentence><sentence id="537">He says, "Your religion." </sentence><sentence id="538">I had a moment of hesitation and I said, "Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="539">He had a moment of hesitation, he says, "Well, since they live there, we know where to get them. </sentence><sentence id="540">Why don't you let them go home?" </sentence><sentence id="541">So we went, fortunately not directly home, we went back to that farm where I had the key to--slept there, which was about four kilometers "S Toll-house (French)."6 Coordinates (French)." </sentence><sentence id="542">Particulars (German). </sentence><sentence id="543">from where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="544">And in the morning I decided, since they had let us go, we probably are not looked for, and that's where I met our, my friend the convict, the ex-convict, he says, "Are you crazy? </sentence><sentence id="545">What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="546">I said, "Well, we coming home because they caught us last night and they let us go," He says, "I have news for you, they must have made a mistake, because they used to have three policemen watching your house, today they have six." </sentence><sentence id="547">So we didn't go home and we kept being hidden for about two or three months until things calmed down. </sentence><sentence id="548">That happens all the time in France, you know. </sentence><sentence id="549">They make an action and then they forget about it. </sentence><sentence id="550">And after two or three months hiding we went--by that time it was I think September--no--it was October. </sentence><sentence id="551">You remember that man, that man in the prefecture by the name of Ernst, and he arranged again to get us a complete absolution and we can go home. </sentence><sentence id="552">The seals have to be removed, we are no longer looked for, and then we lived there for another month until the Americans disembarked in Algiers. </sentence><sentence id="553">That's November "42 and suddenly, the entire occupied--the entire non-occupied became occupied, that's in November, "42. </sentence><sentence id="554">Am I rambling too much? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="687">Q: So you had to stay put? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="689">A: Yeah, we hid--I kept up--because they were torturing--the reason why I could stay at this gardener's home is that poor guy was actually a Cypriot. </sentence><sentence id="690">His name was Pascalis and he had been into--they decided a Cypriot is a British citizen, so they send him--the poor--the Pascalis, he was such an innocuous man, he was just a gardener who could hardly read. </sentence><sentence id="691">And so they send him as a British subject to a camp and interned him as an enemy alien, so his little garden--he had built a little house there, it was just a house--and he's even dug his own well. </sentence><sentence id="692">And so since he was deported, his house was closed. </sentence><sentence id="693">But I knew where the key was and nobody ever bothered us, so I kept on going with my sisters to that house, and my parents were still continuing to live near that hospital, that woman, and Saint Eloi until they moved officially the seals and then we moved back in that house. </sentence><sentence id="694">But we only stayed there for about three weeks because then I decided I will no longer ever say I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="695">I will join the underground and when the Germans move in to the whole zone in November, and that's-- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="719">A: The seals, the fact that we couldn't go to school, the fact that they stamped our ration cards and our identification cards "Juif," which made it difficult frequently, because if you dealt with those--for example there was a great food shortage in the south of France and when you start in line, people queue for four o'clock and suddenly you come with your "Juif" there, sometimes people just pushed ahead of you and you weren't going to say anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="720">It's like in the occupied zone, they had the yellow star we weren't yet to wear, but we had identity cards with "Juif" stamped on it which was annoying.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="825">Q: One other question about when you saw there was southern Jews under Vichy: Did you have a sense of what the general attitude was about the Vichy administration and the general French attitude? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="827">A: The French attitude was favorable to Vichy, very much. </sentence><sentence id="828">And I can tell you this was going on in general, except for individual people. </sentence><sentence id="829">Some individuals were absolutely wonderful, you know the old type of Clemanceaus, like the Republicains. </sentence><sentence id="830">But others would have a general attitude of anti-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="831">All French have always been intellectual anti-Jewish anyhow, ever since Dreyfus, you know, Zola. </sentence><sentence id="832">But you have some people like Zola or others who, you know, those were individuals. </sentence><sentence id="833">I must say the French population in the south was very, very pro-Vichy. </sentence><sentence id="834">They approved everything and they were sort of, sort of giving that feeling, well, everything was the fault of Leon Blum and his popular front, that Jews Leon Blum and Daniel Mayer and all these guys, oh, there was an attitude. </sentence><sentence id="835">But individually, certain people are definitely against persecution and when they knew you were in trouble, they were ready to help you. </sentence><sentence id="836">It's a dichotomy. </sentence><sentence id="837">I mean I have people, they were just wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="838">Oh, like these people that saved my niece, she's not a niece, she's a second cousin, yeah, whom I see--she's in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="839">But those were Catholic people. </sentence><sentence id="840">She, the woman, was married to a Jew, Rosenstiel, but she's the one who instigated this whole, this saving of the children and kept raising the child as Jewish so she wouldn't forget her grandparents, because her grandparents were very religious. </sentence><sentence id="841">But the girl isn't Jewish any more, but she was. </sentence><sentence id="842">She tried. </sentence><sentence id="843">So these individual people are just sublime, that's what I'm saying. </sentence><sentence id="844">The sense of Vichy was extremely popular government. </sentence><sentence id="845">They were listening to them, there were very few who were actually for the British. </sentence><sentence id="846">It may have been also the hate of the British and the hate of the leftist movement, which identified with the Jews, especially Leon Blum. </sentence><sentence id="847">I don't know if you remember Leon Blum, who was the Prime Minister who instituted all these beautiful, liberal reforms, you know. </sentence><sentence id="848">Social Security and all this that France has, all the workers even now that they have, they owe it to Leon Blum and his government and yet they were so happy, "Oh, we got rid of all those Jews," etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="849">Yeah, there was a very anti-Jewish feel, but that's not just France. </sentence><sentence id="850">I can tell you later on, even when I got to Spain, I faced this from the Belgians, who were, the Belgians who were officially on the British side. </sentence><sentence id="851">See, when I wanted to volunteer for the Belgians they said, "We can't accept you," and later on I said "Well, I had no papers," and then when the other Belgian says, "But we never had any papers he says, "I bet you're Jewish," I said, "Yes," he says, "Well, yeah." </sentence><sentence id="852">We never had their attitude. </sentence><sentence id="853">He wouldn't like, even--the other people knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="854">So that's not surprising. </sentence><sentence id="855">And that's why we were always living in fear. </sentence><sentence id="856">Every day we knew something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="857">And it did, finally it happened, it happened, at a tremendous scale, which is a miracle that we escaped that. </sentence><sentence id="858">Never understood why. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: Well, I went and I think there was a major mistake which could have cost--there was a major mistake because I went there. </sentence><sentence id="979">I had no address to give. </sentence><sentence id="980">When I went there I realized that the man in charge of the ID cards was a militia man, an officer, and he then went, after I filled out the papers, he filled out the papers, asked me to come in back and looked at me very sternly and I said, "There. </sentence><sentence id="981">I am caught," you know? </sentence><sentence id="982">And all he said is, "Eyes blue, hair brown." </sentence><sentence id="983">All he wanted was to have a look at me because he wants to give the details, and then he said, "Well..." and I knew that when you take an ID card, usually they fill out the papers and then they stamp it and you go home. </sentence><sentence id="984">He said, "You'll have to come back in two weeks from now," and I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="985">He said, "Well, because this--we don't deliver cards any more. </sentence><sentence id="986">It's now very serious and we do it through the prefecture de police," and I didn't know what, and I said, "Fine," and then I left. </sentence><sentence id="987">And then I went to see my chief and he says, "That was a stupid thing to do, but now that you did it, he's either going to have--if you have the courage and you go there, you either--you'll be the only person in the entire region who's going to have an identity without an accomplice, which means--" and then he started to explain to me, because he says, "You're going to be assigned in the manufacturing of false papers and distributing false papers and bringing them over to various places as you can see on that certificate." </sentence><sentence id="988">And I said, "Where is it?" </sentence><sentence id="989">and then he gave me the explanation, he says, "There is virtually nobody who has what we call true-true-false papers--false identity--and if you get that prefecture card, you're going to have the only one with true-true-stamps. </sentence><sentence id="990">There's not going to be an accomplice, so you can never be caught. </sentence><sentence id="991">The second thing is..." then he explained to me, "...some of them you're going to make and we have rubber stamps and we have forms that we buy," etcetera. " </sentence><sentence id="992">They're not going to be perfect and those are called false-false-false papers. </sentence><sentence id="993">Then there's going to be--you're going to have contacts as you're going on, you're going to work in mairies, and we're going to find some people who we can bribe and they're going to make it at the mairie and keep a record, but that's somebody who's not totally reliable--that's going to be the false-true-false papers. </sentence><sentence id="994">And then we're going to have--somewhere we're going to have a person that is one of ours in the mairie, he's a resistance. </sentence><sentence id="995">But he can be caught and under torture he can tell, that he's going to be again. </sentence><sentence id="996">And those are going to be true-false-false papers. </sentence><sentence id="997">So that's going to be the different categories of papers." </sentence><sentence id="998">And that's after he says, "But we're only going to use you after you have your own papers, so..."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1097">Q: So there wasn't an agreement in Montpellier to meet with certain people once you arrived in-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1099">A: No, no, because you see, it was only the--almost two days before I left Montpellier that I joined, it was a very secretive--and that's maybe why Toto, the chief, acted a little bit strange in the beginning, because it was such a secretive thing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1100">It was in the dark, you made an oath in the dark on a revolver. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I mean it was--I thought it was a lot of--I was sort of a little cynical about it and maybe I acted a little bit supercilious or something because I think Toto told me in the beginning he was very sort of diffident, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1102">That's maybe why he handed me that discharge paper saying the hell with it, he's not--I'm not going to do anything special for him, but when I got the real papers and when he saw that I have guts, because he said, "Now it's up to you," and I said, "Would you go?" </sentence><sentence id="1103">he says, "The only thing I can tell you, if you ever get those papers, you have the best papers and you're going to be very useful to us. </sentence><sentence id="1104">On the other hand, I'm not sure if I would do it in your place because there is a big risk involved." </sentence><sentence id="1105">And I said, rather than-- if I want to do a thing, I'm not joining the underground not to take risks." </sentence><sentence id="1106">So I took the risk and got my papers. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1220">A: Yeah, well, I was living in that place, number 16 Grande Rue, above a bordello, and it was a safe haven because you see, again, they had picked that place and on the first floor there was a bordello, because there was a red light, and so they had picked up because you could go in and out. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And then I had this apartment where this woman was living, and I had a little room there, and I wasn't there much either, because most of the time I was in the farms all around, so traveling a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Many times I was sleeping at Madame Jeanne, this famous Madame Jeanne Latchiver; she was a marvelous woman. </sentence><sentence id="1223">That's where I got to meet all these people who later on were deported, like Marianne Cohen, Mila Racine--all these people who tried to get children over and they betrayed them. </sentence><sentence id="1224">Somebody betrayed them, I don't know who--around there--Laubert(ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: Tell me a little bit about the process of making all these papers and distributing them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: That's what I explained to you. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Number one, we had--somehow we had a printer, he was a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="1234">He was Gregoire I think, he had a printing shop. </sentence><sentence id="1235">I didn't have much deg7 According to the interviewee, this was a code phrase that the group used. </sentence><sentence id="1236">to do with him, it was Toto again. </sentence><sentence id="1237">He would print us the forms, he would make us the rubber stamps, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1238">These forms--we would just get the pictures, have the form where they were just rubber stamps, because my papers had the watermark print, you know the--that was different. </sentence><sentence id="1239">If, in an emergency where we had to have quickly some people come over from, yeah, families coming from the occupied zone who would send--I would go over there, bring them the papers, but we would make them. </sentence><sentence id="1240">These were little cardboard kind of, kind of cardboard kind of forms. </sentence><sentence id="1241">They fold and you fill them out and you stamped them, and they were given. </sentence><sentence id="1242">They're worthless because if ever they would check--can I, can you stop one second? </sentence><sentence id="1243">I have to blow my nose. </sentence><sentence id="1244">See, they were worthless because if anybody checked, really, if the police would have any suspicion, they would get those people over, just make a phone call to a man, you know--there were no computers then, but just call and said, "Do you have any registration?" </sentence><sentence id="1245">I would say no, so they were totally false. </sentence><sentence id="1246">They were false-false-false papers. </sentence><sentence id="1247">Also we had a few people in areas like Domene, etcetera, where I didn't know what the difference was except that I used to go and pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I sit in small city halls. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I call them mairies, you know that's--we used to have either employees there, who are accomplices because either they were doing it for money or they were resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1250">I didn't know the difference between them, but they would say *Today, go to Domene..." for example, "...Domene, and you pick up a bundle of things." </sentence><sentence id="1251">These were registered. </sentence><sentence id="1252">In other words, you had the background papers there. </sentence><sentence id="1253">If the police called, the guy would say "Yes, they are here, these people," but you had a weakness-- they had an accomplice. </sentence><sentence id="1254">That accomplice could be somebody that we thought was trustworthy, in which case they were true- false-false; or where there were two true-false; or the guy could be trusted, in that case they were true-true-false. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I mean we had all these things, and I would pick them up and bring them over. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Now there was always a danger there, either a person was caught and somebody was waiting for me to come and pick them up or the people was a double agent or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1257">It never happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1284">Q: Were you afraid constantly that it-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1286">A: No, I was only afraid that if they would stop me I would become nervous and I would show that there's something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1287">I was never--that was a strange thing, not even when I, the most difficult part, even the day that I was conduct--I don't know was. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I think it's the youth, the fact that our life was so tense all the time, that these things seemed to be sort of a relief. </sentence><sentence id="1289">I don't remember, looking back that I was afraid, except, for example, I remember one day coming back from Saint-Gervais, where I had just given all these papers to the people, distributed them, came back, had nothing, and suddenly there was big, ID check, I'm sorry, ID check. </sentence><sentence id="1290">The police was there, the militia was there, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1291">I wasn't afraid for me, because I had the--but I was afraid that I might not look relaxed and that they would see I'm nervous and then they would start asking them and then I, I might betray. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I was much more afraid ever to be nervous and to betray people, but otherwise I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And so this was about the life, I was also the liaison person with Toulouse at one time. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Toulouse was the other, was the real big center. </sentence><sentence id="1295">We didn't--I didn't--know that, but that's where Polonski, who was known at the time by the name of Pol, was running a big operation where most of the people after I left of Grenoble moved to, and Toto moved to Grenoble, to Toulouse, because that became the big center because at one time when the Germans, when the Germans occupied even the Italian zone, there was no more reason to have two centers. </sentence><sentence id="1296">So a small group was left in Grenoble. </sentence><sentence id="1297">My two sisters, who before I left joined the underground, became much more active than I, because then they had become more of a--they started using the places that I had found. </sentence><sentence id="1298">They also were much more active in the false papers business. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And I think one of my sisters even got hurt at one point, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1315">Q: Did you have much sense of the overall organization or did you really operate with a few people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1317">A: Very little sense. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I think the organization was still very disjointed. </sentence><sentence id="1319">Our operation was one operation and we thought it was all. </sentence><sentence id="1320">I only got an inkling later, in Toulouse, but I didn't realize that Toulouse was the major center. </sentence><sentence id="1321">I only got--when it became--when I became, I wanted to tell you, after a certain time I could not use--I could not stay Pierre Vinot because as Pierre Vinot I was born in 1919, four years older than I really was. </sentence><sentence id="1322">There was suddenly--the French had suddenly made an order that all people born after-- before--1921 had to report to go to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1323">You had to go, mandatory labor, for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1324">At least you had to register, and so I could no longer be Pierre Vinot, and I had to become Arthur Vergnaud. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I think it was still Pierre, I have to remember. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I don't remember because they weren't exactly good, there was not longer any good for anyone it was one of those little cards made by Domene. </sentence><sentence id="1327">I remember the mairie, at which point, one morning, I--I used to sneak in very early in the morning at six o'clock in the morning to my where my parents lived to chop the wood and bring them sometimes the food that I had collected in the farms. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And I come there in the morning and there is a little girl, Fischer, she was a neighbor, and she came to me, and she says that--she came to the streetcar and she came up with a little milk thing and she says to me, "You go and pick up the milk," and I couldn't understand this little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1329">She was maybe nine years, 11 years old--nine years. </sentence><sentence id="1330">She says, "Police," and so I knew I couldn't go home, and so I went. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Later on I discovered they got my poor father and my sister, took them all the way to somewhere, and they grilled them all day long by saying, "Where is your son?" </sentence><sentence id="1332">and he says, "My son is only four years old." " </sentence><sentence id="1333">No, no, no, the other one, the one that's in the resistance, the one that worked there on this farm and there on this farm and he's in the underground and he distributes flyers," and they didn't know what I was distributing so they thought I was distributing propaganda, you know--he's in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And so I knew that somebody had betrayed me because they didn't even know my name, they just knew that I existed and they knew how I looked, and so at which point, when I told this to Toto because he didn't know about it, he said, "Well, I can't use you any more, but we can use you now because we do want to have more liaisons to Toulouse and we would like to make a channel and you be the guinea pig with whoever you want to recruit to go to Spain," and I said, "But I thought that Spain is impossible." </sentence><sentence id="1335">He said, "Exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1336">That's why we want you to try it," because nowadays nobody had crossed to Spain for the last year--smuggled in, because you have a border area. </sentence><sentence id="1337">You have 50 kilometers which is zone interite."* </sentence><sentence id="1338">If they catch you, they shoot you, if you don't have a certain color pass, and so it's almost impossible to get over, but we have a passer who we want to use and Toulouse is looking for volunteers that are desperate and then ultimately we'll set our goal that you should then try to get to Palestine at that time because--I forgot to tell you that the, at that time the AG, or the OGC was very Zionistic. </sentence><sentence id="1339">All wanted ultimately to get to Palestine, and so that's what I'm saying was so--it was such a comedy because they kept on saying, "You go to Toulouse and then you try it and then within 48 hours you have to report to Barcelona, to our agent in Barcelona and they will get you over to..." That was nonsense because it didn't exist, this whole channel was sort of just a trying field. </sentence><sentence id="1340">So the first time--I then went with George Schneck, my best friend, we were buddies and, you know, brothers, and I went to Toulouse again, without a pass, without, but I, then I was where I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And I got to Toulouse. </sentence><sentence id="1342">We were hidden at that time and we were trained for weeks by--in the home of Madame Knout. </sentence><sentence id="1343">Her name was Rachel Knout, K-n-o-u-t. I mentioned to you she was the granddaughter of Scriabine, and she was not Jewish but she was married to Knout who was a big wheel in that organization and--oh, no--he was deported, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Yeah, Knout was deported, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And Rachel Knout, she was a wonderful woman, with her children there, she reminded me of that Madame Jeanne because she had about four or five children. </sentence><sentence id="1346">She had the little--and everybody was hiding there, and she was active. </sentence><sentence id="1347">She was shot later on, on the 28th of July, 1944, she was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1348">There was also another guy by the name of Gerard and he also was shot, later on. </sentence><sentence id="1349">And then they send me and George to Nakache. </sentence><sentence id="1350">Nakache was a Olympic champion of swimming--swimming champion of 1938 or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="1351">He had opened the gymnasium and he trained people physically for the underground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1388">Q: He was Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1390">A: Yeah, Nakache was a, Nakache was a--but they didn't know that, see, Nakache was an Algerian Jew or a Moroccan Jew or something like this, Nakache. </sentence><sentence id="1391">And he trained us you know, etcetera, and then what happened it--George's family, his mother was, she was from Russia and she was absolutely against him continuing because she said she knows the nihilists, and we're probably going to be--because they did train us how to jump from trains and things like this and so she, I don't know, George decided he wasn't going. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So [ had to go all the way back to Grenoble and try to recruit different people, which I wasn't, it wasn't such a good bunch because George and I were really idealistic and these other guys, they just wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1393">I got five people, one I didn't know, he was from Megeve, and I had Nick, Charles and the brothers Levine. </sentence><sentence id="1394">And in Toulouse they gave me another guy that was from Antwerp, Armand Herchkowitz, he was the sixth deg8 Destruction zone; from ""interitus," meaning "death" (Latin). </sentence><sentence id="1395">guy. </sentence><sentence id="1396">So I got six guys and the French underground gave us five more people and I became in charge of this group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1404">Q: You said the French underground gave you more people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1406">A: Not me. </sentence><sentence id="1407">Yeah, the French underground, like I said, they did not work with us, but Pol Polonski and Jack Roytman, who were the two guys in Toulouse, told us we--because the French underground apparently furnished--supplied--the passer. </sentence><sentence id="1408">The Jewish underground was financing it, see that's where we-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1412">Q: But there was a relationship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1414">A: Oh, yes, there was a relationship, but it was not the real--it was sort of a--you could feel a sort of contempt: "You provide us with money," you know. </sentence><sentence id="1415">There was no other interchanging except that I was told in Toulouse, "You're going to get whatever you get. </sentence><sentence id="1416">There are going to be five guys and you're going to be responsible for them, too." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1420">Q: There was no sense of a common enemy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1422">A: Yeah, but that way, like I said, in "43, the population was still very, very pro--not real pro-German, but anti-British, anti-Jewish, and I'm not sure that the--and I had the feeling that the French underground was had only started, the major, the most strongest part of the French underground were the Communists. </sentence><sentence id="1423">They were really anti-German, because they were anti-Russian, not for any other reason. </sentence><sentence id="1424">They were very unconcerned with what they did to the Jews, and they couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="1425">The Jewish underground was simply because they felt, otherwise they would have been part of the French underground, but they felt that there was discrimination against the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1430">Q: So their goals were different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1432">A: Their goals were different. </sentence><sentence id="1433">The Jewish underground, the way I knew it, both in Toulouse and--had an aim to get the Jews as much as they could, either fighting the Germans or getting them to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1434">That was at that time--the Jewish resistance was very Zionist-oriented. </sentence><sentence id="1435">The Communists that infiltrated them tried to switch it differently, made them Communists. </sentence><sentence id="1436">The French sort of ignored them except when it came to--at least in my time. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Now later on, I think towards the very end, they were working together, but you see the French resistance, no matter what they say, was Johnny Come Lately, you know, all those people that you see in movies, etcetera. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1438">A: Even the second D.B."? </sentence><sentence id="1439">friend, who went through the same place without the French underground, went the same passage and he joined the French army in Algiers, he also said that was, first of all, he could have done without us, secondly they were so deg Division Blindee, (blind division), (French). </sentence><sentence id="1440">antisemitic in these, in the French army. </sentence><sentence id="1441">The French army of liberation, de Clercq and all these people, were terrible antisemites. </sentence><sentence id="1442">So I got to Toulouse, I was hidden once in M--by Rachel Knout. </sentence><sentence id="1443">I got the training, I went back, I recruited five people, they gave me a sixth one, then after a couple of days they, Pol and Jack, they gave me instructions how, what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1444">We got to some place which--it was my memory, I have such a great memory, I can't remember that place--and there we were hidden in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="1445">We got the five Frenchmen with us, the five non-Jewish guys and we--and then--his name was Bertrand Borde, yeah, he came. </sentence><sentence id="1446">He was about seven foot tall; no secret that I'm a pretty short guy, and most of the people except one Frenchman, one, he was a law student, was the only tall guy. </sentence><sentence id="1447">All the others were relatively--I mean my size or even shorter, and he took us for two days in the mountains on a absolutely incredible tempo. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Then they abandoned us in the mountains, and then we had another two days without food in the middle of storms, etcetera, and we finally got to Spain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1460">Q: Now, tell me a little bit about that journey to Spain. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Was this a fairly easy crossing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1464">A: Oh, no, this was a horrible crossing. </sentence><sentence id="1465">As a matter of fact, the team--the team after us I think lost three people. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Two died and one broke his leg and they had to abandon-- they don't know what happened and the next team didn't make it at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1470">Q: Why was it so horrible? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1472">A: First of all it was--you start off almost in open thing--in fields where there are German villages, for example. </sentence><sentence id="1473">Whenever you crossed, you crossed towards dusk because at night you couldn't see, and when we passed any of those villages, for example, there were Germans in there. </sentence><sentence id="1474">And you have to remember, when we passed I had to start--let's see--no, I was always the last one because the guy before that, the passer would go, and then when you hardly see the passer. </sentence><sentence id="1475">The next one would go, and by that time it became dark. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Then you had to get into fields that go up like this where the people who work in those fields are attached by cords to work in the fields, you know, with a sickle. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Then you start, then it became so bad that you have to do it in daylight, and you're absolutely a target there. </sentence><sentence id="1478">If they see you, they shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="1479">You don't have a pass. </sentence><sentence id="1480">The terrain is terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1481">After the fields you get into the most horrible rocks and you know the mountains goes up and it goes down. </sentence><sentence id="1482">It's north of Honduras and, for example, in the mountains, when you are on the top and you want to start going down, you don't realize that when you go down let's say 100 feet, there's nothing underneath and some of our people almost died this way. </sentence><sentence id="1483">There was this guy that I got from Megeve, he was the most undisciplined guy ever, and he would just go down there and then he would stop because he almost fell. </sentence><sentence id="1484">These were extremely dangerous and then there were paths where you had about, I don't know, this much to slide on the side. </sentence><sentence id="1485">I couldn't do it now, it just how we did it. </sentence><sentence id="1486">It was just horrible and at times the guide did us--made us do it in the middle of the night, and when I found out what we were doing with the morning when we woke up because then he would stop, and he would fall asleep because he drank all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1487">And then he would say, I would wake up and I says, "Ready to go?" </sentence><sentence id="1488">He says, "That." </sentence><sentence id="1489">I said, "We did that in the middle of the night?" </sentence><sentence id="1490">He says, "You wouldn't have dared to do it during the day." </sentence><sentence id="1491">It was physically one of the most dangerous mountain climbing things that you can imagine, besides even if it was August there were patches of ice, and you don't realize it in the mountain, you're seeing sort of a, seeing some snow and you think "Oh, well, that's just snow, that's a patch of ice," which in the mountain looks like if it's a yard and it's 10 yards and you slide down. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And once you slide, you go. </sentence><sentence id="1493">So there was a dangerous--it was dangerous for two reasons: number one, it was the most impractical thing; that's why he picked it and he knew his way, he was a professional smuggler. </sentence><sentence id="1494">The second thing is you were in open; at night it was too dangerous physically, you could kill yourself, and people killed themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1495">Secondly, during the day, you were exposed to anybody who saw you--shooting, you know, and the Germans were patrolling. </sentence><sentence id="1496">It was a terrible thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1497">I went back there, 1990, to look at the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1498">I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1499">It's the most awe-inspiring mountains that you can dream of. </sentence><sentence id="1500">It's north of Honduras. </sentence><sentence id="1501">It's a terrible place. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1760">A: It was just--that was funny because, that was funny because they had us divided in--everybody's Canadian, see everybody was Canadian, Canadian-Belgian, see, because the government of Spain, Franco, had made an arrangement that he's not going to repatriate anybody who is army age and is Canadian, so everybody is saying--we all said we were Canadians, and so they knew better and so they said, "Yes? </sentence><sentence id="1761">Canadian? </sentence><sentence id="1762">Born where?" </sentence><sentence id="1763">And then you know, there were Belgian-Canadian, Polish-Canadian, Czech- Canadian, but I didn't stay there very long. </sentence><sentence id="1764">They decided to ship me to Barcelona because I was French-Canadian. </sentence><sentence id="1765">I didn't say at that time that I was Belgian, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1766">I was Belgian, but I certainly wasn't going to say that I was, how do you call it, no nationality at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And so I went to--they had given me an address to see a guy by the name of Sequera, who is the head of the Joint in Barcelona. </sentence><sentence id="1768">He's a Portuguese guy, a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1769">And we woke him up and he didn't want to--it was on a Sunday--he didn't want to come to see us and then I said, "You have to," and then he said--and then I gave him a password, which was the name of a person. </sentence><sentence id="1770">I didn't even know what it was--a name of a person who was apparently a very important person in Switzerland--Jeff Roytman. </sentence><sentence id="1771">It's a Frenchman, but as soon as I said "Roytman" he opened the door and then he found out that we weren't--I said I was French.
