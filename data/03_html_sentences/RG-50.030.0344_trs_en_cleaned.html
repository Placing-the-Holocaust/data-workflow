<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="627">Q: And were the Germans around a lot in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="629">A: They had their quarters which were inside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="630">But if somebody saw a German, he tried to go around them as far as possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="635">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="636">Maybe someone did something or some of the fellows felt bad, he might have hurt the Jew when he saw him and the Jew did not get out of the way quickly enough, or so, he might have hit him, or something. </sentence><sentence id="637">But not in our camp. </sentence><sentence id="638">Let's put it this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="643">Q: So when we're talking about this Jewish administration, what were they in charge of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="645">A: Well, what an administration would do. </sentence><sentence id="646">You know, give jobs, or say this and that has to be done, or complied with the Germans order that has to be done, but mostly it was the orders from the Germans that we got, or that they got to comply. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="649">Q: You said they were also responsible for the transports? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: Yes and no. </sentence><sentence id="652">An order came from the Germans, for instance, on this and this date, one thousand Jews have to be going east. </sentence><sentence id="653">We didn't know where east was, or we didn't want to know where east was. </sentence><sentence id="654">Everybody was afraid that it's worse than from where we are coming. </sentence><sentence id="655">Anda thousand Jews had to go. </sentence><sentence id="656">No matter what. </sentence><sentence id="657">And they sent them and we were afraid it's worse -- in Terezin we heard some rumors where they are going to, but it was so terrible that nobody wanted to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="658">Nobody would have believed that there were gas chambers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="667">Q: Who had to make that list of the thousand people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: Well the Jews really. </sentence><sentence id="670">But they were instructions, for instance, everybody over 55 years, or under 25, or everybody who has done this work, or that work has to go. </sentence><sentence id="671">And it was always bad feelings about it. </sentence><sentence id="672">Among the Jews too, because everybody thought "if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have to go" or things like that. </sentence><sentence id="673">It was a very sad business. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="679">Q: Did that come through your office? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="693">Q: What I'm trying to understand is that it sounds like there was this semblance of a whole city - - all the regular functions and activities of a city there. </sentence><sentence id="694">Is that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: Well, as much as the Jews could do it, yes. </sentence><sentence id="696">But we were supervised by the Germans and if the Germans didn't like something it couldn't be done. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="697">Q: Was this ghetto or camp enclosed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="700">You couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="701">You can flee somehow. </sentence><sentence id="702">Hide and go somewhere but if they caught us, and where to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="713">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="714">After it was closed, yes. </sentence><sentence id="715">Before, not. </sentence><sentence id="716">We had to have passes to get from one building to the other or things like that. </sentence><sentence id="717">But after it was closed, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="723">Q: How soon after the beginning was it enclosed, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="725">A: I would say about a year, a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="726">As long as they got the non-Jews out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: So in the beginning there were non-Jews living there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: Well, they couldn't move everyone. </sentence><sentence id="732">And those people didn't want to go because they were living in their houses, you know, that they owned and they didn't want to leave it. </sentence><sentence id="733">So in the beginning there were non-Jews there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: And then eventually they moved away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: Yeah, they moved them out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: So I'm trying to get a picture of this because this is different than many other places. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="748">Q: So all kinds of buildings that are in a normal city? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: Not buildings, these were big casernan (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="751">if you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="752">So there were some houses and people who were lucky got assigned to live in a house after they evacuated the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="753">But that was a big advantage, and they lived in the upstairs without -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: Do you remember some of the leaders of the ghetto </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="755">A: I knew them all. </sentence><sentence id="756">I was working with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="768">When they could help they would help. </sentence><sentence id="769">Otherwise they would have to do what they were told by the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: In general, did you and the other people living there respect them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: We did not disrespect them. </sentence><sentence id="776">We took them for granted. </sentence><sentence id="777">Maybe somebody did respect them, you know, one of them or the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: But there must have been a big difference between the way one would run the camp and another one would; there must have been a difference between Edelstein and Mermelstein (ph.)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: Yeah, but they did not really have to run it by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="784">They had to run it together. </sentence><sentence id="785">Mermelstein we didn't like, but not because he was bad but because personally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="789">Q: Why, what do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1124">A: They tried to stay together. </sentence><sentence id="1125">The groups that came in tried to stay together because they knew each other. </sentence><sentence id="1126">But how long could they stay -- they sent half of them or how many out of the group. </sentence><sentence id="1127">They were sent to Poland because Theresienstadt wasn't such a big town. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1144">A: They had different expectations, and it went even that far that even some time or one time a German said "if our Fuhrer knew how you treat us, if our Fuhrer". </sentence><sentence id="1145">Because they thought, you know, since they are Germans, Hitler would take care of them better than of the Czechs. </sentence><sentence id="1146">But that was what some of them said, "if our Fuhrer knew". </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1150">Q: How did the Czech people react to the Germans who came in -- what did they think of them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1152">How did you feel? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1153">A: We took them for granted. </sentence><sentence id="1154">They came the same as we, and the German Jews, they expected to be treated better which is true because "our Fuhrer", but they were not. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And they got assigned the same as the others and then came an order, a thousand Jews have to go, so how do you select a thousand Jews and don't make a mistake, let's put it this way, or what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1159">Q: Were there ever tensions between the Germans and the Czechs and the people from Holland? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1205">Q: But the Germans allowed children to be born? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1225">Q: So they didn't force women to have abortions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1227">A: No, not really, but who wanted to have a child in a camp like that. </sentence><sentence id="1228">So most of them did have abortions on their own really. </sentence><sentence id="1229">On their own will. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1246">A: Well they sent the other ones to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1247">So what they had to send the usually sick or older people. </sentence><sentence id="1248">It came by itself, let's put it this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1252">Q: That probably changed the balance in the camps in terms of working people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1254">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1255">But as I say, they came from Austria or so, and they came. </sentence><sentence id="1256">The people who work they were sending to work and the older people remained and they sent them to Theresienstadt. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1271">Q: What I'm wondering is if they would keep the men around longer because they thought they were better workers or something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1273">A: They might in some cases. </sentence><sentence id="1274">If somebody knew something special they wouldn't let him go because they needed his work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: Did you feel that women were treated the same as men there? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1345">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Because everybody who knew something tried to apply it for his own sake and for the sake of the others. </sentence><sentence id="1347">So I don't know everything, but we had pretty much to be proud of. </sentence><sentence id="1348">Let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Because of the people who were there and said about those things, were talking about those things. </sentence><sentence id="1350">I don't think I could tell you too much about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1411">Q: So did the Germans allow this; did they encourage it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1413">A: They didn't encourage it but they did not prohibit it expressly. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And I believe some of them even went to see it because they didn't have it on the outside. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1422">A: Well in the camp we had rooms enough and they could be guarded. </sentence><sentence id="1423">Let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1424">If the Germans were close, the lights went out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1480">A: There was, but not everybody could get in and there were too many to be taken care of by too few and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1481">That was sad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
