<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, yes, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow up, because his older brother died, very early. </sentence><sentence id="52">So, the burden of supporting the family was always on him. </sentence><sentence id="53">So he was the provider type and my mother had no basic responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="54">She was basically what you would call a petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my father's values more than my mother's but that doesn't mean I didn't love my mother. </sentence><sentence id="55">My mother also survived the war with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: How did your father and your mother meet? </sentence><sentence id="62"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a wholesale drug distribution firm. </sentence><sentence id="66">By drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply firm, but in Hungary they were called druggists, making cologne water, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="67">It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today. </sentence><sentence id="68">It was not a pharmaceutical company. </sentence><sentence id="69">And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it was the custom of middle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then have them work for a few years for some firm, hoping that they're going to catch a husband. </sentence><sentence id="70">And my mother caught my father there, which was very much to the dislike of her family because my father, they felt, was much below their class and they made him feel that way in all his life. </sentence><sentence id="71">Of course, I cannot really say what would have happened after World War II because my mother's entire family was wiped out, practically. </sentence><sentence id="72">Only a few people who lived in Budapest remained. </sentence><sentence id="73">So, but I resented them for a very simple reason, that they looked down on my father who I thought was a, was a very, was a man of integrity and, and hard-working, a good human being. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Were they, how did they treat you as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: I had a very strange relationship with my mother's family, especially my grandparents because they were very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with them they forced me to wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of very strict kosher food, go to the synagogue every night and pray and, and in general, they considered me some kind of a, what they call in Yiddish a shaygets, somebody who is kind of just an outsider because I never really went along with their, with their religious rules. </sentence><sentence id="86">I also resented the fact that my grandmother was kind of a, of a, of a very angry person. </sentence><sentence id="87">I felt that, that the way she treated others and the way she treated my grandfather, I resented that. </sentence><sentence id="88">I didn't like to go there and my mother, of course, always wanted me to go and visit and I have, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have to visit anymore. </sentence><sentence id="89">And one day, this was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a butcher shop, got a huge ham hock and got out and when the people went to the synagogue Friday night, I was eating it without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were coming and that was my last visit. </sentence><sentence id="90">They immediately sent me back to Budapest and I never had to visit again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Was your mother angry with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="100">My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an understanding. </sentence><sentence id="101">Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with religion to go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just did it for my mother's sake. </sentence><sentence id="102">And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to Israel, I was in Israel which we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, I realize that my father doesn't know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words. </sentence><sentence id="103">He has no idea, what really, how to even pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my, my, my mother and I appreciated this, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting discovery for me, that. </sentence><sentence id="104">So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically influential after the war to put down his foot and say, forget about kosher anymore, let's just eat what is available. </sentence><sentence id="105">And so we did not have a kosher household anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Now was your father's entire family not very religious, then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="115"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="116">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="117"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Yes, yes, they weren't. </sentence><sentence id="119">They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness. </sentence><sentence id="120">They knew they were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know? </sentence><sentence id="121">And interestingly, quite a few of them survived because of the place where they lived. </sentence><sentence id="122">Since they lived in a Proletarian tenement of--city tenement--that was given to people under a certain income who had too many children and not enough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on this area and when, then, the World War II came and the Nuremburg laws and everything else, some of these Communist leaders, Communist members, came and actually rescued members of the family. </sentence><sentence id="123">I have an uncle in Hungary and he, for example, was a very good friend of a past Communist prime minister who just died recently because they practically lived side by side. </sentence><sentence id="124">Soa great deal of the Hungarian leadership, Communist leadership, came from this tenement. </sentence><sentence id="125">So that helped rescue them. </sentence><sentence id="126">The Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during those terrible years that, that would help you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: So, was religion mainly only recognized in your household on holidays, or . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="139">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="140">My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the synagogue, your mother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force me to do whatever with religion. </sentence><sentence id="141">He just asked me to respect my mother's wishes and so I had Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing that I did. </sentence><sentence id="142">After my Bar Mitzvah I never probably went to synagogue again unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what it is, inside. </sentence><sentence id="143">And, but I never denied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially ask me about religion, I say lam a Jew but I'm not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="144">And they ask me, "How can that be?" </sentence><sentence id="145">And I said, "Well, it's easy." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Did you have any sort of, any sense of faith? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="157">It's a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the supreme being and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because they say people who have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don't, but I always just associated with people who practically felt the same way and it never caused any problems so far in my life, in my sixty-six years. </sentence><sentence id="158">But I can't remember when I really honestly believed in a supreme being. </sentence><sentence id="159">And then of course, the war probably wiped out, if 1 had any doubts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Will you say something about your relationship with your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: My relationship with my father was always very good. </sentence><sentence id="167">I [indecipherable], I considered him always my, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken away and sent to a labor camp in Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="168">And when he came back in 1945, he, of course, I was overwhelmed and in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my mother, a lot more than with my father because he was also a traveling salesman for a long time and I only saw him on weekends, somehow my memory is much more blurred when it comes to my mother than when it comes to my father. </sentence><sentence id="169">My mother, one reason it might be that my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980, so he survived ten more years and since we lived in Europe from "74 on, at least for six years I had a lot more contact with him than I would have if I had stayed in the U.S. I always considered him an absolute statue of integrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I, even though when I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn't need any, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in Hungary and was always This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="171"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection giving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should spend it on himself. </sentence><sentence id="172">He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

[ </sentence><sentence id="373">Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left out was a very important thing. </sentence><sentence id="374">The teacher was yelling at me as I was running out of the class, "I hope you go to Palestine to sell oranges. </sentence><sentence id="375">That's where you belong." </sentence><sentence id="376">And so when I told my mother, this is when her reaction came. </sentence><sentence id="377">So she came back to school with me and instead of demanding some kind of a remedial action for this, apologized to the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="378">And I thought that was, that was a very strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="379">I didn't understand at that time. </sentence><sentence id="380">I did understand it, years later, that this was the only course she could, she could take. </sentence><sentence id="381">Obviously, she was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of school if she does something else. </sentence><sentence id="382">And every Jewish family, of course, wanted to have their son finish middle school. </sentence><sentence id="383">And that incident somehow frustrated me to the point, it created a mental block. </sentence><sentence id="384">I never drew or never painted in my life since. </sentence><sentence id="385">I am such idiot when it comes to, to do anything with my hands that involves drawing or painting that it is pathetic. </sentence><sentence id="386">When we play some games, for example, with my friends, when I have to draw something, they can't believe that, they think my perception is that of a mentally retarded person and it is, it is just a, just a block. </sentence><sentence id="387">However, I appreciate art very much. </sentence><sentence id="388">I never fail to go and see an exhibit of paintings and drawings. </sentence><sentence id="389">I just don't want to do it and I cannot do it myself. </sentence><sentence id="390">Now it's possible that this can be unlocked in time but by that time I won't be alive. </sentence><sentence id="391">So, I rather just leave this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: Did you father care about this incident? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: No, my father was not around anymore. </sentence><sentence id="428">He heard it after the war and of course by that time, I could, I understood the whole situation better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: Was that the first instance of anti-Semitism that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: ...Hit me for the first time? </sentence><sentence id="434">Well, the first one, I remember was when I was six and I was playing marbles with, with kids and I won. </sentence><sentence id="435">And one kid said, threw the marble down the gutter and said "Td rather throw it down the gutter than to give it to a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="436">And I went home and asked my mother, "What, what does it mean?" </sentence><sentence id="437">So, that really was the first time that something like this hit me. </sentence><sentence id="438">And since I went to a Jewish school for the first four years, I was not really exposed to things like this. </sentence><sentence id="439">But the minute I switched and in fifth grade, everything started. </sentence><sentence id="440">Luckily, there were some teachers of course, in our school who tried to make up for this. </sentence><sentence id="441">And I remember a couple of them. </sentence><sentence id="442">Unfortunately, they're not alive anymore but they did everything possible to, to make our life a bit more civilized. </sentence><sentence id="443">And one of them was even fired because of that. </sentence><sentence id="444">But not everybody was like this. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: He was very protective of, of Jewish children and he was also fired because we had a special subject called, how would I, how would I translate this, Defensive Studies, which meant, basically, kind of a ROTC type, except it was sheer propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="460">We had to, the book contained sentences that were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="461">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="462"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection so revolting as far as Hungary's neighbors were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="463">For example, the Romanians were described as monkeys on a, on a tree, their intellectual level and, I mean, for every nationality that surrounded Hungary, they had a very derogatory term. </sentence><sentence id="464">And, actually, the book was preparing you that one day we will get even. </sentence><sentence id="465">And what he was, among other things, he was teaching this subject, and he said, "Put the book away and let me tell you what life is about." </sentence><sentence id="466">And it was a very, very human, humanistic lecture that he would give us every day. </sentence><sentence id="467">And, after the war, to our great satisfaction, but not surprise, he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of Physical Sciences, so, he, they recognized him. </sentence><sentence id="468">And he was then, I talked to him later and he was in the Illegal Social Democratic Party, so that also helped him. </sentence><sentence id="469">But, there were teachers and I had a teacher, I don't even know if he had any political conviction, but he was a human being and he always tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, even, even in middle school, I had to go once a week to three hours of, of labor, battalion practice. </sentence><sentence id="470">This was one of the most humiliating experiences that anybody can have. </sentence><sentence id="471">They had the scum of earth in charge of us, it was not teachers or any... we had to report either at school or somewhere on the outskirts of Budapest to a practice ground where these hired instructors that were a lot worse than any drill instructor I have ever seen in any movie, any American movie, because it's not that, it was not just the physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated, but it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so bad, the way they called us everything, a Jewish this and a Jewish that, and these were people hired to do this job and besides of marching and, and digging and building, constantly, we were abused and constantly even physically so. </sentence><sentence id="472">Many times they beat us and all this. </sentence><sentence id="473">And we had to go there about three hours on a certain day. </sentence><sentence id="474">The Christians then went to three hours of practice of what you would call today ROTC. </sentence><sentence id="475">They had, they had marching drill practices and all this. </sentence><sentence id="476">But ours was completely different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: What year did that start? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: What year? </sentence><sentence id="501">Well, I was in fifth grade, right, so it was about 1940 when I entered the middle school. </sentence><sentence id="502">It was about 1940. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="506">Q: By that time, had any of the anti-Jewish legislation, I know there were a few things that Hungary had adopted, was that affecting your family at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="508">A: Well, yes, in a sense, that some people in the family, such as my aunt, who was very young, one of my father's sisters, and, was married also to a young, twenty-one or twenty-two year old man. </sentence><sentence id="509">He was called up to go to the eastern front and, and he go into labor battalions, in deg41, I'm talking about deg41 because that's when Germany declared war, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="510">Immediately, the very young, I think twenty-one old Jewish men were called up. </sentence><sentence id="511">They had to go to a certain place in their own clothes. </sentence><sentence id="512">They didn't get any uniform, anything, and taken to the eastern front immediately for mine, got to, to pick up mines, okay? </sentence><sentence id="513">And many of them without any previous experience and, and, and any schooling as to how to do it, of course, blew up. </sentence><sentence id="514">Now, the reason I am mentioning this because my father's sister who was very young and married to a young man, interestingly, when he was taken to the front, for some reason, somebody made a mistake and his unit was issued Hungarian army uniforms. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="547">Q: Back in the beginnings of the war, when there were, did your, did your family experience economic hardships when there were economic restrictions on Jewish . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="549">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="550">Obviously, everybody experienced this because the men were away and there were very, very few employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family. </sentence><sentence id="551">And so a lot of people were actually either starving, or the mother had to go and look for a job, or if the children were old enough, they had to go and work and do something. </sentence><sentence id="552">We were in a very good position, my mother and I, for a while, because my father's employer felt obligated to send us part of his regular monthly salary, so we did get money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: Let's come back to that and first, if you would, tell me how your father was taken away and when? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="559">A: Okay, my father was taken away several times. </sentence><sentence id="560">You know, Hungary was kind of a strange part of that Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in the hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murdering Jews. </sentence><sentence id="561">They were above this, and so therefore when the dictator of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government, most of the time that government would not eventually do everything that the Germans wanted them to do. </sentence><sentence id="562">So it was almost like playing musical chairs, I mean, Hungary's a very small country and you don't have that many politicians, aristocrats to go around, but almost the same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then maybe minister of interior, or something. </sentence><sentence id="563">So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti- Semitism, we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives. </sentence><sentence id="564">Because somehow that was below the dignity of that class. </sentence><sentence id="565">Not only that, some of those aristocrats were very Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British. </sentence><sentence id="566">And so in between, it depended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country. </sentence><sentence id="567">Some of them were a little bit more This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="568">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="569"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 German-oriented than others. </sentence><sentence id="570">And when, and more German-oriented came into the picture because the Germans didn't like the one who was in office, then he ordered that so and so is going to go and serve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion. </sentence><sentence id="571">My father was in the labor battalion before he was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so we could visit him, we could take food for him and eventually, when a new prime minister came, he declared that anybody over let's say, forty-five can go home. </sentence><sentence id="572">So there was no fear of being killed just because you are, you're a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="573">Up until 1944, March, when the Germans marched into Hungary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: So when your father was called to be taken away... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="593">A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was. </sentence><sentence id="594">I remember, he was not far from Budapest for awhile, for a few month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he was released, we could walk around a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="595">And so it was not the same thing as taken away to a faraway country where we had no idea what would happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="596">Now, there, there, then in 1942, he was taken away for, for good. </sentence><sentence id="597">For some reason, and I cannot really remember exactly what happened and why. </sentence><sentence id="598">We had, probably, a more radical prime minister who yielded to the Germans and let this contingent of Jewish labor battalions go outside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="599">I remember, even then, they, they were told which railroad station are they going to be going through in Budapest and they allowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit with him so we could talk over a few things. </sentence><sentence id="600">And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years until he came back after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="609">Q: And he, where did he go exactly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A: He went to, he was in a copper mine in Bor, B, O, R which is I think the nearest is NiS which is Serbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="612">And he was there, he was always telling me about what was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them. </sentence><sentence id="613">They had Croats, they had German, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not SS, but Hungarian, and I think that they had something, ve forgot what, but anyway, various nationalities were guarding them and probably Bosnians. </sentence><sentence id="614">And he mentioned when he came home, interestingly, he said, "Son," he said, "we never, we never really worried too much about anyone else guarding us except the Croatians." </sentence><sentence id="615">He said, "We had never seen such beasts as the Croatian SS was." </sentence><sentence id="616">They called them UstaSas, you know. </sentence><sentence id="617">He was there and I think, I, this is probably much better written than in my memory, I think about one hundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and what happened was when, when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back, The Germans decided to march them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern Yugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up these slaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp were killed and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 unfortunately we had to burn everything and we had to throw away his medals because it was very dangerous to be in the possession of anything that connects you to Tito. </sentence><sentence id="618">People were hanged all the time without not much reason, let alone if they find something on you. </sentence><sentence id="619">So, he was very bitter about this, and this turned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very pro-Yugoslavian. </sentence><sentence id="620">He would have been heartbroken to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he lived today. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="634"> End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: I would like to ask, you were just describing your, your father's experience in Bor and I wonder if when he was taken away to Bor if that, you and your mother and your father were recognizing that this was going to be the big one, as it were and if you can recall that separation and what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that physically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed. </sentence><sentence id="639">But an interesting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he survive if so many people died? </sentence><sentence id="640">And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, "Son, there were two kinds of people in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="641">We got a canteen of water every morning. </sentence><sentence id="642">The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves." </sentence><sentence id="643">And I said, "Half a canteen of water would make you clean?" </sentence><sentence id="644">He said, "No, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself." </sentence><sentence id="645">And he said, "And later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I'm not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I'm still caring about myself." </sentence><sentence id="646">So that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I'm sure, that was who survived. </sentence><sentence id="647">And of course luck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn't like your face or the way they moved. </sentence><sentence id="648">Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he's going to return, and she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time, especially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn't have heard from him because he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the battlefield. </sentence><sentence id="649">It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. </sentence><sentence id="650">And he came home in 1945, I remember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said, "Here I am." </sentence><sentence id="651">He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="652">He sent a friend up. </sentence><sentence id="653">A man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, "When did you hear from him?" </sentence><sentence id="654">and all this, and "Do you think he's alive?" </sentence><sentence id="655">and all this, and slowly he said, "Well, I have a feeling that he is alive," and slowly he led us to this. </sentence><sentence id="656">I remember him coming up on the stairs with a rucksack. </sentence><sentence id="657">The rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="658">And he knew that we were starving and so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="659">Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you needed to be, to stay a human being, the, we did not live in our apartment, we were moved, because you could not stay in your apartment. </sentence><sentence id="660">You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that had a big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="661">And because of the history of this house, we did not move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a Jewish house first. </sentence><sentence id="662">So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apartment in, that was 1944, summer when you had to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="663">It is not the primary source, and it has not been

</sentence><sentence id="665">We, the neighbors came, some of them, and said "We will keep this for you, and keep this for you," and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again. </sentence><sentence id="666">Or resurfaced again. </sentence><sentence id="667">They all, either the Russians took it, or the bombing or everything. </sentence><sentence id="668">It's all disappeared, and what could you do about it? </sentence><sentence id="669">You said okay. </sentence><sentence id="670">But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circling around and see, you know, what they can take. </sentence><sentence id="671">And then the apartment was given, all these Jewish apartments were given to bomb those people whose...Gentiles whose houses were bombed and they couldn't live in anymore. </sentence><sentence id="672">And I had no idea of course what happened to our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="673">We lived in a street called Rottenbiller Street, 667, and I, my first thing, we were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what happened to our apartment because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when we left. </sentence><sentence id="674">We just, we couldn't do anything with it, so. </sentence><sentence id="675">And when I came, when I went up there, I had this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I'm going to show these people whoever are there, that within two hours, I said I'm going to give them two hours to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="676">And here I was a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family and I was telling them to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="677">And the family consisted of a mother, father, a daughter and two sons. </sentence><sentence id="678">And they were tailors. </sentence><sentence id="679">And the old man was quite old, the father, was telling me, he said, "But, but, where can we go?" </sentence><sentence id="680">And I said, "Why did you come here?" </sentence><sentence id="681">And he said, "Well, we have, we have no place. </sentence><sentence id="682">Our, our house was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this is, this was a Jewish apartment, but still it was between this or living in the street, in the cold snowy January," so he said, "Could, could you do something, could, could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?" </sentence><sentence id="683">And so my mother came up and she said, "Why can't we just divide the place between us?" </sentence><sentence id="684">And here it was a two room apartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother and I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was just something that all of a sudden hit me. </sentence><sentence id="685">My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we were going to, we'll, we'll make it. </sentence><sentence id="686">And so we lived there under the same roof and we became very good friends. </sentence><sentence id="687">And when my father came home in late spring, the new government, Democratic government, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an empty apartment or, almost like a Justice of Peace. </sentence><sentence id="688">They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily, they were deputized. </sentence><sentence id="689">And my father was appointed to do this because he was always very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good, you know, with the new regime. </sentence><sentence id="690">And next to us, an apartment was full of old, old women who died one after another. </sentence><sentence id="691">It was a, like a Salvation Army place. </sentence><sentence id="692">They, they rented it and it became empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over there so we could get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I'm sorry I lost contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="693">But then, we had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two rooms were too many for three people. </sentence><sentence id="694">So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn't speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept. </sentence><sentence id="695">And she said, "I am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace." </sentence><sentence id="696">And so, and she kept it and she had it with her all the time. </sentence><sentence id="697">And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a temporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it way back between sheets. </sentence><sentence id="698">Now one day we came home and my mother said, "This, this place smells like cologne water, very  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 good cologne water," and she rushed to her cologne water in the armoir but these two

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="856">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="857">I also took a job. </sentence><sentence id="858">I was a messenger boy up until 19... until the yellow star came into existence...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="870">Q: And as the war progressed, was the next significant event then, would have been the German occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="872">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="873">1944, March, if I remember it, 19", is when the Germans had serious doubts apparently, that Hungary is not a trusted ally anymore, that Hungary probably entertains the idea of getting out of the war because by that time I think Romania was ready to jump and the situation in Italy was very shaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in a very right-wing government which was still a lot better than what came in 1944, October. </sentence><sentence id="874">That will be the other stage. </sentence><sentence id="875">But let's take a look at what happened when the Germans marched in, the yellow star had to be worn within a few weeks, or... So, the labor battalions were more intensified. </sentence><sentence id="876">Now everybody who was eighteen had to go, that was now, they lowered the limit and the deportations started. </sentence><sentence id="877">So, unfortunately, that was the worst thing, the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="878">They started in the countryside, eventually coming to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="879">They were supposed to come to Budapest, you know, by the fall. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="892">Q: How did you manage to avoid being deported yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="894">A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt, the one who gained this special status, said to me, "Please, I just have some very bad feelings, I don't want you to go today out and work. </sentence><sentence id="895">Stay home, stay with me." </sentence><sentence id="896">She took me to her apartment and that was the day when it happened. </sentence><sentence id="897">It was just a, just a miraculous instinct that she had. </sentence><sentence id="898">And that is what saved me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="904">Q: Did life take a turn after that, after the German occupation did you feel, were you able to feed yourself and your mother adequately? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="906">A: Well, what I did was, I gathered, I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found that the best way to do this whole thing is first to get some papers that would qualify us--at least to those who don't know us--as Christians. </sentence><sentence id="907">So I took my mother's jewellries, sold it, and bought papers. </sentence><sentence id="908">And the papers were blank and you had to fill it out. </sentence><sentence id="909">And I did that. </sentence><sentence id="910">Also, I got some papers and I fill it out with the same name from a cousin of mine who was adopted but had birth certificate and everything else that pertained to the fact that he was a Gentile. </sentence><sentence id="911">And his parents gave me his papers too so I had kind of this double insurance, moving around, in case I needed it. </sentence><sentence id="912">For a while, I did not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="913">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="914"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 use these papers. </sentence><sentence id="915">I waited until, you know, we got the point where it was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="916">Also, there was a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a telephone call to find out if you had false birth certificates. </sentence><sentence id="917">All they had to do is call the principality, you know, and that, that municipality and check, okay? </sentence><sentence id="918">And so, actually, we waited until practically the first village fell and, after that, it was much easier to fill it out, to a town or a village that had, that was already occupied under occu... Soviet occupation because they couldn't check anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="934">Q: And after that point, did you use those papers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period when we were moving a lot. </sentence><sentence id="937">First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of one of my father's friends. </sentence><sentence id="938">They were Seventh-Day Adventists. </sentence><sentence id="939">And they offered their place but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews so after consultation, we left. </sentence><sentence id="940">Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street, hearing, feeling, looking, what can happen? </sentence><sentence id="941">Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school which was designated as a clothing supply business for the Hungarian army and it was really a refuge for, for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="942">They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired fake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they were actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and, and, so I was always, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at what seems safe at the moment. </sentence><sentence id="943">And it is possible that something that was safe one week became unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place when he was walking down the street, going into places, "Here is a Jew, doesn't wear a yellow star, what is he doing?" </sentence><sentence id="944">And so, your life depended on nuances, those days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="954">Q: So you just took off the yellow star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="956">A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the yellow star and said, "You stay with me," and then my mother came there, too. </sentence><sentence id="957">And this is how we got to this house in Zichy Jeno Street, One, in the Fifth District of Budapest. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="972">A: Well, we, whenever there was a, up until we had to leave our own apartment, when there was a bombing we lived in the cellar, you know, sometimes for hours. </sentence><sentence id="973">But usually, the bombings came at night, so, I, one thing that war taught me how to be very organized because there was no light. </sentence><sentence id="974">You couldn't turn on the light. </sentence><sentence id="975">No, that was a major offense. </sentence><sentence id="976">If they saw any light, when the sirens went This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="977">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="978"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 off, they, they considered you collaborating with the, with the enemy, you know, giving signals. </sentence><sentence id="979">So, I had to lay out all my stuff and in the darkness I could pick every one of my clothes and still do, to run down. </sentence><sentence id="980">We had seconds to run down in the bombing, started. </sentence><sentence id="981">Usually, there was no really intense bombing of Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="982">Most of the bombers, many times, Americans, were flying over to Romania, to Ploesti, to bomb the oil fields. </sentence><sentence id="983">There was really not much to bomb in Budapest, was not very badly bombed. </sentence><sentence id="984">Budapest was, Budapest was mainly destroyed during that siege from December until January 18. </sentence><sentence id="985">That was the main reason for the destruction. </sentence><sentence id="986">But before that, there was not that much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1004">Q: So, when was it that you moved in with your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1006">A: It was late fall, in 1944, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Late fall that... when we felt that that place was the best place to be. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And then it turned out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there was a famous Hungarian psychiatrist. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Psychiatry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early stage. </sentence><sentence id="1010">This man became very famous and since there weren't too many, a great deal of his clientele were famous politicians, actors, actresses, writers. </sentence><sentence id="1011">So he was well-known all over the place and he had this idea that he is going to save his family and friends by number one, contacting a fascist officer and I've no idea how he did it, who wants to save his skin and is willing to play this game of declaring the house a clinic and, and do everything possible to save the people inside the house and then he found this man and his name was Jereczian Ara George. </sentence><sentence id="1012">And this is in reverse order because Hungarian names are in reverse order. </sentence><sentence id="1013">The last name is what we consider first so in English you would say George Ara Jereczian. </sentence><sentence id="1014">The, I remember him, a very handsome man, a very, kind of a man of stature and a fascist uniform, hand grenades hanging from his belt. </sentence><sentence id="1015">I mean, he was intimidating to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1016">To, with us, he was very kind. </sentence><sentence id="1017">The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors and families in that apartment house jammed, absolutely jammed. </sentence><sentence id="1018">While we could still live upstairs, probably there were at least five to ten people to a room. </sentence><sentence id="1019">When we lived in the basement, no one is to tell, we were just side by side on mattresses because when the siege of Budapest started, you couldn't live upstairs anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1020">So this man moved in with a few of his men who apparently were loyal to him and his girlfriend and they set up their headquarters there and they were practically like a, a, a support group. </sentence><sentence id="1021">The clinic had its official emblem there and the whole operation looked like it was a legal operation to save anybody who is injured.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1087">Q: At that time, was, were you and your mother aware of the so-called Final Solution and what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1089">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1090">My mother somehow, well, first of all the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what happened to the Jews who were taken away to concentration camps and death camps but by the that time it was well known in Hungary too, what the deportations, how the deportations end up. </sentence><sentence id="1091">So my mother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to kind of keep her spirit up and, constantly reminding her that there are certain things we can't change and she still has to live for her own little immediate family. </sentence><sentence id="1092">But yes, we were very much aware, very much aware. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and up until 1944, March, or April when the radios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And I learned from my father, I was six years old when I learned from my father that there is more to news than just the Hungarian papers and the Hungarian radio. </sentence><sentence id="1095">He would close the shutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of course, he would lock the doors and he would listen to BBC. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Ata very early age and would tell me that this is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Eventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a device that was on top of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to find people who listened to foreign broadcasts. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And it was punishable also by going to concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1109">Q: And yet, despite your awareness of what was happening elsewhere in Europe, you and your mother remained, or at least your mother remained optimistic enough to find you a tutor and to... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1111">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1112">Yes.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1140">A: No, those who were in the house, they were allowed to stay, which is obvious, I mean, anybody who would have been tossed out would have had to go to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And it was, to most people, it was clear that eventually the ghetto is going to be annihilated. </sentence><sentence id="1142">There was no other way, since Budapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you do with it? </sentence><sentence id="1143">They built a huge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors, they would just detonate the whole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews survive if the siege had lasted another week or so. </sentence><sentence id="1144">The lucky thing is that they just ran out of time. </sentence><sentence id="1145">I, of course I was never in the ghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could stay, and a lot of other families moved in, practically all of them connected to famous Hungarian doctors. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1838">A: It's hard for me to look back but I would say we had at least thirty doctors there, at least. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And we are talking about the cream of, of the Hungarian Jewish doctors, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1840">Really, they went out and famous professors from universities so this man, this Doctor Velgyessi&gt; who was the psychiatrist living in the house originally, he had a very large circle of friends, and so he managed to gather the ones that he could and brought them in. </sentence><sentence id="1841">And there were many other people, I don't know how they got there. </sentence><sentence id="1842">I just read a few years ago that the chief architect of Budapest, the main architect of Budapest today, was with me in the basement in this house. </sentence><sentence id="1843">I... somebody sent me, I think, a newspaper article or while in visiting in Budapest I saw it, he gave an interview about it. </sentence><sentence id="1844">Because it was the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Budapest this year. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1866">Q: So he had made just a complete break from the Arrow Cross? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1868">A: Yes, apparently, apparently and why he even joined them and what was his job there, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1869">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1870">Since I left in 1948, you know, and I think that probably it took a few years to write about these things and clear up this thing and I was not there in these, from "48 to 50. </sentence><sentence id="1871">And after I came back, you just didn't want to, those were the worst years of Stalinism and you didn't want to get involved with anything because you didn't know what he was doing at that time and so, no questions asked was the best policy. </sentence><sentence id="1872">But, later on in the sixties and seventies, I heard that he was a concert impressario and that he took certain shows back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1873">And I even saw his name and Iam, I really regret that I didn't go to see him. </sentence><sentence id="1874">I should have looked for him somehow and talked to him. </sentence><sentence id="1875">So I feel so strongly about this whole thing that if I knew today that he is still alive, living, I would probably go to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1876">That's where he lived and, and, and just thank him again. </sentence><sentence id="1877">But I know that he received a great deal of recognition from people. </sentence><sentence id="1878">But I know, I don't know exactly what, if he's alive today. </sentence><sentence id="1879">He was, I would say, about ten, at least ten, fifteen years older than I, so it's hard to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1898">A: What did I do after that? </sentence><sentence id="1899">Well, I did what probably is a natural thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1900">I went with the Russian soldiers and whenever they broke into a store and they broke into every store that still had anything, I went with them. </sentence><sentence id="1901">And after they were through and took what they wanted to take, I took what I wanted to take. </sentence><sentence id="1902">In other words, I did what we called zabralny which means to confiscate things. </sentence><sentence id="1903">I was full of hate, I was full of frustration and I thought this, this was the way to get even, probably. </sentence><sentence id="1904">And, I had a little store at home, a kind of a little supply of all these stolen goods that I got from shops that were just there, most people wouldn't dare to go in with the Russians, but I put back my yellow star and I went with them and unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous anti- Semites and beat the hell out of you, the, the others, they, they were welcoming you. </sentence><sentence id="1905">They said go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="1906">Also, we had a, a little Jewish domestic from Romania with us, who joined us and helped my, my mother and she also spent the last few months with us in this, in this basement. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And she was from Romania and with the Russians we had Romanian troops coming in. </sentence><sentence id="1908">And she was a beautiful young girl, nineteen, and the Romanian officers were just, just absolutely crazy about her. </sentence><sentence id="1909">So she took me by the hand and she said, "Come with me." </sentence><sentence id="1910">And she went with these Romanians to all the jewelry stores and she amassed a fortune within days in jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And then said goodbye to us and disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1912">We never found out what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="1913">She had a fiancee in Romania, whether she found him or not, we suspected she eventually ended up in Israel like most young people of that time. </sentence><sentence id="1914">But I went with her and Romanian officers, I went with Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1915">I was kind of a street urchin for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1916">I enjoyed the fact that nobody, nobody can really give me any orders. </sentence><sentence id="1917">And my mother could not control me either, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1918">I was now a man and I was just intoxicated by this, and so I had a little store there, that, with all the stolen goods, and my father saw this when he came home and found out, asked me what happened and I told him. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And he was absolutely just horrified that I would do something like this and made me take everything back to the stores where I got it from. </sentence><sentence id="1920">It was interesting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came with me and he stayed outside and I had to deliver it back. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And I tell you, some of those people could not believe that this happened. </sentence><sentence id="1922">And today, of course, I feel very good about this but not, not at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1923">So, in, it took me only a year or two to realize that I, my real emotions that I'm not a Hungarian, I never had a Hungarian passport, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1924">I never had any, any identity, Hungarian identity. </sentence><sentence id="1925">They, I was always being denied of being a Hungarian even though my parents were born in Hungary and practically everybody back generations born in Hungary and so I joined the Zionist Movement. </sentence><sentence id="1926">And in 1948, the, the, the Communists completely took over the government. </sentence><sentence id="1927">They called it the Year of Turn. </sentence><sentence id="1928">And all other organizations except for Communist youth organizations were banned. </sentence><sentence id="1929">So again now I was in the underground Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="1930">End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1970">A: Well, I told you, before, that, it, we knew because of an emissary that he had sent ahead of him who then by small dosage made us aware of the fact that he was alive, that he was coming, but of course, it was a tremendous emotional experience for him to appear there and, the fact that he immediately This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1971">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1972"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 understood why there are two families living in the apartment and, and, and accepted our decision, it was just a very nice homecoming. </sentence><sentence id="1973">Because number one, we saw him, number two he brought food, which helped us to have a little feast then, and number three is that he, we knew that that's what he would have done, he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four, family of five who were out of their own, well, problems, housed in our place. </sentence><sentence id="1974">We... naturally, we were totally just overwhelmed by emotions for awhile and then, set out to see the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence id="1975">He wanted to see his brothers and sisters and, and, that's, this is what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="1994">Kay? </sentence><sentence id="1995">And, then shortly we moved back with my mother and so after a few months, I think it must have been April or May when my father finally appeared. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2002">Q: And you, during that few months, food was very scarce? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2004">A: It was, very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="2005">But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role in saving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up and went, which was very customary then for city people to do, took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers might like to have and we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty kilometer, about twenty miles from Budapest, and exchange it for food. </sentence><sentence id="2006">We also hired a person with a horse to drag it back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="2007">It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of course, a horse was immediately a red flag in, in the eyes of the Russians because they confiscated every horse, everything that could be used for transporting their goods. </sentence><sentence id="2008">And we were caught midway between this place and Budapest, coming back, in a small Danubian village. </sentence><sentence id="2009">On the other side of the Danube, there was a battle going on. </sentence><sentence id="2010">And we knew that it doesn't affect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the Germans didn't have any means to get over and why would they come over, but there was a battle over there because Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet. </sentence><sentence id="2011">And so the Russians were very edgy and they confiscated the cart, they confiscated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also incarcerated my aunt and myself. </sentence><sentence id="2012">And I have no idea what happened, but the next... my aunt was with me in the room and the, the Russian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few hours later and she said, "Don't worry, everything is going to be fine." </sentence><sentence id="2013">And the next morning, we were given back the cart, the horse, the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And I can only guess what was the price. </sentence><sentence id="2015">The only thing I regret is that we heard that after delivering the stuff to our home and sharing it with the family, when the, the farmer whose, who had the horse and the cart went back, eventually, was caught and lost both. </sentence><sentence id="2016">So yes, if you had still some belongings that farmers would appreciate, you could have food. </sentence><sentence id="2017">Because the farmers always have food. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2045">A: Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high school at the age of eighteen. </sentence><sentence id="2046">And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my Zionist Organization give me signals that it was time to go to Israel because they couldn't guarantee that we would have more time. </sentence><sentence id="2047">The Communist Police was and the border guards were really closing everything very tightly. </sentence><sentence id="2048">So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to my family and get either an instrument or an instrument case, that was instruction number one. </sentence><sentence id="2049">Then I was called by my Zionist leaders and, and asked if it is true that my mother comes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="2050">They said, "Do us a favor. </sentence><sentence id="2051">Go to that town, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your mother is related," and all this and that, "and ask them if they would like to have a high school orchestra to play a concert in town. </sentence><sentence id="2052">And if they say yes," --which probably they would, they said, because which little town doesn't like a free concert-- "go to a printer, here is money and have nice posters printed." </sentence><sentence id="2053">And they give me the date. </sentence><sentence id="2054">I went, I talked to the mayor, he was overwhelmed, I went to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn't realize at that time that this was the alibi just in case we would be caught because this town is on the way to the border, my mother's birthplace. </sentence><sentence id="2055">On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state-owned bus by that time from a state-owned company. </sentence><sentence id="2056">We were all either holding an instrument or having an instrument case so people thought this was a high school orchestra and while singing Communist songs, we took off for the border. </sentence><sentence id="2057">On the border, when we got close to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver said that he was hungry, we were hungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was in 1948, February. </sentence><sentence id="2058">We were eating there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt with the bus driver. </sentence><sentence id="2059">And we were horrified because that would, everything would cause a problem, we, we knew that we had a definite plan. </sentence><sentence id="2060">And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take about a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, "All right, go." </sentence><sentence id="2061">And as soon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he said, "Go across this field and there is a barn there and don't ask any questions, just get into the barn." </sentence><sentence id="2062">That's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2063">They closed the barn and around midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly River which is the river between Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to our great amazement, who was leading us?--the peasant woman who was in the pub. </sentence><sentence id="2064">She shed her twelve skirts or so because those

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2682">A: Well, it was much more pleasant than I had envisioned, frankly. </sentence><sentence id="2683">I found that there is a very large segment of a new German generation that is, is absolutely appalled, okay, of the past. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And I met a lot of intellectuals who had a very good vision of the past, and not only that, they spread the knowledge around. </sentence><sentence id="2685">Naturally, there is an element in, in Germany, that is, you know, that is the scum of earth, but frankly, they are very much the minority. </sentence><sentence id="2686">And I, I could live in Germany much easier, probably, than I could ever live in Austria, where it doesn't take more than a few minutes to hear somebody making an anti-Semitic or fascist remark, especially if they have a couple of beer. </sentence><sentence id="2687">You know. </sentence><sentence id="2688">So, there is, there is a new Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2689">Now, with East Germany joining, it is a problem. </sentence><sentence id="2690">But West Germany itself, was, I would say, a pretty civilized state. </sentence><sentence id="2691">Okay, now the East Germans, that's a different, that's a, that's a tragedy right now, that they had not been instructed by the proper history teachers, and, there are big problems in East Germany because the East Germans said, "The Nazis, oh no, they live in West Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2692">We, we are good Communists here, we don't have to worry about the past." </sentence><sentence id="2693">And this attitude then led to what is happening nowadays in Germany with the skinheads. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2772">A: Her name was Aranka, that is Goldie in English, you know, Aranka, and Teply, T-E-P-L-Y. She's still living in Hungary at this date and probably it would be very difficult to communicate with her because she is number one, old, and number two, I think that she has some mental problems that she developed since the war and, but she certainly is the heroine of the whole story and my survival, so I try to keep up with her but it's very, very difficult and I'm very, very sorry about that. </sentence><sentence id="2773">But she has a son who lives in Switzerland so at this point she's still alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2776">Q: I didn't quite understand how just go back a little bit, when you lived in the house on Zichy Jeno Street, before it became a clinic, it was a Jewish house. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2788">A: Non-Jews, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2790">Q: And I suppose your aunt was considered one of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2792">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2794">Q: But before the house was designated a clinic, if anyone in the house were to be liquida... were to be put into the ghetto, would they have gone apartment by apartment, or would they have taken the entire house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2796">A: They would have gone apartment by apartment and, of course, if you could prove that you are a gentile, and that was very easy because every concierge had a list, years ago this was a law in Hungary, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-Jews way back, because when you change your residence in Europe, you have to go to the police and report it. </sentence><sentence id="2797">In other words, every European country, they know who is at that point where. </sentence><sentence id="2798">And so this list existed, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the concierges were basically serving the government, they were in my estimate, what I call the common man, and their attitude changed regarding of what the government was doing and they were lackeys and so there was no big problem, they always could tell who were the gentiles and who were not by just showing the list. </sentence><sentence id="2799">But there were gentiles still living in the Jewish houses who had a nice place and they just didn't want to move, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2800">And so when, for example, at one time we were lined up because the house was discovered and this George Ara Jereczian was not there with his guards. </sentence><sentence id="2801">I think they went to buy, get some rations for the house, and so we were really without any defense, and we were lined up, then the gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently they had known what was going on and could identify themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2808">Q: But you were lined up although you lived with your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2810">A: We were, yes, we were lined up, we were lined up. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And then in the last moment, a lot of things happened. </sentence><sentence id="2812">This aunt of mine, for example, she was also out, most people who could go on the street were always out looking for something to eat and bring home and when she saw her mother, for example, in the lineup, she just went up to her and started to kick her and said, "This stupid slut. </sentence><sentence id="2813">Just, she is so stupid. </sentence><sentence id="2814">Every time people say line up, she lines up, she's not Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="2815">And all this, and in front of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged her mother out of the line up and she had a personality that nobody argued with her. </sentence><sentence id="2816">So they assume that she is a gentile, therefore her mother is a gentile, too. </sentence><sentence id="2817">And then we were saved because George Ara Jereczian came home and immediately, his men immediately went to these punks and said, you know, "Clear out of here in short order, papers and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="2818">And if you want, you know, we'll call the Ministry of Defense." </sentence><sentence id="2819">And so, they knew their job and threatened these people who then left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2830">Q: You mentioned that there were about ten people living in that apartment with your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2840">Q: And some of them were her brothers and sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2842">A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my mother, then my father's three sisters, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2843">Among them this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually my father's two brothers, too, joined us. </sentence><sentence id="2844">They were also under some kind of a disguise as policemen or this and that in whatever uniform they could get, but when things were really tough the last, I think, ten days or two weeks, they joined us, so they were there, too. </sentence><sentence id="2845">Then there were some husbands, my, one of my aunts had a husband and a boyfriend. </sentence><sentence id="2846">It was a triangle that the family just tolerated because the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the husband, everybody, so there was even humor then. </sentence><sentence id="2847">And some children. </sentence><sentence id="2848">So we might, it's possible we were even more than ten and that was very fortunate, a lot of apartments have a lot more than just ten people because this was, it sound like, it seemed like a safe haven and of course, all the relatives were coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very famous doctors were there who then went on and came to this country and elsewhere and the whole family was there, so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2856">Q: What about her other brothers and sisters, other than those who were in the apartment? </sentence><sentence id="2857">Where did they... were they at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2860">A: Oh, my aunt's other, well, we were all together in the same apartment, it was her apartment and because ordinarily a gentile would not have had anything to do with Jews, but this was an extraordinary place because we, she knew that if they really stormed the house, the Arrow Cross people, and if they really eliminate George Ara Jereczian and his guards, then everything is lost, it doesn't make any difference, so... and inside the house, of course, there was absolutely no other rule except you made up your own so nobody cared. </sentence><sentence id="2861">Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2864">Q: But she had, there were thirteen all together, siblings, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2866">A: Yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2868">Q: So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2870">A: No, no, no, no, thirteen, my father had thirteen brothers and sisters and some of them were already dead and others were elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2871">One was in what was Slovakia at that time and participated in the Slovak uprising against the Germans and was hanged, was captured and hanged. </sentence><sentence id="2872">My father was in Yugoslavia, so there were, another was in a labor camp, we didn't even know where he was, so they were dispersed. </sentence><sentence id="2873">The women were together, the women we could get together and, but the men, only two of them. </sentence><sentence id="2874">So there were altogether five, five of the thirteen, right there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2906">A: He was in his, I would say, late 50's in 1945, but he had a son and two daughters and a relatively younger wife, so I assume that they are somewhere and I also assume that they are not in Hungary, that they are probably in the U.S., so if ever there is a reunion, I will see them. </sentence><sentence id="2907">As a matter of fact, I would like to see them because I was deeply in love with one of the, the little Velgyessi girls. </sentence><sentence id="2908">I was a young kid then, it was just a puppy love. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2924">A: Oh, we went through the same experience and nobody... in that house, the only people who were taken away were a man between eighteen and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or eighteen and fifty-five, before, before October 15th when the labor, when they truly were just going to a labor camp, labor organizations, that is when all the men, so there were no men until October 15th, between eighteen and fifty-five in that house, they were all taken away. </sentence><sentence id="2925">So, some of the families who lived there, for example, their father was not with them by that time. </sentence><sentence id="2926">And, I don't know of anybody who survived. </sentence><sentence id="2927">In other words, unfortunately, most of these people were then in a forced march toward Germany at the end of the war and somewhere in, probably western Hungary, they were just either killed or died of typhus. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2949">A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little left in our apartment, what was left, a couple of boxes, and I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched. </sentence><sentence id="2950">And that, to me, was immediately, I give them some good points for that. </sentence><sentence id="2951">But when I opened it, our apartment got a direct hit when the siege of Budapest took place and so a lot of the... and most of these boxes contained tablecloth or sheets or something like that, and so they all had big holes in them. </sentence><sentence id="2952">And, however, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins we had for a long time until they disintegrated. </sentence><sentence id="2953">My wife mended them and we used them. </sentence><sentence id="2954">And now, what happened to the furniture?A lot we give to neighbors to say, "If we come back, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and if we are not, then it is yours," so, and they took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they can give back to us. </sentence><sentence id="2955">They all said the same thing: the Russians took it. </sentence><sentence id="2956">Now, this was the most illogical, stupid thing to say, because the Russian soldiers had two hands, what are they going to do with a piano? </sentence><sentence id="2957">What are they going to do with a table, what do they need it? </sentence><sentence id="2958">The Russians only went for one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2959">Watches. </sentence><sentence id="2960">They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen watches before, that was the only thing. </sentence><sentence id="2961">They stop you on the street and that was the only question, "Davay chasi\" That means, "Give me your watch." </sentence><sentence id="2962">Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot soldier who is going on and on and on across Europe, what is he going to do with anything that takes up space and has weight? </sentence><sentence id="2963">And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely nothing was returned from the neighbors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2980">Q: Did any of your friends from before the war return afterwards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2982">A: Any of my friends? </sentence><sentence id="2983">Well, as I mentioned before, my class, junior high class, was practically totally taken and deported under those very unusual circumstances, so I had to look for the kids who were not my schoolmates, but, or either lower or higher classes, and also the ones that I used to play with when I went to the city park which was not far away from us. </sentence><sentence id="2984">And I would say that about half of them I found, but the other half perished, you know, either because of the fires, you know there was bombs, or because they were killed during the Arrow Cross era, after October 15th. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2988">Q: You, in our last interview, had talked a little bit about meeting up with some of your friends around Budapest and that you would talk about the war and that was exclusively what you would talk about. </sentence><sentence id="2989">When you met up with them again after the war, what did you talk about then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2992">A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were looking for some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And part of it was they give away shirts, we found a Communist Party. </sentence><sentence id="2994">Imagine, we were fifteen year olds and we saw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts. </sentence><sentence id="2995">And we found out that the flaming red shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply parachutes that were dropped by the Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and the Communist Party made a kind of a campaign and made it into shirts and would give them to anybody who signed up. </sentence><sentence id="2996">And I think this drew us a lot more than anything else, the four very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the illegal boy scout organization and, luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2997">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2998"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Communist Party and I think this is the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party because, now we went to a couple of meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to American communists, too. </sentence><sentence id="2999">Signed up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we never really considered ourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members for a month and then we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our first step was to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist Party, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be the one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in--on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="3000">So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3001">And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit. </sentence><sentence id="3002">So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts. </sentence><sentence id="3003">But our heart was not in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. </sentence><sentence id="3004">And so now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just lost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="3005">Then, you know, this was, another year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="3006">They just, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am going to have a homeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure. </sentence><sentence id="3007">Immediately, they send me up in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instruction, more than one, on more than one occasion. </sentence><sentence id="3008">And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at learning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life. </sentence><sentence id="3010">My only conflict was with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="3011">Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious, but rebellious enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home where first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group. </sentence><sentence id="3012">There were many, there were many in Hungary, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this as a lifestyle. </sentence><sentence id="3013">And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3014">And my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home and one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, anti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me and all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I moved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for Jewish orphans. </sentence><sentence id="3015">That was on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda section of Budapest where I found a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous man, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer* and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt very much at home, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of there. </sentence><sentence id="3016">Even I had a  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 girlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they were very happy days. </sentence><sentence id="3017">And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventually they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to Israel, that was after, but we'll get to this. </sentence><sentence id="3018">Now I want to talk just a little bit about school because all these times I went to school, too. </sentence><sentence id="3019">Right after the, 1945, as soon as the school started, my mother was determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high schools were specialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for Commerce. </sentence><sentence id="3020">Can you stop it for a second because I want to close the window. </sentence><sentence id="3021">So as I said, my mother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I started at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the first half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that time can just about do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3022">So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate this, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, "No, I am not going to do that." </sentence><sentence id="3023">There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating. </sentence><sentence id="3024">He was not just making statements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years and my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout movement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the organizers. </sentence><sentence id="3025">And I went to see him and I said, "This man should be removed from the school." </sentence><sentence id="3026">And they did take him in and somehow they went down the list at school and found out that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in class and so. .

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3065">Q: Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3067">A: I just had to quit. </sentence><sentence id="3068">And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same experience again and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was a school to educate future teachers, but it was a high school still. </sentence><sentence id="3069">Just like my previous high school was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a teaching high school, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that once you finished--and it was instead of four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished the school--you were then an elementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any college education. </sentence><sentence id="3070">I was there at this school and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad experience, I didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="3071">Now I was among my own people, there were some very, very good friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special, it was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

eventually, and we will go back to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really finished my high school. </sentence><sentence id="3075">But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. </sentence><sentence id="3076">So I had a high school diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so these are the two schools. </sentence><sentence id="3077">Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for, high school for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps Lyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious. </sentence><sentence id="3078">Now, going back, of course in the meantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go practically underground. </sentence><sentence id="3079">As the communist regime established itself in Hungary and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every Eastern European country, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in Eastern Europe, those countries that knew what democracy was. </sentence><sentence id="3080">And Hungary had some very able politicians and was really on its road to become a democracy, so was Czechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of course, Romania was very different. </sentence><sentence id="3081">But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became, again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it. </sentence><sentence id="3082">So we were doing, basically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and meetings were held usually either in some far away synagogues, basements or in some Jewish orphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because there were hundreds of people living there anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3083">The, many times we paraded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing communist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business. </sentence><sentence id="3084">By 1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as many people out as possible, fearing that if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also completely communist, that there will be no way from Hungary to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="3085">By that time we could only go illegally across the border. </sentence><sentence id="3086">And I think it was in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little northern town, Vacz, V-A-C-Z, my mother comes from that town and they knew it. </sentence><sentence id="3087">My job was to go to the mayor of the town and ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert on some given date. </sentence><sentence id="3088">I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many times because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was born here, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a high school orchestra is coming to play. </sentence><sentence id="3089">I then went to a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed advertising the date and the concert. </sentence><sentence id="3090">Went back, reported it and the next command was that on a certain day, I would have to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a corner of Budapest and there would be a bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus company was nationalized, and I have to board the bus with a lot of other people and I have to pretend that I am a member of a high school band, whatever instrument I am playing, and do, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel, anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="3091">And just wait for further instructions there. </sentence><sentence id="3092">And of course, I was notified that this is it, that we would be going to Israel and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case, boarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who were in my group, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3127">Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism appealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that you were involved in and hearing a little bit more about how you felt about the politics of the time and the communist takeover. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3129">A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper middle class or upper class. </sentence><sentence id="3130">I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle class or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class. </sentence><sentence id="3131">My father came from a very low class proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3132">My mother came from a little petit bourgeois family from the northern Hungarian town. </sentence><sentence id="3133">They thought they were middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but there was not much work and a lot of complaining. </sentence><sentence id="3134">Now, because I never had a very, let's say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious. </sentence><sentence id="3135">Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them. </sentence><sentence id="3136">They were the most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. </sentence><sentence id="3137">I was, you can consider even though I was not a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't consider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a lot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I would go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3138">But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at home. </sentence><sentence id="3139">And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist takeover in Eastern Europe was not a very pleasant occasion. </sentence><sentence id="3140">And one only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to eliminate anyone who disagreed with them. </sentence><sentence id="3141">And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they became. </sentence><sentence id="3142">And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or another, there was no law. </sentence><sentence id="3143">The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that. </sentence><sentence id="3144">My father, he was always a Social Democrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3145">And he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, "Excuse me, but I don't want to join you." </sentence><sentence id="3146">Which was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched. </sentence><sentence id="3147">The fact that he comes from a working class and was a very little fish, I think saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="3148">But if he had been a name, probably he would have been killed then. </sentence><sentence id="3149">And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be peace here. </sentence><sentence id="3150">And, do you have any other questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3185">A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better world is coming. </sentence><sentence id="3186">And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms in the countryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in Poland, in Slovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they were always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="3187">That disappointed me, people were killed, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a pogrom in Hungary and in some other Eastern European countries, two years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3188">And that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3193">Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3215">A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. </sentence><sentence id="3216">The whole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we wanted to have. </sentence><sentence id="3217">We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just working in a kibbutz as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are running around like ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going to have a country, I have a home, I will have a fatherland and it was, it was a marvelous feeling. </sentence><sentence id="3218">And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3219">And all of a sudden these people come from Israel, they are beautiful looking people. </sentence><sentence id="3220">And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs, people that, those who are sent, I think, literally. </sentence><sentence id="3221">And they were in charge of all these camps where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a tree in one camp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we had to stay up, and sleep up there and make our bed and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3222">I mean, which young person doesn't like this? </sentence><sentence id="3223">The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mind and we said, "God, it's This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3224">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3225"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 beautiful." </sentence><sentence id="3226">And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger. </sentence><sentence id="3227">I remember once I was up in the Boerzseny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense camp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a creek, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess who is the one who escaped from the creek in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were released. </sentence><sentence id="3228">The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders. </sentence><sentence id="3229">And he escaped, he escaped in that creek, crawling in twenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the rocks, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people. </sentence><sentence id="3230">And women, you know, it's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3231">I mean, and when I took my wife to Israel, she understood that, that there was just something about those kids. </sentence><sentence id="3232">And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them. </sentence><sentence id="3233">And they were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got quite introverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal example, they were leaders because we followed them. </sentence><sentence id="3234">So the, the bus going back to my escape from Hungary, the bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop there. </sentence><sentence id="3235">Beyond Vacz, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we stop somewhere and eat and there was a roadside pub where they also served food. </sentence><sentence id="3236">We went in and we were given money and we could order something, and in that pub, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. </sentence><sentence id="3237">And she started to flirt with the bus driver. </sentence><sentence id="3238">And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and they had a good time and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to create a big problem here, right? </sentence><sentence id="3239">We knew that we were on a timetable. </sentence><sentence id="3240">All of a sudden, the bus driver said to our leader, "How long do you think we will be here?" </sentence><sentence id="3241">And our leader said, "Well, all these kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes." </sentence><sentence id="3242">He said, "Good, I'll be back." </sentence><sentence id="3243">and left with the woman. </sentence><sentence id="3244">We ate, and our leader said, "Okay, line up outside." </sentence><sentence id="3245">And instead of going back to the bus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would say about one mile down in a muddy field, it was February and snow and mud everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="3246">We all got into the barn, about thirty of us, they closed the doors, barn doors, and he said, "Okay, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="3247">Everything will be okay." </sentence><sentence id="3248">After midnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opened and we were, they said we have to get on line and marched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, and that was the border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="3249">The Austrian border was already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups come over, it was kind of an arrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't know which border, Czech border guard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="3250">And once we went beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this. </sentence><sentence id="3251">So as we were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her hip in blue jeans. </sentence><sentence id="3252">I looked at this woman's face, said, "Hey, I have seen her before." </sentence><sentence id="3253">And I looked and said, "This is the woman in the pub." </sentence><sentence id="3254">This is to show you how organized they were. </sentence><sentence id="3255">I mean, the Germans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization. </sentence><sentence id="3256">I mean, everything, if you understood the whole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3257">If you understood that, how they did it, you can understand how they could survive. </sentence><sentence id="3258">All right? </sentence><sentence id="3259">Surrounded by, of course, a sea of enemies. </sentence><sentence id="3260">Once we got down to the river, we had to take our shoes off, and we kept everything on our head, the river was not high enough, we couldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small, and it got to my throat at one time. </sentence><sentence id="3261">Now this is February, imagine. </sentence><sentence id="3262">We got over to the other side This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3263">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3264"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 and it was supposed to be that the border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and something happened and the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they were still talking to each other. </sentence><sentence id="3265">There was snow on the ground and the dogs, their dogs were barking, so we had to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet. </sentence><sentence id="3266">And many of us got sick, right there. </sentence><sentence id="3267">I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that. </sentence><sentence id="3268">Now, then the border guards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes, it was a grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I don't think I have ever been colder in my life since then. </sentence><sentence id="3269">And so we huddled together because now we missed the truck that was supposed to pick us up right down on a highway beyond that hill, so the Israelis, the two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us, they went down and eventually, in about four or five hours, they located the truck, the truck came back, the truck was looking for us and then left and then, anyway the truck came back, we got up on the truck, the canvas, the top was taken down, and from there on, all we heard was the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were halted and the word dollar, the word dollar came back all the time, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3270">End of Tape 5, Side B Tape 6, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3329">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. </sentence><sentence id="3330">So you'll say something about the group of people that you were with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3333">A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. </sentence><sentence id="3334">He lives in Israel at this time still, in Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we kept up and I consider him my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="3335">He's about the only person I keep up with. </sentence><sentence id="3336">Oh no, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what happened, I just know that he's living there. </sentence><sentence id="3337">But the others, the, I remember one young lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to Vienna, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in Vienna of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the cemetery and I always planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably there is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going to find out because my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so he would know. </sentence><sentence id="3338">Now, after the truck finally stopped in Bratislava. </sentence><sentence id="3339">In Bratislava they took us to the gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue, they took us to the synagogue that had already warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets, good food, everything, and we were told that next morning we are going on. </sentence><sentence id="3340">And it was very strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was a big show, of course, all just in case some Soviet authority is watching. </sentence><sentence id="3341">And they took us to the railroad station where we were taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few people in boxcars, and the train started and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and we were in the American sector of Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="3342">Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="3343">We stayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an American hospital, that's where the Joint somehow got an American hospital for the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm rooms and it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3344">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3345"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 was very pleasant, the only thing we were always warned about, not to ever wander into the Soviet section. </sentence><sentence id="3346">We were free to wander around, the city was still divided into four sections, American, British, French and Soviet. </sentence><sentence id="3347">And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going to, I remember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous. </sentence><sentence id="3348">But, basically, it was a good time. </sentence><sentence id="3349">Vienna was full of refugees, full of life. </sentence><sentence id="3350">After one week or so, then we were taken across, again by trucks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct myself, to, not to Austria, to a, a, a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee Association or something, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were housed in a beautiful area of the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden. </sentence><sentence id="3351">It is a, on a lake, just the other side from Germany, and there were some very picturesque villages nearby, and I remember even though here the food was very meager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains, and I remember that just above our camp, our refugee camp, there was a place, a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy, but we were still pushing for it, we wanted to see it. </sentence><sentence id="3352">We stayed here, again, one or two weeks and then on, again, now over the border to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="3353">In Italy, they took us again to the train station, somewhere in northern Italy, and the train then was closed up and sealed, but regular train, we just could not leave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that nobody escapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at least at that time? </sentence><sentence id="3354">And we were taken down to Bari. </sentence><sentence id="3355">Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind was that a lot of times when the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and the good looking girls among us ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written on it, I love you, I'm going to marry you and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the girls were exchanging pictures and who wanted this one and this one? </sentence><sentence id="3356">I mean it was a funny thing to see that those men were really just instantly falling in love with these girls. </sentence><sentence id="3357">In Bari, a ship was waiting for us, if you could call it a ship. </sentence><sentence id="3358">It was called the Galil, Galilea or Galilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in two days or three days, it must have been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa. </sentence><sentence id="3359">Everybody got sea sick, the boat was an old, old fishing boat that the Israeli government brought from, bought from Greece and it was a primitive thing, very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="3360">And I know I have a very strong will and I don't want to, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I never throw up, somehow I just psych myself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up. </sentence><sentence id="3361">And I remember I was the only one on the ship who could eat. </sentence><sentence id="3362">Everybody else was just constantly throwing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was just yellow and green and wouldn't want to look at food. </sentence><sentence id="3363">Now, the funny thing about this ship is that a few years ago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in the Loire valley in a small little town, Blois, and as we were walking in the town there was a kind of a summer suit that I wanted to buy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer suit for wearing on some occasion that I have to wear a suit and I went into the shop and I was trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of a sudden yelled and said, "Shalom haver." </sentence><sentence id="3364">And it appears he was talking to my wife and somehow it came that he was a Moroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan Jew and all this, because he had a definite Arabic name. </sentence><sentence id="3365">And so my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish, too you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal--which was a good one--he invited us to a bar down on the street, an outdoor cafe, to drink something with him. </sentence><sentence id="3366">And during the conversation he asked me a little bit about my life and he said to, and I asked him and he said, "Oh, I was in Israel, I was a sailor." </sentence><sentence id="3367">I said, "Where did you sail?" </sentence><sentence id="3368">He said, In the Mediterranean, of course," and I said, "What ship?" </sentence><sentence id="3369">He said, "The Galilea." " </sentence><sentence id="3370">What time?" </sentence><sentence id="3371">He said, "From 1948 to 1950 something." </sentence><sentence id="3372">Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean it was a small ship and he was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3373">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3374"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 one of the sailors. </sentence><sentence id="3375">Well, when we arrived in Haifa, of course, that was a very emotional scene and then eventually, the war, basically, was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we, our movement went to a kibbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then. </sentence><sentence id="3376">I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3423">Q: Everyone from your group then who was travelling together went to the same kibbutz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3425">A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did not want to go to the kibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="3426">There were, not everybody wants to live in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult living for those who dream of money and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a radio that you can call your own. </sentence><sentence id="3427">So we lost, I would say, about one- third of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the outside. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3431">Q: How was it decided that your group would go to a kibbutz, was it decided communally among the group or did someone else decide it for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3433">A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were geared toward the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="3434">This was an understanding back in Eastern Europe where we were recruited that Israel, and they always brought the example of the pyramid, that the, we Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the pyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a pyramid upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the smallest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid. </sentence><sentence id="3435">So almost every Zionist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3436">So that was the reason why most of us did go to a kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="3437">And who decided it? </sentence><sentence id="3438">It was decided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would go, we were assigned to an old kibbutz, very old, experienced, large kibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which is in, about midway between Haifa and Tel Aviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3445">Q: Did you speak any Hebrew at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3447">A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except the ones who came from very religious families. </sentence><sentence id="3448">They knew quite a bit and for them it was much easier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak, Hungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit kind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Israeli kids. </sentence><sentence id="3449">There were so many Hungarians coming in at that time that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they were called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the street and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because they heard us speak. </sentence><sentence id="3450">And so we were in a big hurry to learn Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="3451">And then when we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the Hungarian language is such that your accent stays with This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3452">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3453"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 you no matter what language you learn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had our difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually. </sentence><sentence id="3454">I was there in Israel for two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3464">Q: What trade did you learn on this kibbutz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3466">A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected with the tractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know, flours and up to plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. </sentence><sentence id="3467">Then we got our own land, own piece of land, which was a reclaimed area on the train line between Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was the, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so Jordan give back a piece of land so the train service can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because part of the train line was in Jordan. </sentence><sentence id="3468">This was the land that we received, and it was a very dangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out there, I remember, was really hair raising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and the, the weed in Israel is much higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines, if there were any mines. </sentence><sentence id="3469">And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know, generous support there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area. </sentence><sentence id="3470">And sO we were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="3471">Above us was an Arab town, Tul Karem, which today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. </sentence><sentence id="3472">And I remember that Arab town practically you could see the people on the street, and here we were on the other side living, you know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures because of living on the border, but then again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust and I am sure that the Holocaust Museum has a lot of testimonies from Israelis so they don't need. </sentence><sentence id="3473">I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the border, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3482">Q: I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds of relations or encounters you had with Arabs in that area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3484">A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab shepherds down on the other side of the barbed wire, the border was just marked with a bunch of barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="3485">And when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and they were running away, they were just scared to death. </sentence><sentence id="3486">These were shepherds, very poor people, and we didn't know exactly who they were, but we learned eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the land for very little. </sentence><sentence id="3487">And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the border we are plowing with up-to-date 20"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a horseback whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them. </sentence><sentence id="3488">The owner of the land had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was just a few hundred yards from where we were working. </sentence><sentence id="3489">As they got used to us, they came closer and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the barbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in Israel those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies. </sentence><sentence id="3490">Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very cheap in Israel, American cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="3491">So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but they did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the... Jordan had the best military force, the Arab Legion, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3492">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3493"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis. </sentence><sentence id="3494">So at night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and always the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the border people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me dead right there, it could have been a trap. </sentence><sentence id="3495">We went down and we were doing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were much better fence jumpers than we were. </sentence><sentence id="3496">So this was one contact that we had. </sentence><sentence id="3497">The other one was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize borders, they run, you know, back and forth, Israel, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which is most of the time, this is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds because you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little canyons. </sentence><sentence id="3498">And they would come over in these river beds and go into other areas and steal, mainly animals. </sentence><sentence id="3499">And they were unbelievably good thieves. </sentence><sentence id="3500">They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by walls. </sentence><sentence id="3501">Nobody could ever figure out how they did it. </sentence><sentence id="3502">So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns, we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come. </sentence><sentence id="3503">And I only had one occasion when three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these coming by and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have?And so we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't want to engage in any fire fight there. </sentence><sentence id="3504">Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion, which then eventually had also a sad ending. </sentence><sentence id="3505">All of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I remember, and I had to have always a guard on my tractor with a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp, guarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them. </sentence><sentence id="3506">And you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patrol right by the barbed wire and they were motioning to us to come down and we said no, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3507">And so they went away. </sentence><sentence id="3508">Next day they came and again they were motioning, they said, "Peace, peace." </sentence><sentence id="3509">So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns into a pile and then came back, showing that they had no weapons and they told us, "Sit down on that side of the border. </sentence><sentence id="3510">What can we do?" </sentence><sentence id="3511">They were about twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, "Okay, let's go down. </sentence><sentence id="3512">What do they want?" </sentence><sentence id="3513">They just wanted to talk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time and eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at one of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is, "Hey, bring me a watermelon." </sentence><sentence id="3514">Yalla Jibbu Battiyah. </sentence><sentence id="3515">And they brought a watermelon and they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought some stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3516">And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3517">And eventually we really fooled our countries because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel and sometimes we jumped over and we said, "Oh, we ate in Jordan." </sentence><sentence id="3518">And one day it was our turn, we stopped the tractor, they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other side, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it is a totally different patrol. </sentence><sentence id="3519">What happened, apparently somebody saw them and reported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw them again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="3520">And you know that border was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab. </sentence><sentence id="3521">Very

walking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most of the Israeli border guards were from Arab countries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds kind of strange, but Jews from Arab countries, and they were vicious. </sentence><sentence id="3524">I mean, you could not get better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3525">And so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason. </sentence><sentence id="3526">So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then the man said, "How come you speak some Arabic? </sentence><sentence id="3527">Where did you learn it?" </sentence><sentence id="3528">And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, "You have one luck that I have a son of your age." </sentence><sentence id="3529">He said, "If I ever see you even down touching the barbed wire," he said, "T am going to just

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3585">A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly sign language quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking about their children, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or Shalom in Hebrew, was constantly mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="3586">And I have a feeling that all of us involved, probably, if they are, hopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of softened us up, so we know that human beings can relax under certain circumstances and we don't have to be enemies. </sentence><sentence id="3587">It was the first time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't necessarily have to be my opponent, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3603">A: At first I was very, very idealistic. </sentence><sentence id="3604">Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in our kibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart. </sentence><sentence id="3605">And there were more and more arguments and somehow this and the fact that as the country settled down into so-called peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences, surfaced, such as crime and... but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me. </sentence><sentence id="3606">You know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't want to do anything to hurt another human being. </sentence><sentence id="3607">There were even, even murderers, and I just one day after another, these things, they added to my little disappointment, but I was still enjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we, we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3608">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3609"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 did the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we had a very good self-image of ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="3610">There were two things that contributed to my, to my coming, going back to Hungary eventually in "51. </sentence><sentence id="3611">One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all my life I loved my father very, very much, and this is a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about it, I loved my father more than I loved my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3612">Somehow I always considered my mother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood. </sentence><sentence id="3613">And I thought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted me to be also, you know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not the type. </sentence><sentence id="3614">So I was not that close to her even though I was with her all the time and practically, I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I realized I spent very little time with my father as a young man because he was always away in, in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="3615">And now he was home and now they couldn't come any more, Hungary was sealed. </sentence><sentence id="3616">And then I also, at the age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of cynical people. </sentence><sentence id="3617">And I met them here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they were married to this and this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice any more in Israel except the bad things. </sentence><sentence id="3618">This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to get all kinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was misled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a marvelous country today. </sentence><sentence id="3619">And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they never wanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come home, they were afraid what would happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="3620">And that, they just apparently didn't come across quite well because I, eventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably homesickness had a great deal to do, I, at that time as a young man, | didn't realize that you can't go home again, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3621">I envisioned that everything is going to be back and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3622">Well, I then applied to the Hungarian Embassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, didn't keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3623">And those were the worst years, aside from October 15th, those years were the worst years of my life, the next two or three years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3647">Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very well organized as you were escaping from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3648">When you arrived in the kibbutz, did you, did you share the feeling that the way that the kibbutz was organized was, was very good and smooth and, did you have any observations about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3651">A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, this was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock work. </sentence><sentence id="3652">Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had no argument with that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there was nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here today. </sentence><sentence id="3653">It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very good food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are coming, good ones, entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect. </sentence><sentence id="3654">No, I admired the way they carried on. </sentence><sentence id="3655">Just a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the kitchen, so there were, there were certain things in the kibbutz that it was not a, an area where you were assigned permanently, they were temporary. </sentence><sentence id="3656">And so everybody knew that once in a month I have to shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were some other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner. </sentence><sentence id="3657">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3658">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3659"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3669">Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to Hungary, was that... was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3671">A: I was naively thinking about going to the university and continuing with my education to become a teacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey, Black Sea, Romania and then Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3672">Travelling through Romania by train, in 1949, excuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and since there are quite a few Hungarians in Romania, I then... eventually they found out that I speak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively give all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at me, just looked at me, just looked at me, and also Romania was tremendously gray and I could only think of 1984, going across Romania. </sentence><sentence id="3673">And that was only the beginning, 1951, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3677">Q: You're referring to the book, 1984? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3681">Q: You're referring to the book? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3683">A: Yes, I refer to the book /984, or the movie rather, okay? </sentence><sentence id="3684">It's the same thing, but the movie is the one that I always keep in my mind when I think of Romania. </sentence><sentence id="3685">So I arrived on the Hungarian border and here was an officer on the border looked at my papers and all this and he, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, "I don't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from." </sentence><sentence id="3686">And he looked at me and said, "Welcome to Hungary." </sentence><sentence id="3687">And this was a border guard officer. </sentence><sentence id="3688">And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="3689">Well, I learned very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="3690">When I boarded the train again on the other side of the border, it was just as gray as coming through Romania and then finally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled. </sentence><sentence id="3691">Never have I been misled before or after the way I was. </sentence><sentence id="3692">I arrived there and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="3693">And my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to the university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I came home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. </sentence><sentence id="3694">And it took me almost six month to get a job to sweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a state-owned garage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3707">Q: How did you get the job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3709">A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his brothers and their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from, this suburb of Hungary, a very poor one, suburb of Budapest, where now the communist officials with great connections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out their neck, they just somehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an auxiliary labor help, a no name person whom they hired because they needed somebody to clean something. </sentence><sentence id="3710">And that was the only job I could get. </sentence><sentence id="3711">What hurt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the street, some of them who stayed in Hungary, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3712">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3713"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 not want anything to do with me because most people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me. </sentence><sentence id="3714">Some probably out of disgust that how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3722">Q: Because you had been in Israel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3724">A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it was a totally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the next day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3725">So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to college and I wanted to go to college, and I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had about twelve garages, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next step and every time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, "You know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there." </sentence><sentence id="3726">So the, my break came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm, and they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, "Well, I don't have time to write you a recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="3727">I'm glad that a worker wants to go to college, we need working youth, why don't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it." </sentence><sentence id="3728">So I passed the first hurdle, with this I went to the university where I had to submit this. </sentence><sentence id="3729">This was a committee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography, autobiography for everything, everything. </sentence><sentence id="3730">So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about, I would say, seven, eight people. </sentence><sentence id="3731">And when they got to certain points, they said, "Come on, you must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here." </sentence><sentence id="3732">Well, I left and as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was the university where I wanted to go, it was called the Teachers Academy, but it was part of the university. </sentence><sentence id="3733">He came out and he said, "Holczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?" </sentence><sentence id="3734">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3735">He said, "Didn't your father have four or five brothers playing on the same soccer team?" </sentence><sentence id="3736">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3737">And he said, "Okay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a minor when you left the country, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education, maybe something can be done." </sentence><sentence id="3738">Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in September and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they couldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. </sentence><sentence id="3739">And I found him and he said, "Just a second." </sentence><sentence id="3740">He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he said, "I am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you were a minor when you left Hungary, give you special permission to enter the university." </sentence><sentence id="3741">And he said, "Now, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3742">Never again." </sentence><sentence id="3743">He said, "That is the price. </sentence><sentence id="3744">You understand?" </sentence><sentence id="3745">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3746">Said, "and say hello to your dad." </sentence><sentence id="3747">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="3748">I went home, my father remembered him, they played on the same team. </sentence><sentence id="3749">And he was the head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know?And this is how I got in. </sentence><sentence id="3750">And I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids thought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. </sentence><sentence id="3751">And yet, when it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week. </sentence><sentence id="3752">Stalin was dying and when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

anti-Semitic and he said, "Are they Jewish doctors?" </sentence><sentence id="3757">And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight were Jewish, they said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3758">They said, "Arrest them." </sentence><sentence id="3759">And they were, all the doctors around Stalin were arrested a few days before he died. </sentence><sentence id="3760">And then, when this happened, in Hungary, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the college. </sentence><sentence id="3761">They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down. </sentence><sentence id="3762">So they found me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that. </sentence><sentence id="3763">And Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the Thaw started, then they called me back and they said forget

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3857">A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics. </sentence><sentence id="3858">You know, eventually, throughout these years, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and... because they were always eager beaver Party workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we knew that we can still talk to them, they're just careerists and they just want to go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="3859">But I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things. </sentence><sentence id="3860">Obviously, we didn't do it on the street, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or in a restaurant where there was a lot of noise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says what. </sentence><sentence id="3861">So in this respect, we did not really have a kind of a prison atmosphere in college. </sentence><sentence id="3862">And our professors, I would say eighty percent of them were very much against the regime and occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous statements. </sentence><sentence id="3863">We recognized it immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to Russian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen, we didn't learn anything, and after going through college, at the end you had to take a state exam. </sentence><sentence id="3864">And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which you had a topic. </sentence><sentence id="3865">And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your memory, you were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was your turn and you could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee. </sentence><sentence id="3866">And I went to my Russian exam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I just, in these years I just never bothered to read, to learn enough to read. </sentence><sentence id="3867">Today of course, I'm not very proud of this, because now I know that the more languages you speak, you know, the more lives you have, but those days, this was a political statement, they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there was tremendous animosity toward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others. </sentence><sentence id="3868">Can we stop? </sentence><sentence id="3869">End of Tape 6, Side B This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3870">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3871"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 Tape 7, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3891">A: Oh, the Russian exam. </sentence><sentence id="3892">And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same problem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they were very angry about it. </sentence><sentence id="3893">But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that point, going through all classes, didn't they realize that something is wrong? </sentence><sentence id="3894">Well, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3895">And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="3896">There were very few people. </sentence><sentence id="3897">So when I left the college, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the countryside, they could not, you could not teach in Budapest the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small village, not far from Vacz, from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught there for a year. </sentence><sentence id="3898">And this was a small village of a minority, Hungary has very few minorities, but they have some Slovak minorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher, too. </sentence><sentence id="3899">And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the Holocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. </sentence><sentence id="3900">And then after this year that I spent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization probably could use me because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the Zionists, I had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a summer camp. </sentence><sentence id="3901">They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was just a day camp, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if I would like to come and teach in the district. </sentence><sentence id="3902">And I said, "Naturally, this is it!" </sentence><sentence id="3903">And so I was transferred to, just to a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3970">Q: Where did you, you mentioned that you had a, you had a real enthusiasm for working with young people and that seems to be something that you did for most of your adult life and at the time, what, where did your, where did that enthusiasm come from and what, what were you teaching, were you teaching them simply geography or were you trying to teach them a broader range of things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3972">A: Well, when I was transferred to Budapest, immediately I started to teach geography, they had these so-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the afternoon and depending on their interests, join groups, study groups. </sentence><sentence id="3973">And I was running the geography group which was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a river is meandering and then old river is meandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities. </sentence><sentence id="3974">I took them to hike and I taught them how, orientation in nature and all, everything that was romantic in the boy scouts. </sentence><sentence id="3975">And from this, I kind of organized a group of very enthusiastic kids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you know, and it appealed to me as a young, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they hired me to run big camps. </sentence><sentence id="3976">But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really cared for the politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing. </sentence><sentence id="3977">I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement and suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that age, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can have. </sentence><sentence id="3978">A white shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and nothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, "No, a child wants to see his or her achievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world." </sentence><sentence id="3979">And so they were, they were giving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this, submitted it, it was accepted, so this is what I loved, that I could have some influence and push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one, that is, I think that pleased me a_ great deal. </sentence><sentence id="3980">And eventually, it was a, I did it until the very last day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my group as adults. </sentence><sentence id="3981">And when I went back later on, ten years or This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3982">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3983"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 fifteen years later, some of these kids were running the same kind of camps and organizations and they always came and they said, "You know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we have to leave our homes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been up there. </sentence><sentence id="3984">And we would have been following you all the way out to the border." </sentence><sentence id="3985">I didn't tell them that I was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of them learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in Switzerland, but eventually went back to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3986">So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into them and I go out and look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see. </sentence><sentence id="3987">I even see the Communist Party secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took my wife, too, to see her during the late "70s and early "80s, she and her husband, I just, they were good people. </sentence><sentence id="3988">They came from the old communist underground, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3989">And though we never talked about it, I'm sure they were just as disappointed in what happened to Marx ideas as most other people. </sentence><sentence id="3990">But they would never discuss it because they were too loyal to the Party. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4012">Q: When 1956 came and some of the demonstrations started, were you intrigued in any way or did you mainly feel concerned about the fascist elements that you were seeing? </sentence><sentence id="4013">Did you go to the big demonstration on October 23rd? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4016">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4017">I was on the street all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most Holocaust survivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted to read the crowd. </sentence><sentence id="4018">The mood of the crowd. </sentence><sentence id="4019">And so I was in the street all the time, watching what's happening, kind of sensing the undercurrent. </sentence><sentence id="4020">I was like an animal and I knew that I knew exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="4021">And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no good or quite a few of them could be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't lose its spots and even though it all started with great democratic slogans, eventually after two weeks, it did disintegrate and there were a lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live under Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the Russian tanks came back. </sentence><sentence id="4022">I just didn't want to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because there were ugly incidents. </sentence><sentence id="4023">The Revolution started for two weeks, the first one week was kind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just everything disintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4032">Q: You also mentioned that there was an extreme amount of anti-Semitism during that time. </sentence><sentence id="4033">Would you just tell me some examples of what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4036">A: Well, unfortunately, after looking at all the countries where anti-Semitism is so rampant, has been and still is, I must conclude that all Catholic countries are that way in Eastern Europe, only the Catholic countries. </sentence><sentence id="4037">Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, these are the countries where, and some of them have very little Jews, in Poland there are only a few thousand Jews left. </sentence><sentence id="4038">I have experienced anti-Semitism all the time, [coughs] excuse me, and even when I go home nowadays to visit, well I haven't been to Hungary for the last three years, but the letters I receive from my relatives constantly refer to that and my family was never very much interested in bringing this out because they are, rather, they consider themselves Hungarians, the ones who are living in Hungary today and I'm always surprised that this is a main concern to them, so apparently this situation has never changed. </sentence><sentence id="4039">In 1919, Hungary became the first fascist country of Europe, even before Hitler, and stayed that way, at least, even today under the current, the undercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are responsible for everything just like in the Middle Ages. </sentence><sentence id="4040">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4041">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4042"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4052">A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the first week of November and it took me about ten to fourteen days to get going. </sentence><sentence id="4053">I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family and also I had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation there, too, because he was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that. </sentence><sentence id="4054">And eventually he brought his friend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to fourteen days, I can't remember exactly, but no more than two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4055">I just wanted to see exactly what works, what doesn't work, how can I approach the border, the most practical way, a lot of people were practically there and then captured and brought back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="4056">And the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go through all this and then in the last second, just before you would go over to Austria, captured, you know, be captured, so I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and tried to think of the practical aspects of how to do that. </sentence><sentence id="4057">End of Tape 7, Side B Tape 8, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

What were your thoughts about the future? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4326">A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe, even if I wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country and get some legal status anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4327">The reason was, once you were placed in a country, you couldn't really do much about it any more. </sentence><sentence id="4328">So I knew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly didn't want to stay in Saint Louis, because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in Saint Louis. </sentence><sentence id="4329">Not just against Blacks, but also against just about anyone. </sentence><sentence id="4330">I worked mainly, this is my fate, with German, it was a German company basically, a German family, German workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name a group or a race around the world about whom they were not talking during the day, always in very derogatory terms. </sentence><sentence id="4331">And then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that time. </sentence><sentence id="4332">You were either of German descent, or you were Black. </sentence><sentence id="4333">And luckily, when I became very, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4334">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4335"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 very upset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on, as I learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be... to go around with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home. </sentence><sentence id="4336">And they introduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="4337">I went to just about every nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band that there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis. </sentence><sentence id="4338">And many times, in a huge dance hall, I was the only white face. </sentence><sentence id="4339">And of course, sometimes, I ran into almost trouble too, because of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4356">Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, rather than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had anything to do with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German descent co-workers? </sentence><sentence id="4357">What was the story with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4360">A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn't prevent them from being prejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4361">It was just a general thing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who is not an established person. </sentence><sentence id="4362">And I felt this, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4363">I just... and the situation at home, where I was staying with these people, was also not very happy. </sentence><sentence id="4364">And that, I think, contributed to my thoughts that, how nice it would be to go to some other place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4370">Q: So you came with some ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise you to see how... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this country and the way that the White people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4372">A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much. </sentence><sentence id="4373">In one of these weekend excursions, I was introduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date. </sentence><sentence id="4374">And eventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her life was in danger, and my life was in danger. </sentence><sentence id="4375">And she said, "You don't understand this now, but twenty years from now you will understand. </sentence><sentence id="4376">And as much as it hurts me, we have to stop seeing each other." </sentence><sentence id="4377">And that was my first great introduction to prejudice, really, on a personal, you know, basis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4384">Q: So, up until then, you really hadn't realized what a strong division there was, or what a taboo there was against interracial relationships? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4386">A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I thought I am coming to a society that is much more different and much more positive about these things. </sentence><sentence id="4387">And it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred, that I knew could not be erased very soon. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4408">A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when you have to, you learn everything. </sentence><sentence id="4409">You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you learn English. </sentence><sentence id="4410">No, for Europeans, English is an easy language to learn. </sentence><sentence id="4411">Not so easy to write, but to learn, because it's... the grammar is much simpler than some European languages. </sentence><sentence id="4412">I just put my mind to it, and I decided, if I am here, I might as well do it. </sentence><sentence id="4413">I could have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live my life as a Hungarian, but I wanted to be integrated into the society, and I love the English language, that's the truth. </sentence><sentence id="4414">I think of all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very beautiful language to listen to, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to read and I learned just by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through. </sentence><sentence id="4415">And among all the people eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most progress, because I just decided I don't want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don't want anything to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="4416">I really want to learn English. </sentence></p></dialogue>

And I said, "Yes," and he said, "You're hired." </sentence><sentence id="4628">And that was the kind of attitude that prevailed in Aspen. </sentence><sentence id="4629">Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding. </sentence><sentence id="4630">So I worked for Kurt Breznits, and I started to work for him, this was in 1957, about, I would say, July. </sentence><sentence id="4631">And our friendship survived for forty-two years, because he's the one, he and his wife, in their eighties, I visited them last year. </sentence><sentence id="4632">Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="4633">A young man came in around September, and by that time there weren't too many people in Aspen, because it's a seasonal place. </sentence><sentence id="4634">At least back then, the off season, you could hardly see anybody in the street. </sentence><sentence id="4635">At the end of September, people were leaving, the music festival was over, and the ski season came around in December. </sentence><sentence id="4636">So everybody left, vacation, travel. </sentence><sentence id="4637">A young man came in and started to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="4638">He said, "I got a problem, my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her." </sentence><sentence id="4639">I said, "Look, that's not... shouldn't be a problem." </sentence><sentence id="4640">In my broken English I said that, and he looked at me and he immediately said, "Well, where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="4641">And of course, the whole story came about and I said, "Well, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?" </sentence><sentence id="4642">He said, "Because she has everything." </sentence><sentence id="4643">And this is how I met a then young man by the name of Sheldon Rich, who was the son of a Chicago banking family. </sentence><sentence id="4644">And on his twenty-first birthday he received a nightclub from his parents, called, The Limelite. </sentence><sentence id="4645">He just kept coming back and talking to me, and we just became really... friends. </sentence><sentence id="4646">We'd occasionally go out at night and he would bring his date and I would bring a date, and had a very nice relationship. </sentence><sentence id="4647">And then he came back later on, and he said, "I have to leave my place, and there are three apartments in the nightclub. </sentence><sentence id="4648">I just hate to leave the place unattended. </sentence><sentence id="4649">Would you mind moving into one of the apartments? </sentence><sentence id="4650">You can just stay there, and when I come back we can just share apartments, and no problem." </sentence><sentence id="4651">Well, who'd...who would refuse a free apartment? </sentence><sentence id="4652">I moved into the Limelite apartment, and when he came This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4653">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4654"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 back in December to open it that year, he said to me, "Look, I desperately need somebody that I can trust, to be the cashier. </sentence><sentence id="4655">How would you like to work for me?" </sentence><sentence id="4656">He said, "I double your salary." </sentence><sentence id="4657">And I said, "Well, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love dearly and I just... I just can't leave." </sentence><sentence id="4658">He said, "Oh, this is America. </sentence><sentence id="4659">We don't have to worry about that. </sentence><sentence id="4660">I'll take care of that, I'll talk to him." </sentence><sentence id="4661">He said, "You know, Robert, here, we don't even show up when we leave, we just call and say, send my check somewhere." </sentence><sentence id="4662">He says, "There's no loyalty here." </sentence><sentence id="4663">I said, "No? </sentence><sentence id="4664">You want me to be loyal to you." </sentence><sentence id="4665">The conversation went on and on and on and I said, "Well, I just cannot go to my friend, Kurt Breznits and say, "I am leaving," because you double my salary." </sentence><sentence id="4666">But the truth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school. </sentence><sentence id="4667">That was my aim, that once I mastered the language, I would go back to school. </sentence><sentence id="4668">So, by the... I went to work next day, and my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, "Robert, you don't have to have these problems in this country. </sentence><sentence id="4669">This is not Europe, and not only that, I would be delighted if you can make twice as much money as you made here. </sentence><sentence id="4670">I can't afford that salary." </sentence><sentence id="4671">But I said, "But we were such good friends." </sentence><sentence id="4672">He said, "Well, from now on, as long as you're in Aspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home." </sentence><sentence id="4673">So... and we did that, just every Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early dinner, just so I can come. </sentence><sentence id="4674">And we had dinner together and talked a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="4675">And we saw each other other nights too, but that problem was solved, but I could never understand this distance that is between employees and employers. </sentence><sentence id="4676">I'm still, even in my old days, as a high school teacher and all this, I would have been very hesitant to go and report to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="4677">I know it's silly, but it was just pounded into me that you are loyal. </sentence><sentence id="4678">And so I worked for the Limelite, which became a very well-known nightclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the time when the Kingston Trio and all the others became famous and it was the... you know, the great time of folk singing. </sentence><sentence id="4679">Pete Seeger and all the rest, the... most of them came to this nightclub. </sentence><sentence id="4680">And eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I ended up managing the place. </sentence><sentence id="4681">And then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky, because his hated nightclub was sold. </sentence><sentence id="4682">He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were singing there, three, four people, and they formed a group called "The Limeliters," named after the club, became famous, and now they could buy the club from him. </sentence><sentence id="4683">So, he sold the club, and I became the employee of the group, and... up until 1959, when I left. </sentence><sentence id="4684">But I maintained relations with one of the group, and his family. </sentence><sentence id="4685">These are people who still very much around today, you know, the four. </sentence><sentence id="4686">And one of them, Glenn Yarbrough, who was my friend, is still producing CD's. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4762">Q: And you decided... so your motivation to leave was really that you wanted to get in... to continue your education? </sentence><sentence id="4763">Was that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4766">A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the money to go out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some kind of a business, was more and more expensive. </sentence><sentence id="4767">As Aspen became more and more fashionable, everything became more expensive. </sentence><sentence id="4768">Besides, I had no interest in opening a business. </sentence><sentence id="4769">I always thought of myself as an educator. </sentence><sentence id="4770">I wanted to go back to school, and luckily, I got together with some adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska. </sentence><sentence id="4771">They said that in Alaska you can make a lot of money and it's fascinating, and it's beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="4772">And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a moment when I decided that at the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them to Alaska, and would try to make money, and then, eventually, that fall, | was going back to school in Fresno. </sentence><sentence id="4773">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4774">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4775"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4786">Q: Why Fresno? </sentence><sentence id="4787">Why Fresno? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4790">A: Why Fresno? </sentence><sentence id="4791">Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I'm the most unlikely person to end up in a central California town of practically no distinction. </sentence><sentence id="4792">Hundred, hundred ten degrees heat. </sentence><sentence id="4793">Why Fresno? </sentence><sentence id="4794">Because they were the only ones, back those days, who answered my letters...not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble getting my records together from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="4795">It was against the law, at that time, to send anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with somebody. </sentence><sentence id="4796">And so, I just... a college had to accept me on my word, and apparently they were afraid to do that. </sentence><sentence id="4797">But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a semester, we'll find out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that. </sentence><sentence id="4798">And we cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense Scholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. </sentence><sentence id="4799">And so I| applied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="4800">That's what it was called back then. </sentence><sentence id="4801">And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I ended... I ended up in Fresno. </sentence><sentence id="4802">And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece of America that was very unknown to me. </sentence><sentence id="4803">And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with... Fresno is the center of the Armenian population in America. </sentence><sentence id="4804">And they were... I hit it off with them extremely well, no problem, until they found out that I am writing my master thesis on Turko-American relations in 1918-1920, and that was the time when the Armenians were persecuted terribly. </sentence><sentence id="4805">And of course, no nation is all bad, no nation is all good. </sentence><sentence id="4806">And of course, when they were reading a little bit of my thesis, they found out that I was very sympathetic to Kemal Ataturk. </sentence><sentence id="4807">Of course, I condemned the method of getting rid of Armenians, but I was... I found some goodness. </sentence><sentence id="4808">So we had some little differences, but all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. </sentence><sentence id="4809">I liked them. </sentence><sentence id="4810">I had a lot of foreign, foreign students, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there, than if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. </sentence><sentence id="4811">Here I had a chance to talk to professors. </sentence><sentence id="4812">It was just a very relaxed atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4837">Q: Were you feeling surprised that you'd been to several very different places in the country, with very different atmospheres. </sentence><sentence id="4838">Were you surprised at how much variation there was in this country, that you had kind of come to expecting a certain, maybe... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4841">A: Uniformity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4843">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4845">A: Well, I reported back, I remember to my relatives, and parents, I said, "This is not a country, this is a continent." </sentence><sentence id="4846">I said, "Don't think in terms of a country, this is a continent." </sentence><sentence id="4847">It's... it will be that way for a long, long time, and I think it still is. </sentence><sentence id="4848">When I travel, in spite of the uniformity that modern age brings, you can still see that it is... itll take a long time, and perhaps it shouldn't, perhaps this is the way it should be, that we still have areas that... like you can open your eyes and realize that you are not in Chicago, or not in New York. </sentence><sentence id="4849">And hope that they will keep it this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4855">Q: Well, you talked a little bit, in your first interview about what happened then, and how you... </sentence></p></dialogue>

I'd be interested in hearing how you met Jan and what... kind of how your relationship grew, and was built, and whether... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4863">and what she knew about your past and what you talked... I'm getting ahead of myself. </sentence><sentence id="4864">Why don't... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4865">A: No, that's okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4867">Q: ... you answer my first question first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4869">A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area, for me that was just incredible. </sentence><sentence id="4870">I practically pinched myself every morning when I woke up and I saw the sun and looked around, and the scenery. </sentence><sentence id="4871">I just couldn't believe that I was that lucky. </sentence><sentence id="4872">I just couldn't find words to describe it to my parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the San Francisco Bay Area had for me. </sentence><sentence id="4873">And still, it holds just a fascination. </sentence><sentence id="4874">It's almost like Europe in the United States, when I walked the streets of San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="4875">I lived in Tiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="4876">I lived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next door, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor schoolteacher like myself. </sentence><sentence id="4877">Today, of course, it would be impossible. </sentence><sentence id="4878">And I had a nice little apartment in a duplex, overlooking what they call Raccoon Straight. </sentence><sentence id="4879">And these are small, little islands in the bay. </sentence><sentence id="4880">The sailboats were going back and forth all day. </sentence><sentence id="4881">Tourists, you know, boats, and it was just a very, very picturesque environment. </sentence><sentence id="4882">The type of people I associated with, mainly through school, through my job, were very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="4883">Most of them were very young, and we did a lot of things together. </sentence><sentence id="4884">I also had plenty of opportunity, of course, to go on my own. </sentence><sentence id="4885">And those days, I just was a restless spirit. </sentence><sentence id="4886">I had a tendency to walk down, for example, at night, and see the streets... the lights of San Francisco, and just feel that there is something going on in the city that I'm not part of, and I just have to hop into my car and go there. </sentence><sentence id="4887">And I did that, and it was then fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, I was in the city, going around. </sentence><sentence id="4888">And so then, I was walking around and I was happy, and I did a couple of things. </sentence><sentence id="4889">And then I looked back and I saw the lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or Sausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going on and I'm not part of it, so I hopped in my car and went back. </sentence><sentence id="4890">So I was just restlessly looking for that unknown beauty which really was just around me, all over. </sentence><sentence id="4891">And I loved to hike up on Mount Tamalpais. </sentence><sentence id="4892">Mill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and | thought I would live my life here, probably forever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4917">Q: What year was it? </sentence><sentence id="4918">What year was it when you arrived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4921">A: 1961. </sentence><sentence id="4922">And, as I mentioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching mentally retarded students, but I didn't mind, because I thought of the old Hungarian proverb that said for any... for something that you like, you would even let people chop wood on your back, and I strongly believe in this. </sentence><sentence id="4923">And so, I just... I didn't really consider teaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children. </sentence><sentence id="4924">As a matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you. </sentence><sentence id="4925">Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed kids, who were in this group, too. </sentence><sentence id="4926">But basically, it was easy, because of their love and devotion. </sentence><sentence id="4927">And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself, I'm burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4928">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4929"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 returned to regulating... teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. </sentence><sentence id="4930">And my wife, yeah, I met my wife at a teacher's meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange bunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to do with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we would never have dusty shoes. </sentence><sentence id="4931">And saying this to people who had to go out in the playground almost every hour, I mean it was strange. </sentence><sentence id="4932">And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn't much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the county, but mainly to women. </sentence><sentence id="4933">And... so | met my wife and at that time she was married with three children. </sentence><sentence id="4934">And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn't really want others to know much about her. </sentence><sentence id="4935">And I found out later there was a reason for that. </sentence><sentence id="4936">Then...and we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, "Oh, this lady's quite cold." </sentence><sentence id="4937">That was my first impression. </sentence><sentence id="4938">And never bothered really much. </sentence><sentence id="4939">But, our path crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me up, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4964">A: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="4965">No, teachers of retarded students. </sentence><sentence id="4966">And she called me up and she wanted my advice in something, which I still maintain, even up today, it was just a device to strike of... End of Tape 8, Side B Tape 9, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4971">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4973">A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not very warm. </sentence><sentence id="4974">And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for some help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn't call me and ask for help. </sentence><sentence id="4975">And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on, occasionally, we called each other. </sentence><sentence id="4976">But we never talked about personal things, and so, the whole thing kind of petered out. </sentence><sentence id="4977">And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, "Oh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. </sentence><sentence id="4978">She is divorced, and she looks good." </sentence><sentence id="4979">And according to...excuse me... according to Jan, I said, "Wow," which I deny. </sentence><sentence id="4980">I never said such thing. </sentence><sentence id="4981">But anyway, this, or whatever I did, or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her. </sentence><sentence id="4982">So they invited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just right. </sentence><sentence id="4983">And from there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this was a pretty serious relationship. </sentence><sentence id="4984">But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just was not going to get married without giving it some thought. </sentence><sentence id="4985">So, I did what my previous girlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4986">And [ arrived there, and I spent a year in Germany, and that year convinced me that yes, that she would be the right person for me, so I came home. </sentence><sentence id="4987">And we got married on Mount Tamalpais, on the top of Mount Tamalpais, the mountain I loved to hike around, and the mountain we both saw every day, coming and going to school. </sentence><sentence id="4988">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="4989">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="4990"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5014">Q: Did they ask you about your experiences during the war at some point, or did you tell... did they know anything about your history? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5016">A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now. </sentence><sentence id="5017">As little children, they kept asking me a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, maybe they fear they knew... they heard everything. </sentence><sentence id="5018">But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just as a pastime, never really ask any questions. </sentence><sentence id="5019">And they are around movies concerning the Holocaust and... back those days. </sentence><sentence id="5020">But no. </sentence><sentence id="5021">But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a bit, and it was not really that much about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5022">They were too little, and I didn't want to, of course, cause nightmares, but it was mainly just life, what was life when I grew up and what I... the things I did, and they were fascinated by my accent, and they begged us to have another child, so he or she could have an accent. </sentence><sentence id="5023">They thought that a baby is going to be born with an accent. </sentence><sentence id="5024">And they laughed at my mistakes that I made, because sometimes they were really funny. </sentence><sentence id="5025">And inadvertently, I did say certain things that just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5036">Q: Such as? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5085">A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn't have liked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. </sentence><sentence id="5086">Her mother was a very tolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married. </sentence><sentence id="5087">So, the only relatives around that she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20""-Century human beings, and they are very, very tolerant, and very progressive people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5171">A: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="5172">Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it, but as you were asking me, I realize I didn't really think much about myself any more, as a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="5173">I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="5174">I was more involved in what is happening in America, and thought more about it day by day, than to think too much, to give too much thought about the past. </sentence><sentence id="5175">So, in this respect, it was good, because one should not constantly be visited by ghosts. </sentence><sentence id="5176">So I think it, it was a good thing for me, in this respect. </sentence><sentence id="5177">And you know, I was part of the whole story then, and, rather, an American fighting to end the war, and bring justice to people who were oppressed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5191">Q: What about when you lived in Germany and you're... you're there in this nation that had perpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history there, than your acquaintances had been when you lived in the States. </sentence><sentence id="5192">Was it a bigger issue that The Holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="5193">Was it more of a... did it have more of a place in your life and did you talk about it with people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5197">A: The... now, this is a very complex story. </sentence><sentence id="5198">When we lived in Germany, which was from 1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East Germany, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were bringing it into the open. </sentence><sentence id="5199">It was not something hushed up under the rug. </sentence><sentence id="5200">There were discussions about it in schools. </sentence><sentence id="5201">I spoke about it to high school students, mainly. </sentence><sentence id="5202">The whole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it, really started after the Unification. </sentence><sentence id="5203">Now, I must also say that there weren't too many people who were alive in World War IL, by this time. </sentence><sentence id="5204">Because I was fifteen when the war ended, and I am seventy now, almost. </sentence><sentence id="5205">And so, most people are dead, who were in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="5206">Now of course, it doesn't mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was dead. </sentence><sentence id="5207">Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that it was the proper thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="5208">It would have been totally superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn't have made any difference. </sentence><sentence id="5209">I rather This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5210">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5211"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 concentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation. </sentence><sentence id="5212">And I found that intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5213">They were very ashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. </sentence><sentence id="5214">I felt that they were progressive enough. </sentence><sentence id="5215">The younger German generation amazed me, because I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light. </sentence><sentence id="5216">How... all this changed after the unification, because you had now Eastern Germany joining. </sentence><sentence id="5217">A country that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, only West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according to East Germany, were in West Germany. </sentence><sentence id="5218">So, those people had no background, and they had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it. </sentence><sentence id="5219">And this is why the skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations, basically, come from, East Germany, even today. </sentence><sentence id="5220">Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification didn't bring immediate remedies to all their problems. </sentence><sentence id="5221">So they had to again go back and blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren't too many. </sentence><sentence id="5222">So, since they couldn't attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5305">A: No, no, I did not have any. </sentence><sentence id="5306">I had some German friends and we talked about the Holocaust, and they knew about me, but it... we never really made it into a big deal, and I never really wanted to make it a big deal, I didn't want them to think that I solely exist and maintain the friendship to kind of pound in the subject. </sentence><sentence id="5307">They knew about me, they knew about my life, and we discussed it in... on very civil terms, and I knew that they were genuinely interested and sorry for what happened. </sentence><sentence id="5308">But, other than that, no, no, I did not have any other... occasionally, my high school teacher friend, the German couple, they invited me to their schools, to talk. </sentence><sentence id="5309">And Germans amazed me because, in our house, for example, there was a lady who was a farmer's daughter, and she was in a... kind of a mid-level managerial job with a pharmaceutical company and she had constantly friends from Israel, and she was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="5310">I had another... I have another very old friend in Germany, I met back in the early 1960's, and we have been friends ever since, and she has friends constantly visiting her from Israel. </sentence><sentence id="5311">She's also not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="5312">So, there's a lot of contact between Israel and Germany, and well, I don't know whether this is a result of a... of a bad conscience or something, but certainly you cannot hold somebody who was not even alive at that time responsible for anything that happened. </sentence><sentence id="5313">No, that would be unreasonable. </sentence><sentence id="5314">But it's not...today, it's not a big issue. </sentence><sentence id="5315">It is a sad fact of history, especially in the western part of Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5330">A: Oh, I could have stayed in Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my name, which is a German name and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="5331">And that was just for a few months, so I didn't include in any citizenship, just by a mistake and because of the strange happenings of the times. </sentence><sentence id="5332">They classified me as German in Hungary, and temporarily we were considered Germans, and of course the whole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few month when they found out who we were. </sentence><sentence id="5333">But that little episode and my name, and the fact that the reason the Hungarians tossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my great-grandparents was born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking Czechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all connects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not considered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to Auschwitz, not because he was Jewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner. </sentence><sentence id="5334">He could not prove that his grandfather was a Hungarian, which was not true. </sentence><sentence id="5335">But because of this, and other reasons, I could have gotten German citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="5336">I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of money that way, because of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5337">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5338"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 what happened to my family in World War IJ, and all this, but I never had, for a second, a thought. </sentence><sentence id="5339">I mean, how can I think about settling in Germany, and taking German citizenship?There are so many reasons why I shouldn't have done this, right? </sentence><sentence id="5340">Number one is an emotional thing, a rational thing to... that would be a little bit too much for me to bear. </sentence><sentence id="5341">Second is that I have an American family, and my wife was ready to return to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="5342">There no way would she have stayed in Europe with me. </sentence><sentence id="5343">So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it lasted. </sentence><sentence id="5344">End of Tape 9, Side A This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5345">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5346"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Tape 9, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5462">A: Yes, that was my main concern. </sentence><sentence id="5463">I knew that this is a beautiful state and if I drive an hour from here, I can start hiking and it is really an... an open range, but culturally, I had reservations and I still have reservations. </sentence><sentence id="5464">| feel a little... | would have really felt much worse, perhaps twenty, thirty years ago, but at the time when television brings you, especially the educational channel and the history channel and Discovery and there are so many channels now that you can get, that brings... they bring a lot of good knowledgeable stuff, and this is one thing. </sentence><sentence id="5465">Second, of course, the internet connects you with the world. </sentence><sentence id="5466">So, one is not so isolated any more. </sentence><sentence id="5467">Still, I am still yearning to go to a town where the streets are crowded. </sentence><sentence id="5468">I don't want to live on a crowded street all the time, but sometimes, and I want to go to a sidewalk cafe, and I want to eat some different food that doesn't taste the same, and just converse with people. </sentence><sentence id="5469">I feel that there is, right now in this country, there is great suspicion. </sentence><sentence id="5470">You just can't walk up to people and start talking. </sentence><sentence id="5471">And Kentucky is even better off in this respect than any other state, probably, or most other states. </sentence><sentence id="5472">It just... there is always that suspicion in a person's mind, based on all the stories that we hear day by day by day by day, of violence. </sentence><sentence id="5473">Violence really kind of poisoned the atmosphere in this country a great deal, and I'm very sensitive to that. </sentence><sentence id="5474">So, I would love to just go to a park and sit on a bench sometimes, and just talk to strangers, as I used to when I was younger. </sentence><sentence id="5475">But that's impossible. </sentence><sentence id="5476">We don't go to the park to begin with, because there are no... not many parks, and there aren't... not too many people, if you find a park. </sentence><sentence id="5477">And when it gets dark, of course, you clear out, and you just don't have that kind of a life, that vibrant life that you find still in European cities. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5525">Q: Do you... do people ask you anything about yourself, or have they reached out to you in any way? </sentence><sentence id="5526">Do they ask you about your accent, you know, people in town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5529">A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect. </sentence><sentence id="5530">They are interested my accent, and I cannot really say that they are suspicious or they reject me. </sentence><sentence id="5531">One man, a young man told me this last year. </sentence><sentence id="5532">Said, "You know, you are much better off than I." And he said, "You open your mouth, and everybody says, "Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from?"" </sentence><sentence id="5533">And he said, "I open my mouth and they say, "Hey, you are not from here, are you?" </sentence><sentence id="5534">And you know what they mean," he says, "that I'm a damn Yankee." </sentence><sentence id="5535">And I don't know about this, but all I can say is that nobody has ever reacted negatively toward my accent. </sentence><sentence id="5536">I see that sometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know why they do it and I consider it a friendly gesture. </sentence><sentence id="5537">And that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="5538">The only people I'm really mad at, the ones who listen to me for awhile and say, "What's that?" </sentence><sentence id="5539">Because I know that they are putting me on. </sentence><sentence id="5540">That... if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too. </sentence><sentence id="5541">But... and another thing that, of course irritates me, when... my hearing is not that good any more, and this has nothing to do with accent and all this, it's just that some people are very intolerant, and if you ask, you know, "Will you please repeat it?" </sentence><sentence id="5542">They just say, "Forget it." </sentence><sentence id="5543">And the word forget it really irritates me. </sentence><sentence id="5544">But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign born. </sentence><sentence id="5545">Otherwise, I find that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about being suspicious, much friendlier than they were in some other states that I've travelled. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5567">A: No, I don't do it any more, and frankly, I can't even come up with a good reason why. </sentence><sentence id="5568">Perhaps it's just that I get very busy at home, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I knew, many of them left and I... it's very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to make friends and to build kind of a circle around yourself. </sentence><sentence id="5569">And also when I first joined, the Historical Society was a lot more vital than it is now. </sentence><sentence id="5570">I think it just settled into a routine life, and it just... 1 was just not interested any more. </sentence><sentence id="5571">The museum was established, it's running smoothly. </sentence><sentence id="5572">I don't think they really need me there any more. </sentence><sentence id="5573">So I rather concentrate on the Master Gardener's Association, where I can do something, actually work. </sentence><sentence id="5574">I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I just sit around and talk about what to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5792">A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in Germany while we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="5793">Germany had an economic boom in the 1950's, just like we have now, which meant that the... all the menial and dirty jobs were unfilled. </sentence><sentence id="5794">Most Germans just wouldn't want to work in that, and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could produce. </sentence><sentence id="5795">So they invited in other nationalities as guest workers, that's what they were called, and they were mainly from Turkey. </sentence><sentence id="5796">And this was back in the 50's. </sentence><sentence id="5797">The German economic miracle produced a migration from Turkey, which was legal, completely legal. </sentence><sentence id="5798">They had to have documents, they entered, they went to work in the factories. </sentence><sentence id="5799">Now, today, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has slowed down considerably. </sentence><sentence id="5800">These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="5801">They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a very nice, humanitarian gesture, because Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not allow family members to follow. </sentence><sentence id="5802">They could go home on vacation, send the money back, but nobody was allowed to... allowed to come. </sentence><sentence id="5803">So, the family members came, and you know, one family member then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think today there are close to three million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five million people. </sentence><sentence id="5804">That's quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some people to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="5805">But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on, the real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were already adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, and all the rest. </sentence><sentence id="5806">So now, here came the problem of what to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="5807">Are they citizens, are they not citizens? </sentence><sentence id="5808">And welfare, are they qualified for welfare? </sentence><sentence id="5809">So, I am afraid of the same thing here. </sentence><sentence id="5810">Right now, especially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that these illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. </sentence><sentence id="5811">They are working here in a job that most other people wouldn't take. </sentence><sentence id="5812">So, nobody has great reservations. </sentence><sentence id="5813">When they see...
