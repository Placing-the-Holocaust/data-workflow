My father was the youngest of six children. </sentence><sentence id="26">Uh, his father was a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="27">They were of more ethnic German background in Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="28">Uh, my father went to German schools in Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="29">My mother went to Russian schools. </sentence><sentence id="30">Uh, my parents always spoke Russian to each. </sentence><sentence id="31">My mother's father was a painter and a cantor. </sentence><sentence id="32">And uh died when he...when she was very young. </sentence><sentence id="33">Uh, some of his paintings were so outstanding that uh...My mother's house was always full of...my mother grew up in household full of paintings, and some of his paintings were so outstanding that she even was asked once to donate two of the paintings to the Louvre, but... In Paris, later on. </sentence><sentence id="34">But uh naturally, she only had a few of them and kept them with her. </sentence><sentence id="35">And she still has them. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, my parents met as teenagers, because uh...their older siblings (laughter) were married...got married. </sentence><sentence id="37">My mother's older sister got...was married to my father's older brother. </sentence><sentence id="38">Both my parents had magnificent voices. </sentence><sentence id="39">Uh, my father was a baritone. </sentence><sentence id="40">My mother uh...went to Riga to study at the Conservatory. </sentence><sentence id="41">Uh, she was known there as the girl with the golden voice. </sentence><sentence id="42">Uh, their home town was Liep_ja, which in Russian is Liyepaya [Ger: Libau]. </sentence><sentence id="43">I... They both when to Germany as poor students. </sentence><sentence id="44">My father went first. </sentence><sentence id="45">He uh registered both in engineering school and at the Hochschule fiir Musik, although he first started at the Hochschule fiir Musik in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="46">My mother followed later. </sentence><sentence id="47">They were married in 1928 in Latvia, with both families present; and then they went back to study in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="48">Uh, one day my father sang...had the opportunity the audition for the composer Mascagni, who urged him to go to Italy with his beautiful voice. </sentence><sentence id="49">But he had no monev. </sentence><sentence id="50">and he was on full scholarshin in Germanv. </sentence><sentence id="51">And so Mascaoni said." </sentence><sentence id="52">Ttalia." </sentence><sentence id="53">Mv  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 2 too. </sentence><sentence id="54">Uh, shortly after they were married, my father got a job offer to sing at the Breslau [NB: Wroclaw] Opera Company. </sentence><sentence id="55">He took a stage name, Yasha Lenssen. </sentence><sentence id="56">Uh, his real name is Jacob...Jacob Levinsons. </sentence><sentence id="57">My mother is Pauline Levine. </sentence><sentence id="58">Uh, he was asked to sing the leading roles in 19 operas--the baritone roles. </sentence><sentence id="59">But soon after, they found out that uh his stage name, Lenssen, really was Levinsons--which, of course, he was not about to hide anyway. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh, they decided to cancel his contract. </sentence><sentence id="61">This was in the early "30s in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="62">So my father, having completed some of his university studies at that time, decided to go into business in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="63">And his father helped him out by uh introducing him to someone who needed a contact in Germany for a business. </sentence><sentence id="64">And so my father became a representative in Berlin for a business firm abroad, and was quite successful at that. </sentence><sentence id="65">And they started uh...from being very poor students and living in very, very cramped one-room (laughing) without any money at all, both on scholarships, to being able to set themselves up in a little apartment in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="66">My father did quite well. </sentence><sentence id="67">Uh, I was born at that time--as I said, in 1934. </sentence><sentence id="68">And when I was about uh 6 months old, my parents decided that I should have a photograph taken of me; and my mother took me to a photographer. </sentence><sentence id="69">One of the best in Berlin! </sentence><sentence id="70">And he did...he made a very beautiful picture--which my parents thought, at least, was a very beautiful picture-- which my parents had framed and put on the piano that my father gave my mother as a present when I was born. </sentence><sentence id="71">And there was this picture on the piano. </sentence><sentence id="72">One day, the lady who came to clean...help my mother clean the apartment, Frau Klauke, said to my mother, "You know, I saw Hessy on a magazine cover in town." </sentence><sentence id="73">And my mother thought surely she must be mistaken, that there are many babies that look alike, and just told her, "Well, that couldn't be [the] case." </sentence><sentence id="74">Uh, the lady insisted; and she says, "No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="75">It's definitely Hessy. </sentence><sentence id="76">It's this picture. </sentence><sentence id="77">And...and just give me some money, and I'll get you the magazine." </sentence><sentence id="78">And so my mother did. </sentence><sentence id="79">And sure enough, this lady came back with a magazine, the front cover which said, "Sonne ins Haus"--which in German means, "the Sun in the Home." </sentence><sentence id="80">And there was the picture on the piano reproduced on the front cover of this magazine. </sentence><sentence id="81">This magazine was published out of Leipzig, and very definitely one of the few magazines allowed to circulate in Germany at the time, because it was a Nazi magazine. </sentence><sentence id="82">On the inside of the magazine were pictures of the Army with men wearing swastikas. </sentence><sentence id="83">There's a picture of the Fuhrer himself reviewing the troops. </sentence><sentence id="84">There were pictures of the Hitlerjugend, and uh several of their activities, both in marching and in campfires and all other activities. </sentence><sentence id="85">It was a family magazine. </sentence><sentence id="86">My parents were horrified. </sentence><sentence id="87">They didn't know quite how this came about; except that my mother, naturally, rushed over to the photographer. </sentence><sentence id="88">She said to him, "What is this?How did this happen?" </sentence><sentence id="89">And the photographer quickly sort of closed the door, pulled the blinds, and told her to...very quietly admonished her to keep quiet. </sentence><sentence id="90">And he says, "Sssh...I will tell you the following. </sentence><sentence id="91">I was asked to submit the...my ten best pictures for a beauty contest tun by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="92">So were ten other outstanding photographers in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="93">So ten photographers submitted their ten best pictures. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I sent in your baby's picture." </sentence><sentence id="95">And my mother said, "But you knew that this is a Jewish child." </sentence><sentence id="96">And the photographer said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="97">And this is a quote that I have always... My parents say he said, in German, "Ich wollte mir den Spass erlauben"--"I wanted to allow myself the pleasure of this joke." </sentence><sentence id="98">And then he told my mother, "And you see, I was right. </sentence><sentence id="99">Of all the babies, they picked this baby as the perfect Aryan." </sentence><sentence id="100">There was a beauty competition to select a baby that would represent the perfect example of the Aryan race to further the Nazi philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="101">That was pro...being promoted in  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 3 Germany at the time. </sentence><sentence id="102">Magazine came out in early 1935. </sentence><sentence id="103">Uh, my parents were both shocked by the possible consequences that this could bring, and amazed at the irony of it all. </sentence><sentence id="104">But they felt at the moment to keep...that it was best to keep it quiet. ( </sentence><sentence id="105">Cough) Well, before...there were several consequences that resulted from this. ( </sentence><sentence id="106">Cough) (Drinking water) Uh, one, my parents noted right away that dress shops that advertised beauti...that had baby clothes, that were selling baby clothes had put the picture in their store front windows. </sentence><sentence id="107">Uh, post cards were reproduced made from that picture just for mailing. </sentence><sentence id="108">They were used...they were on every newsstand in the country. </sentence><sentence id="109">They were post cards. </sentence><sentence id="110">One day, one of my mother's...my father's sisters, Ida...my Tante Ida--who was living in Lithuania at the time--went into a store to buy me a birthday card for my first birthday. </sentence><sentence id="111">That was in May "35. </sentence><sentence id="112">And she picked up...she saw that nicture with a statement on the bottom " "__"Rect wishes to the Birthdav""--  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 4 thought. </sentence><sentence id="113">Uh, however, Hieronomus (ph) played a very important role in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="114">Uh, there was one day when the Gestapo marched into my father's office and simply arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="115">It had turned out that somebody had reported him, for some reason that remains obscure. </sentence><sentence id="116">One of the uh people with whom he was dealing apparently reported him. </sentence><sentence id="117">And my father was taken away by the Gestapo, and Hieronomus (ph) did (chuckle) a classic movie type scene. </sentence><sentence id="118">He got in his car and followed the car that my father was in. </sentence><sentence id="119">He was taken to some headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="120">And within minutes, Hieronomus (ph) had followed, threw open the doors, apparently screamed, "Heil Hitler!" </sentence><sentence id="121">He was immediately admitted to the room. </sentence><sentence id="122">And Hieronomus (ph) vouched for my father as not being uh in any way associated with anything anti the Regime. </sentence><sentence id="123">My mother also had some experiences that were sort of unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="124">One of the neighbors in the house had uh reported her as having criticized Hitler once. </sentence><sentence id="125">She just...a comment she had made on one of...photographs that Hitler made once. </sentence><sentence id="126">And the landlord of the building vouched for my mother. [ </sentence><sentence id="127">He] said, "No, she could never have said anything unpleasant about our leader." </sentence><sentence id="128">And so there were people who helped them here and there. </sentence><sentence id="129">But things got very, very tenuous. </sentence><sentence id="130">And so my father decided to move to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="131">And we moved to Paris before the war. </sentence><sentence id="132">During this time, my parents were very close to their families. </sentence><sentence id="133">And we had spent every summer in Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="134">Uh, in 1938, we had spent the summer in Latvia again. </sentence><sentence id="135">Uh, that was the last time we went, because in the summer of "39 my father said, "This year we are not going." </sentence><sentence id="136">And probably if he hadn't made that decision, I wouldn't be here today. </sentence><sentence id="137">In any case, all those who were left behind were...died in the war. </sentence><sentence id="138">The only people who survived were one brothers of my mother's who came to America; some of my father's older brothers and sisters who had come here also when he was a child, long before the war; my Aunt Masha, who was with us in Germany, who went to England; and my aunt and uncle who had moved to Leningrad. </sentence><sentence id="139">Everyone else landed up being victims of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="140">My...L...L..] should say... Let me back up a little. </sentence><sentence id="141">My two grandfathers had died before the war. </sentence><sentence id="142">My mother's father died when she was a child--the painter. </sentence><sentence id="143">Uh, my father's father died shortly before I was born, and I was named after him. </sentence><sentence id="144">His name was Hessel (ph). </sentence><sentence id="145">Uh, we moved to Paris, and life there was both interesting and difficult. </sentence><sentence id="146">Interesting, because my parents enjoyed the cultural life and excitement that the city has to offer; but difficult, because of the times, of course, and the difficulty of getting settled. </sentence><sentence id="147">My father was amazingly ingenious, and was able to set up business and start working again. </sentence><sentence id="148">Uh, after Paris fell, I became very conscious...I was told, "Don't speak German on the streets." </sentence><sentence id="149">And my sister and I were very conscious of the fact that we... somehow it was bad to speak German, and we...it was very difficult for us, who grew up speaking... At that time we spoke German and French. </sentence><sentence id="150">But uh I remember one time we were befriended by some German soldiers, and they gave us chocolates. </sentence><sentence id="151">And we started talking to them, until we realized that we had been told not to do that and then ran away, very quickly. ( </sentence><sentence id="152">Chuckle) Anyway, uh we were in France altogether...uh we were in Paris when France fell, and...or became occupied. </sentence><sentence id="153">And at one point, the concierge of my parents" building--which was in the very elegant area of the 16th arrondissement in France, in Paris--uh told...warned us that Germans were coming and rounding up Jews, and suggested that we not go back to the apartment right away. </sentence><sentence id="154">My father then arranged for my mother and my sister and I uh to uh go to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer. </sentence><sentence id="155">My sister is called Noemi. </sentence><sentence id="156">So Noemi, my mother and I moved to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer, which is in...on the coast, on the Atlantic Coast of France--not far from Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="157">My father stayed  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 5 in Paris trying to arrange ways to leave. </sentence><sentence id="158">He um...my mother had a rather difficult time in [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer. </sentence><sentence id="159">Uh, the...she was conscious of being the only Jew in this so-called resort hotel where we...my father had arranged for us to stay. </sentence><sentence id="160">I remember distinctly there was one Frenchman who was rather aloof and cold and severe looking. </sentence><sentence id="161">But he had a big dog that Noemi and I loved to play with, and we played with him quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="162">Well, one day the landlady of the resort told my mother that she would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="163">That she was under too much pressure, and that she could not keep us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="164">So my mother went to the Chief of Police of the town, and he was very cooperative. </sentence><sentence id="165">He said to her, "I believe that there are people in this town who are not acting in the best interest for France. </sentence><sentence id="166">I will see what I can do in your behalf." </sentence><sentence id="167">So my mother felt reassured. </sentence><sentence id="168">Shortly thereafter, the man with the dog disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="169">It turned out that he was spying for the Germans; and the Chief of Police was only too glad to have been able to accumulate enough evidence that I guess he had from other sources to arrest him. </sentence><sentence id="170">Nevertheless, my mother's life got to be more and more complicated and trying. </sentence><sentence id="171">And soon enough, shortly thereafter the concierge came and told my mother the same story again. </sentence><sentence id="172">But this time, there was no question that she would have to leave by the next day. </sentence><sentence id="173">My mother tried her friend, the Chief of Police, again. </sentence><sentence id="174">And he told her, "Madame Levinsons, I have done everything I can for you." </sentence><sentence id="175">He could handle French, but right now the Germans were down his back and now he couldn't do anything further for her. </sentence><sentence id="176">So that night, my mother tells me that she resorted to all praying and pleading for help...(long sigh)...at guidance for her family from the Lord for some way of trying to see what she could do so she would not get separated from her husband because that's how families got separated during the war, and she knew that if she had to leave, he would never find us again. </sentence><sentence id="177">And while she was up that whole night, pacing the whole night, around 4 o'clock in the morning there was a knock on the door, and the concierge was knocking said, "Madame Levinsons! </sentence><sentence id="178">Madame Levinsons! </sentence><sentence id="179">Votre mari est arrive. </sentence><sentence id="180">"--"Y our husband is here." </sentence><sentence id="181">It was the most joyous moment my mother could imagine at the time. </sentence><sentence id="182">We packed up the car, and the four of us drove away and we drove to meet a group. </sentence><sentence id="183">And my own memory is rather vague of that at the time. </sentence><sentence id="184">But we joined up with a group that was going to take us across occupied territory to the Zone Libre [NB: "Free Zone"], which Nice was still in the Zone Libre at the time. </sentence><sentence id="185">We met some other people from Paris also, some other friends of ours. </sentence><sentence id="186">And...in this group; and we apparently at one point, we went by truck to a certain point, and then we had to go across the woods, walking through swamp that...and be very, very quiet-- because apparently a German encampment was behind the woods. </sentence><sentence id="187">At the end of that road, at the end of those...there would be another truck to meet us. </sentence><sentence id="188">Uh, I did not know those details at the time. ( </sentence><sentence id="189">Chuckle) What knew is that this very ominous looking Frenchman, who had this enormous knife around his belt, took it out and told the children that any kid who opened his mouth would have his tongue cut out. </sentence><sentence id="190">Let me tell you, I have never forgotten that moment.(Chuckle) I went with my lips sealed like this throughout the entire escapade. </sentence><sentence id="191">Except that, at one point, I couldn't contain myself and I asked my father's friend--who held me by the hand- -I said, "What are we doing?" </sentence><sentence id="192">He said, "This is a sport. </sentence><sentence id="193">We're running. </sentence><sentence id="194">This is a sport." </sentence><sentence id="195">And I said, "I hate this sport." </sentence><sentence id="196">And then I saw this guy with a knife, and I contained myself. </sentence><sentence id="197">The babies, the children--including my sister Noemi--were all fed chocolates. </sentence><sentence id="198">They got all the chocolates one could round up during the war to keep these kids quiet. </sentence><sentence id="199">We got to the Zone Libre, and immediately my father applied for American immigration. </sentence><sentence id="200">Uh, I think, in fact, if--  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 6 although my memory is not quite sure about this at the time--I think, in fact, that my father had applied for it while he was still in Paris, and had been granted it at that point when we arrived in Nice. </sentence><sentence id="201">But when you get an American immigration visa--which is hard to get, because you need to prove that you can sustain yourself and, you know, you're not going to land up being on welfare or burden to anyone in this country, uh ...and that you are good health and so. </sentence><sentence id="202">But even after all this, you are told that you have 90 days to reach American shores. </sentence><sentence id="203">And my father realized, as time was going by, that there was no way in which he could get his family to the U.S. within the time timeframe left. </sentence><sentence id="204">Thirty days before the visa expired, he requested an extension from Washington. </sentence><sentence id="205">The Atlantic...you know, across the Atlantic, there were no commercial flights at the time. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh, this was in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="207">Uh, the ocean was patrolled. </sentence><sentence id="208">Submarines...uh... Anyway, we waited for a reply from Washington. </sentence><sentence id="209">And [it] eventually came, and it said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="210">They denied us an extension. </sentence><sentence id="211">So, again, (sigh) I guess I could say it's not thanks to Uncle Sam that I am sitting here today. </sentence><sentence id="212">My father tried every avenue available to him. </sentence><sentence id="213">He went to a series of Latin American consulates in France, and uh...in Nice; and eventually landed up with a Cuban Consulate who would listen to him, also accept some money, and granted him visas to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="214">Uh, we spent a relatively...my sister and I have relatively nice memories of Nice. </sentence><sentence id="215">Uh, it was...it was not much food. </sentence><sentence id="216">My parents never wanted to touch ratatouille again, because that's the only thing they ate for 8 months.(Chuckle) Uh, we didn't go to school, of course. </sentence><sentence id="217">We did try to lead some kind of normal semblance of life. </sentence><sentence id="218">I remember it was that time when I learned swimming. </sentence><sentence id="219">I learned to swim, had some swimming lessons. </sentence><sentence id="220">Somehow tried to lead a fairly normal life. </sentence><sentence id="221">The one very important person joined us at that time who had been left behind at Paris for a while, and that is our nurse, uh Gerta. </sentence><sentence id="222">Gerta was a German-Jewish nurse who came to take care of me when my sister was born. </sentence><sentence id="223">In other words, my mother hired her in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="224">Uh, I was extremely spoiled at the time. ( </sentence><sentence id="225">Laughing) I'm back tracking a bit. </sentence><sentence id="226">Gerta had a terrible time with me.(Laughter) Maybe partly because of all the fuss that was made about me. </sentence><sentence id="227">But anyway, she vowed that the next baby's not going to be so spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="228">Gerta was extremely attached to Noemi. </sentence><sentence id="229">To me, too, I think, eventually. </sentence><sentence id="230">In any case, my parents were very devoted to her; and we both grew up feeling very close to her, uh and Gerta was with us in Nice. </sentence><sentence id="231">My father...uh eventually got us a visa to Cuba, and was told that Gerta would get the visa eventually, too, to the United States, because she had a brother in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="232">So we left, and went to Marseilles. </sentence><sentence id="233">In Marseilles, we waited for a ship to take us to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="234">It's funny, you know. </sentence><sentence id="235">When I think back, my mother says she was wonderful...very good student in school except in geography. </sentence><sentence id="236">And geography was her worst subject. </sentence><sentence id="237">She didn't even know where Cuba was on the map before she found out about us, and here we were going to go to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="238">But, in any case, uh the uh one interesting thing happened before we left. </sentence><sentence id="239">My father heard that Gerta was not going to get the visa to the United States, and that she was left behind. </sentence><sentence id="240">And he was going to try to get her out. </sentence><sentence id="241">But by that time, there was a German line of control and you had to have special passes to go from Nice to Marseilles-- which we had, but my father did not have a pass to go back and get her. </sentence><sentence id="242">And he really wanted to go back and get Gerta out. </sentence><sentence id="243">So he thought he's going to try it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="244">He boarded a train in Marseilles without a pass. </sentence><sentence id="245">He had a ticket, but that wasn't the issue. </sentence><sentence id="246">And he got himself...he got on the train, and then he thought of a very clever way to foil the French. </sentence><sentence id="247">When he got to the border- -the "border" in the sense of the occupied zone--and, of course, at that time the Petain regime  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 7 was cooperating with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="248">Although they were all French patrolling, they were all cooperating with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="249">And he thought [to] himself, "There is only one way to foil the French. </sentence><sentence id="250">What is it that is holy to the French? </sentence><sentence id="251">Dining and eating is holy to the French." </sentence><sentence id="252">So he went to the dining car, and started eating and eating and eating and drinking and wined. </sentence><sentence id="253">And they sat at that border for hours, and he kept on eating non-stop. </sentence><sentence id="254">He wasn't do diddling or daddling. </sentence><sentence id="255">He was eating. </sentence><sentence id="256">And he ate for several hours, and nobody touched him. </sentence><sentence id="257">And he made it to Nice. </sentence><sentence id="258">And when he made it to Nice, he had a gold cigarette case that he went to pawn to get some money. </sentence><sentence id="259">And he got that money, and was able to help Gerta in case she needed passage. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then he went back to the Cuban Consulate and said he needs another visa. </sentence><sentence id="261">And the Consulate denied. </sentence><sentence id="262">He says, "Impossible! </sentence><sentence id="263">Impossible! </sentence><sentence id="264">I am already in hot water for having given you all this. </sentence><sentence id="265">Impossible! </sentence><sentence id="266">I have given away too many. </sentence><sentence id="267">I cannot give another person." </sentence><sentence id="268">My father was not dis...easily to be dissuaded; and he persisted and persisted, and, of course, they got nowhere for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="269">And finally the Cuban Consulate said, "You know, there is an old law on the books that when you're given your visa, you can take all your possessions with you. </sentence><sentence id="270">Now, the old law says that slaves are a possession of the owner. </sentence><sentence id="271">Would you say that this lady is...woman is your slave?" </sentence><sentence id="272">And my father quickly said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="273">She is my slave and my possession, and she needs to come with me." </sentence><sentence id="274">And on that basis, Gerta got the grant...visa to come to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="275">But she did not have a pass to get back to Marseilles, and that was too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="276">He somehow arranged for her to get to Casablanca. </sentence><sentence id="277">All of this was extremely complicated and extremely difficult to do. </sentence><sentence id="278">My father was really very ingenious. </sentence><sentence id="279">Uh, and somehow, again, he got himself back to Marseilles through the line. </sentence><sentence id="280">Apparently, on the way back there was not such a long border stop. </sentence><sentence id="281">But the big crisis was on one way. </sentence><sentence id="282">He had...he did have his visa to Cuba on...to show that he could get out. </sentence><sentence id="283">So on the way back, it wasn't quite as difficult for him as rationale for going into Nice. </sentence><sentence id="284">We sailed on a Portugese ship, the _(ph), from Marseilles in the beginning of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="285">Uh, I remember stopping in Casablanca to an impression I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="286">The dazzling sun, the enormous amount of sand, women were all veiled, long robes for men. </sentence><sentence id="287">I thought this was some storybook. </sentence><sentence id="288">I had no idea what was happening and where we were. </sentence><sentence id="289">I was absolutely stunned at this image. </sentence><sentence id="290">Uh, we were not...we did not get off the boat. </sentence><sentence id="291">But in Casablanca, Gerta got on. </sentence><sentence id="292">And that was a very emotional reunion. </sentence><sentence id="293">Then we proceeded across the Atlantic with a ship full of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="294">My dear father provided for his family. </sentence><sentence id="295">We had a first class cabin all to ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="296">Before leaving Europe, my...one of the things my father had arranged for, while he was still in Paris, is to have all our furniture stored someplace safely in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="297">And so he had it stored in Portugal. </sentence><sentence id="298">And the reason was not so much the furniture--although it was quite elegant Queen Anne furniture which my parent...father had set up this very lovely apartment on the Rue de Messine in Paris when we had lived there. </sentence><sentence id="299">But the thing that was critical in that...in...in...in that box that the furniture [was in] were my grandfather's paintings. </sentence><sentence id="300">There were three of them...three paintings in there, which my father managed to store in Portugal, and which we recuperated after the war and after we came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="301">The three paintings are, one, a self portrait of my grandfather, who looks like Toulouse-Lautrec--big black hat, big fur coat, very distinguished looking. </sentence><sentence id="302">A picture...painting of his father-in-law, [ (ph)], in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="303">The light shining on him looks like that picture would come alive. </sentence><sentence id="304">I think that was the one that they wanted for the Museum. </sentence><sentence id="305">And a third picture, of a painting of a poor man who used to not always have enough food that my grandmother used to offer a  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 8 cup of tea. </sentence><sentence id="306">She'd offer him some borscht or some tea, and would feed him. </sentence><sentence id="307">And so that's the portrait, the third painting that we have. </sentence><sentence id="308">My Aunt Masha brought two other paintings too. </sentence><sentence id="309">Uh, one is a magnificent...uh...paysage [Fr: "landscape"]--a scene of trees, the Berioshkas in snow. </sentence><sentence id="310">And another is uh a scene of a...one of their brothers studying for Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="311">So those are the five paintings that we now have in New York. </sentence><sentence id="312">Anyway, we went on to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="313">The boat...it took 3 and a half weeks to cross the Atlantic through a very circuitous route--to the very south, because we needed to avoid the war zones. </sentence><sentence id="314">Uh, we went far south, I believe, to cross and landed up first in Jamaica, which was again a very interesting uh sight for me. </sentence><sentence id="315">The...the trees, the climate, the people carrying baskets on their heads. </sentence><sentence id="316">I remember little things like that. </sentence><sentence id="317">Anyway, we went on to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="318">This entire ship full of refugees, the entire hull of the ship, the basement people sleeping on the floor, all these people... (Sigh) We got off on Cuba and were put in a camp. </sentence><sentence id="319">It was called Camp Tiscornia. </sentence><sentence id="320">Uh, they didn't quite know what to do with us either. ( </sentence><sentence id="321">Laughter) Which I guess was true of all the refugees, all from Europe and all different...many places. </sentence><sentence id="322">And we spent several weeks in Tiscornia, during which time my father figured how is he going to get started. </sentence><sentence id="323">He had pawned most of what he had in Europe to pay for visas and passage and boat; and we had just some, you know, few suitcases of personal possessions with us. </sentence><sentence id="324">He started to go to several banks in Cuba and asked for a loan to help him get started for a business. </sentence><sentence id="325">Uh, he had a lot of courage. </sentence><sentence id="326">He just walked into many of the banks, mostly American banks that were uh...had had, you know, large branches in Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="327">And (Laughter) they all asked, "What do you have for collateral?" " </sentence><sentence id="328">Myself. </sentence><sentence id="329">I am an honest man, and offer you me as collateral." </sentence><sentence id="330">And, as you can imagine, a bank doesn't deal with this kind of business. </sentence><sentence id="331">And they all laughed at him. </sentence><sentence id="332">Until, one day, he walked into the Royal Bank of Canada. </sentence><sentence id="333">And the Canadian uh officials at the bank looked at him and said, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="334">We think we're going to give you a chance. </sentence><sentence id="335">We'll take our luck with you." </sentence><sentence id="336">And so they helped my father get started. </sentence><sentence id="337">He started first with uh some working in pin...with pineapple business, which was a wonderful product of Cuba, but realized that soon enough that wasn't going to be good for export to the United States because of competition from Hawaii. </sentence><sentence id="338">So he, by that time, got very clever about realizing that the Cubans had good cattle and were throwing away all kinds of meat casings and so on. </sentence><sentence id="339">Things that were...from the slaughter houses, things that were in ample use in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="340">Uh, and he decided to set up a factory, the first factory...such factory in Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="341">Uh, we lived a very good life in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="342">We learned Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="343">Uh, we learned English, because my parents thought that we should go to a...someday we might still come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="344">So they wanted to send us to a English-speaking school. </sentence><sentence id="345">My parents were shocked at the American school in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="346">Uh, the American kids seemed to them totally undisciplined--chewing gum, the kinds of things (laughing) my parents were totally not used to. </sentence><sentence id="347">So Noemi and I landed up in a British school. </sentence><sentence id="348">A rather strict British school. </sentence><sentence id="349">And we had a few months of instruction of English; and then, the fall of "42, started in school. </sentence><sentence id="350">Uh, we knew neither language. </sentence><sentence id="351">We landed up learning English and Spanish simultaneously. </sentence><sentence id="352">We spoke German and French when we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="353">Uh, we didn't find it difficult, I must say. </sentence><sentence id="354">Kids learn very quickly, you know. </sentence><sentence id="355">It's a shame more people don't realize that. </sentence><sentence id="356">You learn...learning a language is very easy when you're a child. </sentence><sentence id="357">Uh, the one thing we did rebel against is French lessons. </sentence><sentence id="358">My father thought that French is a beautiful language, and he didn't want us to forget it. </sentence><sentence id="359">And so he hired a strict, fat, ugly French teacher to come and give us French lessons. </sentence><sentence id="360"> USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 9 Now, I should back up as a little personal history. </sentence><sentence id="361">I grew up as a child not being able to stand ugly people. </sentence><sentence id="362">That's not a very good trait, but uh I couldn't stand an ugly nurse when I was a baby. </sentence><sentence id="363">I couldn't stand her to touch me. </sentence><sentence id="364">And this French teacher just turned me off. </sentence><sentence id="365">My sister didn't want to learn French at all. </sentence><sentence id="366">We both screamed and stomped, "We will never go back there! </sentence><sentence id="367">Whoever wants to go back to that place?" </sentence><sentence id="368">You know. </sentence><sentence id="369">Uh, my father persisted. </sentence><sentence id="370">And, of course, we've been back to France. </sentence><sentence id="371">So, anyway, we both learned. </sentence><sentence id="372">And Gerta, of course, was singularly untalented for learning any languages. </sentence><sentence id="373">She barely learned Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="374">She eventually learned English, and did go back to her brother in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="375">But not until I was 12 and Noemi was 10. </sentence><sentence id="376">So she spent a good time of...portion of time with us in Cuba, always speaking German to us. </sentence><sentence id="377">So we landed up speaking German and French, and German...1 mean, and English and Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="378">We had a wonderful life in Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="379">My father became very successful. </sentence><sentence id="380">My mother had help. </sentence><sentence id="381">Life was easy. </sentence><sentence id="382">We enjoyed the schools. </sentence><sentence id="383">Uh, Noemi and I were...I was very, very reluctant to ever tell anyone that I was born in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="384">I have not admitted that to anyone until I started telling people about the...my story. </sentence><sentence id="385">The magazine. </sentence><sentence id="386">Until then, everyone always thought that I was French. </sentence><sentence id="387">My friends from Havana (laughter)...40 years later, I hate to tell them now. </sentence><sentence id="388">They still think I was born in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="389">It was very...it was something we didn't want to admit, about being German. </sentence><sentence id="390">Uh, even German- Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="391">We just didn't want any part of anything that had the German. </sentence><sentence id="392">We didn't want to talk German, except with Gerta. </sentence><sentence id="393">And I never did enjoy talking German after that; but now I guess I do. </sentence><sentence id="394">Uh, I can also say that years later--even after I was married--and my husband went to Germany on business trips many times, and I refused to go with him for years. </sentence><sentence id="395">But that's just an aside. </sentence><sentence id="396">Uh, eventually... Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: At what point did you come to the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: Uh, as soon as we got a visa. ( </sentence><sentence id="784">Laughter) My father wanted us to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="785">He did not want us to live in Cuba forever, uh because...for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="786">He did not want us to marry Catholics, and he did not want us to lead the lives of the Cuban housewife--which invariably meant staying at home while husbands had mistresses. </sentence><sentence id="787">And he realized that was...did not correspond to his value system-- or my mother's, for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="788">So it was again a matter of trying to get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="789">After the war, of course, my parents being Latvian, they were...from citizens from behind the Iron Curtain. </sentence><sentence id="790">And it was very difficult to get another Lat...American visa. </sentence><sentence id="791">But we did come... eventually get the visa. </sentence><sentence id="792">Uh, and we uh...got the immigration visa in 1948, which meant that we came to the United States and immigrated. </sentence><sentence id="793">But we went back to Cuba to live. </sentence><sentence id="794">You don't have to stay here as an immigrant. </sentence><sentence id="795">I...You know, once you immigrate, you don't...that doesn't stop you from travelling. </sentence><sentence id="796">So we went back to Cuba still for a year or so, then came back and eventually settled here. </sentence><sentence id="797">Uh, my sister and I were both teenagers at the time. </sentence><sentence id="798">I spent only two years in high school in New York, and was very miserable. </sentence><sentence id="799">Uh, I was really not geared to be a New York teenager. </sentence><sentence id="800">I wore pigtails and bobby socks, uh no make-up. </sentence><sentence id="801">I was really, uh as some of my friends said, "square." </sentence><sentence id="802">Uh, I was very unhappy in high school in New York. </sentence><sentence id="803">Big high school. </sentence><sentence id="804">Uh, I came from a small private school in Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="805">I eventually found my niche in New York when I went to college. </sentence><sentence id="806">I found I had very good scholastic background from the school. </sentence><sentence id="807">As I said, I only spent two years in high school here. </sentence><sentence id="808">I was able to, you know, finish my  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 10 language study and I had good history background and I spoke English with a British accent- -which, by the way, landed me the privilege of landing up in a foreign accent speech class in the New York City high school, to get rid of my foreign accent. </sentence><sentence id="809">And there I found myself with all the Puerto Rican children, and we just had a wonderful time talking Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="810">In any case, I went to Barnard College. </sentence><sentence id="811">Uh, my father preferred that I go to Barnard rather than to Radcliffe, so that I would still be in New York. </sentence><sentence id="812">He was still commuting to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="813">His business was still in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="814">He had met a friend of his who survived the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="815">A high...a childhood friend, who came out of the camp with the numbers and everything. </sentence><sentence id="816">And he said to Charlie Salkin (ph), was his name, "Charlie, why don't you go to Havana, run the factory for me. </sentence><sentence id="817">And I will do the export and the business end of it from New York." </sentence><sentence id="818">And so they did that. </sentence><sentence id="819">My father spent a lot of time commuting to Havana, which is why he had hoped that I would stay in New York for college. </sentence><sentence id="820">I didn't think I would like Barnard, but really began to find my niche there and really enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="821">I majored in chemistry and did graduate in biochemistry. </sentence><sentence id="822">Uh, my father's business eventually collapsed in Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="823">As you well know, the events in Cuba led to Castro, eventually. </sentence><sentence id="824">And my poor father lost his business again. </sentence><sentence id="825">And by that time, he was older. </sentence><sentence id="826">And his friends in New York, everyone, was very worried about how he was going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="827">My father was the eternal optimist. </sentence><sentence id="828">He always said, "I have survived Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="829">I will survive Castro." </sentence><sentence id="830">And he did. </sentence><sentence id="831">He did. </sentence><sentence id="832">He came to New York, and his business was taken from him. </sentence><sentence id="833">Charlie eventually immigrated to Miami himself. </sentence><sentence id="834">And his business apparently was sold to Poland, and eventually collapsed because they couldn't run it. </sentence><sentence id="835">They didn't have spare parts. </sentence><sentence id="836">So as far as we know, it's dead. </sentence><sentence id="837">Uh, I met my husband in New York. </sentence><sentence id="838">Uh, my husband is born American. </sentence><sentence id="839">His name is Earl. </sentence><sentence id="840">He is a mathematician. </sentence><sentence id="841">He has a Ph.D. from Yale, and was an instructor at Columbia when I met him. </sentence><sentence id="842">Uh, we were married in New York. </sentence><sentence id="843">My uh...we had children several years later. </sentence><sentence id="844">Our first daughter was born, Nina. </sentence><sentence id="845">Nina Chaya. </sentence><sentence id="846">We called ...named her after my paternal grandmother, whose name was Chaya. </sentence><sentence id="847">And uh...two years later, in 19... Nina was born in 1963, and Alexander Joseph was born in 1965. </sentence><sentence id="848">Alex was named after my mother's brother, Joseph, who had died shortly before he was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
