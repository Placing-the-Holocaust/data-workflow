<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1078">A: I can tell you only what I have seen, in these times I have seen Jewish policemen, and I was told -- so | remember that when we come to the ghetto it should be one or two days before the 15th of August 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1079">We found already Jewish police there. </sentence><sentence id="1080">Some of them were occupied by helping to build the fence and some of them were also staying and working some places, the lines. </sentence><sentence id="1081">The lines of the stores. </sentence><sentence id="1082">There were special stores for Jewish people, already in the city of Kovno, so maybe they are moved to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Anyway, there were certain places to deliver food, very small homes, very small at the beginning of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1084">So, you can feel, I could feel that somebody is -- we knew that it is a committee so that we can feel that someone is taking care, or delivering food. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Somebody has to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1086">And also, the policemen are, they must have more higher degrees of commanders and so on, so we knew that it is a certain organization which is responsible for the ghetto and this 100 percent Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1087">But we didn't know how much they can decide, how long, how far. </sentence><sentence id="1088">That we couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I remember that one day it was Yom Kippur when many people were praying so we saw that from, he is coming a Jewish man, his name is Luria (ph), Luria, and he's telling, "Look we know you are going to pray. </sentence><sentence id="1090">It's very important for you, maybe also for us, but what's more important is you have stopped to do it and everybody who is in a certain age," he tell them, "You have to come and to work very, very urgent, because Germans demand I don't know how many thousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort." </sentence><sentence id="1091">Maybr he told us the aerodromes (ph), the airports. " </sentence><sentence id="1092">And you have to do it, I'm sorry that I have to interrupt you." </sentence><sentence id="1093">So, he went from one to another, from one place to another and people really stopped pray except the old people or what the kids and went to the work. </sentence><sentence id="1094">I don't know if  the Germans did it special for Yom Kippur or maybe for them it wasn't -- they did it from their point of view, but that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1095">So we couldn't understand that this man, everybody shout, "That's Luria," he was, before the war he was a judge. </sentence><sentence id="1096">A judge it -- we had not many Jewish judges in Lithuania, so maybe it was one or two, so he was very authoritatic, he were talking in language of orders, explained very short, that is so, we understood that it's from the Committee. </sentence><sentence id="1097">We called it a committee, the word Elderstrat (ph), we didn't knew yet, but bit by bit we knew it and we have to -- we came to see also the house. </sentence><sentence id="1098">It was in the middle of the ghetto, the big ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1099">It was a brown house, two floors, but we didn't call not this Elderstrat, and not Judenrat, but the Commitet (ph), in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1100">Comitet, it means committee. </sentence><sentence id="1101">Even till the end. </sentence><sentence id="1102">On the other hand, on their announcements, the papers, it was signed Elderstrat or Chairman of the Elderstrat, so and so, or Secretary of the Elderstrat, so bit by bit we understand also this term, and I remember that in the house of the staff, it was two floors, in one room was a certain -- on a door was hanging a certain announcement, Va'ad (ph) in Hebrew, Va'ad Ziknei Ha'Eidah (ph), it's old name for the Eldest of Zion. </sentence><sentence id="1103">So the eldest of the community it's a paraphrase, so in Yiddish Elderstart and also in German and maybe also in Lithuanian, I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1104">So, bit by bit we knew that this was the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1132">Q: Did you know any of these people who formed the Consul of Elders or Committee? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1134">A: Yes, we knew it bit by bit. </sentence><sentence id="1135">Nobody come and told us, "You know, we have a committee from this day and so on and so on," but we knew, of course we knew Dr. Elkous, the name. </sentence><sentence id="1136">We knew Yaakov Goldberg, we knew Rabbi Shmulker (ph) and maybe others knew more. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I was only a youngster at this time, so for me it was enough also three or four names, but I knew very much that they are having the rule inside the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1138">They are delivering places to work, or jobs, better places, worse places and in order to get a good place, you must have what you could -- what you called protection. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Protectzia (ph), of protectzieh (ph), in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1140">It means to be protected or known by the people who are delivering the works in order to get a better one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1148">Q: How did you get protection? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1150">A: It's protection not in the word of a mafia, but if I know that one of the people is working in the office of work, Arbeitzampt (ph), or he was my teacher before or maybe a neighbor or maybe a friend or relative somehow, so go to him and ask him, "Here I am, and it's very hard for me to work in this lousy places. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Please give me another one." </sentence><sentence id="1152">And so, it happened that some people were working very hard, some people less, and what's important that the people who were working hard even could not, or have the possibilities to buy something, or change food for clothes, or clothes for food. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So, if bad is bad at all, if it's good, it's better at all -- more or less everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1158">Q: Now, some of the names you mentioned like Dr. Elkous, Mr. Goldberg, did you -- what was your feeling about these people? </sentence><sentence id="1159">Did you feel they were taking good care of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1162">Did you feel that because they were having to answer to the Nazis that maybe they  weren't so good? </sentence><sentence id="1163">What was your attitude about this committee and about the Jewish police also? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1164">A: When we are talking in the beginning of the ghetto, we feel that we are together in one bad position, and we didn't know what we knew afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1165">So, maybe who didn't get a good job were more opposed, and the others was more pro, but we didn't know that we can expect critical, or vital decisions from the Committee, or the Elderstrat. </sentence><sentence id="1166">They can only execute orders, this time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1170">Q: Do you remember what you -- did you have an opinion of them at the time? </sentence><sentence id="1171">Did you think they were helping you? </sentence><sentence id="1172">Did you trust them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1176">A: More than the opposite. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1178">Q: Did you know any of them personally, other than just knowing their name? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1943">Q: If you can just very briefly repeat to me what it was that the Jewish policeman said to you that indicated he knew what was going on so that I understand that word parole. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1947">Q: You can say parole or password, but I need you to begin by saying the policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1948">It's a full sentence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1951">A: So, the policeman who were a very close to the entrance on their Block C or Block Tze (ph) as we called it, I knew him before. </sentence><sentence id="1952">I knew even his name. </sentence><sentence id="1953">His name was Daniel Billard (ph) and his question was (speaking Yiddish), it means, what do you need here? </sentence><sentence id="1954">I understood I knew it before that this is the beginning of a password, we called it parole. </sentence><sentence id="1955">So, the answer on this password, or the parole was, "We have -- we get here or we have here to sleep this night." </sentence><sentence id="1956">In Yiddish it sounds (speaking Yiddish) mir or I, I don't remember well, anyway to sleep here, so he was satisfied because this was the true parole and he let me in to come and maybe show me also the way to go inside or in the cellar that I don't remember very good but afterwards somebody opened a cover on the ground and they also to put away the stones that were under this cover and I felt that I am falling down, down, down, until several hands caught me and they bring me to a place to a certain room. </sentence><sentence id="1957">It was dark there, that what I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1965">Q: The other question I have is, I assume there were also Communists cells or other groups and I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate responsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1966">Do you know -- what did you know about that at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1969">A: At that time, we knew that we are not the only, that the other groups were organized. </sentence><sentence id="1970">We called them several names one name was the Communist or the Mushtas (ph), because of Joe Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="1971">Ofdevantzes (ph), or Coatkes (ph), Coatkes means short jackets, overjackets, coats, but short. </sentence><sentence id="1972">But we knew that they doesn't belong to us, they belong to the left-left and some of them we knew even before the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1973">Some change their places, come from the Zionists to the Communists and why? </sentence><sentence id="1974">Because as we understood, they are more than we. </sentence><sentence id="1975">They are a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And one of them it was very known his name was Chaim Yellin (ph).He was a very known figure even in all the ghetto, even outside the organization. </sentence><sentence id="1977">We knew also or maybe we had the feeling that they has the best connections outside with the partisans and probably I was told, probably it was my feeling, but we knew that they are the prominent people in the organization or their organization is more important than ours in the terms of communication with outside. </sentence><sentence id="1978">We knew the partisans can be only Soviet partisans because other partisans will not deal with us. </sentence><sentence id="1979">And if Soviet partisans, it's Communists, so again, so they felt themselves very strong in the ghetto even to be a Communist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians because several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to  lull them. </sentence><sentence id="1980">But in the ghetto it was like in autonomy everybody could -- it was like a big shelter in terms of politics. </sentence><sentence id="1981">So, they felt themselves very good and very secure. </sentence><sentence id="1982">Even more when we had to go to the forest, so it was a rumor between us that they are having a preference to go and also their girls, or girlfriends, or wives will get a better -- a better position, or they had not to wait so long as our girls. </sentence><sentence id="1983">And I will not forget one thing that one of our girls, were organized in Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzai, we were living this time already in a communa, in the collective, it was -- the name was Mildos (ph) 7, because the street was Mildos and the number of the house was 7. </sentence><sentence id="1984">So it was called Milda 7 everybody, not everybody, but many knew that that belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. </sentence><sentence id="1985">The Communists have also their house not far from us and also ABC, Abetze (ph) Irgun L'Tzion (ph) has their house. </sentence><sentence id="1986">So, the developments of all the houses was similar. </sentence><sentence id="1987">People were alone without parents, without families, decide to live together and it was also convenient for the organization. </sentence><sentence id="1988">Everybody can catch all his -- all their members at one time and they have control and they can also hide their arms and make training with arms, so it was good for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1989">So, I'm coming back to one of our girls which belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, her name was Rosa, Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="1990">She was already taken to the gate in order to be included in a group -- I don't remember the number of the group -- going by truck to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1991">She was taken away at the last moment, and instead her was put ina girl of the -- what we called them Communist and they are calling no or even the ghetto they have a cover name. </sentence><sentence id="1992">It was called Anti-Facists Fight Organizations. </sentence><sentence id="1993">So, they have a preference and when we come, I come to the forest I found a lot of people who belonged to their organizations and of -- from us were only I think eleven or twelve with one, only one girl. </sentence><sentence id="1994">For girls it was generally more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1995">It's because the high command of the partisans is Ruditsky, or Rudniky for us, demand they give preference for men, male good who trained not with revolvers but with long rifles, long rifles mean long arms and better males than females. </sentence><sentence id="1996">The ghetto organization had another pressure to do what they demand. </sentence><sentence id="1997">So, it all the time were compromise, here, there. </sentence><sentence id="1998">Anyway, the last decision that - - the factor let's say, was that most of the girls, Jewish girls and these detachments, and I am talking about the detachments, Kovno detatchments in the Ruditsky Forest which was called this to the German occupants that most of the girl did belong before to the Communist circles or what was called Anti-Facist Fighter Organizations, that is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2030">Q: Were the non-Communists organizations more effective with working with the Jewish community in terms of getting supplies or hiding spaces or money or anything than the anti-facist organizations. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2034">Q: What about the Zionist organizations in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2036">A: The Zionist organizations, and I am talking mostly about their underground organizations because there were many organizations like parties, but they belong to more adult people, but talking about the youth movements, the Zionist youth movements of -- in the Kovno Ghetto, we are talking about three main organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2037">It Irgun Brei Tzion (ph),  organization of bright young braves, any way now we would call them general Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="2038">It included also religious Zionists, liberal Zionists and so on, that's one. </sentence><sentence id="2039">The other was what I mentioned before Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair with the time where we coordinated with Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair, or Dror (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2040">It was more or less also ideological very close. </sentence><sentence id="2041">So they afterwards established the collective of the kibbutz together. </sentence><sentence id="2042">What I mentioned Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7 was together. </sentence><sentence id="2043">I would call it in one word the --as it means the labor camp of the Zionists. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2052">Q: I need to understand something. </sentence><sentence id="2053">What you're telling me is that most of the underground in the ghetto was young people? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2064">A: Continue, or come back to describe -- maybe it's too complicated what I'm talking about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2066">Q: I think what you can is that the underground -- because I don't think people know this -- was really young people and that if you then kind of go and say the Zionist organizations maybe had better cooperation with the community, or I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2449">A: I was till the first week of July 1944, and then -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2451">Q: I'm sorry I want to hear a whole sentence, so say I was in the forest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2453">A: I was in the forest, or better, in the Rudniky Forest, as partisan till July 1944, the 9th of July we heard the thunder of the big guns, the artillery, the Katusha of the Red Army, or the Soviet Army, so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or so, that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this area. </sentence><sentence id="2454">So, we were told also we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate Wilno because Wilno was very close to us about 20 miles or so. </sentence><sentence id="2455">But then happened a certain event that was for us, for me personally, very important. </sentence><sentence id="2456">The 9th of July early in the morning come to us a girl partisan from the Wilno detachment which were located not far. </sentence><sentence id="2457">We were all the time, we had, I would say, unlegal relations. </sentence><sentence id="2458">She was also from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. </sentence><sentence id="2459">She was sent by Abba Kovner (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2460">Abba Kovner was the commando of the Wilno detachment. </sentence><sentence id="2461">Her name was Ruska Kolchak (ph), a very known partisan. </sentence><sentence id="2462">She told -- came half secretly to us and told us, "You have to go now as we are doing, you will come to Wilno, but when you come, in Wilno, please don't leave the place. </sentence><sentence id="2463">You will be in a new organization with the aim of to go immediately by all means we can to Palestine." </sentence><sentence id="2464">And we were -- it was very logical for us and it was not big surprise and we left the forest and we come to Wilno and then was the beginning of a new organization. </sentence><sentence id="2465">Afterwards, this organization gets the name Bricha (ph), it means escaping. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And I was working for the archives of the internal ministry of Soviet Union, it's called Ainkavede (ph), yes. </sentence><sentence id="2467">I was very proud that they took me. </sentence><sentence id="2468">They took me because I knew several languages and I was intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="2469">So, I attended high school, so they took me, and I was working there. </sentence><sentence id="2470">One of my jobs was to make use from the material the Germans left, papers. </sentence><sentence id="2471">And I did it with pleasure because I found them very interesting material, even some reports from the Germans made on our activity of my detachments. </sentence><sentence id="2472">We also found list of names of Lithuanian soldiers and policemen who took part in killing Jewish people, so I was again very happy that I can do some important thing. </sentence><sentence id="2473">But at the same time, we were building another unlegal organization to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2474">And one of this was to prepare false documents to go by train or by buses -- not buses but by tracks or by foot or by any means to go to Chernovtsy, it means in Bucovina in the south, southwest of Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="2475">From there to smuggle the border to Romania and there we were told maybe that we can find a ship and go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2476">That's close enough. </sentence><sentence id="2477">From Kovno, or from Wilno to Bucuresti was about 1,000 kilometers, it's 900 miles. </sentence><sentence id="2478">So, we did it bit by bit man after man. </sentence><sentence id="2479">I left Wilno, I left my job, I left Wilno, I left my arms, with a girlfriend from the ghetto, with her small sister like we are a family. </sentence><sentence id="2480">I am the father, she is the mother and the small sister is our daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2481">It makes less dangerous for us. </sentence><sentence id="2482">We get also a card, how to go from which place to which place, to whom to apply and what will be our passports. </sentence><sentence id="2483">And we did it. </sentence><sentence id="2484">And for instance, I left Wilno I think the 19th of January 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2485">It means a  half year after I left the forest. </sentence><sentence id="2486">I didn't want to come back to Kovno because I hate Kovno because every man in the street was a killer of my family or other of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="2487">Wilno was for me more neutral, for me personally, and the other thing that we were told also not to go far because if somebody needed us and I had the opportunity to go and our train was to leave very fast this country, this lousy country of anti-Semitism and killers and all the bad things that I suffered, not only me but our whole communities, whole generation. </sentence><sentence id="2488">So, we went to Wilno to Minsk, from Minsk to Baranovichi, I'm talking about Byelorussia. </sentence><sentence id="2489">From Baranovichi to Koval, from Koval to Volpe. </sentence><sentence id="2490">In each place we found a man he some give us to eat, sometimes also to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2491">Sometimes we slept outside on a roof of a wagon, but we did it and in Lvov it is Galicia or west Ukraine, then we met with some girls partisans we can call them liaison officers, L-I-A-S-O-N, so one of them, I remember was Zelda, she was also, she did such a job also between Wilno ghetto and the forests and we went -- and we were sleeping in the Jewish library of Lvov, on the ground, by there were two -- were several people, more and more and they have to go farther. </sentence><sentence id="2492">So we heard one day that Chernovtsy one of the groups were caught and put into the prison. </sentence><sentence id="2493">If so, the way is closed to that and we were talking it's burned. </sentence><sentence id="2494">If so, we have to go to chose an alternative road. </sentence><sentence id="2495">I even was sent for a while to other places in the south, to Stansislav, it's also the area of Ukraine, in order to make sure what happened in Chernovtsy because -- anyway I come back to Lvov, Lvov it's Lemburg, so I give a report and we decided to go straight from Lvov to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2496">To go to Poland we have to take new documents that we are Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2497">So we made it, we crossed the border and the next day we were in a city called Pshemysl, or Peremyshl. </sentence><sentence id="2498">There we also have to wait for several weeks, two weeks or three weeks and we made also a new kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="2499">We are living together and tried to go farther, also to make new documents because we didn't talk Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2500">In Lithuania, the Jewish people, our generation, doesn't understand Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2501">Even not to talk, and if you are talking, everybody will see that we are foreigners and that was very dangerous because we escaped from the Soviet Union and that only traitors are doing or enemies of the people and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2502">They will catch us and they will send us to Siberia, if not to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="2503">So, we went from Pshemysl to Zeshev (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2504">In Zeshev we did a very fine thing. </sentence><sentence id="2505">We went to the commander, or chief office of the county governor, Starosta (ph), Polish, and we told him that we are partisans who were from Greece and have to go to our country back. </sentence><sentence id="2506">And we were talking between us Lithuanian. </sentence><sentence id="2507">A little bit of Yiddish and we -- the rabbi of Zeshev, he knew the truth and he was translator. </sentence><sentence id="2508">Before coming to this man, the governor, we make on our hands numbers like we were prisoners of Auschwitz or other places. </sentence><sentence id="2509">We do it with very easy ink, the next day we could take it off. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And we showed, "You see?" </sentence><sentence id="2511">He told, "Here are the people." </sentence><sentence id="2512">And we showed, "Here." </sentence><sentence id="2513">So he gave us immediately, he was a very nice man, "Oh Greece, good." </sentence><sentence id="2514">It was an incident he would -- he want that we will meet a really group from Greece and so we were very afraid they will recognize that we are not. </sentence><sentence id="2515">So, we said, "No, we are very tired and we have to go immediately." </sentence><sentence id="2516">He gave us documents and we went. </sentence><sentence id="2517">From Zeshev to Transylvania, it means already Romania. </sentence><sentence id="2518">Cluj, Klausenberg, from Cluj we took express train to Bucuresti because Bucuresti was former Romania and we trust that from Bucuresti we can go to Constanta to the port and then to take a ship to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2519">But in Bucuresti probably the KGB or other services were following us. </sentence><sentence id="2520">And we have to  move, we have to move and we heard that in Italy is a Jewish brigade from Palestine so that could be a good way we thanks them to come. </sentence><sentence id="2521">So we did. </sentence><sentence id="2522">And after being three months in Bucharest, also we were living in kibbutzim, oh, we were very -- not only from Lithuania also from Poland and Czechoslovakia and other places everybody was safe to remember that that is the best way to go to Palestine, but only for us former citizens from Soviet Russia, because Lithuania was a part of Soviet Russia, was so dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="2523">So we decided we are going to Italy so we went back from Bucuresti to Cluj from Cluj to Budapest, from Budapest to Chambatoy (ph), from there to Saltzburg, that means Austria. </sentence><sentence id="2524">In Austria we have to cross the border again to the area which belonged to the British Army, means Italy. </sentence><sentence id="2525">Also we have again to cross the border and we were arrested several times by the Russians, patrols, and they took us here and took us back and everytime we have another story. </sentence><sentence id="2526">In each pocket we have another document, other names, and we have to remember all the names all the nicknames, everything. </sentence><sentence id="2527">So, we come to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="2528">Italy we come to Tarviso (ph), it's on the border between Italy and Austria. </sentence><sentence id="2529">We came the 15th or 14th of July 1945, and that was a big, big festival. </sentence><sentence id="2530">What happened, many leaders from the survivors come there then we met Mr. Garfunkel, who was a member of the Elderstrat, and he was so nice received by the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2531">Some of them were from Lithuania who emigrated to Palestine many years ago. </sentence><sentence id="2532">They knew he was a very prominent man. </sentence><sentence id="2533">Afterwards was Abba Kovner from Wilno, and maybe also Tzivia (ph) -- no, Tzivia we met on the way. </sentence><sentence id="2534">Anyway, it was a big, big festival now, and from there we have yes, and Abba Kovner sent me for another emissary back to the Russians in order to show -- to be a guide for three soldiers from the Jewish brigade who want to go back to their homes. </sentence><sentence id="2535">I don't know if they deserted for a certain time or get permission, but he was sure that if | made the way several times I know. </sentence><sentence id="2536">I didn't know, but I did it. </sentence><sentence id="2537">I didn't know the way, but somehow I did it and come back. </sentence><sentence id="2538">When I come back I told more I will not go. </sentence><sentence id="2539">I would like to come here to Palestine and finish with all the tasks. </sentence><sentence id="2540">lam a private man now, so I was put in another kibbutz of young people with the supervision of Jewish soldiers in Mestre (ph), Mestre it very close to Venice, and we spend there a very nice Rosh Hashana, in the ghetto, Venice, in the Nafi (ph) of the English Army, with a chaplain, evrything, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2541">The Jewish soldiers become our parents of this kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="2542">One day I was told that, "You because you are already on the way a long time, you are chosen with another one to go to Palestine." </sentence><sentence id="2543">It was in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="2544">Everything, you know, secretly and so and so, underground noise, and you're underground. </sentence><sentence id="2545">Underground of the Bricha, that's made by Israel -- Palestine guys together with Jewish soldiers from the Brigade, or other soldiers, it was another mafia. </sentence><sentence id="2546">So, we went all the night by truck, from Venice to Barre. </sentence><sentence id="2547">It's all Italy, maybe took more than one night, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2548">But we come -- it was in the south of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="2549">We were put in another camp, a very secret camp. </sentence><sentence id="2550">We could not go out because it was secretly and the Italians should not know who we are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2649">Q: How many were there of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2651">A: Oh, we were then about 250 people. </sentence><sentence id="2652">Also from other groups because it was like a stream, which is going and when the stream is coming near Palestine, the stream becomes bigger  and bigger and bigger. </sentence><sentence id="2653">So, we met people from other places even they come from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2654">They were the real Auschwitz, not like me with a false number. </sentence><sentence id="2655">And even from France and from Belgium and from many places. </sentence><sentence id="2656">I told you it's like a river, it's coming, it's coming, but this place we were isolated -- even not to buy a wine from the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="2657">They have a good wine for us, it was very important so we did, at night we did it. </sentence><sentence id="2658">But we lost our patience and one day they took several guys from us, I think there were 180, and took us also by night -- at night to a certain place, a hiding port, a small port in Trento (ph), this is south of, south of Italy, and there was waiting for us a small ship. </sentence><sentence id="2659">A small ship, a small ship, like half of a normal tennis place. </sentence><sentence id="2660">We were 180 people and when we come to the ship it is also by certain order. </sentence><sentence id="2661">It reminds me when I come to the truck in order to go to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="2662">I wrote it afterwards also in my diary that it's the same sensation I have. </sentence><sentence id="2663">Anyway we were took on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="2664">The ship was very small, but in such a room there were about five or six floors of places to sleep, like in a store. </sentence><sentence id="2665">Every man has so much place and it was -- I can't describe -- it was made like in a field hospital when somebody is carrying you. </sentence><sentence id="2666">So, it was such -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2683">Q: A cot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2685">A: A cot, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2686">Many cots, and we were lying there about seven nights, six nights only at night we could go and have fresh air because British airplanes if they're watching us, military airplanes, because in this time the British prohibited to -- were not allowing the Jewish to come by the thousands to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2687">It was their policy. </sentence><sentence id="2688">And one night we could see the lights, we were told the Carmel Mount and other things, so afterwards it was not true it was Cypress, and we have to make it around Cypress because some ships were running after us, the English marina. </sentence><sentence id="2689">So, marina in the sea and the Royal Air Force in the skies. </sentence><sentence id="2690">Everybody is running after us. </sentence><sentence id="2691">After we already left Europe, but we are in a very, very good mood, also singing. </sentence><sentence id="2692">There were some pregnant women with us and we have not too much water. </sentence><sentence id="2693">We are very short on water until we came one night, it was the 23rd of October, 1945 to a place, very small place that ship can stay near. </sentence><sentence id="2694">It was in the center of the coast of Palestine, Israel between Shefaim (ph) and Kibbutz -- Kibbutz Shefaim, and another place, let's say Kibbutz Shefaim. </sentence><sentence id="2695">And there we have seen that many very small people are coming like swimming. </sentence><sentence id="2696">We didn't know who they are. </sentence><sentence id="2697">Afterwards we realized that they were people of the Hagganah (ph), who come to take us because we will not -- we have to go in the water. </sentence><sentence id="2698">So, I remember that a very heavy girl took me on her shoulder so I told her, "I can go by my foot." </sentence><sentence id="2699">No she told, "We have order, nobody will go." </sentence><sentence id="2700">After that I understood, because we had to make several kilometers by foot until we came to a certain place that they took us on another truck and also us and also what we have, our cargo. </sentence><sentence id="2701">I had some shmates (ph) with me, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2702">Anyway, when they took us also, I could see that some people with Australian big hats are watching with arms on the two sides. </sentence><sentence id="2703">I was told that if the British police will come, they will shoot on them. </sentence><sentence id="2704">So I was told, I don't know if they would do it. </sentence><sentence id="2705">Anyway, I felt myself very good and I remember that we were so thirsty that we took grapefruits from the trees and we eat it together -- all together. </sentence><sentence id="2706">And the same nights we were brought to a village by the name Givat Chen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2707">They took me and another partisan and knocked on the door. </sentence><sentence id="2708">It was in  the midnight. </sentence><sentence id="2709">The man asked, "Who are you?" </sentence><sentence id="2710">His answer was very funny, "We brought you a man from the sea." </sentence><sentence id="2711">So, Iam a man from the sea. </sentence><sentence id="2712">I never was a sailor. " </sentence><sentence id="2713">A man of the sea," he opened immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2714">Maybe it was also a password, I don't know, but he understand, he looked at me and cried. </sentence><sentence id="2715">He talked with me Polish, German, Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2716">I told him I am talking Hebrew. " </sentence><sentence id="2717">Oh, very good, very good." </sentence><sentence id="2718">All his family were sleeping and he asked me, "Don't to talk so loud." </sentence><sentence id="2719">I told him, "But I am happy." </sentence><sentence id="2720">So, he put me in the washroom to clean myself because I maybe was looking like a rubber something with a beard, not make my hair nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2721">Half military uniform, I have half civilian, a very bad impression. </sentence><sentence id="2722">So, he took me in the washroom leave me in the washroom to wash. </sentence><sentence id="2723">When he come back, he found me drinking the water, here from the water, he looked, "What are you mad?" </sentence><sentence id="2724">J tell him, "I am still thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="2725">I have not drink water for several days." </sentence><sentence id="2726">I told him, "I can give you coffee or tea as much as you want." </sentence><sentence id="2727">Anyway, I slept and the day after they collected all the people from the farmers from this village, and everybody had to decide where he is going. </sentence><sentence id="2728">It was a table with a green cover like in an office, and there were sitting people from several organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2729">Zionists, left Zionists, this Zionists, anyway, and also Beitar, or not Beitar, anyway, I told that I belong to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair so please send me the kibbutz of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it happened. </sentence><sentence id="2730">And afterwards I was living in this kibbutz, Beit Zera (ph) a year, until September 1946 and then I decided to go to Jerusalem to the University. </sentence><sentence id="2731">But it was a short time, I could not make my studies because it occured the War of Independence and that's another story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2779">Q: How long was this journey from the time that you were in Wilno and you made the decision until the time you actually came ashore in Palestine, how many months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2781">A: The decision was made in the 9th of July, 1944, but it was only a decision. </sentence><sentence id="2782">But the really journey began the 19th of January 1945 and finished the 23rd of October 1945, so it means about ten months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2785">Q: I want to ask you one more question, and it's a little bit of a different way of thinking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2787">You've had many experiences over the last 40 years in Israel and that's for another time, but you rebuilt your life. </sentence><sentence id="2788">You have a very fascinating life in Israel now. </sentence><sentence id="2789">Are there influences from your boyhood in Kovno that you think are still a part of you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2790">A: Boyhood, you mean -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2792">Q: The time you're growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2794">A: You mean till the Holocaust or after, because you cannot put -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2796">Q: Not after so much, but I mean you came from a strong culture or strong community in Kovno, family, friends, religion, how much did that influence what you became later on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2798">A: Oh, I think that my childhood and what you call boyhood, is a new word for me, I never heard it, but I like it, it, I think it's a continuity, nothing happened because when I came  to Palestine I found many of my family of my uncles, aunts, cousins, classmates who did it before from the organization from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it was a road. </sentence><sentence id="2799">A road that everybody will do it before or after, so for me it was so natural, only what happened, the Holocaust and all the things after and maybe also include the Soviet time 1940 and 1941, it was something out the order for me. </sentence><sentence id="2800">But to come to Palestine what for me it was like two and two are four. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2804">Q: I was just wondering if there was anything especially unique in your growing up in Kovno that -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2806"> A Yeah, but Kovno was a very modern community. </sentence><sentence id="2807">Kovno, Lithuania of Kovno, even more than Wilno was called the Eretz Yisrael of the Diaspora. </sentence><sentence id="2808">So sometimes we were also -- it was not all the community but we were brought up in a Jewish, Yiddish, or Communist ideology but if we take, I would say about 60 percent of the Lithuanian Jewry they were brought up in the way that I was brought up. </sentence><sentence id="2809">May I give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="2810">In 1935 there were elections in all the world for the Zionist Congress. </sentence><sentence id="2811">It happened every two years so in this small Lithuania with about 155,000 Jewish people inhabitants, they took part in this elections about, I think, more than 45,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="2812">Maybe some of them did it not seriously, they did automatically, and maybe they were not very strong Zionists, but anyway in this time is a need of the 30's the Zionist, I would not even tell Zionists, the national feeling was very strong. </sentence><sentence id="2813">The Hebrew culture was dominating. </sentence><sentence id="2814">So, even religious people were Zionist, so it's not a contradiction. </sentence><sentence id="2815">So, I cannot see that Israel in the 40's when I came was something new for me. </sentence><sentence id="2816">I'll give you another example. </sentence><sentence id="2817">When the bus, no it was a bus, no more trucks, it was a bus from Egged company took us from the place I was at night in the village Givat Chen, to the kibbutz, I was sitting and I remember a woman asked me, "Where are we now? </sentence><sentence id="2818">What is here?" </sentence><sentence id="2819">It's a long way it's about four hours. </sentence><sentence id="2820">So I told her, "You don't know? </sentence><sentence id="2821">That's the Mount Tabor." </sentence><sentence id="2822">So, because I knew the geography of Palestine, or Eretz Yisrael, more than of Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="2823">And you know like a fish who is in an aquarium and put back to the original water. </sentence><sentence id="2824">That happened to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
