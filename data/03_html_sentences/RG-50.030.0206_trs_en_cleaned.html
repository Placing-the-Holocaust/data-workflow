at 6:00. </sentence><sentence id="572">They called us out and we had to stay  there and they counted us, and when somebody was missing we had to stay there the whole day until they found the person, brought. </sentence><sentence id="573">But some people were able to escape, and they escaped to Czechoslovakia, and the...the German government what was already the Nazi government demanded to send them back. </sentence><sentence id="574">So the worse day was...in Buchenwald was when this man was sent back and he was condemned to die on the gallows. </sentence><sentence id="575">And we were forced...there was an announcement through the loud speaker [and] everybody from all the barracks had to come out and watch. </sentence><sentence id="576">And, of course, it was a terrible thing to see what happened. </sentence><sentence id="577">And we were supposed to watch this, the hanging of this man. </sentence><sentence id="578">So you can imagine what the mood was. </sentence><sentence id="579">We were not allowed to walk to work because...but they wanted us to do something, so we had to move everyday the stones from one place to the other, to the other corner, and we was busy this. </sentence><sentence id="580">The food, of course, the food were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="581">In the beginning they gave us nothing and then they got...they get everybody should go and get the money what they had brought and what they took away from the people, they brought the food. </sentence><sentence id="582">But, of course, the dishes, we all had to drink the soup from the same bowl-- everybody. </sentence><sentence id="583">And they gave us [wall fish (ph)]...[wall fish (ph)] food. </sentence><sentence id="584">So the conditions were worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="585">We had special arranged services and the Rabbis there went around and say "Please eat" because there was many people they didn't want to eat the food because it wasn't kosher. </sentence><sentence id="586">So the rabbis went around and told the people, but some didn't...they didn't do it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="587">But what happened is that we had secretly arranged services. </sentence><sentence id="588">Every morning we put outside...somebody watched that nobody came from the...from the people there...from the Nazis...and we had our prayers. </sentence><sentence id="589">But another thing happened every day on the appell. </sentence><sentence id="590">On the morning appell, that the Nazi what were in charge, they took off and counted and they punched the people. </sentence><sentence id="591">So I was smart enough not to stand in the first row that I didn't get punched. </sentence><sentence id="592">But what happened that the people...the conditions got everyday worse, and people died from starving. </sentence><sentence id="593">We was...the conditions in the barracks was even worse. </sentence><sentence id="594">We were laying on just wood. </sentence><sentence id="595">There was no blanket. </sentence><sentence id="596">There was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="597">And there was some people had food. </sentence><sentence id="598">Some people had money. </sentence><sentence id="599">They could buy. </sentence><sentence id="600">So they helped the people, the others. </sentence><sentence id="601">Now we come to the first Erev of Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="602">I was there; and that was a wonderful thing. </sentence><sentence id="603">We were sitting in our barracks and sung

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="679">A: There was a store. </sentence><sentence id="680">They had a store there; and the people who got money, they could go and buy it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="683">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: But for me, the most surprise happened on the second day of Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="686">In the morning, I heard over the loudspeaker my name called. </sentence><sentence id="687">And they said, "Please..." Not "please." " </sentence><sentence id="688">Come all the people..."--I was not the only one--"Come after, to the office." </sentence><sentence id="689">So when I came to the office, they told me that they got a paper from Breslau, from my parents, that they had booked for me a passage to Panama. </sentence><sentence id="690">And that was the one what my cousin told him [that] my mother went to the Consulate. </sentence><sentence id="691">And I have the documents; and so that was the only reason  that they let me go. </sentence><sentence id="692">So after that, in the afternoon, they put us on buses. </sentence><sentence id="693">They gave us even some money; because it was a long, a long trip with the railway. </sentence><sentence id="694">So we went first with the bus to Weimar, and they put us there in that...in that train. </sentence><sentence id="695">On this train, was the first station was Leipzig. </sentence><sentence id="696">That was a very big city. </sentence><sentence id="697">It's very famous. </sentence><sentence id="698">There goes to there every year a very big fair. </sentence><sentence id="699">And there lived a lot of Jews, maybe...mostly Jews from the east from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="700">And they had prepared for us a special reception; and they gave us some... And so we was on the, of course, on this station was a very large station. </sentence><sentence id="701">But I wanted to go out, because I know this city very well. </sentence><sentence id="702">Because I went every...every year to that fair. </sentence><sentence id="703">And I went in the night for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="704">And I was amazed I saw how the Jewish store was all destroyed, all the windows. </sentence><sentence id="705">And it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="706">I went all the places and all the streets; and I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="707">And so it happened in every city in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="708">They destroyed in the night from the 8th to the 9th of November 1938. </sentence><sentence id="709">That was the day of the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="710">So they destroyed it. </sentence><sentence id="711">Then I went back to the station and back to the train; and we arrived in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="712">In the morning, the next morning, we arrived in the...in the Breslau, in the railway station. </sentence><sentence id="713">But in...they had told us in Buchenwald before they let us go. </sentence><sentence id="714">They say, "The first thing you come...you arrive at home, you have to go to the Gestapo and report. </sentence><sentence id="715">And they will tell you what to do." </sentence><sentence id="716">But we made a very big mistake, and I make the biggest mistake. </sentence><sentence id="717">In this...in this..in the station...in the train, we talked to the other people. </sentence><sentence id="718">And we said, "No, it is Friday." </sentence><sentence id="719">You know, Friday. </sentence><sentence id="720">We came on Friday. " </sentence><sentence id="721">We will go...we will not go. </sentence><sentence id="722">We will go on..." I mean, Friday night, we thought we wait for Monday. </sentence><sentence id="723">And what happened with me, when I came Monday to the Gestapo, they said, "When did you come?" </sentence><sentence id="724">I said, "We came Friday night." " </sentence><sentence id="725">Why didn't you come the next morning?" </sentence><sentence id="726">I say the reason was that I was very dirty and all, the...when we was in Buchenwald we had...we couldn't change our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="727">We couldn't take no bath, no shower; and I wanted to be clean. </sentence><sentence id="728">But they didn't...they said, "Wait here." </sentence><sentence id="729">And I waited and waited and waited. </sentence><sentence id="730">And my parents were worried...were very worried, because I say early I will come back. </sentence><sentence id="731">So what happened? </sentence><sentence id="732">It was a Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="733">And they left me wait the whole morning from 9 o'clock til 1 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="734">And then they called me in and said, "Why didn't you come?You know what we will do. </sentence><sentence id="735">We will send you to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="736">To another concentration camp, because you didn't obey the order." </sentence><sentence id="737">And I was very scared. </sentence><sentence id="738">So finally I went home, and my parents...what happened. </sentence><sentence id="739">I had to wait. </sentence><sentence id="740">I was the last one but everybody...all was gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="798">Q: What do you mean were gone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="800">A: Everybody was gone. </sentence><sentence id="801">So finally, we had to report every week. </sentence><sentence id="802">That was the order. </sentence><sentence id="803">Every week, we had to come to the Gestapo and tell them what we have done to get out. </sentence><sentence id="804">That was the condition to get out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="805">And I was the one who really were in charge, because when the other people came on the day when everybody was asked the most people didn't do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="806">And they threatened them. </sentence><sentence id="807">But I had prepared already a lot. </sentence><sentence id="808">I wrote to all the...to all the ship lines and everybody. </sentence><sentence id="809">And I...they promised me as soon as they have a passage... So, in other words, they were satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="810">So finally I went to the Gestapo: "Do you have a ship for me. </sentence><sentence id="811">I want to get out." </sentence><sentence id="812">So anyway, I got one day a telegram from the Italian airline what was in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="813">And they said, "We have a passage for you." </sentence><sentence id="814">It was just a holiday of Shavuos [NB: Shavuot] in the same week; and when I came home my parents were very upset. </sentence><sentence id="815">I said, "I have...I just got a...a...telegram. </sentence><sentence id="816">And I went to Jewish Community because I had paid for  them a lot money to help me for my immigration. </sentence><sentence id="817">And what happened, they give me...they gave me the rest. </sentence><sentence id="818">So they say, "It is too late to come to Munich. </sentence><sentence id="819">You go direct to Genoa." </sentence><sentence id="820">Not Geneva...Genoa. </sentence><sentence id="821">That was the port where the largest ship called the Bianca Mano...the largest ship from the Italian airline...ship line. </sentence><sentence id="822">And I went...I went with the bus...with the train from Breslau to Genoa. </sentence><sentence id="823">But in the meantime, we went over the Alps and it was a very long trip. </sentence><sentence id="824">And they didn't allow us any money. </sentence><sentence id="825">We were all only allowed one dollar. </sentence><sentence id="826">That was 4 [deutsche}]mark in that time. </sentence><sentence id="827">And the rest I had to pay for the first train. </sentence><sentence id="828">So when I arrived, I had nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="829">So when we came on at night in Genova... It wasn't night. </sentence><sentence id="830">And we had no place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="831">We was a whole...it was maybe 20, 25 people. </sentence><sentence id="832">We walked around the streets and we looked for a place where to stay. </sentence><sentence id="833">And all the places were full because this was...thousands of people went there, left there for the trip. </sentence><sentence id="834">So we went... went finally I got a room was a attic, was not even a window. </sentence><sentence id="835">When the next morning I left for the headquarters of the airline what was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="872">Q: Airline or ship line? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="874">A: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="875">The ship line. </sentence><sentence id="876">And when I came in the middle of the town, it was a sign at the window "We moved today to the Harbor because on account that the boat is leaving." </sentence><sentence id="877">So in other words, I had to...to...to walk to the harbor. </sentence><sentence id="878">And what happened when I came there nobody understood English or no German, only Italian. </sentence><sentence id="879">Because they had written to me, "Pick up your ticket there." </sentence><sentence id="880">So finally somebody helped me with the language and I got it. </sentence><sentence id="881">I got my ticket. </sentence><sentence id="882">But they say, "Don't go back to the hotel because that you don't miss the ship." </sentence><sentence id="883">This was in the noontime...in the morning...ship left at 4:00. </sentence><sentence id="884">And I got plenty trouble. </sentence><sentence id="885">Because when I left in the morning, I hadn't paid for my room. </sentence><sentence id="886">And somebody had to pay. </sentence><sentence id="887">And they looked for me, and they wanted to arrest me. </sentence><sentence id="888">And, you know, because they said, "Stay here. </sentence><sentence id="889">Stay here and don't go back. </sentence><sentence id="890">Stay here, because you are here already; and go on the boat and you'll get there this." </sentence><sentence id="891">But there was several classes there. </sentence><sentence id="892">A first class, a second class, and a third class. </sentence><sentence id="893">And so the other people, they were looking for me; but they couldn't find me. </sentence><sentence id="894">So when they came on our date, they wanted to get me arrested that I hadn't paid my hotel bill. </sentence><sentence id="895">Anyway, the trip was very painful. </sentence><sentence id="896">Because it was terrible hot and we came to the...the...Red Sea, and it...it took a long time. </sentence><sentence id="897">We was impossible to sleep in the room. </sentence><sentence id="898">It was too hot. </sentence><sentence id="899">We had to sleep on the...on the deck. </sentence><sentence id="900">But finally we arrived in..in..in Shanghai. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="928">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="929">Back up a moment. </sentence><sentence id="930">You had the...this pass to Panama, but you found yourself on a boat to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="931">How did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="937">That this was only...I met... got the original document. </sentence><sentence id="938">Maybe I have it here too. </sentence><sentence id="939">And what happened they said you have to come in person to Amsterdam and to introduce yourself, you know. </sentence><sentence id="940">But this was only, you know, a matter to get me out from Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="941">I mean because otherwise I never would get out from the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="942">So in other words and what many people didn't know, Shanghai was the only place where people could go without any papers. </sentence><sentence id="943">No visa. </sentence><sentence id="944">No affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="945">My parents, especially my mother, they tried to write to all the family. </sentence><sentence id="946">She had family in America, all over, to get a visa affidavit, but they all was in such a state I mean in such that they couldn't afford it. </sentence><sentence id="947">So we didn't get no...and that  0 was the only...that is the reason I never had the idea to go to Shanghai because Shanghai had a very bad name. </sentence><sentence id="948">But Shanghai this was the only thing...and that is the most people who went there, they went there because they had no other choice. </sentence><sentence id="949">So that's the reason why I couldn't take about from Panama you know. </sentence><sentence id="950">You want to know anything else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="966">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="967">Can you...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: This is the pass, what you call identification, I mean, this of course in...in...German. </sentence><sentence id="979">And they put...there's a fingerprint and a picture and this is the President of the Police and there's the Jew because every passport had to read the Jew in and say the name on the...all the...uh...where I came for and for Breslau. </sentence><sentence id="980">So this was the identification to get out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="981">This is called the Heimatschein. </sentence><sentence id="982">And this...it proves that I am a citizen, that I am a...was still a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="983">And that was important when you go outside in other country, that I prove lama citizen of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="984">This is here in Chinese, the fingerprints. </sentence><sentence id="985">This is the identification from Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="986">Because we had to, every time we go there to uh...to our uh...uh to some organization or to some office we had to identify that we are allowed, that we as...allowed to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="987">The picture of the fingerprint and the Chinese, that's a Chinese identification. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1027">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1029">A: This is a interesting document. </sentence><sentence id="1030">This is the Reichlands in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1031">And this was an application, because they wanted to help the Jews that came from the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1032">When they have no other way where to go, [then] Durchgangslager [Ger: "transit camp" ]-- that means a place in England. </sentence><sentence id="1033">To go to a place in England, just for the time being to get out from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And in other words... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1041">Q: Who made these. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Who created this pass? </sentence><sentence id="1043"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1047">A: They created this. </sentence><sentence id="1048">Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutscheland. </sentence><sentence id="1049">This is the main organization who represented the Jews in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And they gave that out. </sentence><sentence id="1051">But after I got the idea to Shanghai to go... So many people went there--but only temporary--to England; because England wasn't safe at all. </sentence><sentence id="1052">So I thought...so people asked me--my friends and my relatives-- "Why didn't you go there, instead [of] to Shanghai?" </sentence><sentence id="1053">So I thought they said you had to wait about maybe a month to get an answer. </sentence><sentence id="1054">In the meantime, it was already the rumor that pretty soon the war will bring out...break out. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And I thought I don't want to wait any longer. </sentence><sentence id="1056">The other one I got right away. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And that's the reason that I didn't go to England, and I went to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
