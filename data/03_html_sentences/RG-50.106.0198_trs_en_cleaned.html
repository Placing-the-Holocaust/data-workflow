you're now two years old. </sentence><sentence id="181"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="182"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 7 August 9, 2012 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="184">And while we're hiding in the ghetto, my mother, my father, my baby sister and I, he escapes from concentration camp and manages to get across a railroad track just as a Nazi munitions train was going. </sentence><sentence id="185">So the sentries had shot his finger, but as he was jumping down, they shot him in the hand and shot his finger. </sentence><sentence id="186">And he started running away as the train was coming by. </sentence><sentence id="187">And of course they did not dare fire at that train because there would be a massive explosion. </sentence><sentence id="188">Ok. </sentence><sentence id="189">Then while he was running this was in a woods, a very deep woods in Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="190">And he met a peasant named Mr. Borecki. </sentence><sentence id="191">And Mr. Borecki, a lot of this is in my grandfather's diary. </sentence><sentence id="192">Mr. Borecki gave him a jacket, rags to wrap around his feet, because my grandfather was a very big man and no shoes could fit him. </sentence><sentence id="193">So and he gave him, and he bandaged his hand and had him sleep in the barn and gave him three breads. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">And my grandfather said look, I know helping Jews could --. </sentence><sentence id="195">He said well I'll just leave my barn door open. </sentence><sentence id="196">Then if I get asked, I could say I don't know who sleeps in my barn. </sentence><sentence id="197">So my grandfather did that and the next day he left. </sentence><sentence id="198">And when he was in the woods, oh and he was given a shovel. </sentence><sentence id="199">And in the woods, he was sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="200">And suddenly he heard two or three men speaking Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="201">And they had escaped an aktion, very near this woods. </sentence><sentence id="202">And one of them had a gun. </sentence><sentence id="203">And they -- my grandfather had been trained for military service as an officer, I guess because he looked good on a horse. </sentence><sentence id="204">The Polish cavalry. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="205">He did. </sentence><sentence id="206">And I think that's why they took him. </sentence><sentence id="207">But anyway, so he was -- they made him the leader. </sentence><sentence id="208">They dug this tunnel and that's the one that I called the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="209">Ok, it's a tunnel in this woods, yes. </sentence><sentence id="210">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: How far from the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Quite a ways I think. </sentence><sentence id="213">Because this was in the woods and the ghetto -- now, I'Il describe the bunker in just a moment. </sentence><sentence id="214">But when grandfather went back to Mr. Borecki, he asked him two things. </sentence><sentence id="215">One was did he know anything, his -- Mr. Borecki's son had been killed by the Nazis. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">Because he was in the resistance, in the Polish resistance. </sentence><sentence id="217">Now but before then he had told his father that the Nazis were going to bomb the ghetto very soon. </sentence><sentence id="218">So my grandfather knew that it was just a matter of time before my father and my mother and my baby sister and I lost our lives. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">Ok. </sentence><sentence id="220">Now I'm going to switch back and tell you about the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="221"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="222"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 8 August 9, 2012 The bunker to me of course it was, I remember cold, damp mud. </sentence><sentence id="223">And there was a ladder to go in and as I remember it, it seemed very tall. </sentence><sentence id="224">Probably it was no more than six feet. </sentence><sentence id="225">And as you walked around, you felt this cold, wet mud. </sentence><sentence id="226">And at one side, here was the entrance. </sentence><sentence id="227">Then there was this cold wet mud. </sentence><sentence id="228">And here at the corner, at the very end, was a fat, was a table, like the kind that electric wire comes on, those spool tables. </sentence><sentence id="229">And I just, I remember it feeling splintery. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="230">And I remember the smell of the candle wax because there was a fat candle sitting on that table. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="231">And then again some more wet mud. </sentence><sentence id="232">Then like an archway out of mud again and a separate room. </sentence><sentence id="233">On the, as you walked into that room, on the left were things that I later found out were guns. </sentence><sentence id="234">And rifles. </sentence><sentence id="235">What I, and how [I I only knew that I touched them and my grandfather smacked my hand and yelled and he never, ever raised his voice to me, much less his hand. </sentence><sentence id="236">And that's when I realized those were dangerous. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="237">I don't remember the people in the tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="238">Now I'm going to switch back and tell you. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">Eventually there were 37 people in the tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="240">But when my grandfather found out that the Nazis were going to bomb the ghetto he asked for volunteers and he, everybody, all the men volunteered, and he took two and they dressed in Nazi uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="241">Well I have to tell you that how they lived at this time was that the men would go out and raid Nazi trucks. </sentence><sentence id="242">They would raise, they would kill the drivers and take -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: They were escaped from the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: They were not in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="245">They were in this woods, in the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="246">And they would go out on raids where they would raid Nazi munitions, trucks, outposts. </sentence><sentence id="247">Take whatever, food, clothing, everything. </sentence><sentence id="248">Now the -- at this time the Banderovski who were Ukrainian resistance were in this woods and they were very powerful and they were very numerous and the Nazis would keep trying to bomb and try to get rid of them and they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="249">So the Nazis thought that these Jews who were raiding them were Banderovski, these Ukrainian resistance fighters. </sentence><sentence id="250">But they were not. </sentence><sentence id="251">Now the Banderovski didn't like Jews much at all, except they would take Jews if the Jews were doctors. </sentence><sentence id="252">Otherwise, and the agreement was, ok stay out of our way. </sentence><sentence id="253">We'll stay out of your way kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="254">We'll leave you alone. </sentence><sentence id="255">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="256">Well my grandfather found out that the Nazis from Mr. Borecki who had found out from his son, the Nazis were going to burn the ghetto so he got the two volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="257">They all dressed in Nazi

the outskirts of the ghetto at night. </sentence><sentence id="258">The two men stayed. </sentence><sentence id="259">My grandfather in Nazi regalia, went into the ghetto, got my mother, my father, my baby sister and me out. </sentence><sentence id="260">Put us in this jeep and brought us to the home of Mr. Borecki. </sentence><sentence id="261">Because my grandfather had spoken to Mr. Borecki and asked him if he would save my mother and the two girls" lives and he said of course. </sentence><sentence id="262">And so we came in the middle of the night and we were at Mr. Borecki's house and my mother said I will not leave my husband or you, father. </sentence><sentence id="263">I will not. </sentence><sentence id="264">I've already lost my mother. </sentence><sentence id="265">I'm not going to lose you. </sentence><sentence id="266">So they had no choice but all of us now went to the bunker. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: This is 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Do you know what month or what season? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A:I- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: That's all right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: It probably was still winter. </sentence><sentence id="300">Because there was snow and the bunker was still relatively safe because the Nazis could, dogs could not get the scent and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="301">So it was winter, probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: End of 43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: Yes, mm hm. </sentence><sentence id="308">Towards the end of 43, right, mm hm. </sentence><sentence id="309">Then apparently and this I hear from my grandfather, my baby sister. </sentence><sentence id="310">Oh there were 37 people in that tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="311">My mother and my father and us. </sentence><sentence id="312">My grandfather's son, my uncle, his wife. </sentence><sentence id="313">And I think their two boys. </sentence><sentence id="314">They had two boys. </sentence><sentence id="315">My sister and I were the youngest, by far. </sentence><sentence id="316">And I guess we cried and got lice and people were very afraid because we endangered the lives of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="317">And my grandfather felt that he just could not do that. </sentence><sentence id="318">That his family could not endanger everybody else because everyone wanted to live and they had the right to live. </sentence><sentence id="319"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="320"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 10 August 9, 2012 So he decided to take us. </sentence><sentence id="321">He had gotten a peasant sheepskin jacket. </sentence><sentence id="322">He dressed himself as a Polish peasant and took my baby sister and me out. </sentence><sentence id="323">I guess according to my grandfather, I had blond hair and dark eyes. </sentence><sentence id="324">My sister had light hair and gray eyes. </sentence><sentence id="325">And he took us both and he went to the local market, looking for someone named Dr. Gruen. </sentence><sentence id="326">Dr. Gruen was a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="327">I think he was Catholic, very famous pediatrician who ran an orphanage for Catholic children. </sentence><sentence id="328">And he looked for, but he couldn't find him. </sentence><sentence id="329">And he was so desperate and this he writes in his diary. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was so desperate about what to do with us when he couldn't find Dr. Gruen, that he almost was ready, he was ready to leave us in the market, thinking somebody would find us and keep us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="331">And keep us alive during the war. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="332">But just as he was thinking of that, he saw a woman who had been a former neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="333">A Polish Catholic woman whose husband had been killed by the Nazis in one of their mass reprisals. </sentence><sentence id="334">And my grandfather had helped her with her horse and carriage business. </sentence><sentence id="335">So she saw him and recognized him and he brought her to the side where they would not be heard. </sentence><sentence id="336">And of course she said she was so happy to know that he was alive and then he said he had these two children and he couldn't find Dr. Gruen. </sentence><sentence id="337">And at that point, he said could you take them. </sentence><sentence id="338">And my grandmother had had to sell her house because the people she had working for her were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="339">And they were all in the ghetto and so she couldn't make a living. </sentence><sentence id="340">So she started working as a cook for a retired engineer and his wife, the Szwarezynskis, somewhere in the country. </sentence><sentence id="341">It must have been near Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="342">And the story they told was that my grandfather was her husband that the two of us were her sister's children. </sentence><sentence id="343">Now at that time many people were back and forth, going towards the Ukraine and, and so the story she told was that her sisters had gone to Ukraine and left their babies with her. </sentence><sentence id="344">And then she asked Mrs. Szwarezynski could she, could grandma take both. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="345">And Mrs. Szwarczynski said yes, she could take me. </sentence><sentence id="346">But she couldn't take a six month old baby. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="347">So my grandfather went, again he asked for how to find Dr. Gruen and this orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="348">And apparently Mr. Szwarczynski knew Dr. Gruen and he told him where the orphanage was and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="349">So grandpa had -- now remember all this time he's passing as a Polish peasant. </sentence><sentence id="350">Very big one. </sentence><sentence id="351">But the Polish peasant and because my grandfather was six, two and well over 200 pounds. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="352">He was -- just an aside. </sentence><sentence id="353">The first time I read Les Miserables, I kept thinking of my grandfather. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="354">Because remember Jean Valjean lifts a cart and that's how Javert knows that he is Jean Valjean. </sentence><sentence id="355">Well my grandfather could lift a car. </sentence><sentence id="356">So I huss? </sentence><sentence id="357">Anyway, sidebar

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: My sister's name was changed from Tola to Antonina Noviska, which was the name of the woman who saved our lives. </sentence><sentence id="362">Lucia Noviska and that's when she was left there. </sentence><sentence id="363">And I stayed with the Szwarczynskis and my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="364">I have a picture, the first picture I have of me was at around that time. </sentence><sentence id="365">I was probably around two and a half at this point maybe even three. </sentence><sentence id="366">And I had been following my grandmother who was going into the countryside to forage for whatever she could find in the way of food. </sentence><sentence id="367">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Do you remember this time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: I, again I remember -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Flashes? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Flashes, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="372">I remember that I wanted her to play with me. </sentence><sentence id="373">I remember that we picked dandelions together. </sentence><sentence id="374">And she made me a wreath out of dandelions. </sentence><sentence id="375">And I remember putting it on and then following her but then falling asleep, just falling asleep. </sentence><sentence id="376">And this I was told later. </sentence><sentence id="377">That grandma had gone home, thinking that I had probably gone home. </sentence><sentence id="378">And when she didn't find me there, she was standing outside waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="379">And ready to go look for me with Mrs. Szwarczynski. </sentence><sentence id="380">And she saw a Nazi soldier, carrying what she thought was my dead body. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="381">And so she was about to scream when Mrs. Szwarczynski put her hand over her mouth and told her to stay calm. </sentence><sentence id="382">And the soldier came and at that point I can't, I don't know but I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="383">And so grandma was just unbelievably relieved. </sentence><sentence id="384">And the soldier had said that I was asleep and he found me there. </sentence><sentence id="385">And I reminded him of his children back home and so he was bringing me to the closest house because he was sure that's where I lived. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="386">So some kind of way later he had the picture developed and grandma got it and she took that picture, saved it and after the war. </sentence><sentence id="387">And by the way that picture is in the Holocaust Museum. </sentence><sentence id="388">As is a picture of my birth mother, father, uncle and two friends. </sentence><sentence id="389">

</sentence><sentence id="896">And Aunt Helen was a very troubled woman and it was very hard for her to take this child who had come from a war torn country and who was a granddaughter of this absent older brother that she idealized. </sentence><sentence id="897">And I was not a pretty child at all. </sentence><sentence id="898">And so she didn't know quite what to do with me. </sentence><sentence

curtains that were the entrance to the bedroom. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="908">And otherwise you saw a sofa, a couple of chairs and a black telephone and a glass bottle near the telephone where everyone who wanted to make a call had to put in a nickel. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="909">Then there were tzedakah boxes all over the place and they were blue with white Jewish stars on them. </sentence><sentence id="910">They were all for some cause or other in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="911">For yeshivas, for trees, for whatever. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="912">And Tante

gray hair. </sentence><sentence id="915">Her brother, Uncle Charlie, also was short but a little taller than she. </sentence><sentence id="916">And I met him a little afterwards and he had a farm in the Adirondacks that he had apparently sold the farm. </sentence><sentence id="917">He had had five daughters. </sentence><sentence id="918">He and his wife Sophie had five daughters.

they were staying with Tante Siegel. </sentence><sentence id="947">Had to pull out something. </sentence><sentence id="948">So to say there was no room in this apartment. </sentence><sentence id="949">So the Joint wouldn't let me live there. </sentence><sentence id="950">And, but I loved going there. </sentence><sentence id="951">And I heard from my cousin Sid, many years later he had given me a huge teddy bear which he had won at a fair and he was going to give it to their first child. </sentence><sentence id="952">But he said, you looked so sad and needy there that I thought maybe I better give it to you. </sentence><sentence id="953">So he gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="954">And I, very imaginative child, named this teddy bear, Louka, which means doll in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="955">But oh I loved that teddy bear. </sentence><sentence id="956">And that was a happy time. </sentence><sentence id="957">And Tante Siegel would have a yummy brunch every Sunday with white fish and sable, and lox and bagels and cheeses and tomatoes and all kinds of yummy stuff, always milchig. </sentence><sentence id="958">And I would be doing dishes and I inevitably used the wrong dish towel. </sentence><sentence id="959">And we had to go find a place that had any dirt in Bronx New York. </sentence><sentence id="960">But that was a challenge. </sentence><sentence id="961">So that was Tante Siegel. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="962">I remember once Aunt Rosa who always looked unbelievably chic. </sentence><sentence id="963">She had a black chignon. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="964">I'm sure she died her hair but she was very regal looking, in contrast to her sister Aunt Helen who always looked bedraggled and harried. </sentence><sentence id="965">In shapeless housedresses which were ugly. </sentence><sentence id="966">Never smiled. </sentence><sentence id="967">Anyway Aunt, Tante Rosa worked outside the home. </sentence><sentence id="968">And one day she took me out for lunch and to buy me a new skirt. </sentence><sentence id="969">And the skirt, I remember was gray but it was kind of full, had big pockets with blue trim on the pocket, the top part of the pocket. </sentence><sentence id="970">And I thought it was gorgeous. </sentence><sentence id="971">And I wore it back to Aunt Helen's and I remember her yelling in the kitchen where Aunt Helen was yelling and saying why did you take that brat? </sentence><sentence id="972">Why didn't you take Perry? </sentence><sentence id="973">She deserves it. </sentence><sentence id="974">That brat doesn't deserve anything. </sentence><sentence id="975">I don't know what Isaac and that woman were thinking of. </sentence><sentence id="976">And I decided that I wouldn't wear the skirt by Aunt Helen because all it did was get Tante Rosa in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="977">So I would only wear it at Tante Siegel's. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="978">Well, one day I remembered, I was still a bit of a ring leader and Perry was very, very shy and I remember saying to Perry, let's go visit Yeta's room, Elaine, at that time she was called Elaine's
