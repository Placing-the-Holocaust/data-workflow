<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: And then things developed, uh, uh, towards "38. </sentence><sentence id="151">There were quite some difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="152">Uh, also with this movement already, some Nazis started preparing; and there was the talk of a takeover of Austria. </sentence><sentence id="153">In that time, I start apprentice-time for painting; and it was even noticeable in that school. </sentence><sentence id="154">We were forced to obtain religious instruction. </sentence><sentence id="155">And when a priest came in, uh, there was some apprentice what were already over twenty before they got a job. </sentence><sentence id="156">And so they objected to the teaching and, uh, presence of the priest. </sentence><sentence id="157">And some in the background even hailed Hitler in his presence. </sentence><sentence id="158">He was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="159">And then the priest said, "What's wrong with our religion? </sentence><sentence id="160">You have no respect! </sentence><sentence id="161">Ask me questions." </sentence><sentence id="162">And so nobody, uh, want to ask, after, any questions. </sentence><sentence id="163">So I asked the priest, uh, "I would really like, uh, to have some of my questions answered, because, uh, I have some doubts about, uh, that teaching." </sentence><sentence id="164">And he said, "That's what I want!" </sentence><sentence id="165">And so I asked him for a whole hour the different questions. </sentence><sentence id="166">About, for example, the involvement of the war: how it was possible that in the name of the same religion they were placing the Austrians to kill the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="167">And, uh, he said that this was the greatest shame. </sentence><sentence id="168">It should never happen again. </sentence><sentence id="169">And at the end of that hour, he came to my desk. </sentence><sentence id="170">He said, "It never happened to me that anyone asked so many questions. </sentence><sentence id="171">And, for example, also about if the Catholic Church can really claim that they are the only true faith." </sentence><sentence id="172">So he said, "Believe me, I would rather have a handful Catholics what would die for their faith, but not so many millions what only on the paper." </sentence><sentence id="173">And then when he asked where I got this knowledge, uh, of the Bible and, uh, I was able to ask him such questions; so I explained to him that our father teach us from the Bible. </sentence><sentence id="174">And he said, "You are on the right road. </sentence><sentence id="175">Just continue." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: So what were some of the...the pressures that you began to see from "33 to "38, when Hitler took over [in Austria]? </sentence><sentence id="203">What were some of the changes that were taking place in your town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Yes, the changes were a few months later [from] when I had that discussion. </sentence><sentence id="207">Uh, Hitler moved in. </sentence><sentence id="208">And then it became really such a, uh, uh, pressure and change. </sentence><sentence id="209">Uh, people were watched, uh, everything they did. </sentence><sentence id="210">They took account of everyone who did not salute it. </sentence><sentence id="211">And, for example, I had, uh, refused to answer the Hitler greeting. </sentence><sentence id="212">And it took...it took not too long and I was called before, uh, SA group--some of the party informations that I had refused twelve times the greetings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: And what is that greeting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Hail Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="223">And so they want to put me in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="224">But the master painter was avoiding, by  excusing, uh, me that I should finish my training and that he needs me. </sentence><sentence id="225">And so I got still through without being taken to the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: You mean, other people were reporting you? </sentence><sentence id="231">On you, ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: ...that you wouldn't "Heil, Hitler"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="239">There were, uh, papers asking me to answer with a Hitler greeting. </sentence><sentence id="240">But we explained to him that we never will hail a man. </sentence><sentence id="241">That this only belongs to our Creator, Jehovah God. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="247">So then all of this took place when you were still under twenty-one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: And in Austria, what age is that--the age of twenty-one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Twenty-one, when you are full responsible. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh, like, uh, when you are called in the services, in the army. </sentence><sentence id="256">Then you are full responsible. </sentence><sentence id="257">But not before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="263">OK. </sentence><sentence id="264">So then in the year 1938, when Hitler finally took over, what were the things that began to happen to you and to your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Yes, the first thing was that they called my father for registration. </sentence><sentence id="269">And in 1939 already, before the Polish War started and, uh, at that Commission, they said it was visible that my father was a invalid, partly from the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="270">He suffered [sublalian (ph)] arthritis; he lost all his teeth right in that time. </sentence><sentence id="271">And then they said, uh, he should be left alone and sent back, because he had enough from the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="272">But then there was some question put to him by some of the German officers. </sentence><sentence id="273">And he said that it would be also against his conscience as one of Jehovah's Witnesses to have anything to do with war. </sentence><sentence id="274">And despite that he was not eligible for war service, they kept him there. </sentence><sentence id="275">He was transferred in, uh, military jail. </sentence><sentence id="276">And there, uh, he had to wait about three months, uh, [to] be transferred from the, uh, Vienna Army jail to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="277">And there he was put before the War Court, the Reichskriegsgericht [Ger: State War Court]; and there, he was sentenced with about twenty- eight other Witnesses to death. </sentence><sentence id="278">In the meantime, some of the town[s] people and the former mayor, uh, put up a petition; and, uh, they were signed by most of the people. </sentence><sentence id="279">Even some Nazis sent in letters of recommendations. </sentence><sentence id="280">And this was all ignored. </sentence><sentence id="281">And the one who had started that petition was nearly put to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="282">And they warned him not to do anything like that anymore. </sentence><sentence id="283">There were still people favored; and they liked my father. </sentence><sentence id="284">In that letter was stated he was an example for the community, that he was a very loving neighbor and that he helped everyone. </sentence><sentence id="285">But this didn't help anything. </sentence><sentence id="286">They beheaded him. </sentence><sentence id="287">And it is really a coincidence that today is that very day. </sentence><sentence id="288">The 7th December of 1935 [1939]--fifty years since  my father was beheaded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: You mean, 1939? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Yes, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="313">On the 7th...7th of December; that's right. </sentence><sentence id="314">Today [is] fifty years since that date. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: Now, did you mention before that your two brothers were also there as well, in Berlin, at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Uh, no. </sentence><sentence id="321">At...at that time, uh, there were some other, uh, uh, Witnesses from, uh...some from that area. </sentence><sentence id="322">But my... was put uh, uh...three months later, uh, I was called up in the work services [NB: Arbeitsdienst]. </sentence><sentence id="323">But my second oldest brother [Gregor Jr.] was, uh, called, after he became twenty-one, uh, to the air force [NB: Luftwaffe]. </sentence><sentence id="324">And he took the stand of one of Jehovah's Witnesses; and he was sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="325">And they waited nearly five months with the execution. </sentence><sentence id="326">Because, uh, everyone had the chance to sign a form that he is not following anymore Jehovah's Witnesses; and also, that he breaks, uh, his oath to Jehovah God and is willing to serve Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="327">My father had one month time. </sentence><sentence id="328">And my brother--twenty- two year old brother--had two...uh, five months time; but he did not, uh, sign the paper. </sentence><sentence id="329">But this were ...this was very hard for him. </sentence><sentence id="330">I had the occasion to meet one of the barbers. </sentence><sentence id="331">He [the barber] was transferred from the execution chamber of uh...to our camp. </sentence><sentence id="332">And he was, uh, cutting his hair and shaving him. </sentence><sentence id="333">And he noticed that I had the same name; and he remembered that this was my brother what he was, uh, serving there in that area. </sentence><sentence id="334">And he said it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="335">He had, day and night, heavy chains on their arms and weights on their legs before the execution. </sentence><sentence id="336">Day and night. </sentence><sentence id="337">They only were taken off during mealtime, or when they used the toilet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: What was the name of the camp, or the place your brother was at, before he was executed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: This was...most were executed in Berlin--in [the] Pletzensee, where thousands were executed. </sentence><sentence id="359">And some were executed in Brandenburg, also in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="360">And some were executed in other places; like, uh, from our congregation there were different ones. </sentence><sentence id="361">Uh, even some were gassed in Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="367">Well, since Jehovah's Witnesses were such a small group, why was Hitler interested in killing them or destroying them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Yes, uh, because of their firm stand that they were staying neutral and not taking part in Hitler's, uh, goal to rule the world. </sentence><sentence id="371">And they feared if more people would take that stand, so it would be very damaging. </sentence><sentence id="372">And that's why it came up, uh, even in all the churches. </sentence><sentence id="373">For example, Pastor Niemieller* was saying in that connection, after the war in one of his big * Martin Niemeller was head of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church from 1937. </sentence><sentence id="374">He was interned in Sachsenhausen and Dachau--usually in solitary confinement--until liberated by the Americans in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="375"> gatherings, "If we had taken the stand with the Catholic Church as true Christians, Hitler could have never gone that far. </sentence><sentence id="376">And there's no excuse. </sentence><sentence id="377">Because many are saying, today, "We were forced to take part in that war. </sentence><sentence id="378">We were forced by Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="379">He said--Pastor Niem6ller-- "We have seen a group of Christians which were not only giving up their freedom. </sentence><sentence id="380">Many were giving up their lives, to keep faith alive in those dark days. </sentence><sentence id="381">These were Jehovah's Witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="382">And if they were able do it, we could have done it." </sentence><sentence id="383">And the same comment made even, uh, before, by Chancellor Adenauer" in a letter, according to Der Spiegel. </sentence><sentence id="384">And Eisenhower, where he said the churches had a great responsibility in the concen...on the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="385">If they had spoken up, Hitler could have never, uh, be able to bring about these terrible things in the concentration camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="405">Q: Now, why was it that they beheaded, uh, your father and brother and other Jehovah's Witnesses, instead of just shooting them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="407">A: Yes, they did, uh, shoot only, uh, two brothers I know from Salzburg. </sentence><sentence id="408">But, uh, it was then changed, because they were not worth it being executed. </sentence><sentence id="409">This was a honorable way of execution. </sentence><sentence id="410">And beheading was dishonorable. </sentence><sentence id="411">This was the reason. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="418">OK, so then that's what happened to your family. </sentence><sentence id="419">Now, what happened to your two brothers who were young? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: Yes, uh, after my second brother, uh, was, uh, executed, they took the other two, uh, younger brothers--they were about thirteen years old, one was fourteen--and the two sisters--one was, uh, also in the age of about fifteen; sixteen, the second. </sentence><sentence id="424">They took them away, so that she would...they would not be influenced, uh, by their mother. </sentence><sentence id="425">Because my mother was still raising them and teaching them in the spirit of, uh, the truth with the Bible. </sentence><sentence id="426">And so they tried to take them away from that influence. </sentence><sentence id="427">They even in a letter apologized that they have taken them away, because they know that they had a very good upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="428">And so the two sisters were taken to some homes, some...what were directed by nuns. </sentence><sentence id="429">And also, my two, uh, younger brothers were taken to the French border near Strasbourg, in the Landau.deg And there they were indoctrinated ...they tried to indoctrinate them with, uh, the Hitler teaching. </sentence><sentence id="430">There were some special instructors coming in. </sentence><sentence id="431">And because my little brothers refused to hail Hitler when they asked them, then they kicked them. </sentence><sentence id="432">Uh, one of the little brothers was once, uh, bleeding all over the face. </sentence><sentence id="433">Uh, they was kicked around, they landed in the gravel there behind this institutions. </sentence><sentence id="434">And then later, they forced them to that home defense. </sentence><sentence id="435">And that little brother was still shot." </sentence><sentence id="436">Uh, lost his life, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

During my work, we already discussed some of our, uh, stand as Jehovah's Witnesses--about our neutrality. </sentence><sentence id="1291">And even the wife [of] the commander made remark we really do not, uh, deserve that we are in such a place. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And the commander said, yes, he doesn't regard me as a law-breaker--I'm just here because of my faith. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And when I received the call, then I was preparing myself. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Because I knew already from experience that everyone in our congregation was, uh, executed what, uh, refused, uh, the military services. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1302">Q: Just to go back for a few moments, uh, to the wallpaper again-- or really, the paint. </sentence><sentence id="1303">How did that happen to, uh...to help you with that commandant of the camp? </sentence><sentence id="1304">That wallpaper--or that  paint, I should say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
