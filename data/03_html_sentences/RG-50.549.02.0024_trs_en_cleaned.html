<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="246">Why do you think these people did this and put their lives on the line? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: I think these people are -- first of all, they were -- especially the Hartamings where we stayed, were very deeply religious, they were Dutch Reformed and the Yolinks were also Dutch Reformed, perhaps a tad less religious than the Hartamings were. </sentence><sentence id="250">I think it was religion, slash, humanitarian need to help your fellow man, because interestingly -- and I'm jumping ahead a little bit now, when I have spoken to them about why, they -- they sort of look at me in amazement and they say, "Well, we'd do it all over again." </sentence><sentence id="251">And Yolink's son said, "Well, I don't think it was such a big deal." </sentence><sentence id="252">Well, it was a big deal indeed, because, after all, they put their lives and their farms and their families on the line for us, but over and over, over the years, they have said, no, they would do it again and it was only the right thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="253">So, I guess it was indeed Christian as well as humanitarian. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Tell me about how much of your experiences you shared with your children. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1952">A: Well, as I started to say, this is interesting, because when my husband and I first met, of course we talked about our backgrounds and what happened to him, what happened to me and in general, and very much aware of each of our histories. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And then we married and we really never talked about it any more -- very little. </sentence><sentence id="1954">Perhaps alluded to it here and there. </sentence><sentence id="1955">And then the children came, Tanya first, in "57 and David in 1960 and I think neither one of us ever really made it a point to -- to sit down and say, "Well, you want to know about what happened to us." </sentence><sentence id="1956">We may have touched it, we may have talked about it here and there, but not in depth. </sentence><sentence id="1957">And I think, as we got older, as the -- as we were less involved in the children's lives, namely once they were out of college and out on their own, if you will, I think much later we started to think more about it and to discuss it more. </sentence><sentence id="1958">And even, you know, going more into details of what happened to us, particularly in my case, because my husband was always much more reluctant to talk about it because, you know, his parents, of course, had a very horrible ending. </sentence><sentence id="1959">And, as we sometimes said, he never really had a chance to grieve for them and it was always a little difficult for him to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1960">And as time went on, it wasn't as if we were hiding anything. </sentence><sentence id="1961">We answered and they knew I was in hiding and where I was in hiding and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1962">But I think it became very much topic A after I -- after we got involved This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1963">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1964"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 69 with the Holocaust Museum and after I gave my testimony and after my t -- my tape. </sentence><sentence id="1965">And I think then, we started to talk much more about what was than we did in the earlier years. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And I think part of it -- I really wasn't deliberate -- I think it was more we were very much engaged in working, bringing up children and making a life and did not really dwell on what was. </sentence><sentence id="1967">And I think, as we got older, we thought back, more about what happened and it's a reminiscence, really. </sentence><sentence id="1968">And again, as I said, the tape was sort of a -- a final presentation to them, as to the what and the whereabouts -- the wheres.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2085">Q: But, do you have any comment on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2087">A: I think that's hard to comment on. </sentence><sentence id="2088">In other words, what he's saying is really it's the Jewish faith and in a way the Jews bonding, sticking together, that helps us survive. </sentence><sentence id="2089">I think the state of Israel has been -- the creation of the state of Israel has been a very important milestone for the Jews and I think without the existence of the state of Israel, I think we would be far more vulnerable than we are now. </sentence><sentence id="2090">Desperate you mean, while in hiding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
