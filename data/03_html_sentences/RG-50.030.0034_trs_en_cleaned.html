<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: Will you tell me, Regina, what happened to you, please, when the Nazis came in to Lodz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="22">When the Nazis came into Lodz, we were still on this place, a summer home. </sentence><sentence id="23">It was name Wisniowa Gora, and we decided that we going to go back home to the city. </sentence><sentence id="24">When we got into the city, our home was taken away by the Nazis, so we stayed in a house of a brother of ours, of my oldest brother, Rubin (ph), who at that time was in the Polish army fighting in Warsaw and his wife and a six-month old baby was with us. </sentence><sentence id="25">And after that we stayed with my brother in my brother's house, and I'm not going to say how it happened that my brother came home from the army and he took his wife and a six-month old baby and he said he wants to go to Soviet Russia. </sentence><sentence id="26">That's the only place he said where the Jews could survive, and he went. </sentence><sentence id="27">My father, my mother, my sister and one brother, sister younger one, a brother older one than me that were staying in this house until March 1940, 10th of March 1940 when the Gestapo came into the house. </sentence><sentence id="28">We thought that we're going to go to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="29">They already made it for the Jews, the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="30">They took everyday from certain streets to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="31">The fact that my mother had a sis...a brother in the ghetto and he said uh bring every...all the stuff here because when you're going to go, all you can do take is a valise. </sentence><sentence id="32">This way bring over stuff to me and when you come to the ghetto you'll have everything. </sentence><sentence id="33">So that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="34">When the the Nazis came in to take us down...it was during the night...one o'clock at night...my mother forget that she went down in the house shoes. </sentence><sentence id="35">And we went down...we thought we're going to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="36">And we said alright. </sentence><sentence id="37">We're going to have everything over there in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="38">For us the soldier said wouldn't you let me go back. </sentence><sentence id="39">My mother is cold and she would like to have some shoes. </sentence><sentence id="40">He said oh, it's going to be soon summer. </sentence><sentence id="41">You can go barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="42">She can go barefooted. </sentence><sentence id="43">So instead to the ghetto, they took us to a place and they told us that we're going to be going out from the city. </sentence><sentence id="44">They took away our money, our possessions. </sentence><sentence id="45">They took off a ring from my mother...she had a fat finger...and they couldn't take it off...with the flesh and they sent us to a small town near Czestochowa named Nowo Radomsko and they put us in a burned synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="46">That town that town Radomsko was " maiden name  bombarded very, very badly and they had already a ghetto over there. </sentence><sentence id="47">But I must say the Jews from the town, especial there was a man named Burger (ph)...he was the oldest from the town and he brought some food special for the children. </sentence><sentence id="48">I still have my little sister...was a still a small little girl and uh I always....1 younger...I always looked older, and my mother said, well, we have to do something to make something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="49">What we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="50">My mother was washing floors for people, because my father got ill right away when...he was a very delicate man, long, very tall, and uh from the nature he was not...my mother was the stronger one, for everything for father, and he...from the beginning he said right away I don't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="51">I cannot live like this, and I don't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="52">From mine...seven children I brought up, from my home, for everything what I worked, I'm here in a burnt synagogue and strolling and a (indecipherable), and on the top of it, his foot got very swollen and very ill. </sentence><sentence id="53">So we decided that...there was no hospital, no Jewish hospital and in the Polish hospital, Jews were not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="54">In Czestochowa was a Jewish hospital, so we hired a Polish (indecipherable)...a Polish...that was a horse and carriage. </sentence><sentence id="55">Called in a Polish (indecipherable), a horse and carriage and we... took my father and we went to Czestochowa and there we arrived in the Jewish hospital in Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="56">That's the time that I came...the first time in my life to Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="57">My mother was behind in that synagogue with my sister and my brother and I decided...my father was out out of the hospital...how...where is he going to go back to that burnt synagogue, so I was looking around a way to to remain in Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="58">I had 50 Polish zloty...what the Germans give...1 took away...we...our Polish...our town in Lodz belonged to the 3rd Reich, Litzmannstadt they called it. </sentence><sentence id="59">So L..and that Poland and Czestochowa was Protectorate for us for that's where they give us the Polish money, so with that money I rented an apar...uh a room by a family, and I brought over my sister and my brother and my mother so we stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="60">In 1942 I said I'm going to make a brief...before Yom Kippur, and that's the first time of our life that comes this kind of a holiday. </sentence><sentence id="61">The saddest time of my life. </sentence><sentence id="62">I guess all the lives from Czestochowa Jews, and maybe for other towns, that was a day that their Gestapo came and they took out the people for the liquidations. </sentence><sentence id="63">They call it the akti...the aktions. </sentence><sentence id="64">I don't know how it is...akt...aktion... aktion in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="65">And before that all it was the holidays and they took out from the ghetto and made another ghetto, so we did not have an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="66">We were the refugees so we didn't know so many Czestochowans, people...so many...you know, that protects you, how you say, that we should get an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="67">So the (indecipherable) rabbi from Radomsko invited my father with his family for the holidays, and I was left behind to wait for an apartment, so they went and I was left behind. </sentence><sentence id="68">I stayed there for a little while and I said no...1 am going also going there, so I went back to Radomsko, just for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="69">Stayed with them and then I decided since I don't look so Jewish, I am going to go back on the train and I went into the train, bought a ticket, and I went back to Czestochowa to wait for the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="70">In meantime in Radomsko was judenrein...you know what that means,  jJudenrein. </sentence><sentence id="71">Clean of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="72">Only a few I think were left behind because two of them came back, two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="73">They came back to Czestochowa later on, in a bunker. </sentence><sentence id="74">They were hid in a bunker. </sentence><sentence id="75">And I stayed there...1 met a fellow in that hospital while my father was laying there in the hospital, and he took me into his house...he had a father and a mother and a sister, but the mother said it's not nice that a girl should stay in the same house, one room, with a fellow, so they decided that I should get married to him. </sentence><sentence id="76">He was much older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="77">He was fifteen years older. </sentence><sentence id="78">I got married by myself, and I even...somebody borrowed me a little veil and a dress and I got married, and if you don't want to have children, then you have them sometimes, and I become pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="79">I called up my mother and I told her about it. </sentence><sentence id="80">It was May 15, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I told her, and she said I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="82">I would like to come, but I can't because we....they were not allowed, the Jewish people, to travel and that was the last time I spoke to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="83">I spoke to her by telephone through the Jewish komitet in Nowo Radomsko and in Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="84">Now after that, my husband was working in a hospital, in that hospital in Czestochowa, so he took me into that hospital. </sentence><sentence id="85">His parents were sent away with the whole family, sisters, two sisters and a niece and his parents, and we stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="86">After that we were...I was washing the bloody wash from the people. </sentence><sentence id="87">I didn't know what else to do but I wanted to help. </sentence><sentence id="88">They left us for the next ones to go. </sentence><sentence id="89">After that they send us to a factory. </sentence><sentence id="90">The factory was named Factory Iskovitch (ph), and across the street was another factory...I don't know the name...where my husband was near the factory. </sentence><sentence id="91">All of a sudden when I was in the factory...I hadn't mentioned his name. </sentence><sentence id="92">His name was Shlomo Muskovitch (ph). </sentence><sentence id="93">And somebody say hey, Muskovitch (ph) is outside, and I looked it out and I saw him taking his rucksack and his head down...he didn't see me. </sentence><sentence id="94">I saw him through the window, and that's the last time I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="95">They were shipped to Treblinka because they needed another hundred men for the transport, so this they sent him away. </sentence><sentence id="96">And here I came into the ghetto...they sent us to a small ghetto and pregnant, alone, not from a strange town, without any family, without nobody. </sentence><sentence id="97">So everybody was making groups to take a room in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="98">It was rooms in the ho...in houses. </sentence><sentence id="99">That's what they give us...a few streets, and uh I was sitting outside on my rucksack and my things...I took a few things because I was thinking we weren't going to have some place the baby. </sentence><sentence id="100">In fact the doctor wanted to make an abortion right away. </sentence><sentence id="101">And I said what, my father would...he was a religious man. </sentence><sentence id="102">That would be the worst thing that anybody could have done. </sentence><sentence id="103">It's a sin. </sentence><sentence id="104">So I didn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="105">But by the time we came to the ghetto, by the time think it was late...so we were in...eight people in one room and there was a wo...a lady...at that time to me she was an older lady. </sentence><sentence id="106">Maybe she was forty-five years old and she had a daughter my age and she said, believe me, Regina, you'll see...make an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="107">Otherwise you're not going to live because she said you're young. </sentence><sentence id="108">You'll get married again. </sentence><sentence id="109">You'll have children. </sentence><sentence id="110">And I went to one doctor to make an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="111">He he wouldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="112">He thought it's too late. </sentence><sentence id="113">Then we went to another doctor. </sentence><sentence id="114">I even remember her name...her name was Dr.  Grunwald (ph), a woman doctor. </sentence><sentence id="115">In middle of abortion, she said I think you're going to die...the head is so big. </sentence><sentence id="116">You are very far...you must be having the fifth month already. </sentence><sentence id="117">I said yes I am. </sentence><sentence id="118">She said why I didn't ask you any questions. </sentence><sentence id="119">She said I've assumed that you're in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="120">I didn't...I didn't show so much. </sentence><sentence id="121">I'm I'm tall, so I didn't show so much. </sentence><sentence id="122">I said no, I I...you didn't ask me what it is. </sentence><sentence id="123">And she said well...and the abortion was made on a small, tiny table, holding my own legs because there was no hospital or anything, and of course we they didn't want to wait any longer because it was pretty late and I listened to that older lady, what she said. </sentence><sentence id="124">She said if you don't go and make an abortion now, a little bit soon it's going to show and then they're going to send you away for the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="125">We want you to live, and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="126">I had an abortion and I was...after that had to go to work, bleeding, and go to work and I was working and uh after one year they made another ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="127">They made three streets. </sentence><sentence id="128">The young, the girls that we had no husbands like me, the men, and married couples where they also had a street, so there were three streets. </sentence><sentence id="129">Everything in Czestochowa in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="130">We were going out to work. </sentence><sentence id="131">What happened...a lot of things what with my husband even said I was listening there about uh that uh Vislovich (ph) that they killed him laying right before my feet. </sentence><sentence id="132">But like I said, we're going to make it short. </sentence><sentence id="133">They sent us to this...1 was working in a place named HASAG". </sentence><sentence id="134">I worked...got up in the morning, five o'clock appel. </sentence><sentence id="135">Seven o'clock we went to work and seven o'clock we returned, and we worked there until June 1943. </sentence><sentence id="136">That day we didn't go back to the ghetto anymore. </sentence><sentence id="137">We prepared to go back to the ghetto like every day and all of a sudden and to this day I don't know how that happened...all of a sudden we looked around by the gate of going out from that HASAG, from the factory...it took us an hour to walk to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="138">All of a sudden thousands of Ukrainians with their machine guns to us and from where they come from until this day I don't know how that happened so quick and they said, halt. </sentence><sentence id="139">And a table was put up and at that table went up a man...he was some kind of director from that factory and he said...this this was exactly his words, because I was there: "In eure gewesenem Lager geht ihr nie mehr guriick." </sentence><sentence id="140">That means in the ghetto you don't go never back again. </sentence><sentence id="141">You're going to stay here until we're going to let us live. </sentence><sentence id="142">That was exactly his words. </sentence><sentence id="143">Women were fainting because they had children, mothers...the ghetto still had, you know, a lot of people and I had...knew Abraham...I had him and I (inaudible). </sentence><sentence id="144">What I'm going do? </sentence><sentence id="145">So my uh two cousins of mine, two sisters...there were three but one of the sisters was working by sor...sorting buttons from the people from the stores who left behind, so they had a thing, the job was to put buttons to buttons. </sentence><sentence id="146">They found a sock with buttons for a Pole...for a Polish man, and he said that the people from the Garibaldiego street where they working with the buttons, they give him the buttons. </sentence><sentence id="147">So they took my cousin, a first cousin, my mother's sister's daughter...the two sisters have survived. </sentence><sentence id="148">They're here in too in America and living in New York, and took her...her name was the beautiful Paula. </sentence><sentence id="149">She was such a beautiful girl...I I cannot ex...there's pictures 2 Hugo Schneider Aktiengesellschaft-Metalwarenfabrik, Leipzig  from her too. </sentence><sentence id="150">The sisters have pictures from her, and they took her and other eight people, nine, and a child nine year old because there was a couple with a child...and other seven...nine people. </sentence><sentence id="151">They took them to the cemetery and they put a ditch and they killed them and she had a ring and she had a little uh how you call it...a chain, a golden chain, and there was a German standing and he said she was so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off of her, and she said listen. </sentence><sentence id="152">You're looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="153">Do me a favor. </sentence><sentence id="154">I have two sisters in that factory HASAG. </sentence><sentence id="155">Could you give this to my sisters? </sentence><sentence id="156">I'll give you their name, and he came back and he gave it to them. </sentence><sentence id="157">They still have this. </sentence><sentence id="158">My husband saw this girl...you ask my husband what a beautiful girl she was and uh we we come in and he came on the table and he told us that we don't go no more to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="159">My cousins said to me, the two sisters said you talk pretty good German. </sentence><sentence id="160">Why don't you ask him what's going to happen to the people in the ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="161">From nature I am not a shy person like my husband. </sentence><sentence id="162">I walked over to him and I got my courage and I said I would like to ask you, do me a favor. </sentence><sentence id="163">Please Mr., what's going to happen to the people in the ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="164">He said they're going to come tomorrow to that to that place here. </sentence><sentence id="165">For a minute we were very happy that that he said that but we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="166">The next day...Abraham came and another couple of people came...I don't know how many exactly but quite a few young people came in. </sentence><sentence id="167">Was no children, not older people, plenty of young people didn't come in. </sentence><sentence id="168">When I left that day in the morning...I saw Abraham at night and I told him, Abraham, you know I had a pair of earrings of my grandmother's put it on on me when I was only three days old. </sentence><sentence id="169">I said I'm going to give you these earrings. </sentence><sentence id="170">It's very dear to me, and I had a watch and I had a wedding band and I had pictures. </sentence><sentence id="171">That was the most important for my family, a lot of pictures and he...I said I'll leave this with you after and you take care. </sentence><sentence id="172">He said oh, of course I'm going to take care of that, but when they took them out from the ghetto to the to the uh market place, they told them to put all their valuables...they didn't know they're not going to go back, so everything was left in there. </sentence><sentence id="173">But I was so happy and pleased and that he came to the place, and we told him look, they made a place for all the women, one on top of the other, and a place for the men. </sentence><sentence id="174">And then they stopped making barracks and they made for about...we were about six hundred in each barrack and what I wanted to tell you that the police..my husband mentioned it already...that the police were taken with hammers over the heads, knocking them down and then taking them to the cemetery for burial, and the wife of one policeman...her name is Mrs.Kohn (ph). </sentence><sentence id="175">She lives now I believe now in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="176">She was left alone with a young baby sixteen months old. </sentence><sentence id="177">Her name, his name was David. </sentence><sentence id="178">We called him Doodoo (ph), and she came in to that HASAG, in that factory with him. </sentence><sentence id="179">She put him in a sack, give him a sleeping pill, put him in a sack, and how shocked she was, and she brought him over. </sentence><sentence id="180">But later on when she sit down on the chair, in that HASAG, she could not talk and she was like you  know not herself. </sentence><sentence id="181">She didn't know she had a child, like you call it crazy. </sentence><sentence id="182">Mishkoiradich* (ph). </sentence><sentence id="183">Regardless of how you say it in English, like like...not like crazy running around but quiet, very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="184">We had a doctor and he said that nothing he can do for her, so we gave her a broom in her hand and that she is the one who cleans the barracks and that...with that broom she was sitting all the time in those barracks. </sentence><sentence id="185">What we going to do with the child?We made it a little bunker on the bottom under mine where I was sleeping on the first one. </sentence><sentence id="186">Then there were three like the bunk beds, and this child they made it a little draw...drawer...door and inside they made for him a little bed. </sentence><sentence id="187">He got very tiny and he didn't grow and he was there. </sentence><sentence id="188">Whatever we could, you know...everybody from us gave him a little tiny whatever we got from bread or a spoon of soup. </sentence><sentence id="189">We had enough. </sentence><sentence id="190">He was so smart and so quiet. </sentence><sentence id="191">He didn't show himself. </sentence><sentence id="192">He didn't...he knew when he saw Nazis or Germans, he knew. </sentence><sentence id="193">He run away. </sentence><sentence id="194">Opened like a little door and ran in there, and one day he couldn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="195">That Nazi saw him and they called the...Mr. Kurlon (ph) I think was the man from the Jewish uh elders and he called him and he said what's this. </sentence><sentence id="196">He said listen. </sentence><sentence id="197">I lost my family but I cannot, I couldn't have the heart to give this child. </sentence><sentence id="198">I'll do with him whatever you like. </sentence><sentence id="199">He said you know what. </sentence><sentence id="200">Give him a portion bread and a soup. </sentence><sentence id="201">Let him stay. </sentence><sentence id="202">You know, it...like who knows tomorrow what's going to be with all of you, and would you believe it or not, he stayed with us until 1945 when we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="203">The only child. </sentence><sentence id="204">He didn't grow. </sentence><sentence id="205">He's in Israel today. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh his father had a brother there in Israel and she's met...she's married. </sentence><sentence id="207">She got well in Israel and she got married. </sentence><sentence id="208">I don't know exactly how at this moment it is with them. </sentence><sentence id="209">You're not interested in everyone but this is the episode that I wanted to tell you that I thought it was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="210">We stayed in that HASAG. </sentence><sentence id="211">I was working very, very hard. </sentence><sentence id="212">I was working so hard because they took away...every time a couple of hundred of people and they send them to the Auschwitz or Tre...1 don't know wherever they sent them away from us. </sentence><sentence id="213">We didn't know exactly where they were sending people, so like I had one machine...we were making ammunitions. </sentence><sentence id="214">Then I had to have three machines, so if one machine made Schmelz*...Schmelz means when the Rohstoff did not come out too good, so he...it was punishment, so I I I couldn't be at once on all the three machines, that was for three people. </sentence><sentence id="215">Abe called me I'm a dancer, I'm dancing from one machine to the other, and at the top of it they made it very hard for us. </sentence><sentence id="216">Why? </sentence><sentence id="217">We used to take the Rohstoff, put it in a very high, big machine inside and that machine was going this way and it came out at once in a big box, the Rohstoff, and this was only uh we called it Matrizen(r). </sentence><sentence id="218">That means that the the bullet goes in &gt; in a stupor (Yiddish) * melted metal (German) * raw material (German) deg mold (German)  in that. </sentence><sentence id="219">I don't know how you call it in English. </sentence><sentence id="220">We call it in German the Matrizen. </sentence><sentence id="221">And the bullet goes in in that. </sentence><sentence id="222">The bullet was a different place where people were working. </sentence><sentence id="223">So one day I had Schmelz down but the work was not done. </sentence><sentence id="224">He said why did you do that? </sentence><sentence id="225">I didn't do it, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="226">I said I have for this machine then that happened. </sentence><sentence id="227">You've got to call up Heinrich (ph). </sentence><sentence id="228">That means the man who's fixing the machine. </sentence><sentence id="229">I said I did but I couldn't do it while I was on this machine, so I got "strafe...punishment. </sentence><sentence id="230">Punishment...it was my twelve hours work regular. </sentence><sentence id="231">The other twelve hours was the "strafe and then it was again my time to work and it was at night time. </sentence><sentence id="232">For thirty-six hours without nothing, eating, standing what we got to eat, so I was so tired so I sit down. </sentence><sentence id="233">I don't know a German walked over... where he got such a foot I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="234">I was not such a little girl. </sentence><sentence id="235">I'm tall. </sentence><sentence id="236">He picked me up with his foot and he he...I 1 got up, with his foot, while I'm sitting and eating. </sentence><sentence id="237">I'm not going to tell you how many times we got beaten up for things that was...a minimum we got beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="238">As long as we were not shot, and then on the top we had a very bad time. </sentence><sentence id="239">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="240">There was another camp uh Skarzysko. </sentence><sentence id="241">They had liquidated that camp and they sent the people to our camp in that HASAG in Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="242">With them came the Meisters. </sentence><sentence id="243">Means the the German Herrschaft". </sentence><sentence id="244">They came and they were the...if ours were very bad, theirs were ten time worst. </sentence><sentence id="245">They didn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="246">They went with the guns like that. </sentence><sentence id="247">There was special one man...his name is so good for him...his name was Bartenschlager*, and he had...he didn't go...he didn't talk to nobody. </sentence><sentence id="248">If he did see something he didn't like it, he shot you. </sentence><sentence id="249">And I had the pleasure once to see him next to my machine. </sentence><sentence id="250">I figured that seven o'clock we're finishing and at five to seven I made my accord everything was finished. </sentence><sentence id="251">Five minutes before I'm going to clean up my machines. </sentence><sentence id="252">Everything had to be spotless. </sentence><sentence id="253">They're very clean, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="254">That that you can't take away from
