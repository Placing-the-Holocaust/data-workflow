It was to the Jewish World Congress that were looking for me as a witness for that "Boxer." </sentence><sentence id="549">Of course, I immediately replied; and I was called to the German Consul in Chicago and I was told that somebody gave my name that I know what happened in that...in that day. </sentence><sentence id="550">I said, "I certainly do." </sentence><sentence id="551">I still don't know until today who gave my name; but I went to Germany and I testified against that "Boxer," which I found out that his real name is "Krisom" because that's how they referred to him, "Herr Krisom." </sentence><sentence id="552">And I was asked by the prosecutor to...to tell what I know about him; and I told them the story about that hospital, what's happened in that...in that day. </sentence><sentence id="553">Uh, his lawyer asked me a question, if I know for sure that the people were thrown out from the windows into the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="554">He said how do I know for sure they were thrown out? </sentence><sentence id="555">Maybe they jumped out, out of fear, when they saw the troops. </sentence><sentence id="556">They jumped out by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="557">So my question to him was, "How about the stretchers?" </sentence><sentence id="558">People on stretchers. </sentence><sentence id="559">And also: belongings, packages, suitcases, bottles. </sentence><sentence id="560">Altogether were thrown out into the.... And then another question was put to me: "Weren't you afraid to stay there and watch all this, with all the Germans around--with that "Boxer," that you call him, around? </sentence><sentence id="561">Weren't you afraid to stand there? </sentence><sentence id="562">You told me that he used to beat up people he didn't like." </sentence><sentence id="563">So I told them that I think that they wanted us to stay. </sentence><sentence id="564">If they wouldn't want us to stay there, they would chase us away. </sentence><sentence id="565">They want us to stay and observe all that fear, all that cruelty, that I did. </sentence><sentence id="566">Then the only defense was, from the lawyer in that same, that I mistake him for somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="567">They never denied that such action happened there by the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="568">The only defense was: maybe it was somebody else, not him. </sentence><sentence id="569">And sure enough, this was forty years later. </sentence><sentence id="570">I said, "Looking at that man I don't know if this is the man. </sentence><sentence id="571">I only know the "Boxer." </sentence><sentence id="572">And if he was the "Boxer," he was the man." </sentence><sentence id="573">They showed me pictures from the past. </sentence><sentence id="574">I recognized him immediately. </sentence><sentence id="575">And then they showed me different kind of hats that he wore, and I picked his uniform. </sentence><sentence id="576">I picked his cap that he wore, and it was established that he was the one. </sentence><sentence id="577">And then the defense went--not referring to me, but referring to the prosecutor--that it was a cruel war and every man in the war had to follow the orders, and this was the orders. </sentence><sentence id="578">But I establish one point: that that action...that this man, Herr Krisom--or that one that we called "The Boxer"--was in charge of that operation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="655">Q: Are there any other stories or incidents that you remember from Lodz that are important that you want to tell us? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: Well, the most important is during the liquidation when we were running from the transports, we were trying to stay in the ghetto, not to go away. </sentence><sentence id="657">Because to go away to nowhere, to a unknown destination, it's frightening. </sentence><sentence id="658">We don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="659">They... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: Tell us...excuse me, what...what happened leading up to the liquidation of the ghetto, so we know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="663">The the people from the ghetto was taken out constantly...five hundred, six hundred, thousand, and they...we were told that they going to be resettled in a different place. </sentence><sentence id="664">That they need--for example, at one time they need strong people, so they took all the strong men and they put them to work, and they send them away. </sentence><sentence id="665">For a while, their families used to get a letter or two--even money paid by the by the Jewish Council in the ghetto-- to make us believe they're working someplace else, and that's is the pay the family is getting. </sentence><sentence id="666">But after a while, it stopped. </sentence><sentence id="667">There were no more letters. </sentence><sentence id="668">No more money. </sentence><sentence id="669">We didn't hear about them; like they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="670">And a few months later another resettlement program. </sentence><sentence id="671">They took away other people. </sentence><sentence id="672">They need another five hundred, or six hundred, or...or a thousand. </sentence><sentence id="673">It was little by little. </sentence><sentence id="674">The ghetto was getting smaller and smaller. </sentence><sentence id="675">The population dying, and putting...and sending away. </sentence><sentence id="676">Until it came to a point that everybody, the whole ghetto, is being liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="677">And everybody was going away. </sentence><sentence id="678">And ..and this was the the time that we tried, we tried very hard to stay. </sentence><sentence id="679">We hide. </sentence><sentence id="680">We built even uh hiding places underneath, uh underneath cellars. </sentence><sentence id="681">We...we kept on running; because uh it looked like uh the minute we leave the the ghetto from there, that there's no place left for a Jew to run. </sentence><sentence id="682">They even promised us that that we were going away we can take our tools. </sentence><sentence id="683">We can take machinery with us to establish ourself in the new place. </sentence><sentence id="684">But the question was: What is wrong with this place? </sentence><sentence id="685">Why, why do we have to be a new place? </sentence><sentence id="686">Our...this is not paradise that we are here. </sentence><sentence id="687">They promised us a huge amount of food at the train for three days. </sentence><sentence id="688">Everybody will receive a whole loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="689">This was a treasure. </sentence><sentence id="690">It was like a bait. </sentence><sentence id="691">But still we were...we would like to stay in one place, because one precious thing was left to us--the family was together. </sentence><sentence id="692">And this we felt, it's going to be...the minute we go on the train, we're going to be separated. </sentence><sentence id="693">The men probably will go to work someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="694">We did not imagine anything worse than that, that probably the men will work in one place. </sentence><sentence id="695">The women will work in another place, and the...the youngsters will work someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="696">This alone was frightening for us. </sentence><sentence id="697">And it came to a point uh that they used to hunt there from street to street. </sentence><sentence id="698">And transport was formed every day, and going to the train and sent away. </sentence><sentence id="699">People among us working at those transports, they told us what is going on at the train and how the people are packed in those trains. </sentence><sentence id="700">Unhuman conditions. </sentence><sentence id="701">And the question was: if we were sent to work, to do some work, and that's how you transport people going to work? </sentence><sentence id="702">And it was...it became clear that this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="703">And we used to run as much as we could and hide, to avoid those transport going away. </sentence><sentence id="704">It came to a point when our part of the ghetto was sealed off; and it was no more place to hide and no more strength to run. </sentence><sentence id="705">And if one member of the family gives up, the rest follow. </sentence><sentence id="706">My mother told us she cannot run no more. </sentence><sentence id="707">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="708">She would like to go to the train, and get at least a loaf of bread and go away. </sentence><sentence id="709">Lets happen what's happen. </sentence><sentence id="710"> Then she suggested that maybe I should keep on hiding with my little brother, and she with my sister would go with them. </sentence><sentence id="711">The minute she said that, my kid brother grabbed my mother's hand and start to cry. </sentence><sentence id="712">He said, "No, I'm going with you, too." </sentence><sentence id="713">At that moment we all decided that we shall go together. </sentence><sentence id="714">Either we're going to live together, or we're going to die together. </sentence><sentence id="715">We reported to the train depot. </sentence><sentence id="716">We came there. </sentence><sentence id="717">It was a huge crowd. </sentence><sentence id="718">The boxcars were waiting; and uh German troops, armed guards all around us. </sentence><sentence id="719">Some even had dogs on their leashes. </sentence><sentence id="720">And they divided groups of a hundred...a hundred to each boxcar, and we started to go to train. </sentence><sentence id="721">And sure everybody received a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="722">Two kilo, will be around four pounds of bread. </sentence><sentence id="723">We never had so much bread since the war started. </sentence><sentence id="724">A lot of people started to eat even before they boarded the box car. </sentence><sentence id="725">You know, they start tearing the bread apart and eating. </sentence><sentence id="726">And in an hour when we all were in...in that box car, a hundred of them, he came over-- the one with the dog came over--and looked around, and he took some people from the other group and added to our train; because he felt that we have too much room. </sentence><sentence id="727">And this was in August 1944. </sentence><sentence id="728">It was a very hot day at that time. </sentence><sentence id="729">And after he added the other people, then they put those gates together and we heard that big noise that he locked the boxcar. </sentence><sentence id="730">And there we were in that train, over a hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="731">The only facility in the train was two buckets for over a hundred men, women and children; and the train was standing on one place. </sentence><sentence id="732">It was unbearable hot. </sentence><sentence id="733">Lack of air. </sentence><sentence id="734">So some people had an idea that the minute we start moving, it's going to get cooler.(Cough) But at one moment we heard that the gate opened up in the boxcar, so we thought maybe they changed their mind. </sentence><sentence id="735">They're going to leave us out. </sentence><sentence id="736">But instead, they brought a few dozen Jews discovered in a hiding place; they were all badly beaten up because they were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="737">I remember one young man, all his front teeth were kicked out. </sentence><sentence id="738">And one boy's face was so badly swollen, it was just a nose that we could see--no eyes. </sentence><sentence id="739">And they added to our car. </sentence><sentence id="740">And soon we started to move. </sentence><sentence id="741">It didn't cool off. </sentence><sentence id="742">And at one moment, we heard a young teenage girl crying. </sentence><sentence id="743">She had to go to the buckets in front of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="744">Her mother, her sister tried to shield her with a coat. </sentence><sentence id="745">A man was begging the people around to give a little more room his pregnant wife. </sentence><sentence id="746">Me being among the youngsters, I was asked to climb up those packages, and look out to see where are we going. </sentence><sentence id="747">I start to reading signs. </sentence><sentence id="748">One recognized those names. </sentence><sentence id="749">He said that we are moving south towards Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="750">I also saw some Polish peasants lining the road. </sentence><sentence id="751">They were probably used to those scenes, those trains. </sentence><sentence id="752">Some made signs to us, pointing to the sky. </sentence><sentence id="753">And some went with the fingers across this throat, the throat. </sentence><sentence id="754">I didn't tell the people what I saw; but I mentioned that later on, after the war, to the Polish alderman in Chicago, Mr.Roman [Pochinsky (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="755">And he told me that, "They tried to warn you that you going to be killed, that you should try to run away." </sentence><sentence id="756">Well, I tried to believe that; but the expression on their faces told me something else. </sentence><sentence id="757">It was late at night that we arrived at Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="758">When we came in, the minute the gates [NB: the doors of the train] opened up, we heard screams, barking of dogs, blows from...from those kapos--those officials working for them, over the head. </sentence><sentence id="759">And then we got out of the train, and everything went so fast: left, right, right, left. </sentence><sentence id="760">Men separated from women, children torn from the arms of mothers, the olderly chased like cattle. </sentence><sentence id="761">The sick, the disabled, were handled like packs of garbage. </sentence><sentence id="762">They were thrown in a side together with broken suitcases and with boxes. </sentence><sentence id="763">My mother run over to me and grabbed me by the shoulders, and she told me, "Leibele, I'm  not going to see you no more. </sentence><sentence id="764">Take care of your brother." </sentence><sentence id="765">Well, my brother was twelve, thirteen at that time. </sentence><sentence id="766">Ten minutes later, Mengele, the doctor--I didn't know in that time...I saw a handsome looking gentlemen with white gloves--pointed to my little brother to go to the left. </sentence><sentence id="767">And before I realized, he was gone and I didn't see him no more. </sentence><sentence id="768">I didn't know at the time that I was the lucky one; because when I went into the showers, from the shower heads we got water. </sentence><sentence id="769">Other people got poison gas. </sentence><sentence id="770">But when we came out from the showers, the sky was red. </sentence><sentence id="771">The air was filled with smoke and the odor of burning flesh and...and hair. </sentence><sentence id="772">A man went over to those officials, and he asked one of those officials (ph)--he called them the "kapos"--he asked him about his wife and his little girl. </sentence><sentence id="773">And the man looked him straight in the eye. </sentence><sentence id="774">He said, "There is no more little girl. </sentence><sentence id="775">There was...there is no more wife." </sentence><sentence id="776">He said, "What do you mean? </sentence><sentence id="777">Where they are?" </sentence><sentence id="778">And he pointed to the chimney with that...that smoke bursting out. " </sentence><sentence id="779">That's their funeral. </sentence><sentence id="780">Here they go." </sentence><sentence id="781">Well, the man didn't cry. </sentence><sentence id="782">He didn't scream. </sentence><sentence id="783">He just stood there and stared at that chimney. </sentence><sentence id="784">We all stared at it. </sentence><sentence id="785">We would stay there probably for hours. </sentence><sentence id="786">But we started to be chased into the block, to the barracks where we were marched over. </sentence><sentence id="787">We couldn't even recognize each other. </sentence><sentence id="788">No hair. </sentence><sentence id="789">The hair was shaved off. </sentence><sentence id="790">Dressed in striped uniforms--too small, too big, too large, too short. </sentence><sentence id="791">We all looked like clowns. </sentence><sentence id="792">And then we were welcomed by a speech from one of those kapos. </sentence><sentence id="793">He said, "You saw that sign that "Arbeit Macht Frei"? </sentence><sentence id="794">That means "freedom through labor." </sentence><sentence id="795">He said, "Don't make any mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="796">Nobody needs your labor here. </sentence><sentence id="797">You did not come here to work. </sentence><sentence id="798">You came here to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="799">You're just waiting your turn. </sentence><sentence id="800">And remember I don't have any...I don't have to have a reason to kill you, if I want it. </sentence><sentence id="801">So you better do what you're told." </sentence><sentence id="802">Well, this was the beginning of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="803">Every morning that we went out to be counted, we could feel the crematoriums burning. </sentence><sentence id="804">And that most disgusting odor is the burning of flesh and hair together. </sentence><sentence id="805">I decided to make every effort to do everything I can to go away from Aus... Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="806">Because they were forming transport to go away to labor; because Auschwitz itself was an extermination camp, not a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="807">But for the time being, they...they used to send transport to go for work in labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="808">I didn't succeeded in the beginning, but I... still tried. </sentence><sentence id="809">I still tried. </sentence><sentence id="810">Uh, at one time they asked, "Who knows, who ever worked in road construction?" </sentence><sentence id="811">The minute I run over, and I said, "I did." </sentence><sentence id="812">He said, "Where did you work?" </sentence><sentence id="813">I said, "Outside of _6d_, when they build the highway." </sentence><sentence id="814">I never saw any construction worked at all. </sentence><sentence id="815">So they put a few hundred together, and they put us in a site. </sentence><sentence id="816">So we were in the transport. </sentence><sentence id="817">All the rest start to get the tatoos to stay in Auschwitz, their number. </sentence><sentence id="818">And we were put on a transport; and I went to a labor camp outside in Silesia, in a place called Kaltwasser." </sentence><sentence id="819">Kaltwasser was a labor camp under construction. </sentence><sentence id="820">It was a beautiful area. </sentence><sentence id="821">They were building uh new roads and a small railroad, and that's what we worked. </sentence><sentence id="822">The conditions that time: it was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="823">We didn't have adequate clothes; and starting to get cold in the morning, especially when we stood to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="824">We were freezing. </sentence><sentence id="825">There were no beds in our barracks. </sentence><sentence id="826">They just put uh some straw on the floor, and that how's we slept, in our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="827">And the work was very * Administered by Wiistegiersdorf (subcamp of Gro Rosen). </sentence><sentence id="828">Located at Kreis Glatz, in Lower Silesia. </sentence><sentence id="829">Opened August 1944. </sentence><sentence id="830"> hard. </sentence><sentence id="831">But the....
