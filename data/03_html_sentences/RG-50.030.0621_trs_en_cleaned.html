<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="135">I'd like to introduce Steve Vitto to our conversation, Fanny, and I'd like Steve to explain a little bit about what his job was here, and how it is that the two of you met and interacted. </sentence><sentence id="136">So Steve, tell me a little bit about what you do, and how it is that your -- your path with Fanny's crossed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="140">S: I work in a department that was then called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry. </sentence><sentence id="141">We've since expanded, now we're called the Holocaust Survivors and Victims Resource Center. </sentence><sentence id="142">And my job then and my job now is to ensure that the individual experiences of Holocaust survivors are first recorded in our survivors registry and then made available to people who are asking about them. </sentence><sentence id="143">So I bridge the gap between researching archives, but always interacting with the public in s -- to find   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg deg April 21, 2011 out what happened to an individual and to help ensure that an individual's experience in the Holocaust is recorded in some way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: By recorded, do you mean put in a database, or do you mean that like we're doing an interview with Fanny right now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="151">S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which is survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. </sentence><sentence id="152">So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that's otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me for that information. </sentence><sentence id="153">That's one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="159">S: Well, we work in a registry, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us and they're very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to arrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us in a variety of ways. </sentence><sentence id="160">And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from -- she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several -- working with computers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. </sentence><sentence id="161">And we often get   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg deg April 21, 2011 requests not only for individual information, but information based on place. </sentence><sentence id="162">So for instance, all the people who were from -- in Theresienstadt for instance, concentration camp, or from a particular town, or share a ca -- particular experience, and with our database, we're able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular place. </sentence><sentence id="163">And I had a particular request for people who were -- somebody wanted information from those who were in Theresienstadt, who were registered with us. </sentence><sentence id="164">And Fanny was able to help me to --I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I could filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual. </sentence><sentence id="165">That was one database. </sentence><sentence id="166">The other infor -- information -- the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that's a list of the deportations that took place in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="167">And this particular collection is based on date, date of convoy only. </sentence><sentence id="168">And also, it was producing. </sentence><sentence id="169">It was Belgian, so it was in Belgian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="183">I think in Belgium we have French and Flemish, as -- as languages, so -- S: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: So which language was it, of those two? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="186">S: This is in French, okay, you're right, you're right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: It was in French, okay, sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="190">  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg a April 21, 2011 S: But because of Fanny's background in Belgium, I thought it would be a good fit, and this -- this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that. </sentence><sentence id="191">And before each -- it's divided by convoys, before each name list of those on the convoys is a description of that convoy, and -- in French. </sentence><sentence id="192">And Fanny was able to translate those introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those who were on those transports, but they could also read, in English now, that general description of that transport. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: But cle -- thank you, Steve, because I -- I --I think we needed to get a sense of what was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more happened. </sentence><sentence id="198">This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you. </sentence><sentence id="199">And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f -- that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story. </sentence><sentence id="204">And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. </sentence><sentence id="205">Also, when we got the book from Belgium, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in the trains and how many transport, at the same time the museum got a book called "The Hidden Heroes." </sentence><sentence id="206">That book was written by a German reporter. </sentence><sentence id="207">She is from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="208">She tried to interview peop -- Jewish people in Germany and nobody wanted to give her any information. </sentence><sentence id="209">Somehow, she was so determined, she came to Belgium and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the   Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 underground. </sentence><sentence id="210">The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures right here from that. </sentence><sentence id="211">So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. </sentence><sentence id="212">And that book wasn't selling too well, and they had -- she had to change the title, to "The 20" Transport." </sentence><sentence id="213">And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in Belgium more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. </sentence><sentence id="214">Where in France they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="215">And this is why in Belgium only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can't even find the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium, including my own child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: That's amazing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to help [indecipherable]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: So wou -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: And many of the words from the documents from Belgium, I did not know because I didn't learn English of those documents. </sentence><sentence id="237">So Steven would -- made sure I have a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 to know. </sentence><sentence id="238">Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second floor, you just seen people running back and forth, specially young students. </sentence><sentence id="239">So we really -- my job really was, can we help you? </sentence><sentence id="240">And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in France, with the picture from the room where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="241">And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you?Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer. </sentence><sentence id="242">And he had a copy of the picture and the name of the newspaper he was representing. </sentence><sentence id="243">So immediately if not sooner, Steven was able, through the computer, to get the -- all the information, which he typed for him to take. </sentence><sentence id="244">So he didn't have to go to so many places, because he was originally in the right place. </sentence><sentence id="245">So you see, you never know the contact you have with Steven in that particular place, because he knows the answers to everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: Well, it -- to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my mind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it had to do with the Belgian underground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Youre right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and through your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Exactly, you're right. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="265">  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="266"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg 8 April 21, 2011 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: And is -- and is that what made it more comfortable for you to now speak? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Oh, more than just comfortable, because I had the hard time when we came to America and I was still young, nobody from the family wanted to hear any of our stories, because they were afraid they gonna have a headache. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: That must have been -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable -- there's another word which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so unbelievable, which I haven't done to such extent. </sentence><sentence id="272">Because this was always bottle up and still is, to many extent. [ </sentence><sentence id="273">indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the same thing, thanks to Steven. </sentence><sentence id="274">He made sure that I would be speaking up. </sentence><sentence id="275">He said, if you don't do it now, when you gonna do it? </sentence><sentence id="276">And I know I'm old, so I had to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="283">But it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives, have been able to have such a wonderful relationship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Steve? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things and I'm very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="288">So that's why I say -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Steve, we're putting you on the spot all right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: No, I'm not. </sentence><sentence id="291">He knows I'm not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they've gone by, what you've learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between you about her story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="302">S: Oh my God. </sentence><sentence id="303">Well, the first thing I wanted to say is I br-- I wanted to push Fanny, because we did develop this personal relationship and I'm very fortunate in my job that I'm able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os -- really special. </sentence><sentence id="304">And again, one of my profe -- jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered. </sentence><sentence id="305">And so, while we had great conversations, I didn't want it to end there. </sentence><sentence id="306">I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story. </sentence><sentence id="307">I always get her -- want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="308">And so in this way, it's sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. </sentence><sentence id="309">She has so many things to teach about -- I guess mainly for me is overcoming. </sentence><sentence id="310">Someone who's been through so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what she went through. </sentence><sentence id="311">And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that. </sentence><sentence id="312">You go through so many things and sometimes there's no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass. </sentence><sentence id="313">And you're affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="314">And Fanny was   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg (r) April 21, 2011 able to do that. </sentence><sentence id="315">So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. </sentence><sentence id="316">And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations later, there's a beautiful 12 year old girl that's a friend of my son's actually. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I see that if it wasn't for Fanny just persevering and going on, that's -- if it wasn't for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn't able to later on in her life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="336">Thank you very much. </sentence><sentence id="337">And we're going to continue now with let's say, the usual part of our oral history. </sentence><sentence id="338">But I thought it was very important -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: I think so. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: -- that we -- that we would be able to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Because -- I'll you why I feel it's so important. </sentence><sentence id="342">It's very difficult in this time and age, with technology that's so advanced, to such extent you have little ones with the -- the computers, the cell phone, just name it and it's growing bigger and bigger, that people still could have a personal relationship, and feel good about themself, that they have somebody else who could understand their feelings or what they're saying. </sentence><sentence id="343">Another problem I had is because of the things I went through, I always felt --and this is still with me today, because it took me 50 years to be able to talk about   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="347"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg 6 April 21, 2011 it, and I still have a feeling of inferiority, that I'm not like other people, which "m not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Because you suffered? </sentence><sentence id="350">Because you went through these things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: As if they're -- you suffered because of something you had done, and that's -- that suffering made you less of a person rather than more of a person? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="358">This is because what has been done to me. </sentence><sentence id="359">You see, at the museum here, I am the only person who went through medical experimentation. </sentence><sentence id="360">I'm the only volunteer survivor who was already married and had a child at the time. </sentence><sentence id="361">So I had the responsibility, which is so difficult to make other people understand. </sentence><sentence id="362">This is why when I speak to an audience here, and when you feel the reaction of the people, like you did when you heard me talk -- you know somehow it's like a soothing medicine, or like somebody pats you on the shoulder and said you okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: Well, from -- from what Steve said, not only you're okay, but you inspired others and were able to form a family that now, and that effect of -- of your decisions is felt four generations later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Mm-hm, he's right, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="372">It's true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
