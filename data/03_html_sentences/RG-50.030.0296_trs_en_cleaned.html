<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: So you said that the Soviets came in and the world fell apart? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="155">The strange thing at that time -- it was June 28, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="156">That is when the Soviets marched in. </sentence><sentence id="157">And, you know, during the day and in the early part of the evening, it was fantastic what kind of concerts they gave. </sentence><sentence id="158">What kind of excitement they managed to bring out in the people and nobody would have believed that a few days later, during the night, they came and people disappeared in the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="159">And at that time we didn't know where they were taken. </sentence><sentence id="160">And it so happened that in the town in which we lived we had a very beautiful house. </sentence><sentence id="161">Probably the best house in town and we were very wealthy and that was very much against us. </sentence><sentence id="162">I didn't even realize it at that time because I was friends with all kinds of children, never thinking about these things. </sentence><sentence id="163">But, immediately there were people who wanted this house and they moved in and then one night three uniformed men came in the Russian uniform of what was called NK VD, which is now called MVD or KGB.They rang the doorbell. </sentence><sentence id="164">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="165">They searched our house. </sentence><sentence id="166">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="167">My stepfather, my mother, my grandmother and I were made to sit in the corner and I noticed how this one -- after they had turned the house upside down -- this one of them said "hey look there" while he was pulling out a handkerchief and blowing his nose and I saw how he dropped something, and at the same moment he said "look here what they have" and it was either a five or a ten dollar bill. </sentence><sentence id="168">It was the first time in my life that I saw a dollar bill. </sentence><sentence id="169">But I didn't know the implication of this. </sentence><sentence id="170">I was going to say "you dropped this from your pocket" but I couldn't because the next thing all three of them came up to my father and said "you just have to come with us. </sentence><sentence id="171">We found foreign currency in your house. </sentence><sentence id="172">You just have to sign a paper and you will come home." </sentence><sentence id="173">We never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="174">We don't know what they did to him. </sentence><sentence id="175">I know he was 48 years old at that time and my mother would go every day to some place where many other people stood in line with food to bring their husbands, to whom exactly the same thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="176">And after she went for -- I don't know, three weeks, one day another guard stood there and said "why are you coming here? </sentence><sentence id="177"> Your husband isn't here". </sentence><sentence id="178">She said yes is here. </sentence><sentence id="179">I've been bringing this food for three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="180">If he is not here for a long time? </sentence><sentence id="181">And then one day the head guard called her in and said to her "don't come any more". </sentence><sentence id="182">She said my husband is here. </sentence><sentence id="183">He's not here any more and threw his shoe at her. </sentence><sentence id="184">And he said "here is your husband and don't ask any more questions or you will have the same ending". </sentence><sentence id="185">So we don't know, but I do suspect that they killed him and I don't know where he is buried and I wish I would. </sentence><sentence id="186">This was so traumatic for me. </sentence><sentence id="187">I think it was worse than anything that came afterwards, including the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="188">By the time the Nazis took us into the concentration camp I was so numb inside, I was so dead, I was not able to feel anything. </sentence><sentence id="189">And so when Sam told you about how we met, for me the world had ended and here was this man who had jokingly said "we can get married". </sentence><sentence id="190">That was the farthest from my thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="191">My mother had said "run and go wherever you can and hide." </sentence><sentence id="192">And I was running from our town that evening for about ten hours until I came to this other town. </sentence><sentence id="193">It was very difficult because they had -- what do you call this, at night when you are not allowed to go -- curfew. </sentence><sentence id="194">Well I made it somehow, very tired, exhausted and very sad. </sentence><sentence id="195">And I thought of going to my parents" best friends at whose house I had stayed a whole year until the end of May of that year. </sentence><sentence id="196">I came to their apartment. </sentence><sentence id="197">They opened the door and they wouldn't let me in. </sentence><sentence id="198">And they told me forgive us. </sentence><sentence id="199">But last night, it was an apartment house, next door, there was a raid and they came into the apartment and they found one person in that family who did not have a permit with this particular address and because of that they took her and the entire family and they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="200">And so these people would not let me in. </sentence><sentence id="201">At that moment I had no idea where to go. </sentence><sentence id="202">The only thing that remained was to remember the Philharmonia. </sentence><sentence id="203">That's a building where the conservatory was located where I had studied and where I had finished conservatory about also four weeks before the Russians came. </sentence><sentence id="204">And I went upstairs into a projection room where they also had a movie theater and I fell down on the floor and went to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="205">And when I woke up it was day and I thought if I could find somebody in this office and if they would give me a job as a pianist, as a accompanist, maybe I could simply hide. </sentence><sentence id="206">But I knew they were after me because they were after our family and so I went and I met the man who was in charge and he was just closing up the office. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I said I am looking for a job as an accompanist, as a pianist. </sentence><sentence id="208">He said to me "you look to me like you need a lunch, that's where I am going now". </sentence><sentence id="209">I said no, "please get me a job", but I didn't tell him what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="210">And he said how much money do you have and I said three rubles. </sentence><sentence id="211">That's 75 cents. </sentence><sentence id="212">And he said that's enough. </sentence><sentence id="213">I said enough for what. </sentence><sentence id="214">Enough to get married he said. </sentence><sentence id="215">He said I can see you don't know where you're going to sleep the next night, I can see it in your face. </sentence><sentence id="216">He didn't know my name, he didn't know who I was. </sentence><sentence id="217">So he starts walking in the street and I walked after him and I said please get me that job. </sentence><sentence id="218"> And suddenly he stops and he says "come up here with me". </sentence><sentence id="219">Two flights of steps, very dark, old, dilapidated building, and upstairs is a young girl, about seventeen, and this is supposed to be the Registrar's Office. </sentence><sentence id="220">And so she asks him if he came to get married and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="221">This girl, asks "are you living with another woman?" " </sentence><sentence id="222">No". " </sentence><sentence id="223">Do you have children with another woman?" " </sentence><sentence id="224">No". </sentence><sentence id="225">And she asked me the same thing and every question is an insult in my book because I, I was so properly brought up I didn't even have a date. </sentence><sentence id="226">So when we were ready to sign this little paper she calls over the man who swept the floor in the corner. </sentence><sentence id="227">To this day I don't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="228">And he was the witness who signed and we went downstairs and Sam, my husband, said to me "by the way, what's your name?" </sentence><sentence id="229">And we went back to the Philharmonia and he enrolled me. </sentence><sentence id="230">Gave me a job as an accompanist, pianist, and he said "now no more running around. </sentence><sentence id="231">Five o'clock we meet in front of this building". </sentence><sentence id="232">I don't know what he thought. </sentence><sentence id="233">I didn't know where I would run but he had told me that he has a mother and a sister and an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="234">I didn't believe a word he said to me. </sentence><sentence id="235">I thought of one thing only. </sentence><sentence id="236">Where could I hide. </sentence><sentence id="237">And suddenly I realized that I had changed my name because I married. </sentence><sentence id="238">And my name is no longer the one that these authorities were looking for. </sentence><sentence id="239">So I went with him and when he came into the apartment, I had a big surprise. </sentence><sentence id="240">He did have a mother and he did have a sister and they were wonderful to me. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that was like a miracle somehow. </sentence><sentence id="242">That is the story. </sentence><sentence id="243">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="244">So. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Did you, what happened to your mother after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: A few weeks later - my mother had, in the meantime, also left the home because all these other people who wanted our home moved in and one person who probably had a little bit of heart said to my mother, "you better disappear from here or you will have a bad ending". </sentence></p><p><sentence id="340"> So my mother came into this larger town with her mother-in-law, and they rented a small apartment and they both went to find some job to become a proletarian, and my mother found a job to become a cook in an orphanage and I saw her a few times. </sentence><sentence id="341">I went every morning to this apartment to see her. </sentence><sentence id="342">And one morning I went there and there was a big sign. " </sentence><sentence id="343">This apartment has been confiscated and the inhabitants have been enemies of the people" and so I know that at this moment, my mother and my grandmother had disappeared, but we didn't know where. </sentence><sentence id="344">Now a long time later we found out -- not even so long, because in three nights 35,000 people had the same fate, and they were brought to an end station outside of the town into cattle cars, and when they were filled they were, left the area and nobody where to. </sentence><sentence id="345">But many, many years later we found out that they were taken to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="346">And my mother was 17 years in Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="347">My grandmother died immediately, one or two days in the transport. </sentence><sentence id="348">And it's strange because my grandmother was only 73 and at that time my mother was 48. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Did your mother come back from Siberia? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: We found her in the most difficult manner. </sentence><sentence id="351">We, after we went through hell and came to this country -- actually first to Columbia, South America where my mother had a brother -- then we came here and my uncle, my mother's brother, found -- one day he received a letter by a lady, Mrs. Weisselberger (ph), who was in Siberia and roomed together with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="352">And there was a moment in the Soviet's time under Khrushchev when he decided -- you know, you remember that he stood up and said how what a monster Stalin had been -- and Khrushchev had then permitted people over 65 if they had close relatives in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="353">And if these relatives sent an invitation to them, an obligated themselves to take care of them, he would permit them to come out. </sentence><sentence id="354">And this Mrs. Weisselberger who, by the way, was the widow of the, of the greatest Zionist in Czernowitz, and he was one of the first the Soviets did away with, and afterwards Mrs. Weissenberger was also taken to Siberia as the wife of the enemy of the people, and my mother had given Mrs. Weissenberger a photo that was taken in Siberia and on the back of it had written the address of her brother in South America because she didn't know what had happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="355">And so, when, when, he received this note he sent it to us. </sentence><sentence id="356">That's how we found her. </sentence><sentence id="357">End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: You were telling us about finding your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: As soon as we got this letter, and we lived in Minnesota and were already very successful as musicians, and well known. </sentence><sentence id="369">We knew Senator Humphry who was at that time the senator of Minnesota, and we got in touch with him and he said he'd do whatever he could to see whether he could get her out. </sentence><sentence id="370">And after some time he said "sorry, the Soviets say they don't have such a person". </sentence><sentence id="371">Then some more time went by and we approached the other senator from Minnesota, Senator Phye. </sentence><sentence id="372">He said he would try. </sentence><sentence id="373">And this was maybe a year later and at that time the Soviets said "yes, there is such a person". </sentence><sentence id="374">They would, would, let her out if somebody, some relative in Israel, would ask for her. </sentence><sentence id="375">She didn't have any relatives in Israel but Sam had an uncle. </sentence><sentence id="376">He wrote to him and this uncle, who had never set eyes on my mother, had filled out some papers and she was finally permitted to go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="377">But I have to tell you that this, from the moment we had this first notification that she had survived and until she came to Israel, was eight years. </sentence><sentence id="378">So after she arrived in Israel we did whatever we could and we brought her to the United States and I saw her again and we were like two complete strangers. </sentence><sentence id="379">She was so different. </sentence><sentence id="380">She was so hard -- so, so aloof. </sentence><sentence id="381">I can't even describe it and there was nothing much I could do. </sentence><sentence id="382">I wanted very much to ask her to talk and she couldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="383">Finally I got it out of her. </sentence><sentence id="384">One day I got very angry and I said "please, tell me what has happened; can't you tell me?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: She started talking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="405">And she finally said to me that she had undergone some hypnosis and they had told her -- "you want to see your daughter again, you want to see your son-in-law again, you want to see your brother again, then you have to forget everything that happened to you". </sentence><sentence id="406">She didn't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="407">She promised she would forget. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: OK, so you said that living under the Soviets was really horrible? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Horrible. </sentence><sentence id="415">And they said to me and to others, "you can never run away from us. </sentence><sentence id="416">We find you everywhere". </sentence><sentence id="417">You know, that sits so deep in me. </sentence><sentence id="418">I can't get over it. </sentence><sentence id="419">I simply can't get over it. </sentence><sentence id="420">So. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="428">Q: Do you remember the things you saw, under the Soviet occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: You never saw anything because they did everything very, very smoothly. </sentence><sentence id="431">Behind closed  doors. </sentence><sentence id="432">You never saw anything. </sentence><sentence id="433">You only knew that people disappeared, and when, by chance, you found them like I found my mother, I couldn't get a word our of her to her dying day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="438">Q: So what happened, the Germans marched in? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: Were you married then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="449">At that time I was already married. </sentence><sentence id="450">And the first thing that I remember is that they came and took all the men. </sentence><sentence id="451">Not the women. </sentence><sentence id="452">All the men from our building and from the whole street and marched them, I think by foot, and we didn't know where they were taking them. </sentence><sentence id="453">Then we found out. </sentence><sentence id="454">There was a big building that they, the Russians had called Palace of Culture and that same building, under the Germans, was used for certain purposes. </sentence><sentence id="455">They took those men -- these were all Jewish people -- and the rumor went that they took them to shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="456">And I knew at the moment that I will never see Sam again. </sentence><sentence id="457">And somehow it was very, very difficult to accept. </sentence><sentence id="458">But all of a sudden, some hours later, I saw him running down the street and I thought that I was having a vision -- that I was imagining. </sentence><sentence id="459">But he did come and he said that they had put them up to count one-two-three, one-two- three. </sentence><sentence id="460">Every one was taken to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="461">And he was not one, but they took him and many others to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="462">So they marched them down to a place near the river and they forced those that they had not shot to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="463">And Sam managed, knowing the area very well, managed to somehow to jump out of the line and, through certain side streets, he was out of there and he came home. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="751">A: I don't know very much. </sentence><sentence id="752">I think once a day it was permitted for certain people only - not everybody - to go down to the river on the bottom of this carara (ph) was a little stream, very little stream. </sentence><sentence id="753">The natives who lived in the area came with whatever they had to, to offer, to sell, to barter, a piece of butter or a piece of bread, or a piece of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="754">The women usually were hiding them in their bosom. </sentence><sentence id="755">And they stood on one side of that stream and the inmates of our group stood on the other side and were showing what they had to barter. </sentence><sentence id="756">One had a blouse or one was offering maybe a pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="757">Anything for just a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="758">And then, if that person on the other side pointed at this blouse, yes, that's what I want and I have a piece of bread, then they come a step closer into the water and they exchange this. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="961">Q: When were you liberated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: We were "liberated" in I'd say 1944. </sentence><sentence id="964">But very early in the year. </sentence><sentence id="965">I would say we began to hear noises like cannons -- I think it was January or February -- and I said to Sam "now the front is getting so close, now they will kill us all." </sentence><sentence id="966">Because it was well known that the Germans, when they retreated, they set a whole thing on fire and they killed everybody in the camps and in the ghettos. </sentence><sentence id="967">And I said "it's unbelievable that we have survived until now and now we're going to die", and you know, this was January, February, no tree to hide in. </sentence><sentence id="968">At least in the summer the trees have leaves, you know, no tree to hide in. </sentence><sentence id="969">None of the native Ukrainians wanted to hide us. </sentence><sentence id="970">They would not risk their life, you know. </sentence><sentence id="971">And I said, "Sam, what are we going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="972">and I got so vehement and so excited that I banged with my foot on the floor in that room in which we lived, and suddenly as I banged, I heard a hollow noise as though it was empty underneath and I said, "Sam, did you hear what I just heard? </sentence><sentence id="973">It seems to me that there is nothing underneath. </sentence><sentence id="974">Maybe we could hide there." </sentence><sentence id="975">And we had a neighbor who  7 was an engineer, Rosenfeld, and he was the kind of man -- what his job was, he went also out of the ghetto in the morning, worked for, for the hospital, but he fixed radios. </sentence><sentence id="976">So he was the one who radios all day long and came home and told us all the news that went on in the outside world, which was amazing because we never had a paper or anything or a radio. </sentence><sentence id="977">So we told Rosenfeld -- I told him -- we are going to have to hide if we want to survive and nobody will take us in. </sentence><sentence id="978">Could we try and see if we could hide right in our room, I have heard a hollow sound. </sentence><sentence id="979">And he just had a smile but he humored me and he came into our room and he tried and he said "you are right". </sentence><sentence id="980">So he brought -- where he got this, I don't know -- a saw. </sentence><sentence id="981">Now these were, these were floors in the old fashioned kind, you know, long boards. </sentence><sentence id="982">And so he was sawing one board here and then two later, like this. </sentence><sentence id="983">Finally he made an opening and we did find an opening down there which was very raw and nothing in there, and everybody who was in our area knew about it and laughed about us. </sentence><sentence id="984">They thought that I was crazy, out of my mind. </sentence><sentence id="985">And when the day came and they, the shootings, came closer and closer, we had amassed a lot of straw which we had brought into our room and since about 18 people knew about this crazy idea, these 18 people came and went downstairs with us and we thought it would be an hour or two or three. </sentence><sentence id="986">Well, they kept coming and coming and before we knew it, we were standing one next to the other and how many were we -- 68 people down there. </sentence><sentence id="987">We closed this thing and had all this straw on top and all of a sudden -- now this was already night -- all of a sudden we heard footsteps on top of us. </sentence><sentence id="988">We knew that the Germans were running away but we heard footsteps directly above us and we recognized by their marching, by their walking, that these were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="989">What had happened -- they had chosen that room to stay over night because they didn't see anybody there and there was a lot of straw there, and we sat there underneath, 68 people not daring to breathe or cough or anything, and the next morning they left. </sentence><sentence id="990">And then we began to, to smell smoke. </sentence><sentence id="991">And we knew that they had put some buildings on fire and someone in our group of 68 people -- a woman started yelling, "I don't want to die, to suffocate here. </sentence><sentence id="992">I want out. </sentence><sentence id="993">I want out." </sentence><sentence id="994">So by that time we opened the thing and the Germans were gone. </sentence><sentence id="995">We came out. </sentence><sentence id="996">We were green and white as a sheet and we saw in front of us three young Russian boys with very long coats and with rifles and we asked them "who are you" and they said "nastuyahschi (ph), Russki partisani (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="997">We are the real Russian partisans. </sentence><sentence id="998">And they said to us "and who are you" and we tried to explain to them. </sentence><sentence id="999">They didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1000">That's how we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They we could dream only of going home. </sentence><sentence id="1002">That's a very different story. </sentence><sentence id="1003">We couldn't get home until a few days later because we found a truck driver who wanted vodka and then he gave him the vodka and he took us up to a forrest and dropped us down there and said "that's enough for you." </sentence><sentence id="1004">And then --  8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
