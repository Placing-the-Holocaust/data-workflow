Let me ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="174">When you say the City was becoming more terrorized, what was happening on the streets?A. That's a good question. </sentence><sentence id="175">The Germans came in shortly before - that's a good question -- shortly before Rosh Hoshana. </sentence><sentence id="176">The Jewish New Year. </sentence><sentence id="177">Before the war started, already feeling that it was coming, we were digging on order of the government, we had to dig shelters in the street against bomb attacks. </sentence><sentence id="178">Let me say something, yet better. </sentence><sentence id="179">Before they came in, big announcements were hung out, what do you call these announcements on walls?Q. Posters?A. Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="180">That it is not true the rumors that you're hearing about the atrocities about the German Army and the Germans is not true. </sentence><sentence id="181">Come out when you see the German Army when they come marching in, and greet them. </sentence><sentence id="182">You hear that? </sentence><sentence id="183">And everything was going fine and smooth. </sentence><sentence id="184">We have seen an Army that we didn't even imagine exists because the Polish Army was a thousand years behind with little horse and buggies. </sentence><sentence id="185">Here at once you see a motorized, not one horse, everything in tanks and on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="186">We went out in the main street and nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="187">That lasted only a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="188">Then they started grabbing Jews and burying them in the shelters. </sentence><sentence id="189">That's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="190">Q. They shot the Jews?A. No, they didn't need to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="191">If he wanted, he could shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="192">They didn't make a big tsimmes, a big deal about how you died. </sentence><sentence id="193">They wanted you to die the most miserable way. </sentence><sentence id="194">So, throwing you into a mass shelter like that and covering you up, to them that was a very befitting way to doing it to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="195">Anyway, we decided to escape to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="196">Escaping to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="197">How do you escape to Warsaw? </sentence><sentence id="198">Do you buy a ticket on the plane or on the train. </sentence><sentence id="199">Do you take your car from the garage? </sentence><sentence id="200">There was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="201">Number one, we were immediately forbidden to use public transportation. </sentence><sentence id="202">Anyway, it was still the beginning and there was still some horse and buggies and imagine when I think of it now, that by horse and buggy and the winter got tough, like in spite, very cold and a baby also with us, and we made it finally to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="203">It's easier said than done. </sentence><sentence id="204">So, now to describe the terror that happened in these few weeks is as  impossible as to describe the whole thing, because when you're talking about terror, is not only that something happened. </sentence><sentence id="205">Say, somebody gets killed by a car. </sentence><sentence id="206">Somebody gets killed by a brick falling down. </sentence><sentence id="207">That's a tragedy, but that's not terror. </sentence><sentence id="208">That's why I don't call myself a survivor and I already was talking with our organization. </sentence><sentence id="209">I'm not big mixer, I don't push. </sentence><sentence id="210">We're not survivors, we are victims. </sentence><sentence id="211">Because a survivor is one who gets hurt by    any means and then he gets revived and if the other person or realtor has any type of insurance which they do, they will be made good for. </sentence><sentence id="212">They'll take him to a hospital, and if he's lucky he'll come back as a survived person. </sentence><sentence id="213">We are not survivers. </sentence><sentence id="214">We suffered day and night. </sentence><sentence id="215">Because why did my wife have to have a dream fifty years later that they take the children and it's cold outside and they don't have socks on. </sentence><sentence id="216">This is not one occasion. </sentence><sentence id="217">If it's a funeral, a bar mitzvah, a wedding, a card game a restaurant and we were this week twice, that this thing does not come up amongst us. </sentence><sentence id="218">I don't know if you did realize it. </sentence><sentence id="219">This is why my neighbor Mary once said to me, "Sol, why don't you start living a normal life? </sentence><sentence id="220">Get it out of your mind." </sentence><sentence id="221">Easy said. </sentence><sentence id="222">Get it out of your mind. </sentence><sentence id="223">I wish it could. </sentence><sentence id="224">There is not a day, if more than once a day, if we go to sleep, if we go to eat, if we meet for a game, if we go for a walk, always comes up. </sentence><sentence id="225">This was -- it cannot be told. </sentence><sentence id="226">It cannot be told. </sentence><sentence id="227">As my teacher said, he cannot find expression in the dictionaries of the languages. </sentence><sentence id="228">You can see that we can go on and on forever. </sentence><sentence id="229">If you need to go home to sleep, you will not. </sentence><sentence id="230">So, ask me questions which will lead me in, otherwise I get lost in it. </sentence><sentence id="231">Q. You made your way to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="232">Did you go directly there?A. Oh, you got me back on track. </sentence><sentence id="233">So, we made our way to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="234">Father, six of his sons, no, five of his sons. </sentence><sentence id="235">One of our brothers died before the war. </sentence><sentence id="236">Five sons, his only grandchild which was the light in his eye. </sentence><sentence id="237">She was only a few weeks old, our first grandchild. </sentence><sentence id="238">My brother- in-law did not come along because he had a big business to take care of. </sentence><sentence id="239">He was a big businessman. </sentence><sentence id="240">I'll tell you how he died. </sentence><sentence id="241">He was thrown out of a hospital window by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="242">We will get to that. </sentence><sentence id="243">Now, we are in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="244">Q. You went directly there? </sentence><sentence id="245">You didn't stay --?A. You don't go so directly by horse and buggy to Warsaw, you know. </sentence><sentence id="246">We stopped over in different places to sleep over and we slept on the street and we slept in Konushki(?) </sentence><sentence id="247">on city not so far. </sentence><sentence id="248">The rabbi of Konushki(?), </sentence><sentence id="249">his son rather, opened his house for the escapees, and we slept on the floor, masses of us. </sentence><sentence id="250">When I say we made it to Warsaw, it wasn't the same day. </sentence><sentence id="251">The locomotives didn't say, hey we're in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="252">No, so, we got to Warsaw, now we are homeless. </sentence><sentence id="253">A whole homeless family. </sentence><sentence id="254">There were no brokers or realtors to contact before or anybody provide me a roof over my head. </sentence><sentence id="255">But somehow, Father had plenty of money, he got an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="256">It happened to be by coincidence the apartment was placed right across the street from the so called Pawiak. </sentence><sentence id="257">Pawiak was the most famous prison in Poland or in Warsaw where the first Marshal Pilsudski was imprisoned by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="258">By coincidence the building was right across the street from there. </sentence><sentence id="259">So, we located ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="260">I'll tell you a little story about this as a side piece that happened in Hollywood between me and a Jew from Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="261">Anyway, so my sister became the housekeeper. </sentence><sentence id="262">She never did that before. </sentence><sentence id="263">She was just married. </sentence><sentence id="264">She had housekeepers. </sentence><sentence id="265">She had everything. </sentence><sentence id="266">She didn't even know how to make a glass of tea, like any young woman. </sentence><sentence id="267">After a while my father says what did we achieve. </sentence><sentence id="268">Where is Mother? </sentence><sentence id="269">We escaped to save our skin and we don't even know where Mother is. </sentence><sentence id="270">And here again he appointed that my oldest brother, who passed away last year, and me to go back to Lodz to look for Mother. </sentence><sentence id="271">Q. I just want to ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="272">First of all, how long were you in Warsaw about?A. A few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="273">Q. Were the conditions any better there?A. Just ask everything. </sentence><sentence id="274">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="275">You did not feel the Germans on top of you. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was still reigned by a Polish puppet government, because as I said before Lodz was the Reich. </sentence><sentence id="277">Hitler reigned already that while the other was protected, Protectorate they called it, occupied territory. </sentence><sentence id="278">The administration was so to say, not German. </sentence><sentence id="279">That would be wrong, not Polish, but not German. </sentence><sentence id="280">Not like in Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="281">We were able to go in the street and there was a curfew, that already didn't scare us, but we were not -- it was bad. </sentence><sentence id="282">We knew we were in trouble, but when you're homeless, you're already a displaced person in the worst way, and you are an illegal being. </sentence><sentence id="283">You don't belong to this world. </sentence><sentence id="284">God didn't mean you to be existing here. </sentence><sentence id="285">The sentence, we felt the sentence already. </sentence><sentence id="286">So, now me and my brother were delegated by Father. </sentence><sentence id="287">Now, in the meantime it gets cold. </sentence><sentence id="288">We are getting into the deep winter and Poland is very cold in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="289">The climate is different. </sentence><sentence id="290">It's a gorgeous climate, but it's very cold and lots of snow. </sentence><sentence id="291">How do you get back? </sentence><sentence id="292">You cannot go by train. </sentence><sentence id="293">You cannot go by public transportation. </sentence><sentence id="294">You're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="295">Nothing is for you. </sentence><sentence id="296">We couldn't find the horse that brought us here. </sentence><sentence id="297">The guy who did it, but there was a pole already available, you know these things develop like black marketing, who bought tickets. </sentence><sentence id="298">In other words he would go to the station and buy a train ticket, two train tickets for us. </sentence><sentence id="299">It seems that now we're fine. </sentence><sentence id="300">We have tickets, all right, but we are still Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="301">The tickets don't say that we're not Jewish, so we are taking a tremendous chance. </sentence><sentence id="302">At least we can get into the train now, but the train is only with Germans and Poles. </sentence><sentence id="303">Not only Germans, and a Jew to be in this, it's illegal. </sentence><sentence id="304">They don't have to sentence you, they can just shoot you or kick you out while the train runs. </sentence><sentence id="305">It was a long voyage, and we made it home, and to describe how it was, at one station they recognized us and they chased us, me and my brother, but I was then 17 and my brother was 23, no 27. </sentence><sentence id="306">He was ten years older than me, my oldest brother. </sentence><sentence id="307">So, we were younger, and I will never understand in Hebrew they say Yad Elokim in  Hebrew, that means God's hand must have been watching over us. </sentence><sentence id="308">The Germans were chasing us across the railroad tracks in deep snow with German Shepherds and they didn't catch us. </sentence><sentence id="309">End of Tape 1 Tape 2 A. We were trying to make our way back to the city of Lodz in search of our mother. </sentence><sentence id="310">We still do not (know what) happen(ed) to her, where she is. </sentence><sentence id="311">One of our brothers which I probably did not inject before, remained behind. </sentence><sentence id="312">My father would not take everybody. </sentence><sentence id="313">He remained behind just in case to be with Mother or for Mother. </sentence><sentence id="314">So, we finally made it there, me and my older brother. </sentence><sentence id="315">It took days and nights. </sentence><sentence id="316">We came there so to say, finally, safely. </sentence><sentence id="317">Our other brother was there. </sentence><sentence id="318">By during that time he was able to find out for money through people like in that particular prison who would bring out information. </sentence><sentence id="319">You know, everything is money. </sentence><sentence id="320">Also, he was able then that he knew already to send in a little food to mother. </sentence><sentence id="321">He found out that mother was in prison without a sentence and was already three months and there she was, but at least we know that she is in prison. </sentence><sentence id="322">Remember I said before it's still cold winter. </sentence><sentence id="323">She had no set sentence. </sentence><sentence id="324">We didn't know that she's coming home at a certain date where we can go there and receive her. </sentence><sentence id="325">So, again, me, being that I was the best German speaker in the house or learned German in school -- and also because of my age. </sentence><sentence id="326">We also had still that we lured ourselves with the impression that they wouldn't hurt a woman or they wouldn't hurt the young boy. </sentence><sentence id="327">They're just out for the real Jews. </sentence><sentence id="328">So, I was the one who every morning went in front of the prison across the street from the prison. </sentence><sentence id="329">The city was almost already clean of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="330">I stood there. </sentence><sentence id="331">I asked myself very often, I wore a coat, I wore a hat, maybe it was earmuffs or the earmuffs came from the hat, how I lasted a whole freezing day, day in and day out with my eyes glued on the main door, the gate of the prison hoping that Mother will come out. </sentence><sentence id="332">If we knew the sentence, we would only have to go there or wait until she comes. </sentence><sentence id="333">We didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="334">This took maybe a month or six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="335">I really don't know, but day after day. </sentence><sentence id="336">Nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="337">God forbid, not a little warm coffee or water because the surroundings was already German. </sentence><sentence id="338">| didn't have a chance to go to a door and knock and say give me a drink of water or maybe hot coffee. </sentence><sentence id="339">How I survived it, just like most of the things are unexplainable and one day me standing there like an idiot watching if Mommy comes out, I come home Mommy is home. </sentence><sentence id="340">They let her out the back door. </sentence><sentence id="341">Half of her was left, maybe less. </sentence><sentence id="342">Three months. </sentence><sentence id="343">Now you remember why she was there. </sentence><sentence id="344">She went with the receipt to be paid for what they confiscated all our businesses. </sentence><sentence id="345">So instead of that, they stuck her in prison without a sentence. </sentence><sentence id="346">Finally, we had Mother. </sentence><sentence id="347">So now, the family is divided. </sentence><sentence id="348">Three of us, me, my brother and the one that was left behind to wait for mother and Mother are here. </sentence><sentence id="349">Father and the rest of the family are there. </sentence><sentence id="350">How do you bring this thing together now. </sentence><sentence id="351">Where is it better to be? </sentence><sentence id="352">Should we go there? </sentence><sentence id="353">Should they come here. </sentence><sentence id="354">The first decision was that we should try to get Father back to Mother. </sentence><sentence id="355">To go into detail how you accomplish a thing like that will be just -- I lack sometimes the expressions, getting into formalities. </sentence><sentence id="356">We got Father back, by horse and buggy somehow through payments, through monies, through smuggling. </sentence><sentence id="357">You had to smuggle from Warsaw to Lodz, because it was a border already. </sentence><sentence id="358">The border was in Kolushki. </sentence><sentence id="359">So, finally, the family is getting to be together. </sentence><sentence id="360">Father is back, but the other two brothers, the sister and the baby, remained in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="361">We're talking not still about 1940. </sentence><sentence id="362">This is 1940 because Mother went with this receipt in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="363">She came out it was already 1940, the very beginning of it, the winter of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="364">So, part of the family remains stuck there and we are stuck here. </sentence><sentence id="365">We never heard of them again. </sentence><sentence id="366">The only thing that came through was this picture once in the mail, in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="367">So, we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="368">That was the last sign of their life. </sentence><sentence id="369">Q. This is a picture of your brother?A. Of my brother, yes. </sentence><sentence id="370">This is my brother. </sentence><sentence id="371">We were like twins, because we were the two youngest in the family. </sentence><sentence id="372">Show it please. </sentence><sentence id="373">Show my brother. </sentence><sentence id="374">But let me tell you the story of the picture. </sentence><sentence id="375">See, if he can get the piece -- you see that. </sentence><sentence id="376">Should I tell the story of the picture?Q. Well, I think you should continue on with the story?A. So, now we are in Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="377">It was not yet a Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="378">It was not yet a Ghetto, and the other part of the family is in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="379">Q. Could you communicate?A. In the beginning there was mail. </sentence><sentence id="380">No telephone, no thing like that. </sentence><sentence id="381">There was mail for a while, yes, that's how this arrived. </sentence><sentence id="382">For a very short time there was a normal mail connection. </sentence><sentence id="383">No other connection. </sentence><sentence id="384">Good question. </sentence><sentence id="385">As I said, I promised to tell the truth so instead of saying there was no mail, there was mail, quite a long time. </sentence><sentence id="386">Where are we now? </sentence><sentence id="387">What do you want to know?Q. Your father and part of your family returned to Lodz?A. So, now Lodz started developing and developing and setting in motion the Ghetto, in "41.In "40 it was closed. </sentence><sentence id="388">They started in "40, but when the fences were created and the Ghetto was locked that was "41. </sentence><sentence id="389">And if I'm a little off on the dates, you'll have to forgive me because I didn't have a calendar. </sentence><sentence id="390">I didn't like today do everything on a calendar and I didn't write a diary. </sentence><sentence id="391">So, dates might be -- not might be, will be, not correct. </sentence><sentence id="392">At the time we still had three of them there, and then one returned. </sentence><sentence id="393">His son, who is the lawyer now, through him I got to write this to the museum to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="394">Two lives start, there are there and we are here and somehow it was considered a plus rather than a minus because the family is divided. </sentence><sentence id="395">If one wouldn't survive, if Lodz will not survive, Warsaw will survive. </sentence><sentence id="396">Because we could have reunited ourselves by the very primitive ways of communication as Father came as my other brother came. </sentence><sentence id="397">All of the rest could have come, too, but it was more logical to  have it divided. </sentence><sentence id="398">You remember in the Bible when Jacob divided his riches so if he's caught by his brother Esau they all shouldn't get lost. </sentence><sentence id="399">That's how we did it. </sentence><sentence id="400">Father decided to already have an apartment there. </sentence><sentence id="401">Sister was the houselady, the baby was growing. </sentence><sentence id="402">God knows how old the baby was when it disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="403">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="404">That's how the situation is now, or established itself to that. </sentence><sentence id="405">We were here and they were there. </sentence><sentence id="406">Until the Ghetto started closing, and all the new chapter of living in a Ghetto, seeing the creation of it and all true to life in the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="407">Q. Can you tell me how your daily life was. </sentence><sentence id="408">How things --?A. Daily life in Ghetto depending on what the Germans had in store for us. </sentence><sentence id="409">Q. I'm sorry, first of all tell me how you got to the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="410">Were you in the same neighborhood?A. We happened to live -- and I answered it to you before, in the Jewish neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="411">The very Jewish neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="412">As a matter of fact, I have there a picture of the synagogue which was destroyed which was on our street. </sentence><sentence id="413">The Germans dynamited the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="414">The night that I was sleeping in my sister's house when she still had her apartment, that's how early they did it. </sentence><sentence id="415">They laid around dynamite for days or weeks because a little before that, they dynamited the Polish heroes monument, you call it Kosciusko, and then they drove over with a tank and they put a chain on his neck and they pulled him down. </sentence><sentence id="416">Then they destroyed the synagogue, and why to hell they needed an excuse, they needed excuses for nothing, they said because the Jews destroyed the monument of Kosciusko, so the Poles dynamited in revenge the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="417">Ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="418">So, then they started forming the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="419">They just chased section by section into the territory, and you had to find yourself a place where to get into. </sentence><sentence id="420">In other words, we took in two families. </sentence><sentence id="421">Apartments at home weren't as big as here. </sentence><sentence id="422">Ours was a two bedroom apartment. </sentence><sentence id="423">By today's standard, it would be one bedroom and one big salon, what you called with beautiful furniture, in case like ours, because we were on the well to do side. </sentence><sentence id="424">Now, every room was a room for another family to live. </sentence><sentence id="425">So, we got all squeezed in. </sentence><sentence id="426">The Ghetto became an Arbeitslager so to say. </sentence><sentence id="427">It's the best I can describe it. </sentence><sentence id="428">Not a complete concentration camp, which actually it is recognized as because it has fence. </sentence><sentence id="429">It was high fence all around with guards. </sentence><sentence id="430">The signs, where they had the few gates of entries, I don't know if anybody ever told you that what the sign said "Wohngebiet der Juden", (it) means that's where the Jews live, "Betreten verboten", it's forbidden to get in. " </sentence><sentence id="431">Seuchengefahr", it's danger of the plague. </sentence><sentence id="432">Those were the signs. </sentence><sentence id="433">So, we start forming factories of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="434">My brother in law which I mentioned before, was one of the top millinery producers before the war. </sentence><sentence id="435">The whole family. </sentence><sentence id="436">So, he founded we called a resort, a factory, a place to work. </sentence><sentence id="437">We had 500 people working. </sentence><sentence id="438">We made 02:12:)) flour -- all for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="439">In other words, everyday German trucks would come into the Ghetto and pick up productions of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="440">Shoes, clothing, even uniforms, military uniforms -- and here I'll tell you right away with connection my brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="441">So, that's why I worked in a millinery shop which had 500 women and men working. </sentence><sentence id="442">We made the most beautiful things for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="443">Trimmings and flowers and earrings and hats for the German population. </sentence><sentence id="444">Other people made shoes. </sentence><sentence id="445">My brother worked in a shoe factory because we were from shoes. </sentence><sentence id="446">Whatever anybody was able to contribute to a factory, did, because otherwise we didn't get soup. </sentence><sentence id="447">If you did not work you didn't get your ration to begin with, but if you worked, you also get a soup. </sentence><sentence id="448">The soup consisted of some water with some dirt in it, but it was very important to have it. </sentence><sentence id="449">Everybody worked because what else? </sentence><sentence id="450">You couldn't go on the street, they would shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="451">You had to work. </sentence><sentence id="452">Q. What age people worked? </sentence><sentence id="453">What age range were the workers?A. Good question. </sentence><sentence id="454">You led me into this horrible scene. </sentence><sentence id="455">What did I leave out before, what I always leave out. </sentence><sentence id="456">Starting from 12 years, in May of "42, I don't know if you ever heard this one, I'm jumping over a lot now because you led me into it. </sentence><sentence id="457">Announcements came out -- it was a beautiful sunny day and I was on my way home from work, because we had a home and a place to work. </sentence><sentence id="458">If the home had ten people instead of two people, or if the home was cold or without water or without facilities, but that was the place where you went to sleep over. </sentence><sentence id="459">On the way home there was announcement. </sentence><sentence id="460">What do you call what you call when you put announcements on the walls. </sentence><sentence id="461">There's an English word for it. </sentence><sentence id="462">Mother's should prepare children up to ten years old in front of the building to be picked up by trucks because they are unproductive. </sentence><sentence id="463">This answers your question, and they don't earn their ration. </sentence><sentence id="464">I always tell the way I was tortured, but I never leave out in conjunction with this, this scene. </sentence><sentence id="465">I think of all the atrocities, and everybody knows that there is piles of shoes in Auschwitz and everywhere else, but to be present when this announcement came up, when I walked into the garden of my building where we live and I seen mother's tearing the skin off their flesh. </sentence><sentence id="466">They had to prepare their children for next day to be given away. </sentence><sentence id="467">Now, what could be a bigger crime than that? </sentence><sentence id="468">All the crimes I will tell you about, or I will not tell you about, all of them together in my judgment and I always feel it that way, if I would be able to come in front of the United Nations and I would tell this story only. </sentence><sentence id="469">The following day, trucks were coming down the street. </sentence><sentence id="470">Me and my brother, the father of Mark, the lawyer, were on the roof top. </sentence><sentence id="471">We made it to the roof top for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="472">One, we wanted to see what was going on better, but mainly because we were afraid to be in the building because the mother's just didn't deliver the children on a silver platter. </sentence><sentence id="473">The Germans had to break in doors, and they did. </sentence><sentence id="474">These "Herrenvolkz", these proud bastards, sorry if I have to call them that, were going door to door breaking in the doors with the carabins, grabbed the children and throw them on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="475">We seen it from the roof top with my brother. </sentence><sentence id="476">Isn't that heartbreaking. </sentence><sentence id="477"> Can this ever come out of your mind? </sentence><sentence id="478">Can this be forgiven? </sentence><sentence id="479">Moses was taken out from the water, right? </sentence><sentence id="480">But she put him on at least something to swim. </sentence><sentence id="481">Here, they threw them on the trucks and many times they tear them in half. </sentence><sentence id="482">Never heard it? </sentence><sentence id="483">Everybody knows where these children went? </sentence><sentence id="484">They went to death. </sentence><sentence id="485">So, usually I tell my own torture that I went through once. </sentence><sentence id="486">I know that we're leaving out a lot. </sentence><sentence id="487">We're skipping a lot or we'd have to be here forever. </sentence><sentence id="488">1942 again. </sentence><sentence id="489">I'm 19 years old. </sentence><sentence id="490">My father was summoned to the Kripo. </sentence><sentence id="491">Kripo is the acronym for Criminal Police because we were big criminals. </sentence><sentence id="492">As a matter of fact, when I was in Germany 16 months ago, about my case, and I at once opened the paper and it says Kripo, I thought I'm going to faint there sitting there because I didn't see this word since then. </sentence><sentence id="493">The Kripo was the place in the chancellory of the nicest church in the neighborhood and this church fell into the neighborhood of the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="494">So, there was no use for the church as a religious place, so the Germans made their warehouse out of the gorgeous church. </sentence><sentence id="495">A block big magnificent church. </sentence><sentence id="496">I'll never forget that because it was only a block, two blocks from me where I live, where I went everyday passed. </sentence><sentence id="497">They made this into a warehouse for the Schmattes, for the belongings of the poor, already worn down Jews. </sentence><sentence id="498">So, the church became a warehouse with that stinking stuff. </sentence><sentence id="499">The chancellory which was across the street turned into a torture house, and that's where we were tortured ten days, and I will describe you only the tortures. </sentence><sentence id="500">Father was called the 16th of April. </sentence><sentence id="501">See how Iremember. </sentence><sentence id="502">You asked before if we had money. </sentence><sentence id="503">They went by that. </sentence><sentence id="504">They went by the status of the person, figuring that Father was a businessman, he must have hidden money and what they wanted was very simply, money, diamonds, brilliants and dollars. </sentence><sentence id="505">The list was like this. </sentence><sentence id="506">So, Father was in the day before, summoned. </sentence><sentence id="507">Now, you know when you prepared yourself to go there that you're going to be tortured and you don't know how long. </sentence><sentence id="508">So, what we did we dressed ourselves in a lot of underwear, a lot of upperwear that when they beat you, it should help. </sentence><sentence id="509">It doesn't help, but you do your best. </sentence><sentence id="510">Mother sent her husband and now she sends her sons. </sentence><sentence id="511">The next day, the 17th, we were summoned, the three of us. </sentence><sentence id="512">We had to stand like walked up three flights, stand in the little foyer, the balcony when they called down the first one, there was more people than us. </sentence><sentence id="513">First they searched us and took everything out from us, you know, because now we are legal prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="514">By coincidence a small little pencil, and I don't know why I had it there. </sentence><sentence id="515">It was there, and they didn't find it. </sentence><sentence id="516">I used it then to mark on the bunk in the cell when I came down, the dates and the day, otherwise I wouldn't even know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="517">We had to listen to the screams of the other ones so my older brother was done  first. </sentence><sentence id="518">The screams were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="519">Then they threw him down the stairs like a ball, and they put him into a cell. </sentence><sentence id="520">We didn't know where he was going. </sentence><sentence id="521">Next came the other one. </sentence><sentence id="522">They took it by age, and then came me. </sentence><sentence id="523">When I came into the other room, there was a German sitting on kitty-cornered desk, and he had laying strings(straps?) </sentence><sentence id="524">on the counter. </sentence><sentence id="525">The other German was sitting behind -- I am there now. </sentence><sentence id="526">He was having a breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="527">It turned my Kishkes, because we didn't smell an egg for two years now. </sentence><sentence id="528">And there he sits behind the typewriter consuming an egg breakfast and smells up    the whole house with it. </sentence><sentence id="529">The first one behind the desk, he was the first one talking to me, he says you are the youngest so you better be the smartest. </sentence><sentence id="530">You heard what happened to the others, so if you want to be smart, talk. </sentence><sentence id="531">We didn't talk, because by then there wasn't anything to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="532">Because the answer to that is if you already went to Warsaw, the money already became worthless. </sentence><sentence id="533">That's just God forbid something happens here the dollar loses its value, everything became black marketing, and if there was anything little left, how could you give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="534">Anyway, this is only besides the point, and as I didn't talk, now this I considered the only heroic thing that I did through the war because my father and the three of us made up not to talk. </sentence><sentence id="535">So, the fact that we lasted and I didn't talk, I considered this was the only heroic thing, if anything. </sentence><sentence id="536">Anyway, with a wink of his head, he was a hunch back, you must have heard of him in your interviews. </sentence><sentence id="537">Suter was his name, a Volksdeutsch, called the other guy whose name was Schmitt. </sentence><sentence id="538">This guy was a real German, full Aryan, tall and blonde. </sentence><sentence id="539">Told me to lay down on the floor belly down, ass high. </sentence><sentence id="540">He showed me exactly how to do it, but he had canes hanging on the wall or on the closet side. </sentence><sentence id="541">I had to pick my cane and he started measuring out. </sentence><sentence id="542">He tells me you're going to get 50. </sentence><sentence id="543">You remember the Singapore story with Michaels. </sentence><sentence id="544">He was getting six but the President intervened for four and a hospital room was prepared for him. </sentence><sentence id="545">He said you're going to get 50 and he starts measuring out and I scream. </sentence><sentence id="546">He politely stands and talks down to me, he says, would you please not scream. </sentence><sentence id="547">I can't hear you screaming. </sentence><sentence id="548">I can't take it. </sentence><sentence id="549">Go down again. </sentence><sentence id="550">He gives it to me again, and I scream. </sentence><sentence id="551">He says, see I forgot to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="552">Bite your fingers so you wouldn't scream. </sentence><sentence id="553">I go down again, he measures out and I scream. </sentence><sentence id="554">Again, he gives me advice. </sentence><sentence id="555">He says, you know you're hurting yourself, because every time you go down again, you have to start counting from the beginning so don't scream. </sentence><sentence id="556">Go down, bite your fingers, count. </sentence><sentence id="557"> How do you count while you bite your fingers? </sentence><sentence id="558">The sadism of it is what I'm trying to point out. </sentence><sentence id="559">I don't know how many I counted. </sentence><sentence id="560">I don't know how many I received. </sentence><sentence id="561">Enough to find myself in a dark alley in the chancellory on the top floor in a flood of blood. </sentence><sentence id="562">If you want to touch here you'll feel where the blood is coming out. </sentence><sentence id="563">I had them touch it in court last year. </sentence><sentence id="564">Last week it was bleeding a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="565">I said to my wife, it's bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="566">How could a nation become so murderous? </sentence><sentence id="567">My father died only a few months later, November 27, which was -- he never recovered. </sentence><sentence id="568">When we got out of there after ten days, -- I'll tell you one more thing. </sentence><sentence id="569">We couldn't sit, we couldn't walk, we couldn't lay down. </sentence><sentence id="570">Remember I said I had a little pencil. </sentence><sentence id="571">When I got down to the cell then they put me to a cell. </sentence><sentence id="572">One of my

At once I had nothing, and I turned around I walked back and the rabbi died from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="873">All this that you are hearing today make up for the most cannibalistic  happening and we know history and we don't deny history and there's book recorded. </sentence><sentence id="874">There was plenty bad things happening and do happen at the time too. </sentence><sentence id="875">Like Elie Wiesel was the first one to run to the Balkans_ to say what are you doing here. </sentence><sentence id="876">Let me give you a little break down. </sentence><sentence id="877">Remember in the Balkans in Bosnia Herzegovina once a bomb recently a few months ago and it blew up and killed 60 people, and the world was outraged. </sentence><sentence id="878">You'll be surprised when I say rightfully so. </sentence><sentence id="879">60 people to kill from a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="880">I'm not talking about all the other atrocities that are going on now today, but he was there Elie Wiesel to tell the world that he's getting sick from it. </sentence><sentence id="881">Why isn't something done about it. </sentence><sentence id="882">Now, let me give you a statistic now. </sentence><sentence id="883">Six million divided by 2,185 days comes to 3,000 a day, not 60. </sentence><sentence id="884">Three thousand each day, if you have a pencil or an adding machine you can add it up. </sentence><sentence id="885">Q. I just want to get back to the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="886">Were there regular round ups in the Ghetto?A. Oh absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="887">These were called "Aussiedlungen", liquidations until the final liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="888">Naturally that was  going on normal. </sentence><sentence id="889">They would grab you, they would announce that you should come to a certain place where you will be -- but they lied. </sentence><sentence id="890">They said we need people that say in another part of the country or the biggest lie and the most sarcastic lie was when they came in "44 to liquidate the Ghetto they told us being that the Russian front if coming nearer we want to save you and take you with us. </sentence><sentence id="891">So, they liquidated whole shops with the things and they really were -- because they were robbing. </sentence><sentence id="892">They were robbing, but under the pretext that something wrong is coming. </sentence><sentence id="893">The Russian front is coming near because our side only the Russians could have come because that was east. </sentence><sentence id="894">The Americans came to Normandy which was in the west. </sentence><sentence id="895">End of Tape 3 Tape 4 A. How could they have undertook to fight helpless innocent people. </sentence><sentence id="896">All right, I will leave out the word innocent because according to them we are the most guilty in the world. </sentence><sentence id="897">But how can they have taken upon themselves to make the judgment and to carry on such atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="898">Q. You were telling me that there were actions and deportations  all the time. </sentence><sentence id="899">Were there any rules? </sentence><sentence id="900">Who got sent away first?A. Sick, anybody who was breaking down. </sentence><sentence id="901">Age, like at one time I almost went though somebody told me if you go you will not live. </sentence><sentence id="902">They told us that they need an amount of people at a certain age that they're a little stronger and healthier for work somewhere in Germany because at one time I worked on the Berlin autostrada,_ building the Berlin highway which was supposed to connect Berlin to Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="903">I worked there too. </sentence><sentence id="904">So, when they needed slave labor mainly the fact when let's say somebody in Germany was short of labor because after all they were conducting a war and their people were in. </sentence><sentence id="905">So, they would reach into these businesses of theirs, Ghettos and said at once we need a thousand young men. </sentence><sentence id="906">That's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="907">Now, who made the list had a terrible conscientious thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="908">He had to deliver a 1,000 people, so he had to sit down and pick, and whoever he picked he  had to. </sentence><sentence id="909">See, here again there is the big discussion amongst ourselves did they have to do it didn't they have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="910">Are they guilty are they not guilty. </sentence><sentence id="911">Well, they were made to do it. </sentence><sentence id="912">They had no choice, because if they had an arsenal of weapons to say well tomorrow morning we're going to give weapons to a thousand boys and we'll go out and have a little war with the Germans instead of sending them, there was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="913">We were locked in absolutely helpless. </sentence><sentence id="914">That's how they did these liquidations. </sentence><sentence id="915">The liquidations were actually work things. </sentence><sentence id="916">So, if they didn't take him right away to death, not all the time, no. </sentence><sentence id="917">You heard of the selections, once they took a group out, they started selecting who will fall to the wayside, systematically. </sentence><sentence id="918">Then they needed more, so they had plenty Ghettos so they reached into the Ghetto and got more. </sentence><sentence id="919">There is no other explanation of it. </sentence><sentence id="920">Q. So, when they sent people away, they still needed workers. </sentence><sentence id="921">A. In Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="922">They needed somebody somewhere maybe better or like Schindler himself or my guy, where we were. </sentence><sentence id="923">We also were owned by a slave owner like that. </sentence><sentence id="924">Maybe he needed to enlarge his business. </sentence><sentence id="925">Schindler had a factory and he needed more. </sentence><sentence id="926">So, let's say this guy of mine or another one. </sentence><sentence id="927">He didn't give a damn for anything else probably than his own business, but he was able to get instead of going to the labor organization for workers, they were at the front lines. </sentence><sentence id="928">So that's how they used us, they used us up until death. </sentence><sentence id="929">In other words, they didn't waste a bit of us. </sentence><sentence id="930">They used us until we died. </sentence><sentence id="931">Q. Did they bring more people in when they were sending people out?A. They only brought in people when they had the full pull of it in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="932">Then they didn't bring in no more. </sentence><sentence id="933">Where would they take them from. </sentence><sentence id="934">There was no more. </sentence><sentence id="935">Q. Maybe from other Ghettos or other towns?A. We had people to begin with from all the surrounding towns. </sentence><sentence id="936">In other words, not every little town did they make a Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="937">It would be bothersome for them. </sentence><sentence id="938">They incorporated all the small towns around Warsaw, all the small towns around Lodz, so the Ghettos were mainly in the big towns. </sentence><sentence id="939">There was some small Ghettos, too. </sentence><sentence id="940">It all depended on this strategic productive need that they had. </sentence><sentence id="941">They did what they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="942">They didn't have to ask anybody. </sentence><sentence id="943">Q. Right. </sentence><sentence id="944">So, there were people in the Lodz Ghetto from around other places?A. Yeah, sure. </sentence><sentence id="945">We still have some that we know now that survived just like ourselves who were brought in from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="946">We know a few of them. </sentence><sentence id="947">Q. Then they just got distributed amongst the rest of you?A. Yes, they were just thrown in there and the leadership had to place them. </sentence><sentence id="948">And placing people was an easy thing. </sentence><sentence id="949">You're going to live in this apartment. </sentence><sentence id="950">You're going to say no, and he's going to say -- there was no choices. </sentence><sentence id="951">You did what you were made to do. </sentence><sentence id="952">Q. Did people get along? </sentence><sentence id="953">A. I wouldn't say not all the time probably. </sentence><sentence id="954">There wasn't too much antagonism, and then on the other hand, it was yes, because under circumstances like that where some helped themselves better to a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="955">Bread was the key word. </sentence><sentence id="956">You could have --  I didn't come across myself any frictions or even that I should be able to tell of. </sentence><sentence id="957">I did know people that worked in the same place as me that were getting an extra soup. </sentence><sentence id="958">The biggest envy was an extra soup. </sentence><sentence id="959">What else did you know? </sentence><sentence id="960">You didn't care about your pants. </sentence><sentence id="961">You didn't care about your jacket. </sentence><sentence id="962">You didn't care about your tie. </sentence><sentence id="963">You didn't care about your car. </sentence><sentence id="964">The main thing was survival, a piece of bread or another soup. </sentence><sentence id="965">Q. Were women treated any differently than men?A. Were women treated different than men? </sentence><sentence id="966">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="967">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="968">Absolutely, no. </sentence><sentence id="969">Q. How did you manage to avoid deportations all this time, for these three or four years in the Ghetto?A. That's a good question because I answered a minute ago that at one time I wanted to report for the deportation. </sentence><sentence id="970">Now, let me explain what that means. </sentence><sentence id="971">Let's say that an announcement comes out that the Germans need a hundred strong men or young men. </sentence><sentence id="972">So, the first thing that came to your mind is that it will be good there where you're going. </sentence><sentence id="973">You'll get an extra piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="974">You'll get an extra soup so some reported "freiwillig", voluntarily. </sentence><sentence id="975">That's what you can call it. </sentence><sentence id="976">So, how one avoided all the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="977">Some questions are very proper that you put forward and not easy to give an answer to. </sentence><sentence id="978">Because they say if they needed 100 out ofa thousand, only a hundred went. </sentence><sentence id="979">Who it was -- sometimes you needed to know somebody up there not to be sent out. </sentence><sentence id="980">Another time you needed somebody in the higher echelons because we had a committee that should help you go. </sentence><sentence id="981">Q. Did you know people on the committee who helped you?A. No, we knew who they were every one of them because they were visible every day. </sentence><sentence id="982">I personally didn't have any personal contact with anybody in higher places. </sentence><sentence id="983">If I might call it higher places. </sentence><sentence id="984">It was like a prison. </sentence><sentence id="985">A big, big prison with some people being a little bit more in charge of things than others. </sentence><sentence id="986">Q. So, you and most of your family were there until the final liquidation?A. No, we lost two brothers, a sister and her baby in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="987">We don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="988">Q. But the people in Lodz, your father?A. No, my father died after the beating in Kripo in "42, but  the three of us, me and my other two brothers, my oldest brother passed away two years ago, and my other brother, the father of this lawyer passed away 14 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="989">We, by unexplainable miracle, and you have a few cases where there are sisters or brothers, we were together all the time. </sentence><sentence id="990">Q. So, you and your two brothers and your mother were still in the Ghetto at the final liquidation?A. At the final liquidation, yes. </sentence><sentence id="991">Q. Tell me what happened?A. What happened. </sentence><sentence id="992">Then they announced the final liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="993">Q. This was when?A. The Ghetto got liquidated between August, September, October of 1944, but they needed a group of workers that will clean up so to say. </sentence><sentence id="994">They called it clean the Ghetto after the people are gone. </sentence><sentence id="995">What was it to clean of? </sentence><sentence id="996">Nobody had a new suit or a new diamond or a new living room wall piece. </sentence><sentence id="997">For them everything was good. </sentence><sentence id="998">Anyway, that's what they called this. </sentence><sentence id="999">We loaded that on trains. </sentence><sentence id="1000">So, there were 500 of us, women and men. </sentence><sentence id="1001">We became kind of chosen because we were there longer than the others. </sentence><sentence id="1002">The Ghetto was empty. </sentence><sentence id="1003">We went out every day to work. </sentence><sentence id="1004">On trucks they took us to work from building to building to pick up the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1005">It's ridiculous, what was there? </sentence><sentence id="1006">Broken up things, the Ghetto was already five years old. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Then finally came our turn where this Beboff(?) </sentence><sentence id="1008">who owned us, he already owned us there, so what he was doing was already as a businessman or rather as a function to guard himself or hide himself from going to the Russian front because he makes himself useful for the fatherland. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Q. For the record, why don't you tell me who Beboff is?A. Beboff was a German, a German who was the Gauleiter, it was called. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Gauleiter means like Schindler was in his business. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Schindler was actually like a gauleiter. </sentence><sentence id="1012">So was Boboff. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Beboff was the head of our Ghetto, the German head of our Ghetto because we had a Jewish head. </sentence><sentence id="1014">You've heard of him, Chaim Rumkowsky, but Beboff was the German representative, the German delegate, the German appointee for this business of this Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Then he took us with him and he opened this business, established this business of building cement four by eights it would be today flats in Koenigs Wusterhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So we belonged, our headquarters were Sachsenhausen, the concentration camp was Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1017">They took us to Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1018">From there he got his group further after delousing and after being there a few weeks --.Q. Wait you're skipping too many steps here. </sentence><sentence id="1019">I want to hear about the trip when you left the Ghetto, how all of that came about?A. They loaded us into cattle trains. </sentence><sentence id="1020">I have to mention only a little thing, a few weeks or a few days before they loaded us, the engineer of the cattle of the train was a Pollack. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Because you remember there was movie Shoah on television for nine hours and it showed how the Poles this was their job. </sentence><sentence id="1022">He was the engineer of the train. </sentence><sentence id="1023">When we were loading these products that we were making on those trains he told us in Polish Jidski, Jews don't go, they're frying you in frying pans. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Now this is the end of "44, and we said to ourselves is he off his mind? </sentence><sentence id="1025">Frying us on frying pans? </sentence><sentence id="1026">What's he talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1027">He's stupid. </sentence><sentence id="1028">He knew what he was saying because he came from here to there and from there back. </sentence><sentence id="1029">So, he had to be careful telling us because the Germans were around but he did anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So, finally the liquidation came. </sentence><sentence id="1031">We were loaded into cattle trains, and they took off. </sentence><sentence id="1032">No openings of any kind like you see on Schindler's List. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I really cannot tell you how many nights and how many days because we didn't know the difference between day and night. </sentence><sentence id="1034">They pushed us back and back until we arrived at the very big railroad crossing and I assume that it was Ravensbruck because they took out the women. </sentence><sentence id="1035">The doors opened and outside Germans running around with dogs, with German shepherds, yelling aloud "Frauen "raus", women get out. </sentence><sentence id="1036">And that's how we were separated from our mother. </sentence><sentence id="1037">Then the doors locked again and the train went forward. </sentence><sentence id="1038">I don't know how long it took and we wound up in another place. </sentence><sentence id="1039">Now we knew we were in Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Q. What was the train ride like?A. A cattle train filled with people like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Not a place to turn. </sentence><sentence id="1042">No facilities of any kind, not even a pail. </sentence><sentence id="1043">Now, you can imagine after a while how this things smelled, and people were just dying, falling down, sick or dead. </sentence><sentence id="1044">That's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="1045">It was hell, hell couldn't be that way. </sentence><sentence id="1046">This was worse than hell. </sentence><sentence id="1047">How long was it? </sentence><sentence id="1048">It could have been a week. </sentence><sentence id="1049">I don't know because we didn't know when it was day and when it was night. </sentence><sentence id="1050">We just heard trains going by and passing by and they pushed us from one line to the other and at once the door opened, we didn't know where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1051">We didn't know where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1052">That was the only stop to get all the women out. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And when they meant out, they meant out. </sentence><sentence id="1054">Then they continued on after a while and not long after we wound up at another station and that was our place, Sachsenburg- Oranienburg. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Q. Describe to me what was happening when you arrived there?A. When we arrived at Oranienburg, the doors opened and a few guys were dead and a few others got heart attacks and died in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="1056">One of them two sons survived and came to America afterwards, Jakobowski_ was their name, and he was one of the leaders of the Ghetto, too, and his father just fell dead while the door was opened and we carried him with us and he was cremated because they had crematoriums there too. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Then we came into the camp and there was big sign "Arbeit macht Frei", Work Makes You Free. </sentence><sentence id="1058">So, we realized that we were ina concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1059">There were barracks, full of barracks, and we all got --  _this was an established concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1060">As a matter of fact, the guy in charge of our barrack was a German. </sentence><sentence id="1061">George was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1062">He was incarcerated yet from the beginning of Hitler's times. </sentence><sentence id="1063">He was not bad with us. </sentence><sentence id="1064">The next barrack from us they had Russian prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1065">Every morning they would march them. </sentence><sentence id="1066">These prisoners were used for breaking in new military shoes for the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="1067">You never heard of that. </sentence><sentence id="1068">That was their job. </sentence><sentence id="1069">In the morning, every morning they got a new pair of shoes because they were heavy and hard. </sentence><sentence id="1070">They wanted to have them for the soldiers to have them broken in. </sentence><sentence id="1071">SO, they would march a whole day and in the evening they came back and they gave back these shoes and they got other shoes the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="1072">They were our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Us they were taking out to  work, and I remember at one time we worked at the Autobahn, means the highway from Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="1074">We built that. </sentence><sentence id="1075">At one time they took us to like work in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="1076">At one time they took us out to pick potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1077">I remember the SS man who was in charge of the group just for fun pushed one of our boys. </sentence><sentence id="1078">I knew the boy well, when the truck moved, behind the wheel and squashed him. </sentence><sentence id="1079">In the evening he had to report to Mr. Beboff. </sentence><sentence id="1080">Beboff was waiting at the gate when we came back, marching us back, and he reported " Herr Gauleiter, Ich habe herausgenommen 125", I took out 125 and I brought back 120, and the reaction would be "gut gemacht", well done. </sentence><sentence id="1081">So, when we went out to work, we didn't know if we were going to come back. </sentence><sentence id="1082">All this was already so part of our being that we didn't think of the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1083">We didn't know it would come until finally as this our commander told us that the spring song wind is blowing in front of you, you will not live but probably orders came in that we had to brought back to Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Q. When you were in Sachsenhausen initially, how long were you there?A. Initially, we stayed in Sachsenhausen a very short time, just like a passing through to the real camp, maybe two or three or four weeks, no longer. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Q. Was there a registration there"?A. That's how I got my number. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Q. Yes, but the tape doesn't know that's your number so tell me what really happened in those two weeks?A. We got incorporated into the camp as prisoners of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1087">We were taught all the rules of what goes on and while we were there we had to witness hangings. </sentence><sentence id="1088">If there was a hanging, we all had to go to witness it. </sentence><sentence id="1089">You know, that was the duty of us. </sentence><sentence id="1090">Q. What were you thinking?A. What we were thinking? </sentence><sentence id="1091">I don't think we were thinking. </sentence><sentence id="1092">What could you think? </sentence><sentence id="1093">We had hangings in Ghetto too. </sentence><sentence id="1094">In other words, why was somebody hung in Ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="1095">I was stealing too,    and I'll explain you why. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Let's say my brother, should he rest in peace, he worked in a shoe factory, so he would bring home a sole for a shoe. </sentence><sentence id="1097">For that he could have been hung. </sentence><sentence id="1098">So, if they caught anybody touching somebody, taking it, stealing it, he was sentenced. </sentence><sentence id="1099">There was no sentence, there was no court, they didn't have him in court like we have the thing now. </sentence><sentence id="1100">He was just hung. </sentence><sentence id="1101">They had places where to hang him. </sentence><sentence id="1102">So, and when they hung somebody to show the others how to behave, we had to go and be present at hangings. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Q. What were the rules they taught you?A. I really don't...The rules were to keep yourself clean, or  to make the bunk every day. </sentence><sentence id="1104">There was no rules of any particular kind that I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1105">I wouldn't even want to remember if there were, but I'm sure that there were rules to obey. </sentence><sentence id="1106">They were all more like for I don't want to say animals because I think I mentioned once today I don't want to insult the kingdom of animals. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Q. But you said they taught you -- they told you how it was going to work when you got in, I'm just wondering what they told you?A. They didn't give us any future. </sentence><sentence id="1108">They didn't tell us if you'll be good, you'll go home or you will go to the theater tomorrow or you'll have a piece of cake tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="1109">We were worms as you walk and you step over worms. </sentence><sentence id="1110">Do you ask then the worm if he had rules. </sentence><sentence id="1111">There was rules that they made up, that they obeyed. </sentence><sentence id="1112">Okay, it (be)came very interesting in Koenigs Wusterhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1113">You remember I mentioned we had no facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1114">If we needed to go out in the field, the only way to go out was into the field. </sentence><sentence id="1115">So, in the night, let's say if I remember it vividly, if I needed to go out in the night, to make a physical need, to piss or whatever else, I had first to report to the Wacht (guard), the Heftlig (prisoner) #...., that I need to go out. </sentence><sentence id="1116"> You know what he did to me. </sentence><sentence id="1117">He made me run around the barracks three time, not run around three times but "auf, auf, hinlegen", I'll never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="1118">He played with me. </sentence><sentence id="1119">He didn't get orders to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1120">He just wanted to have fun. </sentence><sentence id="1121">He made me fall down and get up. </sentence><sentence id="1122">I needed to go out, so he made me run around three times the barracks and he had fun in the night to make me fall down and get up. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Exercise. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Another case, it was a big privilege in camp, because they had their quarters there, the commanders, those who watched us. </sentence><sentence id="1125">I don't know now many of them, eight or ten, so they had a separate nicer house where they lived and where they ate, but they had to go for their food to headquarters, to the nearby headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="1126">It was a tremendous break or privilege rather a break if you were picked. </sentence><sentence id="1127">He would just go, come on here. </sentence><sentence id="1128">He picked one of the guys to go with him so they put you into a wagon like a horse with two wheels and there was a part on it to go to their kitchen to bring food for them. </sentence><sentence id="1129">On the way there, to the headquarters every German officer who passed by like that had the pleasure of spitting at you, kicking you, pushing you and the one who was in charge of us didn't mind. </sentence><sentence id="1130">But this was a break. </sentence><sentence id="1131">Why was this a break? </sentence><sentence id="1132">When they finished eating they gave you to wash the pots so you were able to lick a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1133">So you would agree to be kicked around going one way and the other for this big break. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Q. You did this?A. I had once the privilege, only once, otherwise I wouldn't be able to tell you how these proud clean, tall uniformed like this he kicked, he spit, he threw his cigarette on you. </sentence><sentence id="1135">He pushed you over the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="1136">I was doing a duty and the guy stood there with the commander and just had fun both of them. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Where did you ever hear a thing like that in history?Q.

Health, health what is that? </sentence><sentence id="1138">Who thought of health. </sentence><sentence id="1139">You mean if you sneezed? </sentence><sentence id="1140">If you died, you died. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Q. Was there disease? </sentence><sentence id="1142">Were people taken care of?A. Well, disease they would be afraid themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1143">Well, they always had "entlausung" deloused us because we didn't take showers or wash so they threw powder on us, "entlausung", and if somebody would be a little bit sick, they would shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="1144">There was no problem healing him. </sentence><sentence id="1145">Q. You had lice? </sentence><sentence id="1146">Did you have lice on you?A. I just told you, yes, lice. </sentence><sentence id="1147">Sure I had lice on me. </sentence><sentence id="1148">I did have lice on me, so what they did, they would powder you only. </sentence><sentence id="1149">You didn't take a shower. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Q. Did you ever get typhus or anything? </sentence><sentence id="1151">A. I got typhus in the Ghetto, right after crypo. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I had very mild case of typhus, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1153">That was also in another horrible, horrible horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I feel so horrible about it, that I am even ashamed, I feel bad to tell it with all three of you particularly those two. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Q. Forget us. </sentence><sentence id="1156">A. My uncle, this is why I don't want this to come to the public because maybe I have a chance now, maybe they'll give me something. </sentence><sentence id="1157">My uncle was also taken in at the same time as us, a little later, maybe a week later because we were there ten days. </sentence><sentence id="1158">When we came out, I was laying in bed sick, my wife, my father was laying in bed sick, and at once my oldest brother handed me a little note. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Uncle Solomon, my name, is dead. </sentence><sentence id="1160">How did he die? </sentence><sentence id="1161">He was taken into the Kripo too, and they tortured him. </sentence><sentence id="1162">I'm even ashamed to tell you what they did to him because it isn't . </sentence><sentence id="1163">They tied his testicles with a rope. </sentence><sentence id="1164">Remember I told you it was only cobblestones at home. </sentence><sentence id="1165">They put him on a wagon. </sentence><sentence id="1166">They had a wagon with horses. </sentence><sentence id="1167">They didn't have a car. </sentence><sentence id="1168">If we heard that little horse running on the street, we didn't know who was next. </sentence><sentence id="1169">This little horse was like the devil for us. </sentence><sentence id="1170">The crypo was if you remember before, I said, only a block, two blocks, or one and a half blocks from where we lived, my uncle, too. </sentence><sentence id="1171">They put him on the wagon, and until he came threw the half of block, he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1172">Blue and dead. </sentence><sentence id="1173">This you never heard yet. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Q.

Let's go back to where we were which was Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1178">A. We were talking about Koenigs Wusterhausen now all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1179">From Sachsenhausen we were sent to work camp because Sachsenhausen was not a work camp. </sentence><sentence id="1180">It was a concentration camp and this was supposed to be a work camp. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So, there we were not long, from October to April 21, when the war started getting bad for them and then I said before Potsdam was burning and we were able to see Potsdam burning, so they returned us to SAchsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1182">When we arrived at Sachsenhausen we were going to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Koenigs Wusterhausen was on one side of Berlin and Sachsenhausen on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1184">So, we were seeing Berlin also in flames and pretty ruined. </sentence><sentence id="1185">We have seen the bombers day and night going that way because we were in the middle, rather Berlin was in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Q. How far were these --?A. We were about ten or fifteen miles from one side of Berlin and the camp Sachsenhausen was also ten or fifteen miles the other side of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1187">When we came back to Sachsenhausen, it was a mad house. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Papers were flying. </sentence><sentence id="1189">They were burning papers, you know, they were disposing of it. </sentence><sentence id="1190">There was anarchy because when the camps were there was an order. </sentence><sentence id="1191">You know the famous German saying "In Ordnung muss die Welt zugrunde gehen", we will bring the world down in order. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So when we came there to Sachsenhausen_ we didn't know where we belonged. </sentence><sentence id="1193">There was no barracks for us. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1195">They just led us into the gutter, but at the gate, we had to line up constantly and march out into the death march. </sentence><sentence id="1196">We didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1197">So, that's how the death march started or became. </sentence><sentence id="1198">End of Tape 4 Tape 5 Q. Tell me about this work camp, what was it like?A. The work camp was exactly if somebody would open a business of his own. </sentence><sentence id="1199">We were building one item. </sentence><sentence id="1200">In other words, this Biboff, in order to get themselves involved with something that is almost military and need for war, because Berlin was bombarded by then and there was a lot of homeless. </sentence><sentence id="1201">There was no more monkey business. </sentence><sentence id="1202">He came up with this -- not the idea-- but he opened the business of building four by eight cement plates which then he sent or sold to Berliners to make themselves shacks to live in. </sentence><sentence id="1203">They were already "auf Tsures" themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1204">That's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="1205">In other words, he took advantage of the situation or if you want to say it was a business of his. </sentence><sentence id="1206">It had nothing to do with the German government anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1207">But we did belong to the German government. </sentence><sentence id="1208">We did belong to Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1209">The Shupos, or the soldiers that were watching us were belonging their command came from Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1210">So, that's how it worked. </sentence><sentence id="1211">It was a whole set up. </sentence><sentence id="1212">As a camp how it was, we did not have hangings in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1213">We did not have much beating in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Once in a while the commander here would kick you. </sentence><sentence id="1215">He could have split you in half. </sentence><sentence id="1216">We worked from sunrise to sundown. </sentence><sentence id="1217">There was no hours. </sentence><sentence id="1218">I remember like now, at that time, it was placed on a railroad intersection. </sentence><sentence id="1219">So, we loaded the railroad with the stuff and then by then already as we were there a little few weeks because that already was towards the end of the war, we started receiving German soldiers from the Russian front without noses without ears, frozen hands. </sentence><sentence id="1220">They couldn't even eat a piece of bread that was laying to them. </sentence><sentence id="1221">So, we already have seen how they were getting in their behind. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Yes, yes, they were getting it. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Q. What were you thinking when you saw that?A. We were thinking -- I think you said before if we ever thought -- this time we were thinking, oh, it was so good. </sentence><sentence id="1224">It was good. </sentence><sentence id="1225">It didn't last long because then they took us to the march, and it became hell again. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Q. Did it give you hope? </sentence><sentence id="1227">A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1228">That was the first time when the hope was me or not me but that's their end. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Where did we get news from? </sentence><sentence id="1230">That should be a question to answer. </sentence><sentence id="1231">How did we know what date it is or what day it is? </sentence><sentence id="1232">We didn't have calendars. </sentence><sentence id="1233">We didn't have watches. </sentence><sentence id="1234">We had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1235">When the SS was having a paper and the wind blew it away, that's how we caught up with the times. </sentence><sentence id="1236">It's interesting, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Q. Please tell me more about what the camp looked like, who was in charge?A. It was a field, a big field on the outskirts or on the side of this big railroad station because what we produced was supposed to be shipped and received again raw material. </sentence><sentence id="1238">That was going on for these few weeks or these few months, but we were there. </sentence><sentence id="1239">That's all it was, a big field. </sentence><sentence id="1240">Now, you wanted to know if the Germans knew about us. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Let me describe you. </sentence><sentence id="1242">We were hungry, no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="1243">We have seen German women -- because this was in the midst of them-- German women driving bicycles, not cars. </sentence><sentence id="1244">In the back they had loaves of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1245">It turned our insides. </sentence><sentence id="1246">They were having big full breads to eat besides other items probably that she took home to her family. </sentence><sentence id="1247">We seen them. </sentence><sentence id="1248">They did see us, and they did see the way we looked. </sentence><sentence id="1249">They knew that we were prisoners, that we were prisoners--prisoners is too fancy a name because we were not prisoners, slaves. </sentence><sentence id="1250">Not even that. </sentence><sentence id="1251">There is no word to describe what we were. </sentence><sentence id="1252">So, that describes to you what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1253">It was a few barracks that we built ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1254">When we came there there was only one barrack and it wasn't finished. </sentence><sentence id="1255">So, first we built our own barrack and this Biboff couldn't give a damn how much production went out from there or what we built. </sentence><sentence id="1256">All for him was important that he was covered because he was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1257">It was his business and he is helping the government, the war effort. </sentence><sentence id="1258">He was helping the war effort and he enslaved us. </sentence><sentence id="1259">So, probably he must have been a big guy that even could get a thing like that. </sentence><sentence id="1260">Do you understand his position? </sentence><sentence id="1261">His position was to cover himself. </sentence><sentence id="1262">If he made profit or not on it that I don't care and I don't know, but I'm trying to describe you what it was a big empty field which was fenced in then, and when we came there was one barrack unfinished. </sentence><sentence id="1263">We had to finish it ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1264">It was already winter coming. </sentence><sentence id="1265">There was one water well outside, a pump. </sentence><sentence id="1266">That's where we in the morning we able to wash our faces. </sentence><sentence id="1267">We stood in line half naked in the cold and splashed our faces. </sentence><sentence id="1268">You couldn't do more than that with a little pump when you had 500 people to go through and here you had to go out to commandos, it's called, work commandos. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Q. The entire working camp was you 500 people from the Lodz Ghetto?A. Yes, that group, that group. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And we had women amongst us too, but not together with us. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Also, now, if somebody died, it was another privilege to get a piece of bread if you carried them out. </sentence><sentence id="1272">They had the wagon on two wheels only and you put yourself in the front like a horse and I know a person who lives now in Europe who was good at it because I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1273">Not everybody could. </sentence><sentence id="1274">He got an extra piece of bread to do that job, to carry out the dead. </sentence><sentence id="1275">The way he disposed of them nobody knows. </sentence><sentence id="1276">Q. So, they sent you back to Sachsenhausen and you saw Berlin burning, that must have been hopeful?A. Because we had to go to Berlin to the underground bahn-- to the subway. </sentence><sentence id="1277">As a matter of fact there were rumors that Hitler had ordered the underground to be flooded. </sentence><sentence id="1278">It was flooded, but right after we passed it. </sentence><sentence id="1279">So, through the autobahn we came to Sachsenhausen, but we did have the privilege of seeing Berlin burning. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Q. Did you see a lot of German people on your way?A. We did some, yes, we did see some, but they could not have any contact with us. </sentence><sentence id="1281">That mood was already hell for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1282">That was hell came to be. </sentence><sentence id="1283">Then at once when we came into Sachsenhausen, the whole thing was like anarchy. </sentence><sentence id="1284">As orderly as the camps were, not it's an anarchy. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Q. What does that mean? </sentence><sentence id="1286">A. Everybody on his own. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Papers flying, burning papers. </sentence><sentence id="1288">They're burning everything. </sentence><sentence id="1289">But they directed everybody into the main gate out and we got lined up into what became the death march. </sentence><sentence id="1290">That was the death march which lasted from the 25th of April when we left Koenigs Wusterhausen. </sentence><sentence id="1291">In include this into the 2nd of May, the day of Liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1292">So, we marched for about two weeks without any provisions, without any facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1293">Just marching, marching, marching, and after a while people were tipping over to the sideways with the SS on the sides of us. </sentence><sentence id="1294">They did inform us, like some of them that they are marching us towards Hamburg because -- and it was on television this week-- if the Russians reach us, they will call us all. </sentence><sentence id="1295">They, the Germans will kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1296">If the Americans reach us, we will be their -- they will turn us over to Americans as a good gesture to save their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1297">So, we walked like that and we walked and people were tipping over and that's how this picture got soiled because we were sleeping in the mud. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Q. The picture of your brother?A. This picture of my brother, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1300">If I knew I would stow it away because if any German would notice he would kill me. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Then after a while I couldn't take it no more and I realized that when people lay down they give him a shot in the head to make sure he's dead, finished, over. </sentence><sentence id="1302">So, we kept on marching, we kept on marching, and people were laying down. </sentence><sentence id="1303">At once I started negotiating with my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Now, this is really something that I'll never ever be able to explain how the three of us were together all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1305">That is unexplainable. </sentence><sentence id="1306">But there is a few other cases like that too, in amongst such a big mass of people. </sentence><sentence id="1307">I started negotiating with my two brothers that I've had enough, I'm going to lay down. </sentence><sentence id="1308">I'll tell you why else. </sentence><sentence id="1309">It was May, April May. </sentence><sentence id="1310">When we came to Sachsenhausen originally in October they bathed us, just like they did for gas chambers and then they threw us clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1311">We had undressed, and a big guy would get a small piece of clothing and I got a coat it must have been from a dead woman of 400 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="1312">So, it became very useful in the camp during the winter, but to carry it on yourself in May. </sentence><sentence id="1313">Europe has a mild climate. </sentence><sentence id="1314">It was killing me. </sentence><sentence id="1315">It was hot, and it was so big. </sentence><sentence id="1316">So, at once I said I'll throw it away, but if you throw it away they'll shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="1317">You're not supposed -- this is not your road, you cannot throw -- and the coat doesn't belong to you, a coat, a shmatte. </sentence><sentence id="1318">It had not buttons. </sentence><sentence id="1319">I remember when the commander once in the morning said to me "Sie haben keine Knoepfe", that I have no buttons. </sentence><sentence id="1320">He was worried that I have no Knoepfe. </sentence><sentence id="1321">Tomorrow you will have Knoepfe. </sentence><sentence id="1322">I'll go to Macy's and buy Knoepfe. </sentence><sentence id="1323">So when I was outside working I thought what will Ido now. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Tomorrow I will be on count down and I have no Knoepfe. </sentence><sentence id="1325">So, I found a piece of wire on the floor and I made holes and I tied it up. </sentence><sentence id="1326">This was my coat, which because of this coat I wanted to give up in May because I couldn't carry it, it was too hot. </sentence><sentence id="1327">So, anyway, my brother, who was the father of this lawyer, said to me, my name at home was Schlomik, in Polish, "I have a feeling that we're going to freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Don't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1329">Please don't lay down." </sentence><sentence id="1330">But by then if you lay down they didn't shoot you, but they kicked you. </sentence><sentence id="1331">They didn't want to waste ammunition on you, so they made you, they forced you to walk. </sentence><sentence id="1332">In the nights, they dispersed us into the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1333">If you want me to tell you the last day of this march which is liberation so my brother again, he was terrific. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Once we were sleeping near a farm, in the night and they had some bags with little corn. </sentence><sentence id="1335">My brother with his fingers managed to pull out a few pieces of corn because we didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1336">When we marched it was five of us. </sentence><sentence id="1337">Me and my two brothers, one friend that went with me to school together and his father. </sentence><sentence id="1338">He then became a doctor in America and he died of cancer. </sentence><sentence id="1339">Anyway, my brother was feeding us. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Everytime he gave each one of us one piece to chew to exist. </sentence><sentence id="1341">So, one day it was the 2nd of May--better yet the first of May we notice the SS reading a newspapers. " </sentence><sentence id="1342">The Fuehrer ist tot. </sentence><sentence id="1343">It was worth living. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Do you know what it means? </sentence><sentence id="1345">Hitler is dead. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Better news we couldn't ask for. </sentence><sentence id="1347">He was reading, but they were starting losing themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1348">Without the Fuhrer how can they exist. </sentence><sentence id="1349">The Fuhrer is tot. </sentence><sentence id="1350">Now, another story, airplanes started flying on top over us one day before liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Leaflets came down signed by Truman, Stalin and Churchill. </sentence><sentence id="1352">Stop the killing, we will keep you responsible. </sentence><sentence id="1353">Why did they wait so long. </sentence><sentence id="1354">Why did they wait why couldn't they do that months or years before the last day? </sentence><sentence id="1355">You know how the Germans reacted to that? </sentence><sentence id="1356">They have an intuition of sadism like nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="1357">They threw a can of bloodwurst-- meat into the masses thousands of people got killed because amongst them was mainly the Russian prisoners who were a little stronger than us. </sentence><sentence id="1358">All these people had to grab that can. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Imagine their idea that they'll throw in one can of meat there many people will get killed. </sentence><sentence id="1360">That was the first of May. </sentence><sentence id="1361">So, now liberation day. </sentence><sentence id="1362">That's a beautiful day. </sentence><sentence id="1363">At once we reached a little overpass as we were marching and the sun shined so good. </sentence><sentence id="1364">On the overpass we couldn't believe ourselves there were red cross busses and red cross representatives and German officers and they were negotiating and talking and we feel that this must be a put on because this is the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="1365">They didn't let us cross. </sentence><sentence id="1366">It must have been 11:00 or 12:00, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1367">We didn't have watches, and I remember I was laying on the ground and I put my feet against a tree just to relax a little bit and I was picking grass and I ate and we were sitting there and they were negotiating back and forth and we didn't believe that this is it. </sentence><sentence id="1368">At once, march again, the busses get away and we marched across this overpass. </sentence><sentence id="1369">So, the hours in the meantime we went forward until we reached an intersection and there was a German again like this showing us that we can't go any further than into the woods again. </sentence><sentence id="1370">Same thing as every day. </sentence><sentence id="1371">Dispersed into the woods for the night. </sentence><sentence id="1372">My brother, this one, he was a hero, really. </sentence><sentence id="1373">He had a little can on him all the time, and as we were marching at the risk of being shot he would run over if there was mud, and he would grab a can of this and that would be our supper in the evening, with the worms and everything in it. </sentence><sentence id="1374">He did it every day. </sentence><sentence id="1375">So, they moved us in there. </sentence><sentence id="1376">Yes, I must give credits to the Czechoslovakians. </sentence><sentence id="1377">We were marching geographically as Poles, and the Poles even then were anti-semitic, but at once geographically we were able to blend ourselves into Czechoslovakia which is next on the map geographically, and these Czech's took care of us. </sentence><sentence id="1378">They watched over us. </sentence><sentence id="1379">They knew we were Jewish that we are in bigger trouble than them. </sentence><sentence id="1380">In the evening, in the night, they helped us get leaves together to make a place to lay down. </sentence><sentence id="1381">I'm talking now about liberation day. </sentence><sentence id="1382">So, we did all that, and my brother had managed to grab a piece of supper for us, in the can of worms with everything in it, with the grubs, and I lay down on the ground like that and I pushed it over, my can, with my foot. </sentence><sentence id="1383">There went our dinner. </sentence><sentence id="1384">My brother got himself again -- now it's a dispersement. </sentence><sentence id="1385">Everybody lays there, all kinds of nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="1386">God knows how far and he went to find another pan, and he didn't see it. </sentence><sentence id="1387">He went. </sentence><sentence id="1388">After a  long time, me and my brother standing there we lost him. </sentence><sentence id="1389">At once we see a bundle is moving forward like a pile of something is moving towards us. </sentence><sentence id="1390">We notice that our brother is coming and he brought a can of food. </sentence><sentence id="1391">He said we don't need it no more, we are free.

id="1397">The day came to an end and we say to ourselves, if it's true and everybody starts going out to the main road and we say to ourselves, we're Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Let's wait a little longer. </sentence><sentence id="1399">If it's true, we waited that long, let's wait a little longer, but the woods were getting empty and also we noticed that Germans were kind of coming and mixing amongst us and tearing off their epaulets and throwing their uniforms away, the big heroes. </sentence><sentence id="1400">At once they're not anymore heroes. </sentence><sentence id="1401">Something -- we couldn't add it up. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Also we decided also to go out. </sentence><sentence id="1403">So as we went out towards the main road because we knew where we came in, the corn was already that high on the side of the road. </sentence><sentence id="1404">At once we notice a German on a horse with a column of horses like this. </sentence><sentence id="1405">He didn't know that it's over, so we could have gotten killed. </sentence><sentence id="1406">We laid down on the side of the corn and they passed and we went forward. </sentence><sentence id="1407">We came to the main road. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Americans with the pistols like that, like about every 20 or 30 feet. </sentence><sentence id="1409">We couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1410">The Germans like this, their tanks taken and we're free. </sentence><sentence id="1411">I was hospitalized right after this. </sentence><sentence id="1412">Let me get to it. </sentence><sentence id="1413">We didn't know English. </sentence><sentence id="1414">In other words, the Russians and the Americans(?) </sentence><sentence id="1415">came together. </sentence><sentence id="1416">So, we went --we came out to the road where the American side was which was good. </sentence><sentence id="1417">The American boys showed like this. </sentence><sentence id="1418">We didn't know what they meant. </sentence><sentence id="1419">The Red Cross is waiting for us there. </sentence><sentence id="1420">Until we understood what, so we were going there and in the middle of the road the Germans were already like this, prisoners, with the tanks with all the machinery and we couldn't walk no more. </sentence><sentence id="1421">We didn't know how far it was so we got in ina tank. </sentence><sentence id="1422">The soldiers helped us on the tanks and the Germans were leading the tanks. </sentence><sentence id="1423">I came up on this tank, in front where the driver was, was lying a bacon, a big piece of bacon. </sentence><sentence id="1424">It was green and | ate it. </sentence><sentence id="1425">I wound up in the hospital, because I got poisoned from it. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Anyway after a short while of -- I didn't know right away that I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1427">I didn't eat -- I mean I knew I ate raw bacon and after I went off that tank the whole thing -- the whole world is how will I use an expression, in Hebrew it's Tohu va Bohu, like in the beginning God (when) created the world. </sentence><sentence id="1428">We walked, me and my two brothers, and at once we noticed that on the left hand side was a white beautiful house and three American soldiers standing there. </sentence><sentence id="1429">So, we went over to them. </sentence><sentence id="1430">The Germans were just walking passed like this with their hands on their heads, prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1431">We went over to them and we started talking but we don't speak English. </sentence><sentence id="1432">But they were Jewish boys, so we were able to communicate. </sentence><sentence id="1433">They were wild. </sentence><sentence id="1434">The first Jew since Normandy, which was a year later. </sentence><sentence id="1435">The invasion of Normandy was a year before. </sentence><sentence id="1436">They took us into that house. </sentence><sentence id="1437">This was a German house. </sentence><sentence id="1438">They took us into that house. </sentence><sentence id="1439">They fed us, which they shouldn't have. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Then they put us to sleep and we couldn't sleep in a bed. </sentence><sentence id="1441">It was awful, it was so clean and it was so soft. </sentence><sentence id="1442">The following day I got sick, and they had to take me to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1443">The soldiers took care of us all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1444">They were stationed there. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So, they brought a woman German doctor for me, and she prescribed red wine for me. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Where would they get red wine. </sentence><sentence id="1447">It's a war zone. </sentence><sentence id="1448">The boys went out and told us don't you open the door to nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1449">When we come back we will knock with the carabines on the door a certain amount of times then you'll know it's us. </sentence><sentence id="1450">We're going to look for red wine. </sentence><sentence id="1451">They came back in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="1452">You're not going to drink red wine. </sentence><sentence id="1453">We're going to bath you in it. </sentence><sentence id="1454">We found a tug boat full of it. </sentence><sentence id="1455">That's the end. </sentence><sentence id="1456">That is the end of the hell, but then you are a displaced person and you have to go through a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1457">It took until July "45 when we went to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="1458">We went to Sweden because you remember when I told you my brother, they broke his arm, and they shot the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Because of my brother's state of health, the Red Cross picked sick ones to go to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Very few, as we wondered all his time how is that three of us survived? </sentence><sentence id="1461">Very few were more than us alone, so anybody who had family like two brothers, the Swedes took us alone. </sentence><sentence id="1462">That's how we got to Sweden July 7, 1945, after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Q. So the Red Cross took you to Sweden?A. The Red Cross took us to Sweden, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1464">Q. What happened in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="1465">A.
