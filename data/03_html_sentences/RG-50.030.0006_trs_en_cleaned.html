<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: My father was a salesman, sometimes a traveling salesman. </sentence><sentence id="14">My mother used to play the violin and that's how, how it started that they discovered maybe that I had some musical talent, but by the time I was three and a half years old I had a little violin and I had teacher. </sentence><sentence id="15">And my mother practiced with me until I passed her level. </sentence><sentence id="16">And that was my line of work from there on. </sentence><sentence id="17">I became a violinist and a musician. </sentence><sentence id="18">Went to school, but I also went to the Music Academy and I was sort of "non-child" prodigy, because everybody was afraid of that word, so I didn't have that kind of a push from home. </sentence><sentence id="19">But I grew up as a student of the Academy and music was my line all of my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Tell us what it was like for a young Jewish child in Budapest going to the Music Academy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well, it was not as frightful as some of the young Jewish people who had to go to the university because the Numerus Clausus, that was called the 10 percent, was very strictly observed in the universities. </sentence><sentence id="30">In the Academy that was kind of equivalent to the universities, we did not have regular 10 percent Numerus Clausus there. </sentence><sentence id="31">But we had problems. </sentence><sentence id="32">And when the Nazis -- the Hungarian Nazis, the Pfeil Kreuzler" -- Nyilasok -- I don't know how to, how to say this in, in English -- When they started, there were bashing. </sentence><sentence id="33">Head bashing and violin breaking on, on some of the Jewish kids" heads and so we felt it. </sentence><sentence id="34">But we could still get to the point that -- I was one of the prize winners at age. </sentence><sentence id="35">I think I was, I was maybe 17, and I won the Remenyi" Prize. </sentence><sentence id="36">That was the violin that was offered to the so-called best student of the fourth grade of the Academy. </sentence><sentence id="37">And they let me win it. </sentence><sentence id="38">In other words, it wasn't like many places where you, you couldn't even participate. </sentence><sentence id="39">But * Arrow crosser (German) ? </sentence><sentence id="40">Ede Remenyi  then later, of course, when they started the so-called Jewish laws, according to the Nuremberg Laws, the Hungarian laws were much worse than the, than the Nuremberg Laws and that's well, that's a well known fact, I think, at this point. </sentence><sentence id="41">Everybody knows about that. </sentence><sentence id="42">They were creating more Jews than, than there ever were because second, third, fourth generation. </sentence><sentence id="43">They were starting to go back and if they found one Jew, Jewish great-great-great-grandparent, you suddenly became a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="44">So some of the aristocrats were really surprised when they suddenly became Jewish -- they were not. </sentence><sentence id="45">But in the Academy this also started to bad, to be bad, but by then I was gone because I finished in "41, and by the time "43 came around I don't think there were in Jews at the Academy either. </sentence><sentence id="46">So when, when I finished, I got teachers diploma and artist diploma and I was Concert Master of the Jewish Community Orchestra. </sentence><sentence id="47">We couldn't play anywhere else, but in the community cultural center. </sentence><sentence id="48">And there was some very high class concerts there, and opera and we kept up with, with ourselves and with the music. </sentence><sentence id="49">I do remember there was a concert that I played when Kodaly" came. </sentence><sentence id="50">And Kodaly was a very outspoken anti-Nazi and he waited until everybody was seated and then he came through the hall and sat down in the first row. </sentence><sentence id="51">And we played Janos Starker and myself played the Kodaly Duo. </sentence><sentence id="52">That's why he came because he knew we were going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="53">So those, those things happened, but basically the trouble was -- the handwriting was on the wall. </sentence><sentence id="54">And when we got drafted like anybody else at age 21, the Jewish kids got the shovels and the arm band, the yellow arm band but we had to go through the drilling and we just didn't have any guns. </sentence><sentence id="55">And that's how it, it happened that after having been on the front and pushing carts across the Carpathian Mountains, the -- some of us were sent back to Budapest to get some clothes, because we were wearing our own clothes and they were in rags by then. </sentence><sentence id="56">So being in Budapest October "44 when the big change-over happened, they deported me with many others, November four, I think. </sentence><sentence id="57">November four they started us out in the Synagogue in the Dohany Synagogue, the biggest in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="58">That's where I was Bar Mitzvah by the way when I was 13. </sentence><sentence id="59">Now I was 21 and I -- they collected us there overnight, and then they marched us across the Danube and we saw the six bridges all in the Danube already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Can you, can you go back a little? </sentence><sentence id="94">Can you tell us -- I'd like to get a sense of what it was like in the synagogue as you were being rounded up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Well, it was just a, a melee because some people were trying to leave -- I mean to, to escape through the windows, and outside were the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis, with the guns. </sentence><sentence id="98">And not just Nazis but military people. </sentence><sentence id="99">And they there --I think they killed a few, and they were just pushing them back until -- we had no idea what they're trying to, you know, do with us because we were just several thousands. </sentence><sentence id="100">I couldn't tell you how many, &gt; Zoltan Kodaly  but we were there. </sentence><sentence id="101">And, and nobody knew what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="102">And when they started us marching across the, the Danube, we still didn't know that before and after they were shooting people into the Danube from, from the other side of, of the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="103">But the lucky ones arrived in this big -- what, what, what would you call it? </sentence><sentence id="104">Like, like a stadium, but it wasn't a stadium. </sentence><sentence id="105">It was some kind of a factory outdoors. </sentence><sentence id="106">And that's where they collected us first and then they started marching us along the Danube all the way to Vienna. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Tell us about it. </sentence><sentence id="119">Tell us what the March was like. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: The Kapo had given you....? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: The Kapo organized the violin. </sentence><sentence id="205">That's the -- organisieren(r) that's the word in German. </sentence><sentence id="206">That he happened to find somewhere or, or paid with cigarettes or whatever for a violin. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I had a violin. </sentence><sentence id="208">I didn't have a-- my own violin. </sentence><sentence id="209">So I had a violin and a bow, and, and I learned these songs and, and I was playing these songs with, with this -- with these people who were, you know, just my concentration camp comrades basically. </sentence><sentence id="210">Only, you know, there was no -- not real camaraderie because there were Ukrainians who hated the Jews, and Polish people who hated the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="211">We were just in the same camp, but not for the same reason. </sentence><sentence id="212">Anyway, this guy who, who, who helped, who actually saved my life, he was no, no criminal and he was no, no anti-Nazi as far as I can tell. </sentence><sentence id="213">He was a barber who, who was doing abortions in the back of his barber shop. </sentence><sentence id="214">And they found him and he became a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="215">So he was in the concentration camp and being a German, he rose on the ladder of, of becoming a Kapo, which means -- what, what does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="216">What did it mean? </sentence><sentence id="217">Kapo? </sentence><sentence id="218">Constant -- he was he leader of this block of the -- what would I say? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: What a Kapo is, is the commander of -- command, commandant of this block. </sentence><sentence id="239">So I was helped by, by the violin, but when they evacuated the camp no, no violin helped anybody. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="240"> And I got lost. </sentence><sentence id="241">I mean I, I, I was one, one of the others. </sentence><sentence id="242">One of all those people who, who got into cattle cars and, and was transported. </sentence><sentence id="243">We didn't know where to, but then, then they put us on ships. </sentence><sentence id="244">They put us on the -- in the hull of some kind of a cargo ship. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="245">That is very well described in that book. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="246"> deg Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="247"> head a labor Kommando of prisoners. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="248"> 6 Organize (German); term used in concentration camps for the process of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="249"> acquisition through bartering. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: I'd like -- would you just never mind the book right now. </sentence><sentence id="251">What I'd like you to do is describe the book -- the ship. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: The description of that, that ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: The ship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: That ship is -- was just a small cargo ship that had a hull, and we climbed down and it was dark. </sentence><sentence id="257">And nobody knew what's going to happen, but once in a while they opened up the light and they threw down a little bread and some, some people had to climb up to, to get a kettle down. </sentence><sentence id="258">And there was some hot water that they called soup and there was no facilities for, for sanitary reasons. </sentence><sentence id="259">Absolutely nothing! </sentence><sentence id="260">And we were in there, I think, for two or three days and, of course, nobody knew how many days. </sentence><sentence id="261">And that was the time when the Swedish Banadot -- Bernadotte", Prince Bernadotte tried to, to get some, some special treatment for the, for the Swedish -- for the Danish police and the Norwegian students who were in the same camp. </sentence><sentence id="262">And he did get some agreement I think. </sentence><sentence id="263">Anyway, they were not on this evacuation. </sentence><sentence id="264">They, they were sent somewhere else and then these, these ships -- there were two or three of these -- were sent out to the middle of the Litibeck, Liibeck Bay and there was this gigantic ship which turned out to be the Cap Arcona. </sentence><sentence id="265">It was the Hamburg South American liner, 37,000 tons luxury ship, luxury ship. </sentence><sentence id="266">And they put us up in this ship. </sentence><sentence id="267">Cabins -- I was in a cabin that had three bunks and I think we had 12 or 14 people in that little cabin. </sentence><sentence id="268">And, of course, again very little to eat. </sentence><sentence id="269">And again we didn't know what happens. </sentence><sentence id="270">The rumors -- you know, by then most of the guards were old German soldiers who, who got drafted at the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="271">They ran out of younger people so they got all these old, older people to be guards that they were not SS. </sentence><sentence id="272">The, the commander and the higher officers, they were all SS people. </sentence><sentence id="273">And the rumors through these older German guards was that there is no gold on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="274">So if there is no coal on the ship, why did they put us on that ship? </sentence><sentence id="275">So all kinds of rumors right and left until May third came around and at two o'clock -- a little after two -- we heard bombs falling on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="276">And the ship started to burn. </sentence><sentence id="277">And panic and -- you know, on, on a big ship like this, there are steps going up from the "B" deck to this "A" deck and from the "C" deck to the "D" deck and -- I can't describe it because first of all, the guards were, were not no where. </sentence><sentence id="278">And there was a open door that you could see the sea. </sentence><sentence id="279">And I was on that, I think "C" Deck must have been. </sentence><sentence id="280">So I jumped just like most, most of the others who, who happened to be able to get to that door. </sentence><sentence id="281">And I was in the water, and the, the ship was burning, and we were trying to get away. </sentence><sentence id="282">Was swimming a little bit, and there was a little ship that must have been tied up to the big ship -- the morning they brought some bread and other food stuff for, for the, the guards I suppose because we never saw that kind of food -- anyway, somebody got this little ship and started to get it away from the, from the burning Cap Arcona. </sentence><sentence id="283">And I was one of the lucky ones who got on this little ship. </sentence><sentence id="284">And there were hundreds of people in that -- in the water. </sentence><sentence id="285">And what happened some people couldn't make it because there was no more room on this ship, on this little boat. </sentence><sentence id="286">7 Count Folke Bernadotte  And so they were pushed back in the water. </sentence><sentence id="287">And then they said on the right side of the bay, there was some Hitlerjugend(r) and supposedly there was some sign, sign from the ship going -- saying, "Don't pick up anybody," and they started machine gunning the people in the water. </sentence><sentence id="288">And I was lucky, on this little boat we went to the left side of the bay and there was a U-Boat Schule" -- now, what is that? </sentence><sentence id="289">Submarine school, submarine school. </sentence><sentence id="290">And we tied up this boat and we were naked and drowning and no shoes and no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="291">Hardly any, any -- you know, maybe some kind of a shirt but -- not even shirt. </sentence><sentence id="292">We didn't have shirts. </sentence><sentence id="293">We had a -- the concentration camp garb which was the blue and white marking and the numbers and so, who ever had that on you. </sentence><sentence id="294">So we got on ground, firm ground. </sentence><sentence id="295">We --I don't know who. </sentence><sentence id="296">I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="297">I don't know who, who the others were. </sentence><sentence id="298">Old, old prisoners from the Neuengamme camp. </sentence><sentence id="299">And the British tanks were coming down. </sentence><sentence id="300">And one of the first tanks stopped and pulled down the flag, the German Hakenkreuz"". </sentence><sentence id="301">They pulled down the flag and here were this, this people coming out of the water, and of course, this was the first troops of the British. </sentence><sentence id="302">They had no idea what's, what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="303">What-- who were these people? </sentence><sentence id="304">I spoke a little English and there were other people, so we, we made it clear to them what, what happened, but we didn't know what happened -- what bombed the ship. </sentence><sentence id="305">So until much later until we found out that it was the British who bombed the ships and that was not just our ship. </sentence><sentence id="306">There was three ships in the Liibeck Bay. </sentence><sentence id="307">And they were all bombed, and there were about 8,000 people who were killed in -- during those last few, few hours of, of the war, because that was May three. </sentence><sentence id="308">At that part of, of Germany, the war ended on May 3rd. </sentence><sentence id="309">The whole war ended on May eighth, so five days later, everything was over. </sentence><sentence id="310">But over here on this you know, the northern part, the idea was that the British didn't know that they there were concentration camp prisoners on these ships and since Germany was always going to try to, to win the war, they were still trying to, to push, push troops up north through Denmark, etceteras, so they figured there are ships going -- this troops whatever, so they just bombed the ships. </sentence><sentence id="311">In spite of supposedly, because of the Bernadotte mission, they were supposedly informed that there are ships with prisoners, concentration camp prisoners, in the Bay of Liibeck. </sentence><sentence id="312">Now, whether this got screwed up somewhere and, and the right people didn't get the, the message, you can't tell. </sentence><sentence id="313">But 40 years later, in 1985, a serialized book appeared in Stern magazine. </sentence><sentence id="314">And that was a very researched long article and at that time a friend of mine sent me a clipping from The London Times. </sentence><sentence id="315">The pilots of this bombing raid 40 years earlier now they found out from this Stern magazine article that they bombed concentration camp prisoners and they caused 8,000 of them to be killed at the last 8 Hitler Youth (German) deg school (German) 1deg Swastika (German)  minute of the war. </sentence><sentence id="316">They did not know it for 40 years who they were bombing on May third, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="317">And since then, of course, there are books written about, about -- No. </sentence><sentence id="318">German -- a German book that is written, a well documented, with all kinds of documents in the book, that describes everything what happened. </sentence><sentence id="319">And I don't think that too many people know -- English speaking people, know about what happened to the prisoners of Neuengamme, because the camp Neuengamme was outside of Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="320">And the lives of, of people who survived in that camp until April 20, most of them were extinguished on May third by the British by mistake. </sentence><sentence id="321">So that's, that's the story of -- that's the short story of the Cap Arcona. </sentence><sentence id="322">That was a, a fantastic luxury ship as, as we found out afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="323">It used to be. </sentence><sentence id="324">Now the ship got burned out. </sentence><sentence id="325">In the hull, of course, there were thousands of dead. </sentence><sentence id="326">It was half as wide as the depths of the water, so the hull -- half of the hull was sticking out there until, I think, eight or 10 years later that they -- I don't know on what basis and who -- the Germans, of course, took it away. </sentence><sentence id="327">But all those who died in there stayed in it. </sentence><sentence id="328">There was no way of, of getting the dead out. </sentence><sentence id="329">But there were some washed ashore while I was still in this little village two days later. </sentence><sentence id="330">The British gave us clothes. </sentence><sentence id="331">The British came with, with us and made, made the Germans open their, their houses to, to give us food, give us clothes and I remember I, I went into a, a home of, of -- I think he was either a butcher, butcher shop or some kind of a food shop -- and the Tommy not the "Tommy," but -- is that what they call it?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: Can you go back a little bit? </sentence><sentence id="543">I'd like to go back to the war and I'd like to go back to 1942, "43. </sentence><sentence id="544">The war had started. </sentence><sentence id="545">In "42, you were in a work camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="550">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="552">Q: And by "43, things had begun to change. </sentence><sentence id="553">Were you still in a work camp or had you come into Budapest by that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="557">I was, I was still in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="558">Forty-one, "42 I was playing in the, in the orchestra and solos and stuff like that in the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="559">I got drafted in "43 and with between "43, fall of 43 and fall of "44 I was in this in the army -- the Hungarian army with the, with the shovel. </sentence><sentence id="560">That was the work. </sentence><sentence id="561">That was the, the forced labor, you would, you would call, I think. </sentence><sentence id="562">That's, that's what it was because we had to work with a shovel. </sentence><sentence id="563">And we got, we got plenty of not just bad language, but bad hits, too, on, on the neck and the back of the neck. </sentence><sentence id="564">That hurts. </sentence><sentence id="565">You know, when that peasant boy from, from some farm who has two stars means he's one further up than the one who has only one star. </sentence><sentence id="566">We had no stars, and we were the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="567">We were the "dirty communists," "stinking Jew." </sentence><sentence id="568">So you can imagine how many hits you got on, on the head if, if you didn't look right or if you, you happened to, to start with the left foot in, instead of the right foot. </sentence><sentence id="569">And if the whole -- it looked to them that the whole world hangs on whether these Jews are going to make good soldiers or not, with the shovel. </sentence><sentence id="570">So it was all incongruous. </sentence><sentence id="571">The whole, the whole idea of, of us being, being in the army was absolutely meaningless. </sentence><sentence id="572">It was just a torture. </sentence><sentence id="573">And you know, the, the army discipline meted out with not just with swear words, but with hits and, and kicks and the worst kind of, of punishment for nothing! </sentence><sentence id="574">Because we were not soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="575">We were supposed to be soldiers, but we were not. </sentence><sentence id="576">And, and they had to show -- when we were in the Ukraine, we were out side of the Hungarian territories fighting the, the Hungarians and the Germans were the Axis. </sentence><sentence id="577">They were fighting the Russians and we were supposed to be helping. </sentence><sentence id="578">And we were helping aa municipal opera (German)  0 because we had to, otherwise, you got shot. </sentence><sentence id="579">So for helping pushing those carts there were no -- very few cars or trucks. </sentence><sentence id="580">These were horse-drawn big carts that were pulling the gun -- the, the big guns on, on wheels and the, the mountain was steep. </sentence><sentence id="581">And either the snow was too deep or the, the mud was too deep. </sentence><sentence id="582">So we had to help push. </sentence><sentence id="583">That was our work. </sentence><sentence id="584">That's, that's how we, we were supposed to be, be soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="585">And we got nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="586">I mean at that point, we were in the Ukraine when it was summer. </sentence><sentence id="587">We ate what we found on the fields that was not harvested. </sentence><sentence id="588">Raw cabbage, and that was delicacy. </sentence><sentence id="589">We found other stuff that wasn't so delicate. </sentence><sentence id="590">Because all we got to eat was a little piece of, of komisz"" bread that they called komisz bread that, that they called komisz bread which, you know in Hungarian means "very, very bad." </sentence><sentence id="591">That's komisz. </sentence><sentence id="592">And soup that has had nothing, nothing in it. </sentence><sentence id="593">And that was -- those were the worst times during the, the retreat because now we had to push the carts the other way because the Russians were pushing. </sentence><sentence id="594">And, and the Germans were coming with their Stuka" planes. </sentence><sentence id="595">I didn't use that word for about 40, 50 years, so I suddenly remember it. </sentence><sentence id="596">And, and then the Russians were coming. </sentence><sentence id="597">And we were in between because we were digging ditches on the side of the road so that the, the water could run down so that we don't have to -- wouldn't have to go through the mud that badly. </sentence><sentence id="598">Anyway, it was work for, for animals and we were treated like animals. </sentence><sentence id="599">And that passed too, but quite a few didn't survive it because from dysentery and, and from hunger, they were dying right and left. </sentence><sentence id="600">And these were their own people. </sentence><sentence id="601">These, these were the 21, 22 year old Jewish kids, you know. </sentence><sentence id="602">So that was -- I was one of the lucky ones who got to be sent back to get some clothes because we had just rags by then and -- to collect clothes from the Jewish organizations in Budapest -- and then we didn't get back to the, to the troops because we were deported by the, by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="603">Not really Germans, it was Hungarians who deported us, but we ended up in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="653">Q: What was Budapest like at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="655">A: Budapest was -- well, it was not bombed, and it -- there was no, no -- there were no, no street fight yet. </sentence><sentence id="656">So it was just like it was a year earlier when I left. </sentence><sentence id="657">You know, the, the blackouts in the, in the evening, not much food in the stores, but still life was going on fairly normal like under, under the same circumstances, same similar circumstances like a year earlier. </sentence><sentence id="658">There were quite a few people who, who were benefiting by the war but most of the people were just struggling along and, of course they, they did not see too many Jews because the, the, the Jews were either in, in the Swedish -- or no, the Swiss Protectorate buildings. </sentence><sentence id="659">You know, certain buildings -- then Wallenberg"* comes in the picture, sooner or later. </sentence><sentence id="660">Not at that time yet, but still the, the Swedish started to give out these protectorate papers and the Swiss and I don't know -- Portuguese? </sentence><sentence id="661">I think they had some too. </sentence><sentence id="662">But in any case they were not concentrated in the, in the so-called "ghetto." </sentence><sentence id="663">That was, that was then designated later. </sentence><sentence id="664">They were still in their buildings but people io vile (Hungarian) "S dive bomber (German) (tm) Raoul Wallenberg  1 were moving from one to the other in case they got this protectorate. </sentence><sentence id="665">So, there was -- I wasn't there, so I don't know exactly what it was -- what, what life was like when I was back there, because I was just be happy to be sitting in, in an apartment instead of on the field and to be able to, to take a bath in a bath tub. </sentence><sentence id="666">But it didn't last long because two weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="667">You know, we tried to collect the clothes and we tried to get back, and in the meantime the big, big switchover happened and we thought maybe, maybe this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="668">So the end came by being collected and, and deported. </sentence><sentence id="669">And of course that had gone on much earlier and in a much larger -- on a much larger scale in the country when they, when they took all the Jews from, from northern Hungary and from the country and most of them ended up in, in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="670">So, the story of the Cap Arcona, I think, is, is very important because it wasn't just a Jewish story. </sentence><sentence id="671">And that's why I'm so surprised -- I was always surprised that nothing was known about it in, in other than the close-by German area. </sentence><sentence id="672">I think this book -- that Cap Arcona book was, was researched and printed in, in Hamburg because all this Ltibeck, Neustadt, Hamburg, this, this is the whole area that was connected with, with the concentration camps of that area. </sentence><sentence id="673">So at least there is one supposedly I don't know if they built it already, but they were going to have some kind of a museum built in Neustadt itself which was the place that was closest to the bombing of the ship in the Bay of Ltibeck. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: When they took you down to the ship, can you tell us something about the people that were with you as you were being herded into the Cap Arcona. </sentence><sentence id="697">What was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="700">A: It's a very difficult thing to remember because you know when you are being herded you are in the middle of, of a group of people. </sentence><sentence id="701">It was normal -- the regular SS type of, of "Push, push, go, go." </sentence><sentence id="702">The, the words they, they used I, I can't even remember. </sentence><sentence id="703">It wasn't anything special. </sentence><sentence id="704">It was going from -- on the plank from one little ship into this big, big ship, one little boat really into the big ship. </sentence><sentence id="705">I don't think there was any, any special significance. </sentence><sentence id="706">I, I can't really remember how it was. </sentence><sentence id="707">I remember that we were, you know, distributed into these cabins that, that used to be luxury cabins with three, three beds, but we had 14 people in there so it wasn't so pleasant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
