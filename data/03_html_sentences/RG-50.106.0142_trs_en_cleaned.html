and translated it for them, and they were quite moved by it. </sentence><sentence id="1898">And I was pleased to be able to open their eyes to this and to be able to read them. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2133">A: I worked for my father and we -- I was stationed up in Boston for awhile learning how to become a steel scrap trader. </sentence><sentence id="2134">And it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="2135">I had problems dealing with New Englanders because they were so difficult to talk with, you know, they didn't open up. </sentence><sentence id="2136">I -- I think one of the things I learned there was that sometimes it's good to keep your mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="2137">I never forget the time I had to persuade a New England scrap dealer to sell me a carload of scrap, because we were going to ship it   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Alfred Schnog " March 10, 2001 off to -- on a ship com -- sailing out of Boston. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And he was selling all his scrap to a competitor. </sentence><sentence id="2139">And so I went in to see him -- Leroy was his name. </sentence><sentence id="2140">And I said -- I introduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I'd like to buy your scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this is what I'm ready to pay for it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="2141">And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think? </sentence><sentence id="2142">And he didn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="2143">He just sat there. </sentence><sentence id="2144">And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say something, or shouldn't I? </sentence><sentence id="2145">And I said, you know, I've just said everything that I need to say. </sentence><sentence id="2146">If he's not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. </sentence><sentence id="2147">For once in your lifetime, don't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2148">So I sat there what was an interminable amount of time and I don't know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which is ridiculous, you know, you" re sitting there and you're wondering what you're going to do, and beginning to sweat. </sentence><sentence id="2149">Should I get up and leave, what? </sentence><sentence id="2150">And he suddenly said, yup, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2151">Now, I don't know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2152">And I won't ever question it. </sentence><sentence id="2153">But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the order and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="2154">So I learned a lot from that experience. </sentence><sentence id="2155">I stayed with that company, I wasn't happy there in New England, and moved back to New York and met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father's partner for some years. </sentence><sentence id="2156">And we -- and I got into the import and export business in -- in -- in steel. </sentence><sentence id="2157">It was in the new steel business. </sentence><sentence id="2158">And in 1962 he retired from the company. </sentence><sentence id="2159">And I know he   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Schnog &gt;&gt; March 10, 2001 was -- he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. </sentence><sentence id="2160">He was in his 70's, but wanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and I'm probably about the same age he was when he retired. </sentence><sentence id="2161">And so, with my father's help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and we said, let's go out in business and start the business. </sentence><sentence id="2162">And I figured that Ben Livingston had a good reputation in the field. </sentence><sentence id="2163">If he stayed active in the business for just three years, we'd have enough grounding in order to be able to -- to run the business without him. </sentence><sentence id="2164">Well, we did. </sentence><sentence id="2165">We went out, found a small office in the Lincoln building in New York and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of mine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And we started to build the company. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was as -- he's -- he was -- h-he lived until he was 89 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2168">He came into the office every single day. </sentence><sentence id="2169">He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very close friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back and forth f-for -- for many years. </sentence><sentence id="2170">We -- I finally took over as the president of the company and it was extremely successful, it worked out quite well. </sentence><sentence id="2171">Into -- one of the interesting incidents I'1ll never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80's already and found it difficult to get around. </sentence><sentence id="2172">He was using a cane. </sentence><sentence id="2173">He was a big man, heavy, and he would start losing some of his agility. </sentence><sentence id="2174">And I was in the office talking to him, I was going to take a trip to Argentina, a business trip and I sat down and I told him   Interview with Alfred Schnog me March 10, 2001 what I was going to do, and how we were going to get around, we had a problem there, and discussed the problem with him and how best to solve it. </sentence><sentence id="2175">Suddenly the lights went out in the building and we were on the -- that time on the 21" floor of the Lincoln building. </sentence><sentence id="2176">And I said okay, let's sit around, let's see what happens. </sentence><sentence id="2177">And half an hour passed and the lights didn't come back on. </sentence><sentence id="2178">And I said, you know, something's going on. </sentence><sentence id="2179">We called up and we found out the whole east coast was blacked out. </sentence><sentence id="2180">I don't know whether you remember the big blackout. </sentence><sentence id="2181">And I said Ben, I don't know whether we're going to get home. </sentence><sentence id="2182">The trains aren't running, everything is closed down. </sentence><sentence id="2183">I just made a telephone call, the whole east coast is blacked out. </sentence><sentence id="2184">I don't -- can't -- don't think I can leave you here. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And he said well, you know something, I -- if you'll help me I -- let's go up to my club. </sentence><sentence id="2186">He was a memory of the Harmony Club up on Fifth Avenue, which was up on 60" Street. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And I said, all right, come on, I'll help you. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And we -- poor fellow, he walked down 21 flights of stairs with his cane, and we started walking uptown. </sentence><sentence id="2189">It was an extraordinary night. </sentence><sentence id="2190">You know, people didn't know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought that the Russians were sending missiles over and bombing America and we were going to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2191">People were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in New York City. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And we were walking up Fifth Avenue, straight up Fifth Avenue. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And Ben got pretty tired. </sentence><sentence id="2194">We were up near 50" Street and he was kind of exhausted by this time, and  ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Alfred Schnog *! </sentence><sentence id="2195">March 10, 2001 there was Saint Patrick's Cathedral right there next to us. </sentence><sentence id="2196">And I said Ben, you know, why don't we go inside and sit down, you know, you can use a spell of rest, and I -- and he said you know Al, that's a good idea, let's go. </sentence><sentence id="2197">So we went to Saint Patrick's cathe -- Cathedral, which was amazing. </sentence><sentence id="2198">It was lit up by candles and people, you know, they were afraid, they didn't know what was happening and they were praying and i-it was an extraordinary sight. </sentence><sentence id="2199">And we sat down, we just sat and relaxed for awhile until -- and I observed all this, the people crying, people in fear, people not knowing where they were going to go, people just resting like we were. </sentence><sentence id="2200">And finally Ben said okay, I think I'm up to going a little bit further. </sentence><sentence id="2201">And we marched from there the next 10 blocks to get up to the Harmony Club. </sentence><sentence id="2202">We walked in and he said, come on up to the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="2203">We went up to the second floor, wherever it was and there were these huge leather chairs. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And we just plopped down and he said okay, now what will you drink? </sentence><sentence id="2205">And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening. </sentence><sentence id="2206">And eventually I think I found my way home by -- I left Ben there, I knew he was taken care of and I found my way home with a group of other guys

well. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And it came time to renegotiate the contract and we renegotiated it and then -- for two -- for two more years. </sentence><sentence id="2299">And then they got
