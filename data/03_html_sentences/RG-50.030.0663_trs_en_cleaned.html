" </sentence><sentence id="223">What are you saying?" </sentence><sentence id="224">I says, "Jesus Christ was a Jew." " </sentence><sentence id="225">You're out of your mind. </sentence><sentence id="226">"I says, "Go and ask your father, your priest or anybody you want." </sentence><sentence id="227">That was the last time I heard from him. </sentence><sentence id="228">This was just a little episode that I like to tell because it was, to me, very satisfying to find out that Jesus Christ was a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
