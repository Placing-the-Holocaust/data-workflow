<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1016">Q: We left off just at the beginning of the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And there was one thing that you mentioned which we didn't talk about a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1018">You said that you had a fiancee at the time and you said that you were considering yourselves to be engaged. </sentence><sentence id="1019">What did you mean by that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1024">A: Well you know, I met him just the Summer before and he was one of the boys, young men that was very popular and we started just going out, dating. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And in those days you just held hands. </sentence><sentence id="1026">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And then we were talking that eventually maybe we will get married because we had a lot of things in common. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And he introduced me to his family who liked me very much, but there was nothing about getting married really because nobody was getting married until they finished school and started to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And so we were just beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1030">We were going together steadily. </sentence><sentence id="1031">And so that's the situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1040">Q: What was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1042">A: His name was Yannosh Fanyo (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1043">He was Hungarian but everybody called him Yannick, which is Polish John". </sentence><sentence id="1044">And his family spoke Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="1045">They spoke a little bit Polish, a lot of German and English, but mainly Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="1046">And so at home he was called Yannosh or Yanchie, but I called him Yannick. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And he played the violin very, very, well he played piano too but he was a very good violinist and his sister played the piano and his mother played too. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And his father was in some kind of an import-export business, I don't know exactly what it was, but they were quite well-to-do and they had Hungarian passports and they lived in a very beautiful apartment, also in a very nice section of town, and they were very cultured people and they had musical too, which use to be a very popular past time in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1049">Especially during the war where the movies were closed, movie houses were closed, theaters were closed and there was really no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Everything was taken over by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1051">NightClubs were always very popular in    Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1052">There were a lot of them in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And cafes. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They were all taken over by the Germans so there was really no place to go and nothing to do, so a lot of people entertained at home. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And so, especially the Fanyo family was very musical and these were very, very pleasant things, times where they had the . </sentence><sentence id="1056">So that's how the story went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1073">Q: Did he spend any time at your home with your family as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1075">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="1076">He would come to our house and stay for dinner and my parents liked him very much. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And he was a very, very pleasant fellow to be around. </sentence><sentence id="1078">And also we entertained some friends until things started to get pretty bad. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I mean as far as the Germans were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And the family still lived quite well because they, as Hungarian citizens, and at that time Hungary was sort of partners with Germany, they could purchase food and necessities in the so-called volk-doych (ph) stores, which were off limits for the Polish people and definitely off-limits for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1081">But people of German descent could register themselves as volk-doych (ph) and they could participate in purchases in those special stores. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Which were full of food and anything you wanted, really. </sentence><sentence id="1083">So the Fanyo's (ph) lived quite well and I enjoyed being with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1093">Q: How did you meet him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1095">A: The swimming pool. </sentence><sentence id="1096">This was another past time that we had in the summer. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Starting when school was out in June, we all would gather in a public swimming pool. </sentence><sentence id="1098">It was a huge, huge pool and that's where we would spend days. </sentence><sentence id="1099">That was the past time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1105">Q: Do you remember feeling afraid during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1107">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1108">At the beginning, now I felt very uneasy about the Germans and about the whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="1109">But we were, at the beginning, we were very free to do whatever we wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="1110">I don't remember exactly when they started registering, but it was right at the beginning, that Jews had to register and then I think that we didn't have to start wearing the white, in Krakow you wore the    white arm bands with the blue star of David, and everything, the Germans had a system. </sentence><sentence id="1111">You see they didn't just file everything, all the bad things all at once. </sentence><sentence id="1112">It was very, very gradual so you somehow seemed to get use to it. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And at first it was registering, then it was the armbands, then you couldn't ride in the front of the streetcar, then you couldn't ride the streetcar at all. </sentence><sentence id="1114">You couldn't go into the park. </sentence><sentence id="1115">You couldn't do a lot of things but it was all so gradual that you almost didn't realize that that was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And then they started talk about the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1117">That all the Jews will have to live in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1118">But that didn't happen until really 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And so a whole year went by where we moved around and things were quite, you may say even safe. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And my parents were getting ready to go to ghetto and I said that I did not want to go to ghetto because, I just felt, that's when I really started to get afraid. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And I remember I even said something that, what would happen if they would just close the ghetto one beautiful day and set fire to it. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And everybody thought I was just being ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="1123">I mean, nobody would do a thing like that. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Why would they do it? </sentence><sentence id="1125">I said, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1126">We read about Christalnaught (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1127">We read about things that happened in Germany and why wouldn't they happen here? </sentence><sentence id="1128">Everybody thought I was just ridiculous and exaggerating. </sentence><sentence id="1129">And the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) made arrangements to take over the tannery. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And have my father, my Uncle and my brother work there as essential to running the tannery so they would be safe and, at that time, we still lived in our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1131">And since they couldn't conveniently go by street car, the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) had a horse and buggy right in their back yard instead of in the garage. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And there was a stable in the back and they would transport my father and my brother and my Uncle to the factory, which was quite a ways away. </sentence><sentence id="1133">It was at the other end of the town. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And so everything seemed to be going quite well and the business was good. </sentence><sentence id="1135">Mr. Mo-stof-ski (ph) was running it and he was a lawyer, he knew all kinds of angles as far as business was concerned, and they gave my father and my Uncle money to live on. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And plenty. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Then the Germans started invading people's apartments and homes    and they simply taking whatever they wanted to take. </sentence><sentence id="1138">They came one evening to our house and they tagged furniture and they tagged the , which was our most precious possession, and several other things, and that's when my father started to get a little bit concerned, not scared. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And then again the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) came to the rescue. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Oh, the Jews were forbidden to own any furs, fur coats, and being in the leather business, of course, my mother had not one but several fur coats, and the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) took those. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And we had some very beautiful furniture, especially my parent's bedroom set was mahogany and some very exotic woods. </sentence><sentence id="1142">There were large wardrobes and dressers, so they took that. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And several other things. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And also jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="1145">So things were still not bad. </sentence><sentence id="1146">But then when the talk about ghetto was closer and closer, I just said, "I will not go to ghetto". </sentence><sentence id="1147">And that's when a friend of ours suggested that Yannosh and I get married. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And this way I would be a Hungarian citizen, I would be on his passport. </sentence><sentence id="1149">I didn't have to go to ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And my parents were sort of opposing to it. </sentence><sentence id="1151">They thought I was way too young to get married. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I was only nineteen, but I had just turned nineteen that January, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1153">And they, but they agreed. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And as a matter of fact, my mother gave me her wedding band and my father gave Yannosh his wedding band. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So that we could have wedding bands for getting married and we did get married by some Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="1156">It was a very short ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="1157">My mother was too ill, as I mentioned before, she was sick after the birth of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And so she was not witnessing, but my father went and my brother and Yannosh and I and we had a very brief ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="1159">But we were married legally and I moved into his parent's house, or apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1160">And then I went to visit my, by then my mother and father and Uncle and Aunt and my brother and my sister moved to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1161">They had a fairly large apartment, which they shared, but not for very long because they put more and more people into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1162">They also brought people from other towns and they had to, they were allowed only one bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And then my Uncle and my Aunt had another very small bedroom, but my father, my sister, my brother, they    all were in one bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And then they all shared the kitchen and one bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1165">So it wasn't exactly the luxury we lived in but still my father was working and they had enough food because he could, he went to work every day and he brought back food and there were no really preserves and refrigerators as such at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1166">In Poland they were in very bad . </sentence><sentence id="1167">You went shopping everyday for food and so he brought fresh food everyday. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And my mother was able to, with the help of my Aunt, to run the household up to a point. </sentence><sentence id="1169">So things weren't really bad. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And I went and visited them practically every day. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Because I was free to go whereever I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I didn't have to wear the band. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1242">Q: Why not? </sentence><sentence id="1243">Why didn't you have to wear the band? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1246">A: Because I was a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1247">At least I thought I was. </sentence><sentence id="1248">There was something scribbled in his passport, I didn't have a passport of my own. </sentence><sentence id="1249">But we went to some office and they scribbled my name on the passport. </sentence><sentence id="1250">Evidently it was still a German consul, but he couldn't issue me a passport, but he put my name on my husband's passport, so I was, at least I considered myself safe. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Until one beautiful day, there was what is called , which means "to catch". </sentence><sentence id="1252">There was a catching business going on. </sentence><sentence id="1253">The German police would stop every streetcar and let all the people out and check their identification. </sentence><sentence id="1254">And that was the first time that I got a taste of what could happen. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Because I did not have an identification. </sentence><sentence id="1256">I told them my husband has the identification. </sentence><sentence id="1257">I got a slap over my face to shut up. </sentence><sentence id="1258">And I was put on a truck with another girl and there were several other people on it. </sentence><sentence id="1259">And we were taken to the Gestapo office. </sentence><sentence id="1260">And I don't remember the address exactly, but I know it was the main Gestapo headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="1261">And the girl that was with me was Jewish too and she had no identification at all. </sentence><sentence id="1262">And she was crying and wailing and she said, "they are going to kill us." </sentence><sentence id="1263">And I said, "Oh, don't be ridiculous." </sentence><sentence id="1264">I mean, I just gave them my husband's phone number. </sentence><sentence id="1265">They still were allowed to have a phone, the Hungarian citizens. </sentence><sentence id="1266">So they will get in touch with him and everything will be all right. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And what I didn't know about the girl, evidently she was outside the ghetto without papers, hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And she was waiting for some false papers to be given to her. </sentence><sentence id="1269">But at that point she didn't have them. </sentence><sentence id="1270">Well anyway, the Gestapo were quite mean to her. </sentence><sentence id="1271">They were all uniformed and they were quite mean to us. </sentence><sentence id="1272">They were shouting and then asking questions and I kept on insisting that I was a Hungarian citizen and they should get in touch with my husband and let me go. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And I remember they put us against the wall, facing the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And it was a little creepy because the girl started to cry and she started to point at the spots on the wall and she says, "That looks like blood and they are going to shoot us, and I know they will shoot us". </sentence><sentence id="1275">And they did have guns. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And, but that was the first time when I faced that maybe they will shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And it's a very funny feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1278">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1279">You are completely helpless. </sentence><sentence id="1280">You cannot do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And you just stand there. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And you feel kind of a creepy feeling on the back of, between you're shoulders, and you wonder, are they going to shoot between the shoulders or are they going to shoot you in the head? </sentence><sentence id="1283">And I think I got a little bit sick to my stomach but I didn't cry. </sentence><sentence id="1284">I just was waiting. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And then one of the guys walked up to us and just turned us around by the shoulders and started to ask more questions. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And they took the girl away, but they were asking me more questions and more questions, and they wanted to know where my parents were and why I was there and what was I doing? </sentence><sentence id="1287">And I don't exactly remember all the answers I gave them, but I know that I insisted that they call my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1288">And finally they brought some woman who took me to a, I guess a kind of a mass prison for other women that they were catching or who ever they were, and we just slept on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1289">There was a bucket in the comer. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And no sanitary facilities of any kind except the bucket. </sentence><sentence id="1291">And I didn't like it, but I decided I am going to just sit and wait. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And the next morning, I didn't get anything to eat, the next morning they gave us some coffee and some bread and anyway, I    stayed there for about two days. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And low and behold, my husband came to get me and they let me go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1344">Q: Did they know that you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1347">But they let me go because I was a Hungarian citizen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1350">Q: Were you registered? </sentence><sentence id="1351">Did you go to register when it was required? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1354">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1355">I didn't register because, you see, I was not going to go to ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1356">So I didn't have the, it was called the chem-card (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1357">So I wasn't registered Jewish because that's when you had to register, when you went to ghetto and I did not register because I wasn't going to go there. </sentence><sentence id="1358">But anybody who couldn't prove they are either Polish identity or German identity was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Or had something to hide. </sentence><sentence id="1360">So they let me go and we still were in the apartment at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1361">And that was the end of my going out. </sentence><sentence id="1362">Because I just would not go out of the house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1372">Q: When was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1374">A: That was about the beginning of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1375">It was spring of 1941 because I know I still had my nice, winter coat with the sable fur no less. </sentence><sentence id="1376">My mother had sables that she brought from Russia and she finally, one day, it was still before the war, she decided that I can have a coat trimmed with these sables. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And I had a big muff and a fur collar and a hat. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And I have a picture of that someplace, in a family album. </sentence><sentence id="1379">So anyway, I stayed home. </sentence><sentence id="1380">I would not leave. </sentence><sentence id="1381">But then things happened to the Hungarians too. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And we were evicted from the fancy apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1392">Q: This was in 1941 also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: No that was already in 1942, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Because that was after Hungary, no, I really don't remember exactly the dates, but I know that it was, in 1942 we lived in an apartment near the barber, near the castle. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And then they decided to tear this down, tear the building down because they were going to build something else there. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And we found an apartment near the ghetto in the    basement. </sentence><sentence id="1398">And my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law made a living by teaching English in secret. </sentence><sentence id="1399">And that's where these friends of mine came into picture. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I wrote the whole story about them to, how they were helping us throughout it. </sentence><sentence id="1401">They were helping us with the apartments and with other things because it was one of my school friends and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="1402">The mother had a small jewelry store and perfume store and she had all kinds of connections. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And, but this is a story for itself and I have about fourteen pages written up for the ee about it. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And she was very, very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1405">My mother-in-law had quite a bit of jewelry, which Mrs. was her name, would sell it for us for a good price. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And she was very, very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And then finally, she also permitted my sister-in-law and my mother-in-law to use their apartment for classes, for the English lessons. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Because this was the only means of support we had at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1409">My husband was working in a German furniture store but after a while he lost that job and so he wasn't working anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Then we moved, when the ghetto was being enlarged and the apartment in the basement where we lived was going to be enclosed in the ghetto, we had to move. </sentence><sentence id="1411">And we moved to a village called Why-give-neek-ee (ph), which was a suburb of Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="1412">And we rented a house out in the country from a man called Borcha Hur-oog (ph), to this day I remember, and it was a Krakow-ofska 493, or something like that address and I tried to find it. </sentence><sentence id="1413">And Why-give-neek-ee (ph) is a big city now. </sentence><sentence id="1414">At that time it was a country-kind of a small house with no indoor plumbing and the water was from the well, you had to put a bucket down and then crack up a bucket and bring the water up. </sentence><sentence id="1415">And it was an outhouse in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="1416">Also another thing that happened in the meantime is that my father-in-law had a stroke and he had a heart condition and he was partially paralyzed. </sentence><sentence id="1417">He was ina bad shape. </sentence><sentence id="1418">But slowly he recovered somewhat that he was able to walk around but one arm was paralyzed and his speech was slightly slurred, so he stayed home most of the time with me and the    grandmother while the sister, my husband's sister and his mother went to town to give English lessons. </sentence><sentence id="1419">So that was my country living. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1448">Q: So tell me again, how many people you were living with in you're husband's house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1450">A: There were six of us, including me. </sentence><sentence id="1451">There was the grandmother, the father, the mother, the sister, my husband and I. There were six of us. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And we had a kitchen and a bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And the grandmother, the father and mother slept in the bedroom and this is their, my husband and I slept in the kitchen on sort of a rolled out mattress. </sentence><sentence id="1454">During the day we rolled it up and put it aside and at night you unrolled it. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Sort of an old-day futon. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And it was very primitive type of living. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And we lived there until 1944, April of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1458">When Germany invaded Hungary, they were not alias anymore, they were conquered country and that's when the Hungarian Jews started to be deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1468">Q: Okay, before we go into that, would you, when you lived in this country spot, in this smaller place in the suburb of Krakow, did you continue to go to the ghetto to visit you're family? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1502">Q: So when did you're father, when was you're father deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1504">A: My father was deported with the first transport from Krakow, which was, as far as I remember, it was first few days in June when they rounded them up. </sentence><sentence id="1505">I think June 3rd or June Sth, I think June Sth is when the train left and June 3rd, Wednesday, June 3rd was when I was standing and discussing all with my husband, waiting for the people to leave the ghetto and be marched to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="1506">And when we were in Krakow, the first time, I was telling Robert, describing it, and we were looking for it and we couldn't find it until . . . </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1507">[End of Side A of Tape 2] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1508">Q: And could you just start at the beginning with that story again? </sentence><sentence id="1509">You and you're husband went back to Krakow? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1510">A: Robert, this husband. </sentence><sentence id="1511">Because that's already a third husband. </sentence><sentence id="1512">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1513">Anyway, Robert and I went back to Poland and we went to the for the , which was, the , a drug store which was in the ghetto, and right now it is a museum. </sentence><sentence id="1514">And Mrs.Swaveka Karlingska (ph) is one of the, was one of the, I don't know if she still is there, people that ran the museum, and she told us that the people from ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1515">You see, I only thought that they went to the main train station but she told us exactly where they went and so we traced that road and we found the grassy knoll and I told Robert that there was a little religious statue on it and we found it. </sentence><sentence id="1516">Because I remember standing right next to it when the people from ghetto in rows of four started coming out and very slowly they were marched with the SS men and the dogs and the whole business. </sentence><sentence id="1517">Right through the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1518">And I did see my father. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And after that, I think I started to cry and my husband grabbed me. </sentence><sentence id="1520">Because there were a lot of people, Polish people standing there and jeering really, and "Getting rid of the Jews", and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And I know he was afraid that somebody will notice that I am crying so he grabbed me and led me out of there, against my better judgment, but anyway, I left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1536">Q: You knew about the deportation before it happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1538">A: Well we were told that they are going, that some of the people have to deport and have to report at this particular office. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And that they will be resettled to a, to some factory. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And they wanted people who were trained in certain jobs. </sentence><sentence id="1541">And Mr. Mo-stof-ski (ph), father, was trying to get my father out of that registration because he said that he needed him to run the factory. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1542">But they said that he had my Uncle to do it so he didn't need my father. </sentence><sentence id="1543">You see, my father was really just in his fifties but he had white hair and so he looked probably much older than he really was. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And Mo-stof-ski (ph) couldn't do anything to get him out of that. </sentence><sentence id="1545">So I knew that they are going to be deported but I wasn't sure whether my father was rescued or not. </sentence><sentence id="1546">Mo-stof-ski (ph) didn't know either. </sentence><sentence id="1547">So that's why I went to the knoll, to see who was really going, and I saw some friends of mine and another girl that I went to school with and her father and her sister. </sentence><sentence id="1548">But they were very heavily guarded and one could not do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1549">And my father, I remember him standing there with a small suitcase and he had this mannerism of scratching his head when things weren't so, I remember him scratching his head. </sentence><sentence id="1550">And then my husband took me away from there. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And then, you see, I could go to the ghetto by just showing that piece of paper that I had from the government. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1552">And so I went to the ghetto the next morning because they kept the ghetto closed that day, but the next morning they again let the workers go out and people come in. </sentence><sentence id="1553">So I went to visit and my mother, of course, was very, very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1554">But she said that she was hoping that everything will be all right. </sentence><sentence id="1555">They promised that they will be put to work and then maybe even she will be able to join him later on. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And it seems to me now, I don't quite remember whether it was my Uncle or whether it was my father, but she got a post card from somewhere, that the transport arrived and that everybody was all right. </sentence><sentence id="1557">And then there is a crazy thing, my mother was superstitious or something, she believed in all kinds of signs and, if a bird knocked on the window it was a bad sign, and my </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1558"> father left her his watch, his pocket watch, and she said the glass cracked. </sentence><sentence id="1559">I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1560">I saw the glass cracked. </sentence><sentence id="1561">And she said he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1562">And I told her, "This is silly." </sentence><sentence id="1563">Maybe somebody knocked the watch over and what not, and she said "No", it was by her bed table and all of a sudden the glass cracked. </sentence><sentence id="1564">And I didn't believe that, I felt it was all crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And anyway, I would come to the ghetto and bring her the food and whatever else they needed and I went there practically every day. </sentence><sentence id="1566">My brother was in and I saw him and he could come out and visit too. </sentence><sentence id="1567">And then he had a girlfriend on the outside, a Polish girl that use to work in the lab, the laboratory. </sentence><sentence id="1568">And then, when Mo-stof-ski (ph) took over the factory he transferred her to the factory and she was a secretary there and she was helping my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1569">And one day, she told me that he was taken on a transport to Czestochowa, to some factory. </sentence><sentence id="1570">And I never heard from him again. </sentence><sentence id="1571">Though her brother, Da-new-chef (ph) was her name, her brother lived in Czestochowa, and he kept in touch with my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1572">But when we went back to Poland, I tried to find out what, whether it was a camp or a factory, what happened to those people in Czestochowa and I just couldn't find it. </sentence><sentence id="1573">Na-new-sha's (ph) brother died and I had her address and I wrote to her many times, but she's not a young woman anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1574">And she may be dead for all I know. </sentence><sentence id="1575">So she is the only one who really was in touch with my brother before I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1576">So I have no idea what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="1577">And every year we go, I try to find her, I try to find anybody that would know about anybody from taken to Czestochowa, and I wasn't able to find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1578">So that's the story on that. </sentence><sentence id="1579">And then we are coming closer to the march, thirteen's or whenever that was, that was 1943, which was the like liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1580">My mother was partially paralyzed too, I mean her arm was bad. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1581">But she still could get around. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And my sister was five years old, she was born March 6th. </sentence><sentence id="1583">And I was there for her birthday. </sentence><sentence id="1584">I brought her chocolate and stuff, and some toys. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And you could, the streetcar went from , the place that I lived out in the country. </sentence><sentence id="1586">It had to go    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1587"> through the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1588">So I would cross the ghetto and then get out and go through the gate. </sentence><sentence id="1589">And it took three days for the ghetto to be liquidated, but I made arrangements with Dan-o-sha (ph) to get my sister out. </sentence><sentence id="1590">My mother didn't want to, but she was very realistic and she thought, yes, that I should take the girl. </sentence><sentence id="1591">We had false papers for her and I brought Dan-o-sha (ph) the girl's clothes and I remember there was a little coverlet for her crib, she was five years old but she still had it, and we bribed the guard and I was suppose to go in and take her out. </sentence><sentence id="1592">And the ghetto was closed. </sentence><sentence id="1593">I could not get in. </sentence><sentence id="1594">They still let the streetcar go through because that was the only way that people could get from one end of the town to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1595">But the doors were closed. </sentence><sentence id="1596">The SS men were hanging on the cars to make sure that nobody even opened the window or anything and let people go there. </sentence><sentence id="1597">I don't know how many times I went back and forth the first day. </sentence><sentence id="1598">And there was no way I can get the child out. </sentence><sentence id="1599">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1600">And then, you probably saw enough of the photographs and pictures, from Schindler's film and from this and that, and you know what it looked like. </sentence><sentence id="1601">It looked probably much worse than anything you saw in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="1602">And so, I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1603">I know some people were taken on transport to Prostejov but these were young people who could be still working. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Then most people were killed right in the ghetto, but then they said that there were several transports of women and children taken to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1605">And I could not find, I was in Auschwitz and I tried to find out whether there were transports that came. </sentence><sentence id="1606">There was another crazy story, that there was one truck with the children and women that broke down and didn't come with the main transport. </sentence><sentence id="1607">And that the people on that truck were put in the camp and not killed right away. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And I had this imagination that my mother and sister were on that truck. </sentence><sentence id="1609">But even then, my mother was crippled really and I know she couldn't possibly survive. </sentence><sentence id="1610">And my little sister, every time we go to Auschwitz, I watch the movie that they show and there is one little girl with these big eyes, showing her number on her arm, and I always think maybe it was my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1611">Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And Ches-wap (ph) gave    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1613"> me pictures of my sister when she was about three years old. </sentence><sentence id="1614">My father, Ches-wap (ph) was an amateur photographer too and he's the one who, my father asked whether he could make pictures of my sister and a couple of years ago when we were visiting, he said I have something for you. </sentence><sentence id="1615">And yet I didn't bring the large one, but I just brought these small ones. </sentence><sentence id="1616">And I had this fantasy that, they say that you can take photographs and make computer pictures to see what a child would look at an older age, and I always have the fantasy that maybe I could have that done, but it's just crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1617">Even if I find out that the little girl, or some other little girl in the picture was a survivor, how am I going to find my sister? </sentence><sentence id="1618">So, one thing that I knew, that she had a mole on her left shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="1619">And several years ago there was a story of a Israeli actress. </sentence><sentence id="1620">She was exactly the same age as my sister would have been. </sentence><sentence id="1621">And she was in Auschwitz as a little child and she survived. </sentence><sentence id="1622">And I was going to write to her but I thought she would think it was some crank, you know, writing her. </sentence><sentence id="1623">And I was going to write to her to ask her whether she has a mole on her left shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="1624">But you know, you live with these things, and, oh, stop, please. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1625">[Pause here

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1635">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1636">Not until we got to the or when the museum in the former ghetto, in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="1637">And we found the chronology of the bands, that people were transported from, with the first    transport from Krakow, that they were transported to Belzec and then she pulled out, Mrs. Kar-ling- ska (ph) pulled out the book and said, this is what happened in Belzec. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And that was the first time I found out what happened to my father. </sentence><sentence id="1639">And then the next transport was in October, I believe, and my Uncle and his wife went on that transport. </sentence><sentence id="1640">So, and that was the first time I found out that there was such places, at Belzec. </sentence><sentence id="1641">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1642">After all these years. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1654">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Not according to the description of the book, in the book. </sentence><sentence id="1656">I mean, I know, well, the book that we got, there was one survivor that escaped and no body else. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And I know that there is, well first of all, my father would be 100 years old, so that wouldn't be possible, of course, but I know that he did not, nobody survived from that transport. </sentence><sentence id="1658">So, at least I may say I felt a little bit better knowing exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1659">Because I think not knowing is probably the worst part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And it is a little bit late for me to start searching because, even if my brother survived, he would be 72 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And how many people do you know that lived to be 72 years old? </sentence><sentence id="1662">I don't know too many. </sentence><sentence id="1663">So it is kind of little late to start really searching. </sentence><sentence id="1664">But I still somehow believe that maybe my little sister survived. </sentence><sentence id="1665">Maybe I should have looked for her. </sentence><sentence id="1666">When we go back, we can look. </sentence><sentence id="1667">I know she was not in Bergen-Belsen, but maybe she was in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And maybe she was in Bergen, no, they didn't have children in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="1669">Because when they liquidated Auschwitz, they were transporting everybody, just the grown-ups. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And I don't know how those children did that in the movie, survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2074">Q: What about the rest of your husband's family? </sentence><sentence id="2075">Were you still with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2078">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="2079">The father had to have his nitroglycerin, which he didn't have, and he died I think about two weeks after we arrived in camp, in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2080">He was doing okay in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="2081">We had the medicine for him and he had angina in addition to the stroke and he had to have nitroglycerin. </sentence><sentence id="2082">And it seems to me that he got it from the Germans, the medication, when we were in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="2083">Because he did get, he had the drops that you put on the tongue, you know, when you would get choked up. </sentence><sentence id="2084">And I think he had some pills. </sentence><sentence id="2085">Otherwise, nobody else did any medication but when we arrived in Auschwitz, I know that Yannosh came and told us that father died. </sentence><sentence id="2086">And Yannosh, I don't know whether he had tuberculosis of the bone when he was a child or was it a birth defect, I just don't remember what it was, but he had a deformed hip. </sentence><sentence id="2087">He was a very handsome guy, he danced and everything, the leg didn't bother him. </sentence><sentence id="2088">But he did limp. </sentence><sentence id="2089">But still he could get around and he was not put in the gas chamber, you know, at the beginning when, I mean, after we were rescued from the gas chamber he was put in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And I saw him several times, he came to visit because some of the men could come into the camp with some errands and they would bring food or they would bring something and he would sneak out and say hello or, sometimes, he could even come to the fence. </sentence><sentence id="2091">And the only thing I know about him is that when we were in Paris, when I was in Paris with Vickie, trying to get the exit visa, and there were many other people from all over Germany and there were several people from Auschwitz, several men. </sentence><sentence id="2092">And I wanted to know if they knew because he wasn't just like one of the prisoners, he really had very distinct limp and he was a little bit different. </sentence><sentence id="2093">And they knew him. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And they said that one day there was a selection and he was selected out. </sentence><sentence id="2095">And they never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="2096">So I assume that he was gassed and done with. </sentence><sentence id="2097">And then the mother, the sister, Betsy and I were together all the time, except for the short time when I was very ill and I was in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2098">And then they were going to have a selection in the hospital and the nurses got me out the day before because they said that the hospital was going to be liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="2099">So whomever they could get out. </sentence><sentence id="2100">What was wrong with me is that I got some kind of an infantago infection, or whatever it was, on my legs. </sentence><sentence id="2101">And I had sores all the way to the bone, oozing, and then it was . </sentence><sentence id="2102">It was a big mess and my legs were extremely swollen. </sentence><sentence id="2103">But still they said I have to be able to walk out of there because otherwise I will be finished. </sentence><sentence id="2104">And they put some bandages on my legs and they got me out. </sentence><sentence id="2105">And then I still had to go on the roll call every morning, get up. </sentence><sentence id="2106">But I was able to walk and I was able to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="2107">And so that's how I survived that ordeal. </sentence><sentence id="2108">But if you look closely you can still see the spots on my legs. </sentence><sentence id="2109">For years and years I had big blotches. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And mother, just before, in December, just before the camp was evacuated we had another selection and they separated there with us and Doot- sie (ph), Ida, we called her Doot-sie (ph) wanted to go with her and they separated them and the mother was put in what they call Schul-Newtz (ph) block, which was preservation block, and all the old and weak women were put there. </sentence><sentence id="2111">And we went to visit her a couple of times and she said she knew that they were going to be just gassed because they couldn't, they had the work and they couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2112">She was extremely emaciated and she was getting really weaker and weaker and one day we went to see her and the block was empty. </sentence><sentence id="2113">They took them all out. </sentence><sentence id="2114">And Doot-sie (ph) was very, very close to her mother and I think that really shocked her terribly and she cried and cried for days and we couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2115">And she got terribly skinny in the last couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2116">Betsy and I were pretty skinny too, but nothing like Doot-sie (ph) was just started to look like a skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="2117">And then when they selected us again, they selected me and Betsy for the train and Doot- sie (ph) stayed. </sentence><sentence id="2118">And this was the 29th of December and I don't have the date when the Russians came to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2119">But I am sure it is dated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2164">Q: But before we goon... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2166">A: Doot-sie (ph) survived. </sentence><sentence id="2167">Because you asked me what happened to the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence id="2168">So it was just Betsy and I were taken to Bergen-Belsen and Doot-sie (ph) stayed in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2169">And then I understand that she was rescued by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And when we watched the movie, it seems to me, one of them looked like Doot-sie (ph), one of the women that was being taken by the nuns, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2171">But then when we got in touch with Renya Chich-en-ska (ph) whose house they taught English, I got an exact report on what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2172">Doot-sie (ph) was rescued by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2173">She stayed in Auschwitz in whatever camp they had them until they evacuated them, and then she came back to Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="2174">And she came to the Deit-chin-ski (ph) house and she stayed with them for six months. </sentence><sentence id="2175">She also had these sores on her legs. </sentence><sentence id="2176">But they got her cured. </sentence><sentence id="2177">And something horrible happened to Doot-sie (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2178">She got a job with the joint, United joint, what was it? </sentence><sentence id="2179">The Jewish Joint Institution, it was working in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="2180">And Rayna (ph) did not know why, but there was some kind of improprieties in the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="2181">By then the Communist government was, took over Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="2182">And Doot-sie (ph) was arrested by the Communists and put in prison for eight years. </sentence><sentence id="2183">She was in prison for eight years. </sentence><sentence id="2184">Since 1954 or so until 1962. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And then she was released and went to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="2186">Now there was a cousin of theirs in Stockholm. </sentence><sentence id="2187">The family, they were first cousins, and the Uncle and Aunt I suppose and the young cousin, immigrated to Stockholm and he came to Krakow, or he came and took her to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And he came to visit her several times. </sentence><sentence id="2189">I got it all from Deitch- chin-ski (ph) and from the cousin from Stockholm, he wrote me a letter. </sentence><sentence id="2190">That Doot-sie (ph) got married and her husband died after three years. </sentence><sentence id="2191">And then she got a stoke and she was very ill for quite some time, paralyzed, and she died in Budapest in 1982. </sentence><sentence id="2192">But she did survive the war but it was very, very sad, what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="2193">So that's what happened to the Fanyo (ph) family. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2230"> of those members of the family. </sentence><sentence id="2231">And I am interested in going back to Bergen-Belsen, the first time that you went there. </sentence><sentence id="2232">And I believe you mentioned you arrived in May of 1944 and you were there until August, is that correct? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2233">A: That's as I remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2235">Q: And I wondered if you could tell me, you mentioned that you met a friend, Betsy Gordon, and that you were, at first you weren't working but then you were working doing sewing with her? </sentence><sentence id="2236">And I wondered if you could say how it happened that you came to, that you met her and you started working there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2239">A: Well it seems to me that Betsy, now I don't remember whether we arrived in the camp and then she arrived later or she was already there. </sentence><sentence id="2240">Because we were together with the other Hungarian people. </sentence><sentence id="2241">And even though she came from Italy and she lived in Italy and she was a dancer, I don't know exactly what kind of dancer, but I know that she looked like an actress with lots of make-up and the dyed hair. </sentence><sentence id="2242">And she was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="2243">And she was there. </sentence><sentence id="2244">It seems to me like she already was there. </sentence><sentence id="2245">That she was deported just like we were, as a Hungarian citizen living abroad. </sentence><sentence id="2246">Living in a country that was occupied or in some way connected with Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2247">And we were all in the same barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2248">And the barracks were very clean, they were very well kept. </sentence><sentence id="2249">And we slept in bunk beds which were just regular bunk bends, you know, lower bunk and upper bunk. </sentence><sentence id="2250">And the older people slept in the lower bunks and the younger slept in the upper bunks. </sentence><sentence id="2251">And I don't quite remember whether, I know we had blankets. </sentence><sentence id="2252">I don't think we had linens as such. </sentence><sentence id="2253">I can't remember, I just don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2254">But I know there were mattresses, there wasn't just a board with maybe some straw or maybe just a thin blanket. </sentence><sentence id="2255">But there were, they might have been straw mattresses, which are very popular in Europe, or they might have been just some kind of things, sacks filled up with whatever filling they had. </sentence><sentence id="2256">And anyway, they were not as bad as we had come later in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2257">And    everything was very clean. </sentence><sentence id="2258">We had to clean it ourselves but there were brooms and there were cleaning supplies and there was a wash room and a bathroom with running water. </sentence><sentence id="2259">So the things weren't really, it was not as primitive as some other camps. </sentence><sentence id="2260">And I know that at first we didn't do anything and it was rather boring. </sentence><sentence id="2261">And there were a lot of people from Holland, I think I mentioned that, diamond cutters. </sentence><sentence id="2262">And they definitely would not work in anything. </sentence><sentence id="2263">They were kind of sheltered because their hands could not get ruined because they wouldn't be able to do the precision work evidently that's required of a diamond cutter. </sentence><sentence id="2264">So they were more sheltered. </sentence><sentence id="2265">And I don't really remember exactly what we were doing and what we were sewing, but it seemed it wasn't on sewing machines. </sentence><sentence id="2266">It seems to me that we were repairing things, maybe they were uniforms, maybe they were just things from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2267">I just don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2268">But I know that we didn't just sit idly the whole time. </sentence><sentence id="2269">And again we had three meals a day, I mean there were no scrambled eggs for breakfast, there was just maybe a piece of bread with some margarine and coffee, which was usually kind of brown water but at least it was sweetened with saccharine I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="2270">And then for lunch we had sandwiches and again coffee. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And in the evening there was some kind of soup with maybe some meat and lots of potatoes and vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And we weren't hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2273">As a matter of fact, I, you know, we could get seconds on soup. </sentence><sentence id="2274">It was very surprising to us that that was a concentration camp and we were wearing our own clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2275">All the suitcases came with us and we had them right in the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2276">And so we could change and that's when I discovered that our suitcases were pilfered, still in Krakow, because a lot of things were missing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2318">A: We really didn't know very much. </sentence><sentence id="2319">The only contact with a person that actually was in a concentration camp was Yes-cho Mo-stof-ski (ph) who was the young man, the older brother of the two sons of Mo-stof-ski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2320">And he was arrested very shortly after the Germans came </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2321"> in. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And, as I found out now from his brother and from Yesh-if (ph) and we visited them last summer, that he was involved in Boy Scouts and he was higher ranking official in the organization. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2323">And he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2324">And I think in 1940, as early as that, and sent to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And at that time, we really didn't know what Auschwitz was except that they were sending people there. </sentence><sentence id="2326">And also the university professors were arrested and sent to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2327">Now we rarely didn't hear from him, and then he came back about eight months later, and as I say the dates, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="2328">I know that he has stacks of books of his memoirs left because he showed them to us and they were all in Polish and I said I would love to read them and translate them into English so that people knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2329">Because one of the things that he told us last Summer, or maybe I should just say what happened when Yesh-e (ph) came back, and I don't remember, it was 1940 or 1941. </sentence><sentence id="2330">I know it was at the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And two years was still the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2332">And he came back and he was really in seclusion. </sentence><sentence id="2333">And it was, I was still very young then and I really didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2334">But the thing that I remember was that Yesh-e (ph) would not talk to anybody about things. </sentence><sentence id="2335">What happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="2336">What he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="2337">Why he was let go. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And he just wouldn't say anything of what happened to him in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2339">But then when Robert and I were visiting them last summer, Yesh-e (ph) showed us his memoirs and also he was an amateur painter, well he thought of himself more than an amateur, but anyway, the walls of his apartment were just filled with paintings. </sentence><sentence id="2340">And some of the paintings were depicting his life in Auschwitz, in the white and blue uniforms and the thing that he told us was about Father Colbert who was sanctified by the Pope and we happen to be on an excursion in Italy with our university and we stayed in a monastery which was converted into a hotel. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And it was named after Father Colbert. </sentence><sentence id="2342">And also, at that time, the Pope sanctified him, that year, he was some 82 or so, and I know that everybody was extremely respectful of Father Colbert because we had some runaround with some Italian police. </sentence><sentence id="2343">And because    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2344"> of, I think it was something about the tickets on the bus, but anyway they wanted to know where we were staying and we said that we were staying in the Castle Colbert. </sentence><sentence id="2345">And they were very impressed and let us go. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2346">[End of Side A of Tape 3] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2347">Q: Mrs. Ware, could you start from the beginning of you're sentence and you were talking about Father Colbert? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2348">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2349">Father Colbert was a Catholic priest in Poland and he was arrested like all the other priests, well many other priests, and sent to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2350">And he was there at the same time that Yesh-e Mo- stof-ski (ph) was there. </sentence><sentence id="2351">And Yesh-e (ph) witnessed his execution and he had it depicted in one of his paintings and he told us about the tortures that Father Colbert went through just because he was a Catholic priest. </sentence><sentence id="2352">There was no other reason. </sentence><sentence id="2353">He had no other sins. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2360">Q: So from the stories that you heard from Yesh-e (ph), you didn't have the impression that there was a mass extermination of Jews going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2362">A: No, you see, all that we got last Summer but when Yesh-e (ph) came back, when he was released from Auschwitz, he must have been told the same thing that we were told when you have not seen or you haven't heard anything. </sentence><sentence id="2363">He was forbidden, he was let go on the basis that he is not going to talk about what he saw or what happened to him in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2364">And even his closest family, according to his brother to whom we talked recently, he said nobody ever knew what happened to Yesh-e (ph) during the six or eight months that he was away. </sentence><sentence id="2365">And also he doesn't know why they let him go except that maybe they needed the space for somebody else that they wanted to do in. </sentence><sentence id="2366">So we just knew that there was a place that people didn't want to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="2367">But we had absolutely no idea what actually was going on in Auschwitz or in any of the camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2374">Q: So when you were in Bergen-Belsen, did you have any fears or expectations of what might happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2376">A: No we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Just because, we heard that the concentration camps were camps where they put the people there and they were suppose to be working and we just had glimpses of it, but here we were in a so-called concentration camp and it was nothing like anybody would have thought. </sentence><sentence id="2378">That it was bad, that there were starving people or, we weren't beaten, we weren't, on the contrary, everybody was quite polite and quite nice to us. </sentence><sentence id="2379">And I don't know, is it because the type of camp they were running at that time was a, sort of a holding camp for people that they wanted to use for some other purposes or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2380">And it was very, very strange when I, later on when I told somebody that I was in Bergen-Belsen before, they just couldn't believe that it wasn't as bad as it was when we were there later. </sentence><sentence id="2381">And on the way to Bergen-Belsen as I told you before, we would stop in prisons. </sentence><sentence id="2382">But a couple of times we did stop in some concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2383">I don't remember the names, but I know that they were camps because we were put in a barrack, but again, they were bunk beds, they were, maybe these were spaces that they were reserving for temporary guests, or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="2384">But not for the actual inmates because we really, on all these excursions we never saw what we saw later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2394">Q: When you were in Bergen-Belsen in the middle of 1944, did you hear any news of the war? </sentence><sentence id="2395">Did you know where the Russian front was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2398">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2399">We never knew what was going out on the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="2400">We had, there were no radios, there were no news whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="2401">We heard the in Auschwitz because there were radios, there were contacts but in Bergen-Belsen it was just like a, sort of poor man's resort almost, compared with what was going on later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2406">Q: Were you in a separate barrack from the men? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2408">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2409">The whole family was together. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And Betsy was with us and then the other men that were in the same transport. </sentence><sentence id="2411">We were all in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And the only privacy you would have is, you know, we were on the bunk beds so, I think there was even electric lighting there. </sentence><sentence id="2413">As I recall. </sentence><sentence id="2414">You see, some of these things are very, very vague because a lot of them I was trying to sort of forget, but I just don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2415">I just know that definitely we were, the family was all together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2424">Q: Tell me about the deportation to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2426">A: As I said, we were living day by day and it seemed to be rather boring. </sentence><sentence id="2427">And then one beautiful morning they walked in and they were quite different in attitude, the soldiers or the guards or whoever they were, they were in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="2428">I guess they were all SS men. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And they told us to pack and also to hurry. </sentence><sentence id="2430">Everything from then on was to hurry. </sentence><sentence id="2431">And so we packed and they brought a truck and they loaded us all on the truck with all of our suitcases. </sentence><sentence id="2432">And transported us to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="2433">And then we didn't feel so good anymore because it wasn't a passenger's train, it was the regular wagon train. </sentence><sentence id="2434">And they put us all in one wagon and there was just straw on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And we were given little packets of sandwiches. </sentence><sentence id="2436">And these were like sliced bread with some kind of a paste in between, a paste a little bit like meat paste or whatever, but anyway they were edible, they were quite edible. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And there was a bucket in the corner I guess for sanitation. </sentence><sentence id="2438">And I don't remember getting any water in addition but I remember the sandwiches. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And then we rode the train with the soldiers at one end and we were at the other end. </sentence><sentence id="2440">And as I say, I don't remember how many of us were, there might have been fewer than twenty people. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And there were six of us and Betsy and then there were several men. </sentence><sentence id="2442">So there might have been fifteen, there might have been more, but less than twenty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2460">Q: Were they all Hungarian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2462">A: They were all Hungarian citizens who didn't live in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="2463">They all lived in different places. </sentence><sentence id="2464">Just like we lived in Poland, Betsy in Italy, and those people might have been in Romania, Czechoslovakia, and I don't think there were any from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2465">I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="2466">But I know that they were all Hungarian citizens. </sentence><sentence id="2467">Now I don't remember how long the journey lasted. </sentence><sentence id="2468">I know we slept. </sentence><sentence id="2469">I know we got more food so it might have been two days, it might have been two-and-a-half days, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2470">And then they never let us out. </sentence><sentence id="2471">We had to go to the bathroom in the bucket in the comer. </sentence><sentence id="2472">But there was a bucket. </sentence><sentence id="2473">And I don't remember whether they had us carry out and empty the bucket, whether the train stopped, I just don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2474">It seems to me that maybe it was on the way to Auschwitz or maybe it was on the way back to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="2475">But I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2490">Q: Would you say that that was a point that which you couldn't retain the same dignity any longer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2492">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2493">At that point it was, well just the fact that we didn't have privacy to go to the bathroom was already something that was very humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="2494">And probably this was something that, well, I don't know whether I want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2495">But I still am having problems, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2496">I mean, when I travel, I have problems. </sentence><sentence id="2497">But this was the taste of what we were going to go through probably and we were scared. </sentence><sentence id="2498">We were scared because all of a sudden we were not treated nicely. </sentence><sentence id="2499">The soldiers were shouting at us and the grandmother was not very well and they were shouting at her because she was moaning and they yelled that we should keep her quiet and we were already having a premonition of what was waiting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2508">Q: And then you arrived in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2510">A: Then we arrived in Auschwitz and we were told to gather up our belongings and get out and we had to carry them out. </sentence><sentence id="2511">And the grandmother still could sort of walk, I mean with help, so it was very difficult because at that point we didn't carry about the suitcases but we wanted to help her and we had to help the father to get out of the train and they were shouting, they wouldn't let us leave the    suitcases in the train. </sentence><sentence id="2512">We had to carry them out. </sentence><sentence id="2513">And when we arrived at the station, things you know are pretty, I kind of tried to push them out of my mind, you know, and not remember. </sentence><sentence id="2514">But as I recall, the first place we stopped was some kind of an office where they tattooed us and they even tattooed the grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="2515">And they tattooed, you had to hold the arm still and it seems to me like it was one of the Jewish workers that was assigned to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2516">And she, and I think I pulled my arm because she stuck the needle, and then she, there it is, she stuck the pen right into me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2525">Q: Into the end of you're finger? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2527">A: At the end of my finger, I mean, she decided to test her pen on me. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And then she tattooed me and it wasn't very painful. </sentence><sentence id="2529">It was sticking some needles into somebody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2533">Q: What was you're number? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2535">A: My number, I don't remember, but it was something like 81 or 86, 87, it was 81,000 or 86,000, but it was in thousands. </sentence><sentence id="2536">And I saw numbers that was like 4, I mean I think Yesh-e (ph) number was something like 800 or something like that, and Father Colbert was 1,000, so there were quite, and then also there were different, I think there were different designations of the numbers. </sentence><sentence id="2537">Then depending on what group you belonged to. </sentence><sentence id="2538">So I don't think that if we had 86,000, I don't think that they only had 86,000 people in that camp because it looked to me like there were many more than that, but, you know, you can't tell out of the mass of people how many actually there are. </sentence><sentence id="2539">And things went very fast from there on. </sentence><sentence id="2540">And I just can't exactly remember the sequence, but I know I can remember certain highlights of that whole trip. </sentence><sentence id="2541">That we still had our jewelry, no, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="2542">We had the suitcases and we were all dressed up and then we had to carry the suitcases to a different place where there was, and to this day I will never forget the sight of it, there was a, sort of a small building and there was a big basket, just heaped with gold. </sentence><sentence id="2543">And they wanted us to take off our rings and just throw it on the heap. </sentence><sentence id="2544">And I had pierced ears, I had earrings, and I was having trouble to get    it out and one of the soldiers was already grabbing my ear and I said, "I can take it out, leave it", and I was able to undo the earring and throw it on the pile, so that's the only jewelry I had. </sentence><sentence id="2545">I think Doot- sie (ph) had earrings, Betsy had earrings, all women had all these earrings and, anyway, Yannick (ph) put his band, anyway, all of our wedding bands and rings and jewelry was thrown on that pile. </sentence><sentence id="2546">And then we were put in sort of a row, walking, and carrying the suitcases we had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="2547">So each of us carried other suitcases because the grandmother had to be helped. </sentence><sentence id="2548">And we kind of dragged her along. </sentence><sentence id="2549">Now we walked on a road that was quite empty and it was not paved and there were fields on both sides of the road. </sentence><sentence id="2550">And we walked, I don't know how much, until the grandmother collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="2551">And she could not move and one of the soldiers walked up and pulled out a gun and was going to shoot her. </sentence><sentence id="2552">Now we all screamed and cried and we said, "we will carry her", and we tried to carry her, and then there was another SS man, I suppose they were all SS men, that's what we called them, had this bunch of papers. </sentence><sentence id="2553">Evidently these were the papers with which we arrived so we were all registered. </sentence><sentence id="2554">And I couldn't understand exactly what they were arguing about but evidently there was something about the fact that they couldn't shoot her because she was, they had the documents on her. </sentence><sentence id="2555">And then, again, I don't quite remember whether somebody on a motorcycle went by and they might have told him to send a truck for us. </sentence><sentence id="2556">Or, I don't know how it happened that they did send a truck for us. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And one of the open bed trucks, I mean, no cover, and they helped us on the truck and we dragged the grandmother on and she was lying on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2558">And at that point I, there were benches on each side too, at that point, should I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="2559">Well, it's not, but who's going to read it?You stop Robert, please. </sentence><sentence id="2560">Please? </sentence><sentence id="2561">Use Kotex pad on the floor of the truck. </sentence><sentence id="2562">Actually two of them, and nobody looses Kotex pads. </sentence><sentence id="2563">And that was the first inclination I had that something was very, very wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2564">You didn't recall that, did you? </sentence><sentence id="2565">Or do you want to recall it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2599">Q: Go on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2601">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2602">After I was arrested for the, the second time, and put in the prison while we were waiting to be transported to Bergen-Belsen, I was suppose to have my menstrual period which I did not get and I didn't menstruate all through the ordeal until 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2603">After I came to New York. </sentence><sentence id="2604">That's about all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2609">Q: So we have you're number here. </sentence><sentence id="2610">Could you read it to me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2613">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2614">It is 81,867. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2617">Q: Now when you were on the truck and you saw that image with the two Kotex pads. </sentence><sentence id="2618">What did you think it indicated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2621">A: Well that indicated to me that there was something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2622">That, we knew a little bit about the, it was called in Polish "wa-pon-ka" (ph), that means "catching", catching people. </sentence><sentence id="2623">And we knew that they did catch people, they put them on the trucks and drove them away, and they were rounded up and so I thought, well, I think that's the end of the people being nice to us. </sentence><sentence id="2624">That something is very, very wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2625">And it was sort of a, not only a premonition but really we realized that things are not going to be good. </sentence><sentence id="2626">So that was my first indication that something was wrong. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2633">Q: Where did the truck take you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2635">A: The truck took us to Birkenau and they brought us to, again, I tried to find the place when we were in Auschwitz, to know exactly where we came. </sentence><sentence id="2636">I know we came through the gate and we came to near the crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="2637">Because there is another thing that happened. </sentence><sentence id="2638">That's later, because first what happened to us, the suitcases were still with us on the truck and the grandmother was on the truck. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And then when we got off, they told us that we didn't have to get the suitcases off and they just took us to this one room and there was quite a commotion, that we were delivered on a truck and there was this half-dead grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="2640">And from all the description that I remember, from Dr. Mengala (ph), it seems to me that it was Mengela (ph) who came in and gave the grandmother a    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2641"> shot and she just died, just like that. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And then there was shouting going on and we really didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2643">They separated the men and they separated the women. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And they told us to undress. </sentence><sentence id="2645">I mean, we were the four women and the men were somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="2646">And we saw quite a big crowd of people outside. </sentence><sentence id="2647">Just like you see the pictures of the refugees, these children and women and men, just walking very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="2648">And then they, some women came in and took us to a corridor and there was a door that opened and they put us into the chamber. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And it was room not bigger than maybe 10 by 12, maybe, I couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="2650">The door opened from the other side and they pushed in the men. </sentence><sentence id="2651">And so here we were and they closed the doors. </sentence><sentence id="2652">And here we were in that little room, it was made out of brick or plaster, I just don't quite remember. </sentence><sentence id="2653">I know there was a blue light on top and there was a drain in the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2654">It seems to me like there was a pipe on the ceiling but it didn't look like a shower at all. </sentence><sentence id="2655">There were, what I think today it was, that when we were being de- loused, they were putting, we would undress in one room and put out clothes on a cart, which was wheeled into a sort of chamber, the door was closed. </sentence><sentence id="2656">Then we went through showers. </sentence><sentence id="2657">That wasn't when, that was later when we were in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2658">Then we went through showers, and then on the other side we would get our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2659">And it seems to me that they had several chambers like that because there were thousands of us at one time that they were giving us the baths. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And it seems to me that that was the chamber that we were locked into. </sentence><sentence id="2661">And after a while, I mean, we just stood there, but for just a few moments, a few minutes, the door opened and they pushed in two women, naked. </sentence><sentence id="2662">And they threw in a little baby that looked kind of crippled, they just threw it on the floor and shut the door again, and then we knew that we were done for. </sentence><sentence id="2663">And nothing was happening. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2664">And you know, sometimes you can't, sometimes time goes very fast and sometimes time stands still. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2665">And at that time it was standing still and we didn't cry, we didn't scream, we didn't do anything. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2666">And the door opened and one of the SS men, I think he had papers in his hand, he says, "The people    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2667"> from Bergen-Belsen are here, are they here?", </sentence><sentence id="2668">in German. </sentence><sentence id="2669">And somebody said, "Yah-vol" and then they said "Rouse". </sentence><sentence id="2670">So we started walking out and the two women, they were counting us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2671">Evidently they knew how many of them were suppose to be. </sentence><sentence id="2672">And they pushed the two women back in. </sentence><sentence id="2673">And shut the door and put us in an identical room, right next to it. </sentence><sentence id="2674">And I don't know how long we stayed in there but, maybe ten minutes, maybe twenty, maybe five, I couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="2675">And we could hear muffled screams and it sounded like the baby mostly. </sentence><sentence id="2676">But not, it was, and then it was quiet. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2677">And then they opened our door and they said, "Rouse", so we went out and they told us " </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2678"> "and we all nodded. </sentence><sentence id="2679">And then they took the men again on one side and us the other side, the four women. </sentence><sentence id="2680">And there were a whole bunch of, there was a large room with the big windows on each side and these were Jewish women who were evidently in charge of preparing the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2681">And they were quite friendly, they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2682">The first thing they did, they put us on small stools and with what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="2683">Clippers, they weren't electric clippers, they had to do it like this in order to shave your head, and they shaved our heads and the pubic hair and the hair under the arms. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And it all was in a pile and I had very beautiful hair, sort of reddish-blonde curls, and they were all on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2685">And there was Betsy. </sentence><sentence id="2686">She had black roots already because her hair was dyed, so all her hair was on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2687">Anyway, we looked very, very strange. </sentence><sentence id="2688">After a while we got use to each other. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2689"> End of Tape 3. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2690"> Tape 4

out, when they, now I don't, it seems to me, in which room? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2697">Q: In the room that you were waiting and that the two women with the child were pushed in. </sentence><sentence id="2698">Were you undressed before that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2701">A: No, we were naked in that room, but we were told to undress. </sentence><sentence id="2702">You see, they separated the women, us, the Hungarian women from the men. </sentence><sentence id="2703">We were in two separate rooms. </sentence><sentence id="2704">And we were told to undress, the four women. </sentence><sentence id="2705">Evidently the men were told to undress too. </sentence><sentence id="2706">And then we came into that small chamber from one side and the men came in from the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2707">There were two doors to that chamber. </sentence><sentence id="2708">And so we were naked in that room. </sentence><sentence id="2709">And then when they let us out again, they separated. </sentence><sentence id="2710">We went to one side and the men went to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2711">And we were all naked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2723">Q: So when you went to get you're hair shaved, were you still naked? </sentence><sentence id="2724">Had they given you any clothes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2727">A: Yes, we were still naked. </sentence><sentence id="2728">We were naked when we had our heads shaved and after they were shaved, we were given clothes from a big pile that was on the side. </sentence><sentence id="2729">And I was given some underwear, just a pair of bloomers. </sentence><sentence id="2730">Because I remember they were very large, kind of long, old- fashioned. </sentence><sentence id="2731">And no bra, no slip, just the bloomers and a dress that was way too big. </sentence><sentence id="2732">And then two shoes, one shoe looked like a small man's shoe and the other one was just a regular woman's shoe. </sentence><sentence id="2733">And they barely fit, they were falling off my feet. </sentence><sentence id="2734">And I remember later on I found some string or something, or maybe tore out a piece of my dress, and made a tie for the shoe. </sentence><sentence id="2735">The dress had a cross painted on the back with oil paint and actually the girl painted that cross on my back. </sentence><sentence id="2736">And so I was looking at that and we were talking, that we couldn't run away anywhere with a cross on you're    back and two different shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2737">But also I remember we were standing there waiting for things to happen. </sentence><sentence id="2738">When we saw all these people outside the windows and the girls who were working there, they just very casually said, "You see all these people?". " </sentence><sentence id="2739">Yes". " </sentence><sentence id="2740">Well, in ten minutes they will be going out through the chimney". </sentence><sentence id="2741">And there were chimney's smoking. </sentence><sentence id="2742">So we were in that entire compound where there were the saunas and the gas chambers and the crematoria was, it all seemed to be in that space. </sentence><sentence id="2743">So anyway, after we were dressed and we were taken to the barrack of the Hungarian women. </sentence><sentence id="2744">And then we were given, each of us was given, that's right, each of us was given a blanket and a bowl, about this big, enameled bowl with a little hole on the side. </sentence><sentence id="2745">And that was very important because you could put a piece of string though that hole and tie it up to you're dress because if you lost the bowl you couldn't get any food because nobody would loan you their bowl because they, if they can get another bowl of food they will eat it, so the bowl was probably you're most precious possession. </sentence><sentence id="2746">And I made a whole art piece for my thesis about the bowls. </sentence><sentence id="2747">I'll tell you about it later if you want to, but anyway, we were taken to a quarantine barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2748">It wasn't the barrack that we stayed in later on, this was a barrack that we stayed in, I think, for two weeks, two or three weeks, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2749">But I know it was a quarantine and they just wanted to make sure that we don't have some kind of a disease and spread it all over the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2750">So we stayed there for, we still had to stand the role call every morning about 3:30 in the morning or so, and they counted us and then they gave us this bowl of soup with a small piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2751">That was suppose to last us for the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="2752">And for the first week, it seems to me like we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2753">The second week, after the role call, they lined us up and some of us went, still inside the camp, to dig ditches. </sentence><sentence id="2754">And some where doing or taken somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="2755">I was taken to dig ditches. </sentence><sentence id="2756">And I remember, another reason that I remember it, it was sometime in the middle of the summer was because the sun was very hot and I was getting sunburned on the top of my head. </sentence><sentence id="2757">And I took off my    bloomers and I made a turban to protect my skin. </sentence><sentence id="2758">So this was the quarantine and after, I think it was after two weeks, we were transferred to the barrack that we were suppose to stay in. </sentence><sentence id="2759">And that's where we stayed for the entire time until we were evacuated to Bergen-Belsen again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2795">Q: Was this barrack in Birkenau as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2797">A: That was in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2798">All that I described to you happened in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2799">And so the barrack was the Hungarian women's barrack in Birkenau and it was just a regular barrack with the three tiers of bunks and I was on the top tier. </sentence><sentence id="2800">Like when we were in Auschwitz, I showed Robert one of those bunks and we had a window on top. </sentence><sentence id="2801">And this was the only air that we were getting, the windows from the roof. </sentence><sentence id="2802">There were no windows on the walls. </sentence><sentence id="2803">And we were very cold. </sentence><sentence id="2804">It was in the fall already. </sentence><sentence id="2805">And the windows were just propped up with a stick and then I got the idea that maybe we should close it because the rains started to fall. </sentence><sentence id="2806">And so I climbed up, I mean I stood up and I reached over and I pulled the stick out. </sentence><sentence id="2807">That was crazy, I was crazy because the window came crashing down and broke. </sentence><sentence id="2808">So here, we not only had rain coming in, but we also had glass all over. </sentence><sentence id="2809">And that's when the thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="2810">The cappo (ph) came and she made me get down and screamed at me, and I said something to her, that why is she screaming, that I didn't want to break the window. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And she started to hit me. </sentence><sentence id="2812">And she was a woman just like I so I hit her back. </sentence><sentence id="2813">Well, I didn't know any better. </sentence><sentence id="2814">And she almost killed me. </sentence><sentence id="2815">I mean, she started hitting me on the head. </sentence><sentence id="2816">She knocked out one of my teeth, she broke another one. </sentence><sentence id="2817">And then I was deaf for about, I don't know for how long. </sentence><sentence id="2818">I think I have been deaf ever since. </sentence><sentence id="2819">So, I just, that was probably one of the, one of the worst experiences because she was a young woman just like I. And she was very, very strong. </sentence><sentence id="2820">Evidently she was trained and her number was like 400. </sentence><sentence id="2821">She's been there, one of the first ones, from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="2822">And all those cappos (ph) that I came in contact with were from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="2823">They were the cruelest people I have ever met. </sentence><sentence id="2824">They were Jewish girls that were trained and they survived. </sentence><sentence id="2825">They had a little room off the main hall of the barrack and that's where they, some of the barracks had two little rooms like that, and that's where the cappos (ph) stayed. </sentence><sentence id="2826">And they had a bed and they had all kinds of goodies. </sentence><sentence id="2827">And they would steal bread from us. </sentence><sentence id="2828">When we got a loaf of bread, it was like about this size, a square loaf. </sentence><sentence id="2829">And what they did was each of us was suppose to get 1/4 of the loaf, and what they did was they didn't cut it into four pieces, they cut it one piece here and one piece there and the center was theirs. </sentence><sentence id="2830">And then the center from the two other pieces were theirs too. </sentence><sentence id="2831">So they actually took almost half a loaf to themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2832">And then they could trade that for the people from Canada. </sentence><sentence id="2833">And I don't know, you probably heard about the people from Canada because they were called, you know gold was discovered in Canada, and in Poland Canada was paradise. </sentence><sentence id="2834">And these were the people that were working on the transports, getting all the stuff that was smuggled in and, before the Germans got to it. </sentence><sentence id="2835">They were sorting the clothing, they were sorting things out, so the cappos (ph) had everything because for bread you could get anything. </sentence><sentence id="2836">And they were just trained to survive and they were surviving. </sentence><sentence id="2837">So that was probably one of my worse experiences. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2880">Q: How did she, did she leave you unconscious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2882">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="2883">Then the girls took care of me. </sentence><sentence id="2884">My sister-in-law and Betsy and whoever else was there, evidently they got water and poured it on me and I had bruises all over and I bruise very easily so I was really black and blue and luckily she didn't break my nose or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2885">So I just had black eyes and shiners under my eyes and then I was deaf. </sentence><sentence id="2886">And I don't know whether she broke my eardrums or whatever she did to me, but I couldn't hear anything. </sentence><sentence id="2887">But eventually my hearing came somewhat back but not enough to really hear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2894">Q: Did you have any problems getting by in the camp without hearing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2896">A: I wasn't completely deaf. </sentence><sentence id="2897">I could hear but not enough to really get along in the hearing world, that's why I have to have hearing aids. </sentence><sentence id="2898">I mean, I take my hearing aids out when I am at home alone with my husband and I can still hear, but, if he doesn't get too annoyed, but most of the time I learned to survive with hearing. </sentence><sentence id="2899">No, it was all right. </sentence><sentence id="2900">I could still hear. </sentence><sentence id="2901">It wasn't just that I was, eventually the hearing came back and I was not completely deaf so I could get along. </sentence><sentence id="2902">I could hear the shouting, "Rouse!", </sentence><sentence id="2903">or whatever else they were shouting. </sentence><sentence id="2904">So that was all right. </sentence><sentence id="2905">And when I started working, I decided to get the hearing aids. </sentence><sentence id="2906">But otherwise, I was always trying to, my children were use to it, that you shout or get my mother's attention, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2907">So that was one of the souvenirs that I have from the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2920">Q: Did you have to go to work again the next day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2922">A: No, I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2923">I couldn't even get out of the bed but I had to go to the roll call so they dragged me out. </sentence><sentence id="2924">You see I was on the third floor so they let me sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2925">Somebody else moved over and they let me sleep down. </sentence><sentence id="2926">And then they kind of dragged me over to the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="2927">And I know I didn't go to work that day. </sentence><sentence id="2928">I don't know what happened, I don't know whether they, how they let me stay, but I know I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2929">But I don't think it lasted more than a day because the following day I did go to work. </sentence><sentence id="2930">And the work that I did in the camp really varied. </sentence><sentence id="2931">I know that sometimes we walked outside the camp and with hoes and we made little, small pieces of clumps of dirt out of big clumps of dirt. </sentence><sentence id="2932">And I don't, to this day I don't know what, we weren't planting anything, we were just chopping the dirt into small clumps. </sentence><sentence id="2933">And so that was for weeks I was doing that. </sentence><sentence id="2934">And then when the winter came we did, now the snows came pretty early, maybe October, and we were going into the fields whether it was sunshine or rain. </sentence><sentence id="2935">It didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2936">Then when the weather got a little colder, we did get either a sweater or some kind of a jacket or an over coat, but nothing that would fit. </sentence><sentence id="2937">But we did get another outer garment after one of those experiences were. </sentence><sentence id="2938">The lice were, I swear I probably will never see a bigger louse in my life, but when we were through working and after we got our so-called dinner, we spent most of our time on the bunks killing lice. </sentence><sentence id="2939">And these weren't head lice because we didn't have any hair. </sentence><sentence id="2940">The hair was growing about a quarter of an inch or so, but these lice live in, they are body lice, and they live in the seams of you're garments. </sentence><sentence id="2941">They are very hard to get rid of. </sentence><sentence id="2942">And so every so often we were supposedly de-loused, but according to our theory, they might have killed the live lice but the eggs they just probably, I don't know, they made them hatch faster in this area. </sentence><sentence id="2943">It seems to me like we had more lice after de-lousing than before, but the lice probably were one of the biggest tortures because here you couldn't rest at night because you had to scratch. </sentence><sentence id="2944">And I still itch sometimes when I think about it. </sentence><sentence id="2945">So, so much for the lice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2971">Q: Did you have, tell me about the food that you ate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2973">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2974">In the morning we got the coffee, which was brown water. </sentence><sentence id="2975">And we didn't have cups, it was all, the bowl was the cup and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2976">And we got the piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2977">Sometimes we got it in the morning and sometimes we got it in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="2978">And in the evening also, but anyway in the morning we got a piece of bread and that had to last us the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="2979">And at noon we might have gotten a bowl of soup, which was mostly water with a few potatoes, a few turnips floating in it. </sentence><sentence id="2980">And it tasted horrible. </sentence><sentence id="2981">And we still think they were putting salt peter into it. </sentence><sentence id="2982">That was the story, that they were putting salt peter to keep us quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2983">I don't know whether this is true or not, salt peter is quite poisonous. </sentence><sentence id="2984">It is sodium nitrate as I know, but that's what we were told, that it was full of salt peter, that that's suppose to quiet you're nerves and you become more obedient. </sentence><sentence id="2985">And then in the evening we got more soup, it might have been a little bit thicker, that might have been, so we're just two pieces of potato, might have been four pieces of potato and maybe two turnips, and another piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2986">And sometimes there was a tiny little square of margarine or a tiny little slice of a kind of a sausage, but that was maybe just once a week. </sentence><sentence id="2987">Most of the time it was just dry bread. </sentence><sentence id="2988">And bread became a, had monetary value. </sentence><sentence id="2989">If you wanted something else you could trade it for bread. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3007">Q: When you were working did you work with Betsy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3009">A: Yes, with Betsy and Doot-sie (ph) and the mother, we all stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="3010">Somehow for all that time we were always together. </sentence><sentence id="3011">And then another work that I was doing was, to this day I have no idea what it actually was, somebody said this was something in connection with ammunition, and it was a, we were led into a room with long tables. </sentence><sentence id="3012">And there was a nail on the table and there was a pile of rags and strips of rubber, just flat rubber strips. </sentence><sentence id="3013">And we were suppose to plate braids. </sentence><sentence id="3014">The hook was to hook on the beginning, you tied it up and then you started to plait and roll the ball and hook on again. </sentence><sentence id="3015">And in the morning an SS woman, well fed, would come in and she would sit down and start plaiting, and then somebody would, an SS man with a stopwatch, would time her, and then they measured it. </sentence><sentence id="3016">And then they multiplied it, I don't know, for how many hours we were working. </sentence><sentence id="3017">Sometimes ten, sometimes twelve. </sentence><sentence id="3018">So that's how many meters of that stuff we were suppose to weave or plait. </sentence><sentence id="3019">And at the end of the day we measured it, forever. </sentence><sentence id="3020">I mean, there was an awful lot of measuring going on. </sentence><sentence id="3021">And if you were one meter short, you get whipped with a whip. </sentence><sentence id="3022">And I'd rather be whipped with a whip than pounded with fists because the other thing what they were doing is pounding you with fists. </sentence><sentence id="3023">So the whipping left welts but they were less painful than, there was just skin that was, you know, injured. </sentence><sentence id="3024">But if you were beaten up with fists, then you're bones hurt and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="3025">So I was very good with my hands and I rarely, I think I just got whipped once, that I was short, because I think I wasn't feeling well that day, but most of the time I was able to plait the quota. </sentence><sentence id="3026">It wasn't exactly the number of meters that the woman was plaiting and calculating, but we had to come within a sort of a reasonable amount. </sentence><sentence id="3027">Most of the time I filled up my quota so I was okay. </sentence><sentence id="3028">And then I was also sewing on sewing machines. </sentence><sentence id="3029">And I guess these were uniforms or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="3030">And as I recall, this was about the variety of work that I did. </sentence><sentence id="3031">There was the fieldwork and then the sewing rooms again, and probably the longest I was in those plaiting rooms. </sentence><sentence id="3032">And somebody said that they were using it in cannons or, who knows what. </sentence><sentence id="3033">Oh yes, then also that wasn't only the number of meters that we had to plait, also how strong they were. </sentence><sentence id="3034">So you have to make sure that if the two SS women start pulling on them, they will not break it. </sentence><sentence id="3035">Because you got beaten up if they broke. </sentence><sentence id="3036">And then you had to fix it. </sentence><sentence id="3037">So I was very careful that I plaited them to their satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="3038">And that's so much for the work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3070">Q: Did you mostly speak Hungarian? </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="3144">Another thing that happened was that some people got Red Cross packages. </sentence><sentence id="3145">And I remember one woman, you see there were stoves in the barrack, it was already winter, and I remember she cooked all kinds of stuff that she got in the package. </sentence><sentence id="3146">And I remember she gave me a little bit of the potato water that she cooked the potatoes in, she didn't give me the potatoes but she gave me potato water in the bowl, and I shared that with Betsy. </sentence><sentence id="3147">But I don't know that, we heard that the Red Cross was bringing packages. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3148">[End of Side A of Tape 4] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3149">Q: If you would just go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3150">A: We can start with the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="3151">I got some kind of an infection. </sentence><sentence id="3152">I think it started with probably some chigger bites or some bug bites that I got working outside. </sentence><sentence id="3153">And I always was quite sensitive and would scratch. </sentence><sentence id="3154">I know that I scratched my legs and then I guess because of the dirt and things that we lived in, I got some kind of an infection. </sentence><sentence id="3155">It might have been also fleabites or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3156">And it was getting worse and worse to the point where my legs were very, very swollen. </sentence><sentence id="3157">And I could not walk even. </sentence><sentence id="3158">Pus was oozing and these were big, round circles all over my shins. </sentence><sentence id="3159">And so they took me to the hospital and they really didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3160">I think they put some Vaseline or something over the wounds and covered it with some gauze and there I was lying and hoping that it will heal. </sentence><sentence id="3161">But at the same time, the German doctors were coming in and drawing blood from us. </sentence><sentence id="3162">And then injecting us with something and I have no idea whether these were suppose to be medications or whatever, but anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3163">Then they were also doing vaginal and rectal examinations with their fingers. </sentence><sentence id="3164">Which wasn't exactly what I considered pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="3165">And it was rather very humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="3166">I just didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3167">I was not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="3168">There were several women that were singled out and we were sort of in a group and it was extremely humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="3169">I was only 20 or so and I just didn't feel that this was exactly the treatment I wanted to have but I was probably worried more about my legs. </sentence><sentence id="3170">And then I think I mentioned it before, that the women, there was a couple of Jewish women doctors and they said that they knew that there was going to be another selection in the hospital so they dismissed me together with some other women because they were afraid that the state I was in, I would have been selected to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="3171">So I was put back into my regular barracks and I barely could walk. </sentence><sentence id="3172">But at that time, I was still working in that weaving business so I didn't have to walk into the fields and I was able to stand during the roll call and then just go to the barracks, which were right on the premises. </sentence><sentence id="3173">So it wasn't like I had to go very far. </sentence><sentence id="3174">And eventually my legs healed but they were, I had sort of scars all over, from my ankles to my knees, and I tried to    be much more careful with scratching and things that may aggravate the condition. </sentence><sentence id="3175">My legs eventually healed. </sentence><sentence id="3176">It took about another month or so, but anyway, I was all right. </sentence><sentence id="3177">So this was another thing that I wanted to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="3178">The other thing that I wanted to say was that about two months before, two or three months before we were arrested, it might have been around Christmas time or maybe a little bit later, I discovered that I was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3179">And I went to a Polish doctor, a gynecologist who determined that I was about two months pregnant, maybe two-and-a-half, and he did an abortion right in his office. </sentence><sentence id="3180">And I was very sad that I had to do it but in the circumstances I couldn't possibly have a baby. </sentence><sentence id="3181">And if I did have one, I would have been pregnant when they arrested us and I probably wouldn't have survived anyway and the baby definitely wouldn't have been alive today. </sentence><sentence id="3182">But if you do think like that, if you just keep on thinking all you're life about the child that wasn't born. </sentence><sentence id="3183">So, this was another trauma that I had to live with. </sentence><sentence id="3184">Then I didn't give it much thought of course when I was in the camp, as I said before, that nature takes care of itself and I didn't menstruate since we were put in the prison in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="3185">And I didn't menstruate until I came to New York. </sentence><sentence id="3186">And I really think it was a blessing because I just cannot image thousands of women without any sanitary facilities having their periods. </sentence><sentence id="3187">Now the ones that were in the camp a long time, they and the cappos (ph), some that knew how to get around because their number was just maybe 400 or 300 or so, and they were the rich ones and they might have been normal already, but the rest of us just were sterile I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="3188">But what amazed me was that really, it was almost like a miracle that we didn't menstruate because it would have been a big, big mess. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3253">Q: Can you talk a little bit about how these two events that you just mentioned have effected you're life since then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3255">A: Well, as I said, you never stop thinking of the child that you, well I can't say killed, but didn't permit to be born. </sentence><sentence id="3256">And I have four wonderful children and you always think how wonderful that one might have been. </sentence><sentence id="3257">So my life was very much effected by everything that happened to me because to this day I have nightmares and I wake up and I don't know where I am, and I have all kinds of physical problems. </sentence><sentence id="3258">What was it, a year and a half ago I finally was sort of diagnosed with an ailment that I've had for about twenty years or so. </sentence><sentence id="3259">That I would come down with, or maybe more than twenty years, I came down with, suddenly, with high fever. </sentence><sentence id="3260">But it was like 104, and shaking and practically being unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="3261">And it would come on quite suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="3262">It would last for several days and usually I got better. </sentence><sentence id="3263">And it would happen like about every three to four months. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And eventually I got sort of use to it and I paid no attention to it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3265">But a year and a half ago I had my neurosurgery, but two months later, again I got this fever. </sentence><sentence id="3266">And this time it was much more serious because I, well, Robert knows because he was taking care of me. </sentence><sentence id="3267">It was so bad that, you know, you don't call you're doctor after hours, and he got to call the doctor and find out what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3268">Whether he should take me to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="3269">And my doctor, who is a physician, said that I have something called the Brill Zincer Syndrome (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3270">And she researched it and found out that a lot of people who had typhus in the concentration camps, the which causes the typhus just becomes dormant and every so often it wakes up and causes the fever. </sentence><sentence id="3271">But usually they are mild attacks and very few people paid much attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="3272">But this time I was really seriously ill. </sentence><sentence id="3273">It was 104, you are not joking you know. </sentence><sentence id="3274">My doctor put me in the hospital and just to do the tests, and they ruled out every possible disease that could cause this kind of symptoms, like tuberculosis and and fever, and what is the one in working, the Valley Fever, and anyway, I don't know how many tests they did and they send my blood to a clinic and they were testing it for , but the strain that they had wasn't exactly, the results were quite inconclusive. </sentence><sentence id="3275">But when I went to Poland the following Summer, Yesh-e (ph) was still alive and he said that he was a and he said that the strain of was a specific strain that was in Eastern Europe and it was called Ball-in-netsa (ph) or whatever, and he said that they should have tested for that and that definitely would have been positive. </sentence><sentence id="3276">But my doctor wasn't going to wait for any tests and he put me on very high doses of tetracycline. </sentence><sentence id="3277">And I was on tetracycline for about six weeks and the fever subsided and the tests were negative again. </sentence><sentence id="3278">And he says, well, let's wait for the six months and see whether you get anything again. </sentence><sentence id="3279">And I was sort of use to it, you know, it was just matter-of-fact. </sentence><sentence id="3280">I was getting use to it and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="3281">But it is already two years and I haven't had the fever anymore so they decided they killed off the . </sentence><sentence id="3282">And evidently you have to do it when the are active, when you have the fever. </sentence><sentence id="3283">And another symptom which was described in the book, because that was the first thing that the doctor asked, where is the rash?And I had a rash going from the armpit down the arm and that was the first thing that he asked, whether I had the rash because that was one of the very typical symptoms of this sort of syndrome. </sentence><sentence id="3284">So that's another thing that I had. </sentence><sentence id="3285">And another symptom that, now since we are talking about diseases, is that after I had, well maybe when we come to Bergen-Belsen the second time we can talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="3286">Or should we talk about the diseases now? </sentence><sentence id="3287">Because another thing was I had typhus in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="3288">Everybody had typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3289">I didn't have tuberculosis, I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="3290">But there are spots on my lungs that are calcified, but it's sort of secondary symptoms. </sentence><sentence id="3291">It's really is not too significant. </sentence><sentence id="3292">I mean, I have something that's called a B Lung picture, but its, the thing that was was the typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3293">And another thing that people where getting was starvation edema. </sentence><sentence id="3294">And this was something that was really frightening because you woke up in the morning and you're eyes were swollen with bags under the eyes and they were getting more and more swollen during the day. </sentence><sentence id="3295">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="3296">In three days you were dead. </sentence><sentence id="3297">I mean, it was just unbelievable because you could see the people swelling. </sentence><sentence id="3298">The faces would get swollen and the legs, the feet and the hands, and then eventually the whole body. </sentence><sentence id="3299">And as I understand this was diagnosed as starvation edema. </sentence><sentence id="3300">And I didn't get it to that extent. </sentence><sentence id="3301">And my legs were very swollen, my feet were swollen and my face just a little bit but somehow I recovered from it. </sentence><sentence id="3302">I didn't die. </sentence><sentence id="3303">But it was very, very frightening and I have absolutely no tolerance for salt. </sentence><sentence id="3304">I am on an almost salt-free diet most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="3305">If I go to a restaurant, like for example today, and I had the tuna fish sandwich, I will have to take medicine when I come home. </sentence><sentence id="3306">And I am on medication the whole time, the dietetics. </sentence><sentence id="3307">And my doctor who is fairly new in town because my old doctor retired and I got a new one, and he was very much against the dietetics and he just didn't think that I should take them. </sentence><sentence id="3308">And he asked me to stop it. </sentence><sentence id="3309">And two days later, Robert took me to the doctor's office. </sentence><sentence id="3310">I couldn't go to work. </sentence><sentence id="3311">I gained about twelve pounds on the scale. </sentence><sentence id="3312">I couldn't open my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3313">I could not talk. </sentence><sentence id="3314">I was so swollen that I couldn't even walk. </sentence><sentence id="3315">And Robert took me to the doctor's office and the doctor could not believe it. </sentence><sentence id="3316">He said he has    never seen anything like it. </sentence><sentence id="3317">He says, you go back on you're pills and renewed my prescription. </sentence><sentence id="3318">And so these are still things that I've had since I left the camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3385">Q: Did you ever learn what kinds of experiments were being conducted at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3387">A: No, I never learned. </sentence><sentence id="3388">All I knew is that they took quite a bit of blood from us and they were injecting us with something else and they were taking, but they were doing so many things of that sort that you just didn't pay any attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="3389">And I don't think that that cause any, that was in Auschwitz, and the edema came in Bergen-Belsen, so I don't think that those two have anything to do with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3390">And I don't know why I didn't get typhus in Auschwitz, maybe because they were de-lousing us. </sentence><sentence id="3391">But the typhus was in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="3392">And of course the psychological effects of the whole experience is something else. </sentence><sentence id="3393">Because I go to the hairdresser, I put make-up on, and I was going, you know, I got three graduate degrees and I did very well. </sentence><sentence id="3394">I was on the Dean's list and I was, I got one of my Master's Degree's in art with distinction, and I entertain and I go out and I think I look very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="3395">But a lot of it is also a facade. </sentence><sentence id="3396">Because Robert knows that there are times that, I call it I'm out of my head. </sentence><sentence id="3397">And I have to have a nanny for the kids because I couldn't always take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="3398">So I was very fortunate that I could afford, or my husband could afford it. </sentence><sentence id="3399">So we had a nanny for seventeen years, until Sir-re-high (ph) started High School, so she was sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="3400">Well actually I had a nanny for longer than that because Margaret was with us for seventeen years and before that we had a nanny for five years. </sentence><sentence id="3401">So, I mean different nannies, but then we found one that stayed with us for seventeen years because I could not take care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="3402">And very few people know that because I, my kids were brought up and I participated in PTA and I just pretended that I lead a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="3403">And so I think I finish on the fact that I had a good facade and everything, but every so often the children would say, well mother you never really took care of us, it was Margaret who did. </sentence><sentence id="3404">But I tried to be a very good mother and I think I did do a good job. </sentence><sentence id="3405">I made sure that they go to school and do well in school and what-not, but there were many times that, I call it I couldn't take care of them the way, you know, I should have. </sentence><sentence id="3406">And there was something, always, I think I held them when they were babies, but we had very little physical contact when they were growing up. </sentence><sentence id="3407">And even now, you know, it may be just a peck on the cheek or something like that, but you never see me kissing the kids and really hugging them. </sentence><sentence id="3408">I do with my grandchildren though. </sentence><sentence id="3409">My grandchildren I hug and I hold and I play with them, but somehow with my children, there was some kind of a barrier that I couldn't break. </sentence><sentence id="3410">And I know it was all in my head and I was examined by a German psychiatrist for the restitution and he decided I was nuts. </sentence><sentence id="3411">Oh yes, they rewarded me restitution all right. </sentence><sentence id="3412">I get a monthly check because I figured out that they pay wasn't very high because, you know, at first they gave me a lump sum and it came out to about $5.00 per diem for the time that I was in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3413">But it was more than nothing, but then they awarded me a monthly pension and they adjusted it since I have been working, and then they said, well, if you are working you really can't or don't deserve the full amount. </sentence><sentence id="3414">But then I petitioned and I send more letters and I have a stack of correspondence with the German government, through my lawyer who is a German man and very, very helpful and he specializes in the restitutions, so that's another story that maybe worth preserving. </sentence><sentence id="3415">All the letters that we were sending back and forth to find out whether I am deserving or not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3446">Q: What did you're psychological state have to do with the restitution? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3448">A: Oh, well what my psychological state was that I wasn't, okay, my husband was supporting me supposedly. </sentence><sentence id="3449">They wanted to know how much money he was making and so on and I insisted that in America, women are independent and I am not able to work. </sentence><sentence id="3450">You see, I didn't start working for money really. </sentence><sentence id="3451">For making a living, until my second husband died. </sentence><sentence id="3452">Before that when I was working, it was charity work and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="3453">And I was teaching at the university as a student teacher. </sentence><sentence id="3454">I wasn't really working for money. </sentence><sentence id="3455">And so the reason that they awarded me the restitution was, it is really a pension. </sentence><sentence id="3456">Nobody can live on that pension because it was like $300.00 and then every year they adjust it for cost of living, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3457">So it wouldn't even pay half the rent for a small room somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="3458">But I had to have a physical examination by a German doctor and who determined that I had a chronic edema, or whatever he called it, and then, I don't know, whatever else his diagnosis was, and then they decided to have me checked by a psychiatrist. </sentence><sentence id="3459">And he gave me the standard psychiatric examination and I had to fill out all kinds of questionnaires, you know, whether I feel that I am being followed and whether I can sleep or whether I can't sleep, do I have nightmares, and I actually had everything that he was asking for, so I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="3460">And then he decided that maybe I do deserve some kind of a pension because he didn't think that anybody would employ me in the state of mind I was. </sentence><sentence id="3461">So that's another story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3477">Q: We can come back in more detail to the restitution later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3479">A: Well, the thing is that as far as the restitution is concerned, I have copies of all the letters that I sent to the lawyer and the copies of his letters to me and the final judgment in all that. </sentence><sentence id="3480">It is all very interesting because it took like maybe several years of constant correspondence and wanting more proof and more proof of this and that and something else. </sentence><sentence id="3481">So, if you think that that would be an addition to it. </sentence><sentence id="3482">Because I really didn't hear anything about restitution in the whole museum. </sentence><sentence id="3483">And there are a lot of people that are getting money from the German government. </sentence><sentence id="3484">One curious thing is that once a month in between the Ist of August, it has to be after the Ist of August and before the 1st of November, I have to fill out a certificate of life. </sentence><sentence id="3485">And it has to be notarized by a notary public. </sentence><sentence id="3486">Years ago it had to be also, not certified, but made true, I can't think of the, I can't think of the word, but it was in German and then eventually it started to translate it into English, that it had to be certified by a German authority. </sentence><sentence id="3487">So I had to send it to the German counsel in San Francisco, and then I had to get it back and then I had to send it to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3488">So this is something quite curious that I think very few people know about it. </sentence><sentence id="3489">Have you known about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3510">Q: And go on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3512">A: When I got married in June, 1947 to Dr. Levin, we decided that we didn't want to have children the first few years because we both were going to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="3513">And I wanted to get my degree from the University of Michigan. </sentence><sentence id="3514">That's where he was going to be for three years in surgical residency. </sentence><sentence id="3515">So when we were even still in, we got married in Dallas, Texas. </sentence><sentence id="3516">And I went to a gynecologist for my pre-marital examination and he examined me and he told me that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant because he thinks I am completely sterile. </sentence><sentence id="3517">My fallopian tubes were plugged, scarred, and there was no way I could possibly get pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3518">And so, of course it was a great shock to me. </sentence><sentence id="3519">I told him my history and he said, well, this is what contributed to it. </sentence><sentence id="3520">And I, of course, I didn't want to get married, because my future husband was from a large family. </sentence><sentence id="3521">There were six children and he was the only son. </sentence><sentence id="3522">Well, actually he had a half-brother, but he was the only son of his mother, and he, they definitely wanted to have a grandson or granddaughter, or whatever, so it was a great disappointment to him and he didn't tell his parents. </sentence><sentence id="3523">But he said he didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="3524">He still wanted to get married, even though I didn't, but we did get married. </sentence><sentence id="3525">And I just tried not to think about it. </sentence><sentence id="3526">But I tried to plan my life. </sentence><sentence id="3527">Definitely go to school and have some kind of a profession so that I can be working and not missing the fact that I can't be a mother. </sentence><sentence id="3528">So, actually I was so busy with the university studies that I did not really have time to worry about anything else at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3529">But then, he was finishing his residency and I was finishing my graduate degree and we were going to move on. </sentence><sentence id="3530">And looking for a place to settle. </sentence><sentence id="3531">And I thought that maybe I should do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="3532">But we moved to Detroit and I got a job as a Medical Technologist at Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital and he was a surgeon there. </sentence><sentence id="3533">And we had a very good friend who was a gynecologist and we told him my predicament and he said that he will see what he can do. </sentence><sentence id="3534">He gave me a very thorough examination and then I had, he put me on high doses of penicillin, back then penicillin was very much in use. </sentence><sentence id="3535">And so if there was any kind of infection, then it would definitely get cleared. </sentence><sentence id="3536">And then in addition he put me through quite painful treatments. </sentence><sentence id="3537">It is kind of a little complicated, these are uterine injections of lapydol (ph), which is a very heavy oil with, first he tried to blow the air through and he wasn't able to, my tubes were definitely plugged. </sentence><sentence id="3538">And then lapydol (ph) is a very heavy oil and it has some kind of an additive to it that it will show up on x-rays, and so he injected that and the lapydol (ph) is suppose to go through the tubes and if they, and the weight of it sometimes will open them. </sentence><sentence id="3539">And the tubes are really opened into the abdominal cavity and the good sign is when the lapydol (ph) spills into the abdominal cavity. </sentence><sentence id="3540">And it's quite painful because there is some kind of a nerve connection, especially if, the pain is hitting the shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="3541">And nothing happened with the injection. </sentence><sentence id="3542">And he repeated it and after two days there was a spill on the right side. </sentence><sentence id="3543">So he said, well, that was sufficient indication that things may be all right. </sentence><sentence id="3544">And a few months later I did get pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3545">And so we spent a year in Detroit and then I was about three months pregnant when we left. </sentence><sentence id="3546">And we came to Fresno. </sentence><sentence id="3547">And my daughter was born in August, we came to Fresno in December and my daughter was born in August. </sentence><sentence id="3548">So things turned out for the best. </sentence><sentence id="3549">But without medical treatments and all, I probably would have not been able to have children. </sentence><sentence id="3550">The American doctor who examined me the first time, when I went there for my pre-marital examination, because I was getting married and I didn't think that I wanted to get pregnant right away, said that I probably would never get pregnant because my tubes were scarred and plugged up. </sentence><sentence id="3551">And that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3552">And he wanted to know what could have caused it. </sentence><sentence id="3553">And I wanted to know what the cause might have been and he says, well, one of the causes that usually plugs up the tubes is an infection and its mainly gonorrhea and I said, well, how on earth would I have gotten gonorrhea and he says, well, you just think. </sentence><sentence id="3554">And you know you can    get gonorrhea by an intercourse with an infected person, which I did not have, and so I told him about the gynecological examinations that I was getting in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3555">And that when I was in the hospital with the skin infection, there were also doctors coming in and poking their fingers into us, and I did not think that they were having sterile gloves on because they were going from one woman to another without changing the gloves. </sentence><sentence id="3556">They were protecting themselves but not us. </sentence><sentence id="3557">And these were vaginal and rectal examinations and the doctor, the American doctor who examined me in Dallas, he said yes, that was sufficient to get you infected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3606">Q: How long all told were you in the hospital at Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3608">A: I really don't quite remember. </sentence><sentence id="3609">It could have been, probably around ten days. </sentence><sentence id="3610">And one thing that I remember very distinctly was that sometimes they were dressing the wounds on a table. </sentence><sentence id="3611">We were in bunks all the way around and there was a space in the center and they would put the patient there and several doctors would be standing around her and doing all kinds of things so that we couldn't really see, but one time I saw her legs. </sentence><sentence id="3612">I thought mine were in a bad shape, but her's were so bad that you could see the bone. </sentence><sentence id="3613">The flesh was just practically rotted away. </sentence><sentence id="3614">And one of the things that they would, they didn't do the maggot treatment to me, but it was very popular in Europe to use maggots to treat this kind of wounds. </sentence><sentence id="3615">And I know that her legs were just crawling with maggots. </sentence><sentence id="3616">And evidently maggots were putting some kind of an enzyme or whatever, that was killing the dead tissue. </sentence><sentence id="3617">Or maybe they were eating the dead tissue and that stimulated the granulation and growth of the new tissue. </sentence><sentence id="3618">And that was one of the cures. </sentence><sentence id="3619">So they did use maggots, but they didn't use penicillin. </sentence><sentence id="3620">They didn't use maggots on me, I somehow got better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3634">Q: Were they treating you in any way that was productive? </sentence><sentence id="3635">That was helpful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3638">A: Well, as I say, it seems to me that they put some kind of an ointment on my wounds and they were somewhat helpful, so that the oozing stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3639">It looked like Vaseline, but I can't believe that    Vaseline alone could have cured, but anyway, at least the things were not full of mud and dirt, which I would have gotten in the regular barracks, or even going to work. </sentence><sentence id="3640">So there were bandages, they bandaged my legs and they were at least kept clean. </sentence><sentence id="3641">I was a pretty healthy and strong person at that time and I guess it was my resistance and just my natural ability to heal. </sentence><sentence id="3642">And to this day I heal very well. </sentence><sentence id="3643">I get a cut on my finger and two days later it is gone, so maybe it was just my ability to heal well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3651">Q: And you mentioned that you left the hospital before you were completely healed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3653">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3654">I left the hospital because of the on coming selection. </sentence><sentence id="3655">And the doctors that were there, the women doctors, they were Jewish women doctors. </sentence><sentence id="3656">They were afraid that the selection may not be very selective and they may just reduce the number of patients so they didn't want anybody who was well enough to walk out, was asked to walk out. </sentence><sentence id="3657">And as I say, after that, I went back to my barrack and I was able to stand the roll call and I was able to walk to that place where we were plaiting the braids. </sentence><sentence id="3658">And sitting all day, I could still keep my bandages on my legs and then I think a couple of times, as I recall, I went to the hospital and I had the bandages changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3665">Q: Did you ever see Yannosh (ph), you're husband, during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3667">A: Yannosh (ph) disappeared about half way. </sentence><sentence id="3668">I think I saw him a few times and I said he came on some errands, he brought some stuff with the other workers to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3669">And I don't know exactly what, and I was able to say a few words to him. </sentence><sentence id="3670">But it was not more than two or three times. </sentence><sentence id="3671">The first time when he came was to, he told us that father died, and that was just maybe like a few days, maybe a week or so, maybe two weeks after we were separated into the different camps. </sentence><sentence id="3672">He died very soon after he got there. </sentence><sentence id="3673">But I didn't see Yannosh (ph) maybe for three months and after that I didn't see him anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3674">| don't think I saw him after October. </sentence><sentence id="3675">As I remember, the last time I saw him was the weather was still bearable and then in October it started to get very cold and snow, and    I know I didn't see him anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3676">And I told you before that when I was in Paris, that there were two guys that said that they knew him in camp and that he was selected and that they never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="3677">And evidently because he was crippled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3690">Q: Do you remember that last time you saw him? </sentence><sentence id="3691">What you said to him, what you said to each other? </sentence><sentence id="3692">Anything about that last time you saw him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3696">A: I didn't know it would be the last time. </sentence><sentence id="3697">I didn't think that each time was the last time, but there was very little that we could say to each other. </sentence><sentence id="3698">It was, I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3702">Q: And you mentioned there was another place that you were working, beside in that, another place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3704">A: Yes, I was also working on some kind of a brick-laying place. </sentence><sentence id="3705">And I remember one thing, that one of the guards complimented me. </sentence><sentence id="3706">That I had a very good ability to measure the distances because my bricks were laid very evenly and I was spreading the mortar, I think I was buttering a slice of bread, and that the bricks were built very, very evenly and very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3707">And what we were working, and that was a very short time that we were working on it, were large, round, brick structures. </sentence><sentence id="3708">It doesn't seem to me that they were ever finished, but by then we, of course, we knew exactly about the crematoria and we knew about everything else. </sentence><sentence id="3709">And what these structures were suppose to be was, and I don't know whether that was the hearsay or whatever, but that's what we were kind of hearing, that these were going to be special extermination places with sort of electrical contraptions that would be electrical crematoria and electrical killing, the high voltage. </sentence><sentence id="3710">But I don't know whether that was true and I never really found out what these structures were. </sentence><sentence id="3711">And when we were in Auschwitz, I was telling Robert about these structures and the first time we went to Auschwitz he says, that's what you described. </sentence><sentence id="3712">And I said, yes, that's what I was working on. </sentence><sentence id="3713">And    we never found out in Auschwitz what these things were supposed to be. </sentence><sentence id="3714">But it was very, we probably will go again and I'll try to find out what they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3727">Q: They were in Birkenau, these structures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3729">A: In Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="3730">Right past the crematoriums, or along side the crematoriums. </sentence><sentence id="3731">And I don't think they were ever finished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3735">Q: You mentioned earlier that by the time you got to Auschwitz you were hearing more news of the war and of the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="3736">Do you recall some of the news that you heard? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3739">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="3740">I just know that, well actually it was more in Auschwitz than in Belsen-Bergen. </sentence><sentence id="3741">In Belsen-Bergen, whatever news we got was when the new transport came. </sentence><sentence id="3742">But all the transports that were coming to Bergen-Belsen were mainly from Holland or from other countries, from smaller countries. </sentence><sentence id="3743">And they were very small transports. </sentence><sentence id="3744">And it seems like, as I mentioned before, that they all seemed to be of prisoners or some political people that were rather taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="3745">As I say, we weren't, we didn't seem to be doomed or anything. </sentence><sentence id="3746">Just like the Holland diamond cutters, they were being sort of guarded and preserved. </sentence><sentence id="3747">And so, if a new transport came, they might have told us what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3748">But we really didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3749">But while we were in Auschwitz, there were underground radios and then also there were a lot of workers who were going outside and coming back in the evening and they would bring some news that what was happening on the front and what was happening with the war. </sentence><sentence id="3750">And at one point we knew that the Russians were coming and that the siege of Warsaw, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="3751">That there was an uprising in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3752">And I just don't remember really. </sentence><sentence id="3753">We were much more concerned about surviving from day to day than worrying what was happening outside. </sentence><sentence id="3754">There were raids, air raids. </sentence><sentence id="3755">There were quite a few air raids and we were hoping that they will bomb but they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3756">The airplanes were swooping down but they were never really throwing any bombs on the crematoria and we were disappointed because we    thought that maybe they would destroy the crematorium, they couldn't be used. </sentence><sentence id="3757">But they were saying that it was the American planes that were coming. </sentence><sentence id="3758">And we could hear the anti-craft shooting, but I don't think they ever shot down any planes either, but they were just shooting at them. </sentence><sentence id="3759">And so, but we really had very, very little contact with the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="3760">And when we were in Bergen-Belsen, we didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="3761">But we haven't gotten to Bergen-Belsen yet. </sentence><sentence id="3762">We are still in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3763">A couple escaped, there were people escaping. </sentence><sentence id="3764">And we witnessed one hanging of a couple that escaped. </sentence><sentence id="3765">And we understand that there were more escapes and more hangings, but we did witness one. </sentence><sentence id="3766">And there were also suicides. </sentence><sentence id="3767">I mean, it was very easy to commit suicide if you could just get to the high voltage wires. </sentence><sentence id="3768">And some people did. </sentence><sentence id="3769">Another thing that happened that was quite a regular occurrence were the latrines. </sentence><sentence id="3770">I mean, we had to go when we were ordered to go and I don't know whether you saw the pictures, I didn't see any pictures in here of the latrines, but it was a cement kind of a block in the center of the barrack with holes. </sentence><sentence id="3771">A double row of holes. </sentence><sentence id="3772">And you were supposed to do your business there. </sentence><sentence id="3773">And that sure was not a very pleasant sight or a very pleasant time. </sentence><sentence id="3774">And this one thing that I was really suffering from was constipation and to this day I still have to be very careful what I eat and what I do and the timing because, I don't want to talk about it, Robert. </sentence><sentence id="3775">But maybe this is important that it is recorded too. </sentence><sentence id="3776">I mean, you don't like to talk about these things, but I remember one night. </sentence><sentence id="3777">I mean, at night if we had to go, there was a bucket. </sentence><sentence id="3778">And I remember one night I had to go and the cappo (ph) would not let, and I think it was Betsy with me, they wouldn't let us until we emptied the bucket. </sentence><sentence id="3779">And the bucket was about, like a 30 gallon garbage can, maybe 25 gallon garbage can, I know it wasn't as high as that, it was about this high. </sentence><sentence id="3780">And she said we have to carry the garbage can to the latrine, there was a ditch that you poured it in, before we can use it. </sentence><sentence id="3781">And that's not a very pleasant feeling either. </sentence><sentence id="3782">Especially when, if you do have an accident, there's no clean clothes that you can put on. </sentence><sentence id="3783">And there is no way of washing it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3830">Q: So two people would carry these buckets and these buckets are about two or three feet high? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3832">A: About two and a half feet high. </sentence><sentence id="3833">Like a garbage can, but it was more like a drum with sort of handles, wire handles or something, and we carried that. </sentence><sentence id="3834">And it was pretty full. </sentence><sentence id="3835">And we were trying to carry it very carefully so that it wouldn't splash because, as I said, if it splashed on us we had no way of clean up and these probably were the worst times. </sentence><sentence id="3836">Probably much worse than not having enough food. </sentence><sentence id="3837">Because you really dealt with, I don't really want to say, but it was shit.[Laughter] But that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="3838">And I can't understand how I can laugh now, I really can't. </sentence><sentence id="3839">But I do. </sentence><sentence id="3840">Maybe that's why I survived. </sentence><sentence id="3841">Maybe that's why I'm not completely crazy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3853">Q: You mentioned that there were hangings going on, or that you witnessed one hanging. </sentence><sentence id="3854">What was the reason? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3857">A: They escaped and they were caught. </sentence><sentence id="3858">They were brought back. </sentence><sentence id="3859">There were more hangings in Prostejov and they always made hangings public to scare us, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="3860">But my brother was in Prostejov and he had a girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="3861">And I think he was quite fond of her and he was still able to go out because he was going to work in the factory, that was after my father was already gone. </sentence><sentence id="3862">And he came, I never saw him cry. </sentence><sentence id="3863">He was a very brave guy. </sentence><sentence id="3864">And that time he came in and I had a place to meet him and I would bring him some food and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3865">And he said that they were, that they did hang the girl and some other people with her. </sentence><sentence id="3866">And why? </sentence><sentence id="3867">Somebody tried to escape and they caught them and then they just took people at random and she was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="3868">And he said, it could have been him, it could have been anybody else, but they did hang her. </sentence><sentence id="3869">So, I try not to think about these things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3883">Q: Did you ever consider trying to escape or do anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3885">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3886">Because we knew that it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="3887">I mean, the people that did escape, I really don't know of anybody that escaped and wasn't caught. </sentence><sentence id="3888">Because the way the camp was situated, it wasn't like there were woods and you can just hide and whatnot, unless you had really help from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="3889">And I really don't know much about it. </sentence><sentence id="3890">All I know is that between the barbed wire, electrified, and the guards in the towers, and the dogs, it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="3891">That anybody who would try might as well finish off on the wires. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3956">A: Well that happened about two or three weeks before. </sentence><sentence id="3957">You see, we went to sauna and the de- lousing so-called. </sentence><sentence id="3958">And when we were completely undressed, you see the routine was as I said we bundled our clothes and put it on this cart which was wheeled into the de-lousing compound which I think were the temporary, provisional little gas chambers, but anyway, that's where we were. </sentence><sentence id="3959">In a room where we undressed and then the SS men came in and started to whip right and left, right and left. </sentence><sentence id="3960">And Doot-sie (ph) mother was by then, she was an older woman, I mean today its not an older woman if you're in you're late 50's or so. </sentence><sentence id="3961">But she was in a bad shape and she was really very, very skinny and very old looking. </sentence><sentence id="3962">And so she was pushed away together with some other older women and Doot-sie (ph) and I and Betsy were pushed to the right to go to the sauna. </sentence><sentence id="3963">And I remember Doot-sie (ph) really went into hysterics and she ran to her mother and they were holding onto her and the guards were just whipping her and pushing her and really separated us. </sentence><sentence id="3964">And they pushed us into the sauna and closed the door. </sentence><sentence id="3965">And Doot-sie (ph) was in complete hysterics because she was really, really always very close to her mother. </sentence><sentence id="3966">Then we went through the bath and went back to our barracks. </sentence><sentence id="3967">And I know she cried all night. </sentence><sentence id="3968">But then we found out that the mother was in so-called Shonin's (ph) block where they kept people supposedly that weren't able to work anymore and they were kind of sheltered. </sentence><sentence id="3969">And taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="3970">And she cried and she was very philosophical about it when we saw her. </sentence><sentence id="3971">She says, well, I suppose I'm going out through the chimney. </sentence><sentence id="3972">And Doot-sie (ph) went into hysterics and the mother said that she was very, very thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="3973">That the soup that they got was terribly salty and they didn't get any water. </sentence><sentence id="3974">And there was no way we could bring her any water. </sentence><sentence id="3975">I mean, we couldn't carry it in the bowl because they would have seen it and there were no bottles and she said that she really just lost the will to live. </sentence><sentence id="3976">Mainly because she was so terribly thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="3977">And we came the next day again to see her and she was in a worse case even. </sentence><sentence id="3978">And she said that she was just too weak to even walk. </sentence><sentence id="3979">And then I guess that evening they finished them off because we came the next day and, I'm quite sure we saw her at least twice. </sentence><sentence id="3980">And then the next day they were all gone. </sentence><sentence id="3981">The barrack was empty. </sentence><sentence id="3982">You see, we could move around after work. </sentence><sentence id="3983">I mean, we sometimes would get a permission to go out and go to the other barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3984">So they were just taken to the gas. </sentence><sentence id="3985">And evidently we were told too by the old timers that the people that they were going to gas, they were fed salty food, very salty soups so that they were so thirsty that they would just going half crazy and they would just as soon go into the gas chamber than to suffer. </sentence><sentence id="3986">So they just went. </sentence><sentence id="3987">They were not fighting or they were not trying to save themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3988">The faster the better. </sentence><sentence id="3989">So, she was gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4025">Q: Was Doot-sie (ph) younger than you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4027">A: Oh no, Doot-sie (ph) was quite a bit older. </sentence><sentence id="4028">No, she was, I don't remember, in the book it says what year she was born, but Yannick (ph) was born in 1921 and Doot-sie (ph) might have been five years older, five or six years older. </sentence><sentence id="4029">They were the only two children that they had. </sentence><sentence id="4030">But she was quite a bit older. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4035">Q: And when the day of the selection came, did you have any forewarning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4037">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="4038">Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="4039">We had no idea of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="4040">And again, it was, they gave us a bath again. </sentence><sentence id="4041">All the selections were taking place in saunas. </sentence><sentence id="4042">And I had no idea whether Doot-sie (ph) was taken to the gas chamber or whether she was just selected out to stay. </sentence><sentence id="4043">But I know that the people that were selected to go, we had to, I think we were bathed again. </sentence><sentence id="4044">I mean, we took a shower. </sentence><sentence id="4045">And then got the clothes from the de-lousing cart and after that we were kept in a sort of a compound by the railroad tracks. </sentence><sentence id="4046">And I think we were allowed to take the blanket. </sentence><sentence id="4047">Because we used the blankets for shawls and for, and the blankets had to go through de-lousing, so I am quite sure that we came to Bergen-Belsen with blankets, because we were not given any when we were there. </sentence><sentence id="4048">Because in Bergen-Belsen we, it was just bare floor and some bunks. </sentence><sentence id="4049">But Betsy and I were sleeping on the floor, not on the bunk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4063">Q: And when you left were you taken in a train immediately or did you go in a truck? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4065">A: No, I think we were loaded on the train and I don't think it was more than an hour or so that the train left. </sentence><sentence id="4066">I think they loaded us up and it wasn't like the other transports. </sentence><sentence id="4067">You know, that they kept us on the train and we weren't really very squished either. </sentence><sentence id="4068">I mean, it was squishy but we could sort of stretch out. </sentence><sentence id="4069">I mean it wasn't like standing room only. </sentence><sentence id="4070">And it was more like they were transporting us to use us for something and not to exterminate us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4077">Q: But you had no idea where you were going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4079">A: We had no idea where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="4080">And we just knew that we were going away from the crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="4081">So we were rather hopeful. </sentence><sentence id="4082">We were rather hopeful. </sentence><sentence id="4083">And when we arrived in Bergen- Belsen, somehow we heard that it was Bergen-Belsen, and Betsy and I were very happy and we were telling everybody what a wonderful place it was after Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="4084">That, oh, oh, we are so lucky that we are in Bergen-Belsen because this will be really just a resort compared with    Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="4085">Resort my foot! </sentence><sentence id="4086">It wasn't a resort. </sentence><sentence id="4087">By then it was pretty crowded. </sentence><sentence id="4088">It was quite crowded. </sentence><sentence id="4089">And the facilities, I don't know what they did with the bathrooms and I don't know what they did with the lavatories and everything else because I just don't remember running water anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4090">And I don't remember latrines. </sentence><sentence id="4091">I think we were using buckets. </sentence><sentence id="4092">Because I just don't remember that there was bathrooms or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="4093">If there were any they were not in our barrack. </sentence><sentence id="4094">And at that time, I was, the barrack that we were in were not just the Hungarian women. </sentence><sentence id="4095">There were Polish women and from all over and there were Czech women and there were different nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="4096">There were no gypsies as I recall, but our barrack had women of all nationalities and I remember the three sisters from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4097">Carmella was the oldest one, and then there were, I don't remember the names of the two others, but one couldn't have been more than thirteen. </sentence><sentence id="4098">She was a skinny little thing and not very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="4099">And then there was the middle sister who was quite nice looking and Carmella was just simply beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="4100">And Carmella was very, very talented and she could draw beautifully and I don't know where she got the paper from, but the whole time, and she had pencil, and the whole time she was drawing and writing poems. </sentence><sentence id="4101">And I don't know whatever happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="4102">Carmella was the first one to die. </sentence><sentence id="4103">And I remember waking up in the morning and hearing the younger sister cried, that Carmel-ka is dead, Carmel-ka is dead! </sentence><sentence id="4104">And they were both sobbing and whining. </sentence><sentence id="4105">And there were many more people that were dead and when they died, we just dragged them outside. </sentence><sentence id="4106">And at that time there were still the commandos for the dead people and they would tie straps to the wrists and to their feet and they would drag them. </sentence><sentence id="4107">Two people would drag each cadaver to the ditch. </sentence><sentence id="4108">And then, three days later the middle sister died. </sentence><sentence id="4109">And then the little one died probably a week later. </sentence><sentence id="4110">And I remember waking up in the morning and seeing the little one on all fours, sort of scrunched up and I think she went to the bathroom, just being scrunched up like that. </sentence><sentence id="4111">And she was dead. </sentence><sentence id="4112">And we dragged her out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4148">Q: Was it typhus? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4150">A: Typhus. </sentence><sentence id="4151">Now the little one died of typhus and Carmella I think died of typhus and the edema. </sentence><sentence id="4152">And the middle one died, she wasn't swollen. </sentence><sentence id="4153">The two younger ones weren't but Carmella was. </sentence><sentence id="4154">And then I remember this one woman, we woke up in the morning and she was on the upper bunk and she was so swollen that she looked Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="4155">Her eyes were just slits in her face and it just was, this was something that was really amazing. </sentence><sentence id="4156">That it's really not, I came across a medical report book in Poland, in polish, and I tried to find that syndrome and I don't think it was ever really described. </sentence><sentence id="4157">So I don't know, I didn't really research it very much but I would like to spend some time in the library and see what, if they have anything of that sort described. </sentence><sentence id="4158">But it was just amazing that, if you woke up with you're eyes swelling you were dead in less than three days. </sentence><sentence id="4159">And as I understand just a good dose of dietetic probably would have cured everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4170">Q: When was it that you arrived in Bergen-Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4172">A: We arrived in Bergen-Belsen after New Years, that was 1945. </sentence><sentence id="4173">I think it was January 1st because it seems to me that when they were toasting and screaming and yelling it was New Years" and I think that we arrived in Bergen-Belsen the next day. </sentence><sentence id="4174">Sometime late in the evening, late in the afternoon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4178">Q: Did you work at all while you were in Bergen-Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4180">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="4181">We didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="4182">We didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="4183">We just sat there and we still had our bowls. </sentence><sentence id="4184">The bowls were more precious than gold because if you didn't have a bowl you did not, you couldn't hold soup in you're hands. </sentence><sentence id="4185">Maybe I, no, I don't remember whether I, I think I wanted to work in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="4186">Because you could steal a potato. </sentence><sentence id="4187">It seems to me that maybe I did because I remember eating raw potatoes because we had no way of cooking them. </sentence><sentence id="4188">But I remember that I was surprised, I had never ate a raw potato before, that it tasted a little bit like an apple without the apple taste,    except the texture was more like an apple. </sentence><sentence id="4189">But, maybe I did. </sentence><sentence id="4190">But I just don't really remember. </sentence><sentence id="4191">The whole time in Bergen-Belsen is just one big fog. </sentence><sentence id="4192">And one thing happened and it was like a miracle because I was outside and I looked up and there was Mrs. Gi-gen-ska (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4193">I saw Mrs. Gi-gen-ska (ph) and I thought I died. </sentence><sentence id="4194">And I was back in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="4195">I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="4196">And she didn't have her hair shaved or anything and she was with her cane, she was limping because she had something wrong with her leg. </sentence><sentence id="4197">And she had her cane and she recognized me. </sentence><sentence id="4198">Actually I recognized her because she looked just like she did. </sentence><sentence id="4199">She was blonde and she had sort of wavy hair and she had her nice clothes on. </sentence><sentence id="4200">Not the rags that we had. </sentence><sentence id="4201">And I looked at her and I called her and she recognized me of sorts. </sentence><sentence id="4202">She couldn't believe that Anya (ph), Anya (ph) was my name, and we hugged and we kissed and I wanted to know what she was doing there. </sentence><sentence id="4203">And she was in a different part of the camp but she just happened to be in that common area. </sentence><sentence id="4204">You see, we were not standing up hill anymore, we were not counted. </sentence><sentence id="4205">We just kind of existed. </sentence><sentence id="4206">And she was in a very good shape. </sentence><sentence id="4207">And you know that except hugging with her and kissing her, I had no recollection anymore of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="4208">And I don't think I saw her again. </sentence><sentence id="4209">And not until three years ago when Rena Chic-kin- ska (ph), her daughter, got my address. </sentence><sentence id="4210">Well actually no, she didn't get my address. </sentence><sentence id="4211">Ches-ruf (ph) wrote to Chin-ut-sa's (ph) wife, I introduced them and they were boyfriend and girlfriend at some time, and Ches-ruf (ph) send me Rena's letter. </sentence><sentence id="4212">Just like the Red Cross does. </sentence><sentence id="4213">If you write to the Red Cross and you want an address of you're cousin somewhere, they won't do it. </sentence><sentence id="4214">You give them the letter that you want you're cousin to get and then they send it to you're cousin, and then the cousin decides whether he wants to correspond with you or not. </sentence><sentence id="4215">So Ches-ruf (ph) decided the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="4216">He send me Rena's letter and he said that Rena said that she knew me from school and she wanted to get in touch with me. </sentence><sentence id="4217">One of the reasons that she wanted to get in touch, she knew that I was alive, at least that I was alive in 1945 because her mother saw me in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4218">You see, I    couldn't even remember whether I saw her in Auschwitz or I saw her in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4219">But Rena wrote that I saw her in Bergen-Belsen and what Rena wanted was, she went to Israel, they were not Jewish but she married a Jewish man after the war, a writer. </sentence><sentence id="4220">A play writer and a play critic in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="4221">That's another story, but anyway she went to Israel and she witnessed the Ad-va-shem (ph) ceremony for the Righteous. </sentence><sentence id="4222">And she thought that maybe her mother was dead already, she died of a heart attack in I think 1983 or 1982. </sentence><sentence id="4223">And she thought that her mother was helping a lot of Jews and among them she was helping my family. </sentence><sentence id="4224">That maybe I could write a testimonial and see whether they could get a medal for her. </sentence><sentence id="4225">And so I wrote back to Rena and I wanted to know more about her mother and she said that it was Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4226">That what happened was her mother was helping a lot of people and one of them was smuggling weapons to the resistance or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="4227">And they caught her finally. </sentence><sentence id="4228">Just before the Auschwitz was to be evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="4229">And they sent her to Auschwitz and when the train arrived, they decided they didn't need any more prisoners in Auschwitz and they sent her off to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4230">And she was just plain lucky because if she arrived in Auschwitz three weeks earlier or so she would have been put straight into the gas chamber with her limping leg. </sentence><sentence id="4231">And this way she had, even she had her cane with her, they didn't take it away from her. </sentence><sentence id="4232">And she had still her normal clothes and she was never tattooed because the train arrived, as Rena said, the train arrived in Auschwitz and then her mother was sent to Bergen- Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4233">And she stayed in Bergen-Belsen until, that I got all from Rena, until October because she did have typhus too. </sentence><sentence id="4234">And so she stayed in Bergen-Belsen and then she was sent back to Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="4235">So that's how Rena knew that I was alive, because her mother saw me there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4294">Q: You mentioned that you had a bowl in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4295">Did you bring it from Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4298">A: Oh, the bowl was from Auschwitz, the bowl was from Auschwitz, but I didn't bring the bowl. </sentence><sentence id="4299">I brought all kinds of other things. </sentence><sentence id="4300">I brought the pill. </sentence><sentence id="4301">I bought the cyanide capsule for about four rations of bread that I saved. </sentence><sentence id="4302">Because I wasn't going to go to the gas chamber again. </sentence><sentence id="4303">They didn't bring that. </sentence><sentence id="4304">And I had a knife and was going to cut my veins. </sentence><sentence id="4305">I didn't have to. </sentence><sentence id="4306">I think I brought the knife with me, but I don't know whether my cousin took it away from me. </sentence><sentence id="4307">It was just a small pocketknife. </sentence><sentence id="4308">Because you see, you could buy anything in the camp from the Canada people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4321">Q: You bought the knife and the pill while you were in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4323">A: Yes, that was still in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="4324">End of Tape 5. </sentence><sentence id="4325">Tape 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4329">Q: We're in Bergen-Belsen and you were telling me about you're seeing Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4331">You were telling me a little bit about after you had seen her and her daughter and you had the correspondence. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4332">A: Oh and about her daughter, that she wrote to me, and anyways to make this story just complete, that I spent quite some time remembering all of the events from the time I decided to get married. </sentence><sentence id="4333">Because it was Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) that recommended that I, that Yannick and I get married. </sentence><sentence id="4334">And this way I can, she was a very clever woman. </sentence><sentence id="4335">She really, she was divorced, separated or divorced from her husband and she had this jewelry store. </sentence><sentence id="4336">And actually, as I found out, it wasn't, I just met her just after the war started and I found out that the store really was not hers. </sentence><sentence id="4337">It belonged to a Jewish woman, and I have her name, I forget, but she turned it over just like my father turned over his tannery to the Mos-tof-ski (ph) family. </sentence><sentence id="4338">This woman, Helena I think was her first name, turned over her store to Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) and it was Chi-chin-ska's Perfumery and Jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="4339">It was costume jewelry mainly. </sentence><sentence id="4340">And she was running a very good business and sometimes she was paying some of the profits to the Jewish woman. </sentence><sentence id="4341">And I don't know exactly what happened, if she survived the war or not, but anyway this is what was happening as far as Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) was concemed. </sentence><sentence id="4342">And she had a lot of connections and a lot of wisdom on how to run a business. </sentence><sentence id="4343">And as I say, she helped our family to find places to live as we had to keep on moving, and then also we were selling some of the jewelry and things and she always got a very good price for it and sold it for us. </sentence><sentence id="4344">So I wrote it all up, about fourteen pages, very detailed for Yat-va-sham (ph) and they accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="4345">And actually, it was not just Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) but Rena at that time was, she was just about a year younger than I and she was helping too. </sentence><sentence id="4346">And one of the things that she was doing, you know that Doot-sie (ph) and her mother were giving the English lessons in their apartment, and Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) was in her store and Rena was directing the traffic of all the students. </sentence><sentence id="4347">She was sort of on the look-out to make sure that there is no police and there is no suspicion, that there are people are coming and going because they had lessons every hour of the hour. </sentence><sentence id="4348">So Rena was very much involved in this whole business too. </sentence><sentence id="4349">So they both were recognized and I have a photograph of Rena receiving the medal, for her and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="4350">And a certificate, so they got it a year ago. </sentence><sentence id="4351">So that's the story of Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4352">Oh, and she said that her mother came home from Bergen-Belsen emaciated and sick, but she recovered very fast and then they lived in Krakow for some time and she died of a heart attack in church. </sentence><sentence id="4353">One Sunday they went to Mass and she died. </sentence><sentence id="4354">So I think she was in her late 80's, so Rena was at peace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4379">Q: You came down with typhus as well while you were in Bergen-Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4381">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4382">And actually that probably somewhat might have saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="4383">Because when the British came, I was just recovering from typhus. </sentence><sentence id="4384">I had edema but it was not as progressive as the ones that killed people in three days. </sentence><sentence id="4385">I remember crawling on my hands and knees because my legs were so swollen, it wasn't just my ankles but I think they were swollen all the way to my knees. </sentence><sentence id="4386">And my hands were swollen. </sentence><sentence id="4387">But somehow my eyes and my face weren't as bad. </sentence><sentence id="4388">And I remember I barely could walk. </sentence><sentence id="4389">And there were two or three steps into the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="4390">I think the barracks were not on a foundation, but on stilts. </sentence><sentence id="4391">And I know that I crawled up and I just barely could walk. </sentence><sentence id="4392">Now we are coming very close to the liberation now. </sentence><sentence id="4393">Because I started, that that saved my life, that I did have typhus, because I had no appetite. </sentence><sentence id="4394">I know that I hadn't eaten anything for several days. </sentence><sentence id="4395">I know I was very thirsty and I just don't remember that there was water available. </sentence><sentence id="4396">I know people can't live without water, but I just don't remember having any water to drink. </sentence><sentence id="4397">And we knew that something was going on because we could hear shooting, and heavy shooting. </sentence><sentence id="4398">And it seemed to me like there were air raids all the time because the sirens were going. </sentence><sentence id="4399">And the guards seemed to be sort of not </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4400"> paying much attention to us and we didn't get any food. </sentence><sentence id="4401">And I don't remember how long it was that we didn't get any food. </sentence><sentence id="4402">And then when we woke up in the morning there were no guards. </sentence><sentence id="4403">And I remember crawling out and seeing people running towards the gates and the gates were open. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4404">There were big, wooden gates. </sentence><sentence id="4405">They were not barbed wire gates, they were wooden gates. </sentence><sentence id="4406">And there were big wooden posts. </sentence><sentence id="4407">And there were no guards, and in the towers there were no guards, anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4408">And we couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="4409">And then the first tank came in. </sentence><sentence id="4410">And they were British. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4411">They had barrettes and the Germans did not wear berets. </sentence><sentence id="4412">And they had kind of greenish uniforms, not the

believe either. </sentence><sentence id="4416">I forgot to tell you what the camp looked like by then. </sentence><sentence id="4417">First of all, there were dead people all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="4418">And there was, I don't want to use the bad word, but there was shit all over because everybody had diarrhea or there was no, they couldn't get to the latrine and they just did it where ever they stood. </sentence><sentence id="4419">And you couldn't even walk. </sentence><sentence id="4420">And there was, I don't know whether it is recorded or not, but there was cannibalism going on. </sentence><sentence id="4421">I remember. </sentence><sentence id="4422">It was before the British tanks. </sentence><sentence id="4423">For several days when we didn't get any food or anything and I saw people with their stomachs open and they were eating liver. </sentence><sentence id="4424">I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="4425">Robert likes liver. </sentence><sentence

all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="4431">And I probably should say dead people. </sentence><sentence id="4432">And they, the Germans, that was before the Germans escaped. </sentence><sentence id="4433">They were making us, I didn't because I couldn't walk, but whoever could, say they dragged them. </sentence><sentence id="4434">They dragged them to the ditches, but they didn't have enough help. </sentence><sentence id="4435">They didn't have enough help to clean everything so when the British came, the place was just absolutely covered with dead people. </sentence><sentence id="4436">Just piles of them. </sentence><sentence id="4437">Some of them were piled up and some of them were just scattered around, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4438">And people just defecating and relieving themselves right where they stood. </sentence><sentence id="4439">It was just horrible. </sentence><sentence id="4440">And, and before that, there was this one time, a few weeks before that, when they drowned a girl in a bucket of soup. </sentence><sentence id="4441">You know, they would bring the, that was when they were still cooking for us. </sentence><sentence id="4442">The soup was turnips or potatoes or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4443">And they brought it in and people were so hungry that they were storming at it and pushing and pulling and one of the women leaned over and they pushed her, just right into the bucket of soup. </sentence><sentence id="4444">And she couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="4445">The rest

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4465">Q: You described seeing the soldiers coming. </sentence><sentence id="4466">You knew they weren't German. </sentence><sentence id="4467">Did you know that they were British? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4471">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4472">We knew that they, because I said that they looked different. </sentence><sentence id="4473">I don't remember the markings on the tanks or anything, or the cars, or the trucks, but they had different uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="4474">They had round sort of caps and they had jackets. </sentence><sentence id="4475">And they drove into the camp and stopped the trucks and people who could walk or run just swarmed them the guys really had to protect themselves. </sentence><sentence id="4476">They had cigarettes and they had chocolate bars and they were throwing them and people were killing themselves for that, and so they stopped because people were just killing each other to get hold of the chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="4477">And I just don't remember what happened exactly, but it seems to me that more and more of them came and somehow the people that were well enough, more of the newcomers, like Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) was one of the newcomers, I think those were trying to put some kind of an order into the place and put us back into the barracks until more soldiers came in so that they could somehow control the crowds. </sentence><sentence id="4478">And the first thing that they did, they opened the kitchen and they cooked this food. </sentence><sentence id="4479">They brought out big barrels of the food that they cooked and it was some kind of British rations that were just a fantastic stew with big chunks of salt, pork or whatever, it was fat. </sentence><sentence id="4480">And it was just absolutely smelling deliciously and people just went crazy and they really had to push them around to be able to ration this stuff out. </sentence><sentence id="4481">And I remember getting a bow! </sentence><sentence id="4482">of it and eating it with my fingers and I think I took one mouthful and I couldn't swallow it. </sentence><sentence id="4483">I just couldn't eat anything. </sentence><sentence id="4484">I just got sick to my stomach and I just left the bowl there and I just didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="4485">I remember crawling back into the barrack and Betsy couldn't eat either. </sentence><sentence id="4486">Betsy also had typhus and she, we both cried because we were so hungry and we just wanted water. </sentence><sentence id="4487">There was plenty of water to drink too. </sentence><sentence id="4488">They had cups and we could drink. </sentence><sentence id="4489">But we couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="4490">But there were a lot of people who were just gorging themselves with that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="4491">And they were all dead the next day. </sentence><sentence id="4492">They all got diarrhea and that place was really then horrible. </sentence><sentence id="4493">Because they had diarrhea in the barrack, they had diarrhea everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4494">And evidently they couldn't eat that kind of food and that caused the diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="4495">And people were just sick all over. </sentence><sentence id="4496">They were throwing up and that was probably worse than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="4497">And by then, it seems to me like the medical Corp arrived. </sentence><sentence id="4498">And they cooked up big drums of watery cereal, sort of a cream of wheat or something, but it mostly looked like watery stuff. </sentence><sentence id="4499">And they gave us that to eat and I remember | ate that, I think it was more like drinking. </sentence><sentence id="4500">I drank about two cups of it, but a lot of us thought that that wasn't food really and we were explained that our stomachs were not use to the rich food and we had to slowly get adjusted. </sentence><sentence id="4501">I remember the next portion was a little bit thicker until we finally got gruel, which is the normal thickness, but for at least three days. </sentence><sentence id="4502">And then also there was bread in storage but we didn't get it. </sentence><sentence id="4503">I mean, the Germans would not give us the bread but the British finally opened the stores and they found there was plenty of bread, which they never distributed. </sentence><sentence id="4504">So we did get bread. </sentence><sentence id="4505">And more and more British came and they started cleaning up the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4506">But the main thing was that the Germans could not, a lot of them did not escape. </sentence><sentence id="4507">And they hid in the camp and the Commander, Kramer, I    think was his name, he was caught. </sentence><sentence id="4508">And the woman, I forget her name, the German woman, the main woman that was taking care of the women's camp, she was caught too. </sentence><sentence id="4509">And many others. </sentence><sentence id="4510">But Kramer was the one and the woman was the other one that we were all cheering, that they got caught. </sentence><sentence id="4511">And then what the British did that I never forget either, they had the German soldiers pile the corpses up in trucks and they had Kramer take his shirt off and lay naked at the top of the corpses. </sentence><sentence id="4512">And drive, they drove to the big ditches and buried the people. </sentence><sentence id="4513">And I know that the trucks were going back and forth, and back and forth, with all the dead people. </sentence><sentence id="4514">I don't know, I heard the figure that there were like 30,000 or so that were dead. </sentence><sentence id="4515">And then they were cleaning up the barracks and cleaning up the whole camp. </sentence><sentence id="4516">And then I have a vague recollection of what was going on, but I know that they had a scale and I guess the British doctors, they were weighing us and taking photographs. </sentence><sentence id="4517">And I remember I weighed 71 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="4518">I didn't know what pounds were, I just knew kilograms, but they were weighing us in pounds. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4571">A: 5'L". </sentence><sentence id="4572">And, oh, but I know we got food. </sentence><sentence id="4573">That after a while we got bread and we got still a kind of not very thick soup and not much meat, but evidently very nutritious food because it seems to me like I gained weight, maybe five pounds in the first months or so. </sentence><sentence id="4574">That was April 14, 1945 when the gate opened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4579">Q: Had you recovered from typhus at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4581">A: By then I was quite recovered. </sentence><sentence id="4582">I didn't have fever and I was recovered from typhus. </sentence><sentence id="4583">And I was, except for the swelling, which was going away, and I was getting stronger after I had the food and I was feeling better and better. </sentence><sentence id="4584">And it took about maybe two weeks for me to sort of recuperate. </sentence><sentence id="4585">And I was getting back my appetite. </sentence><sentence id="4586">But the main thing was that because I had typhus I didn't have any appetite and I didn't eat the gruel, the rich food that they gave us. </sentence><sentence id="4587">And then the big thing was that    they de-loused us. </sentence><sentence id="4588">But they really de-loused us with DDT. </sentence><sentence id="4589">The system was that they had these pumped up, you know the containers with the pump, and we had to open our panties and they sprinkled the stuff and behind, into our dresses and into sleeves, and everywhere, and our hair. </sentence><sentence id="4590">We didn't know that DDT was quite toxic, but not only for the lice but for people, but I think at that point, nobody cared what was toxic. </sentence><sentence id="4591">The main thing was that we could see the lice just die, right on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="4592">So that was one of the great things that they did for us. </sentence><sentence id="4593">And we finally got rid of the lice. </sentence><sentence id="4594">But I never forget the DDT treatment. </sentence><sentence id="4595">End of Side A of Tape 6. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4620">A: Well when we were liberated, she was still sick and she was getting worse. </sentence><sentence id="4621">She couldn't eat anything and they opened the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="4622">I mean, the British opened the hospital and so that's where she went and I would go and visit her. </sentence><sentence id="4623">But then she recovered from typhus but she evidently had tuberculosis and so she was in the hospital the rest of the time. </sentence><sentence id="4624">Until I left. </sentence><sentence id="4625">So I just went to visit her and I just don't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="4626">I searched in the books and the only thing that I found was a record of us being in Bergen-Belsen the first time. </sentence><sentence id="4627">But under the column of diseased, there was just blanks. </sentence><sentence id="4628">So I haven't, and then I searched other books and I have not found her name anywhere else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4638">Q: Will you describe you're memories of the British. </sentence><sentence id="4639">Did you have any particular recollections of relations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4642">A: Not a lot because, first of all, we were absolutely overwhelmed. </sentence><sentence id="4643">I mean we just couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="4644">It took a while to sort of sink into our brains that we didn't have to be up in the morning for a roll call, that we didn't have to be scared, that we were going to get food, that we were alive. </sentence><sentence id="4645">That    maybe even we had a future. </sentence><sentence id="4646">And everybody was absolutely just wonderful to us. </sentence><sentence id="4647">They had tons of chocolate and cigarettes and they just, they were all for, I mean cigarettes and chocolates and anything else was just for the asking. </sentence><sentence id="4648">And they took a lot of photographs and I remember that they did weigh me and photograph me, just on the street. </sentence><sentence id="4649">It was nothing official. </sentence><sentence id="4650">And I was about 70 or 71 pounds, I was really skinny. </sentence><sentence id="4651">And still in the horrible clothing because they didn't have anything else to give us. </sentence><sentence id="4652">And I think we eventually got some better clothing and I don't know whether they brought them in from some warehouses or wherever, but I know that I did not wear the dress that I came in from Auschwitz, when my cousin took me. </sentence><sentence id="4653">So it seems to me that at one point I, see things went so fast and there is a one big blank of sorts, of the detailed day by day activities, but I know that one thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="4654">And it was shortly after the liberation when I was feeling better. </sentence><sentence id="4655">It might have been maybe two weeks later, maybe more, that I joined an excursion into the village. </sentence><sentence id="4656">And a lot of people were going into the adjoining villages and bringing food and clothing and it seems to me that that's where I got the dress that I was wearing later on. </sentence><sentence id="4657">And I remember going into one of the houses. </sentence><sentence id="4658">They were all abandoned, there were no, these were all German house, and it looked like people left in a great hurry. </sentence><sentence id="4659">And I remember going into one of the houses and there was silverware and a Lika camera and I always was very fond of Lika cameras, I had one and I had to leave it behind in Krakow when we were deported. </sentence><sentence id="4660">So I was just thrilled with the Lika camera. </sentence><sentence id="4661">I don't know what I was going to do with it, but somebody found a pillow case and we started to put the things, you know there were some table cloths and napkins and silverware and the Lika camera, and so we were putting those things in pillow cases. </sentence><sentence id="4662">And then somebody went down to the cellar or the basement and called us. </sentence><sentence id="4663">And there were about four women, there were four of us at that time, and so we went down. </sentence><sentence id="4664">And there were sausages and hams and a side of pork, I mean, there was food that we haven't seen for ages and it was just hanging from rafters and I think that's they way    usually food was preserved. </sentence><sentence id="4665">It was all smoked and preserved and then just hanging dry. </sentence><sentence id="4666">Out went the silver and the Lika and everything else, out of the pillow cases, and we loaded it all up with as much food as we could carry, and we went back to the camp and we shared it with other people. </sentence><sentence id="4667">At that time we could already eat normal food. </sentence><sentence id="4668">And we still were hungry all the time even though we could get as much food as we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="4669">It seems to me that the kitchens were going day and night. </sentence><sentence id="4670">And we did not have to stand in line. </sentence><sentence id="4671">They set up tables in sort of cafeteria style and we sat at the tables and ate. </sentence><sentence id="4672">And it was just such a change that it was extremely difficult for us to grasp it and to really know that it is all for real. </sentence><sentence id="4673">Every time I thought, well, you know, we were dreaming about being free and going out and doing things. </sentence><sentence id="4674">And I thought I was still dreaming. </sentence><sentence id="4675">And we were just living in a completely unreal world. </sentence><sentence id="4676">And then one day, I met a young soldier, British soldier. </sentence><sentence id="4677">And he was very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="4678">He spoke a little bit German and I didn't speak much English, but he was very friendly and we were not suppose to fraternize, or they weren't suppose to fraternize with the prisoners, so we were just holding hands and going for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="4679">And then he said that, he was a driver for one of the officers, for an older man. </sentence><sentence id="4680">And somehow I met his superior and he found out that I could speak several languages and he talked to me and he said, he has a job for me. </sentence><sentence id="4681">I should go to the hospital and also in the same building, or the building next to it, again I don't, these were all officer's quarters that the Germans lived in, and of course they were all abandoned. </sentence><sentence id="4682">He told me to go and he wrote it on a piece of papers to whom I should ask for, and I went there and they interviewed me. </sentence><sentence id="4683">And they thought that I would be just perfect for working in a records room, answering questions to people who are coming in looking for relatives and looking for other people. </sentence><sentence id="4684">So I thought this would be kind of neat. </sentence><sentence id="4685">And maybe that's when they gave me a different dress and I just don't quite remember. </sentence><sentence id="4686">But, oh, something else happened before that phase. </sentence><sentence id="4687">I went on another excursion into the village and we went very early in the morning, it was still very dark. </sentence><sentence id="4688">And we got    there and the first house that we came to was locked up so we couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="4689">So we went around looking for a way to get in and I know it was not proper to do it, but at that point we didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="4690">We just wanted things and we wanted to, I don't know why, well, it wasn't called stealing, it was called organizing. </sentence><sentence id="4691">And in the camp that was the word I learned, that it wasn't stealing, you just organized to get things and to just have things. </sentence><sentence id="4692">So we went around and I heard, see I lived in the country before I was arrested, and I heard sort of a familiar sound, birds or something, so I was with two other women. </sentence><sentence id="4693">And we followed the sound and there was a coop with a goose inside. </sentence><sentence id="4694">A big, fat goose. </sentence><sentence id="4695">Well, that was more than we could bear. </sentence><sentence id="4696">I mean, that was the most beautiful sight. </sentence><sentence id="4697">And I stuck my hand in and the goose bit my finger, you know they snap. </sentence><sentence id="4698">And I grabbed her by the neck and I could pull her out, I mean she was fighting me. </sentence><sentence id="4699">It was a female goose I think because we found eggs inside, I mean inside the goose, because I had my little knife, I told you about the knife that I had. </sentence><sentence id="4700">I did an awful thing. </sentence><sentence id="4701">I cut the goose's head off with the little knife and it took a while.[Laughing]. </sentence><sentence id="4702">It was awful. </sentence><sentence id="4703">But, I mean, having seen all the blood and all the dead bodies, I mean just cutting a goose head was not that bad, I think. </sentence><sentence id="4704">But today I think it was awful and I don't know whether I should laugh or cry, but we pulled the goose out and we threw the head back in. </sentence><sentence id="4705">And we were walking back dragging the goose and then we were thinking what will happen if the people come back and they will just find the head. </sentence><sentence id="4706">Maybe they wanted to have the goose and the other girls were saying, forget it. </sentence><sentence id="4707">Nobody was worried about you. </sentence><sentence id="4708">We have the goose and we sat in a ditch and we plucked the feathers. </sentence><sentence id="4709">It took about an hour and the down and the feathers were flying all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="4710">And then we took the goose back to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4711">That was before the kitchens were all set up properly and before we were getting the food in the cafeteria style. </sentence><sentence id="4712">We still were cooking outside on the little sort of stoves and in our bowls. </sentence><sentence id="4713">I mean, not stoves but on an open fire. </sentence><sentence id="4714">Anyway, I don't think I ate the goose. </sentence><sentence id="4715">I don't think I could eat it, but everybody was gorging    themselves. </sentence><sentence id="4716">I think they barbecued of sorts because they baked it on the, they cut it up and they baked it on top of the fire, and I know I couldn't eat it. </sentence><sentence id="4717">But to this day, I can't forget killing that poor goose. </sentence><sentence id="4718">So anyway, so that was before. </sentence><sentence id="4719">And then I went to get the job and they told me it was all right so I, they told me I will not be in the camp anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4720">I mean, stay in the barracks anymore but I will have my own room with a real bed. </sentence><sentence id="4721">And they told me where the room will be so I went upstairs and sure enough there was a bed and there was a mattress and there was a pillow, but there were no sheets and no blankets. </sentence><sentence id="4722">And I thought, well, I suppose maybe they will give me something. </sentence><sentence id="4723">So then I found out that there was a supply room downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="4724">I don't know whether I should tell you this story because I told it to my children and they said, well, you have to tell. [ </sentence><sentence id="4725">rest of following sentence accidentally deleted from testimony] study. </sentence><sentence id="4726">So, I could read English much better than I could speak. </sentence><sentence id="4727">And, you see I didn't know the pronunciation, so I went downstairs and I tried to tell them that I need some bedding. </sentence><sentence id="4728">But they couldn't understand what I wanted and I said, "two shits for my bed - two shits". </sentence><sentence id="4729">They almost died! </sentence><sentence id="4730">Oh, they kept on asking me and they were just laughing and I kept on repeating and they were laughing some more. </sentence><sentence id="4731">Well, finally they knew what was going on, that the pronunciation was, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4732">Sheet or shit or whatever, it's all the same to me. </sentence><sentence id="4733">Well anyway, they gave me the bedding and that was the first time in over a year I slept in a real bed. </sentence><sentence id="4734">With a blanket. </sentence><sentence id="4735">Covered with a blanket cover and a sheet and a white sheet, washed, clean, and a pillow with a pillowcase. </sentence><sentence id="4736">And I couldn't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="4737">The mattress was not like I was use to, but still it was not the floor. </sentence><sentence id="4738">It was maybe a straw or maybe a thin blanket, and this is something I don't think I will ever forget. </sentence><sentence id="4739">So this was my room. </sentence><sentence id="4740">And it seems to me that I got some underwear and I got some, a change of clothes because I know they wanted me to be dressed up. </sentence><sentence id="4741">And I had a badge with my name on it. </sentence><sentence id="4742">I think they took my photograph too. </sentence><sentence id="4743">So I worked there and many people were coming and asking for relatives and, you know, people were wandering and wandering and    wandering from other camps and, I don't know, but there were a lot of people coming. </sentence><sentence id="4744">Even from our camp. </sentence><sentence id="4745">People were coming that were separated when they arrived and they wanted to know. </sentence><sentence id="4746">So I was busy. </sentence><sentence id="4747">I was mainly sitting there looking through the files and, I don't know, somebody else was preparing the files. </sentence><sentence id="4748">And I was still kind of seeing this young man who decided he was in love with me and he wants to marry me. </sentence><sentence id="4749">Well, there was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="4750">There was no fraternization and you could not marry anybody. </sentence><sentence id="4751">And so he talked to his boss and what was happening too is that the officer, I don't know whether he was a General or somebody who was in charge of that particular division and the young man was his driver. </sentence><sentence id="4752">As a matter of fact, I still have his photograph. </sentence><sentence id="4753">I didn't bring it with me but there it is, "To my beloved Anna". </sentence><sentence id="4754">And he said, so the older man, the British officer, wanted to know whether he could take, really get me out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4755">Well there was no way he could. </sentence><sentence id="4756">And he had a daughter about my age and he just couldn't see leaving me there. </sentence><sentence id="4757">So he said, now do you have any relatives?

" </sentence><sentence id="5484">No!" </sentence><sentence id="5485">So we held onto our food. </sentence><sentence id="5486">And then my Aunt looked at us and she said, "Well, you know what?" </sentence><sentence id="5487">She had a beautiful hat on and we had hats that we bought in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="5488">And I think we bought it in a place where the ladies of the night buy hats because my Aunt said, "Well, you know, in America, when you go to a dining place, you really don't wear hats inside." </sentence><sentence id="5489">So she took her hat off, and my Aunt wouldn't be caught dead without a hat. </sentence><sentence id="5490">But she wanted us to take those horrible hats off. </sentence><sentence id="5491">Mine was with a feather sticking out like that. </sentence><sentence id="5492">I remember it was a pheasant feather, just like this. </sentence><sentence id="5493">Well anyway, we didn't want to do that but we took the hats off and we went to the diner and then we started to eat. </sentence><sentence id="5494">And she couldn't believe that two young women can consume that much food and be still hungry. </sentence><sentence id="5495">Then we had to learn how to eat the American way. </sentence><sentence id="5496">Because you see in Europe you hold the fork and the knife and you cut with you're left hand. </sentence><sentence id="5497">And she showed us right there in the diner that you eat with the fork with you're left hand and you don't pile up stuff on the fork and eat it like that. </sentence><sentence id="5498">So anyway, she treated us really like two very young girls, which really what we were. </sentence><sentence id="5499">I mean, with social graces and things like . . . </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5500"> [End of Side A of Tape 7] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5501">A:...came to New York. </sentence><sentence id="5502">So anyway, we arrived in New York and my Uncle had his car parked at the train station and he drove us. </sentence><sentence id="5503">And then I said, "Oh, could we see that street?"

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5593">Q: What newspaper? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5595">A: I think it was either The New York Times or, I don't know whether there was another large paper in New York, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="5596">For years I had that article and then I finally threw it out. </sentence><sentence id="5597">Because, you see, before we arrived, my Aunt consulted with a psychiatrist and she was told that they should keep us in seclusion. </sentence><sentence id="5598">That they shouldn't ask us any questions and just see how we respond. </sentence><sentence id="5599">And not to even mention the camp. </sentence><sentence id="5600">I mean, we should just forget the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="5601">And we should live as if it never happened. </sentence><sentence id="5602">And I think I might have had several sessions with this psychiatrist but I don't remember very much about it. </sentence><sentence id="5603">I didn't want to talk about anything. </sentence><sentence id="5604">But anyway, the offshoot was that we should live in seclusion. </sentence><sentence id="5605">And just try to live as normal life as possible. </sentence><sentence id="5606">My Aunt's daughter, my cousin, was my age, she was married. </sentence><sentence id="5607">And she was in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="5608">Her husband and she both were working for, I think it was called United States, some kind of book, International Book Association, or something like that, and they were working in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="5609">And she had a little year- and-a-half girl, Claudia, with a nanny. </sentence><sentence id="5610">That one also lived in my Aunt's apartment. </sentence><sentence id="5611">And I remember one day, I mean these are all sort of anecdotes of remembering things that happened later. </sentence><sentence id="5612">One day, oh, the nanny use to take the baby out for an outing and then come back late in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="5613">And then my Aunt calls me in and Claudia is sleeping in the crib, and she had nice, long hair. </sentence><sentence id="5614">And my Aunt says, "Look how she's, every evening when we put her to bed, she's scratching her head so sweetly". </sentence><sentence id="5615">Vickie and I look at her. " </sentence><sentence id="5616">She's got lice!" " </sentence><sentence id="5617">What do you mean she's got lice?" </sentence><sentence id="5618">Well, the way she's scratching her head, that means she's got lice. </sentence><sentence id="5619">Now where can the child get lice but from the two refugees. </sentence><sentence id="5620">So my Aunt was out of her head. </sentence><sentence id="5621">Anyway, Vickie was holding the baby on her lap and I was doing the usual. </sentence><sentence id="5622">And there were lice. </sentence><sentence id="5623">And my Aunt almost fell to the floor in a dead faint. " </sentence><sentence id="5624">What do we do now?" </sentence><sentence id="5625">Edith, the mother of the child, is going to be here in two or three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="5626">Well, where did she get the lice? </sentence><sentence id="5627">Of course, from Vickie and me. </sentence><sentence id="5628">I said, "We don't have any lice. </sentence><sentence id="5629">We were de-loused before we came here." </sentence><sentence id="5630">Well anyway, turned out that the child got lice in the park. </sentence><sentence id="5631">I don't know where the nanny took her but she didn't get the lice from us. </sentence><sentence id="5632">And my Aunt says, "Well, what do we do?" </sentence><sentence id="5633">I said, "Well, first of all, you cut her hair as short as possible." </sentence><sentence id="5634">Preferably shaving, then you don't have any problem at all. </sentence><sentence id="5635">Well, we didn't shave the child's head but we cut it about half an inch or so and then | think they got some kind of a de-lousing liquid or fluid or something from a drug store and got rid of the lice. </sentence><sentence id="5636">But there was Claudia, looking like a little boy with very, very short hair. </sentence><sentence id="5637">And my cousin wanted a picture of her daughter that she hasn't seen for almost a year. </sentence><sentence id="5638">So my Aunt was very industrious and she got a pretty kerchief and she made a bambooshka and there was one picture of Claudia in a bambooshka and another picture of Claudia as a gypsy girl. [ </sentence><sentence id="5639">Laughter] Anyway, they were really cute pictures and Edith couldn't understand why the child had to be all dressed because she came home maybe three or four weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="5640">And then she found out. </sentence><sentence id="5641">And she also suspected Vickie and me, but then the truth came out    that it was the nanny that took her somewhere where the child got the lice. </sentence><sentence id="5642">But anyways, that's another story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5693">Q: Did you're Uncle and Aunt intend to adopt you legally in some way, or was that an issue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5695">A: No, I was grown up. </sentence><sentence id="5696">You see the people that offered the adoptions and all that, they had no idea who we were and what it was. </sentence><sentence id="5697">But no, my Aunt and Uncle, there was no need to adopt me. </sentence><sentence id="5698">I was a grown up widow and they thought of adopting Vickie but Vickie didn't want to be adopted. </sentence><sentence id="5699">I mean, she was eighteen. </sentence><sentence id="5700">No, she was about seventeen or seventeen and a half or so. </sentence><sentence id="5701">There was no need to be adopted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5709">Q: Did you have a citizenship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5711">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="5712">I applied for the, I mean I had that alien registration card and it would have taken five years to get a citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="5713">But in the meantime, I decided to learn English really properly and I enrolled in Judy Richmond High School and I took American history and I took English 10, English 11 and English 12. </sentence><sentence id="5714">In English 10, I read what varies, what plays. </sentence><sentence id="5715">They were all plays. </sentence><sentence id="5716">What every woman knows. </sentence><sentence id="5717">And in English 11, Hamlet. </sentence><sentence id="5718">And in English 12, MacBeth. </sentence><sentence id="5719">And then I came home after classes and I sat down with a dictionary and I translated every single word in the reading assignment for that day. </sentence><sentence id="5720">I stayed until about midnight or | o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="5721">And I was memorizing and memorizing and memorizing. </sentence><sentence id="5722">And my Aunt and Uncle insisted on speaking English, what they thought was English. </sentence><sentence id="5723">But it wasn't a very good English, so the English I ended up speaking was also not very good. </sentence><sentence id="5724">But I tried. </sentence><sentence id="5725">And I remember writing a paper in the American History about the Pilgrims. </sentence><sentence id="5726">And there was a sentence that, "profligacy took place of sobriety". </sentence><sentence id="5727">That was about the Pilgrims. </sentence><sentence id="5728">I don't know exactly what they were doing but that was the upshot. </sentence><sentence id="5729">And because in Polish, the longer the word and the more complicated, the more educated that person is that would be using it. </sentence><sentence id="5730">So I was looking for the longest words for most syllables and sobriety and profligacy, it    sounded very good. </sentence><sentence id="5731">And my history teacher, I remember her first name was Bernice, I don't remember her last name, but she was a single woman and she really took a liking to me and she helped me a tremendous amount and she thought that was the funniest thing she's ever heard about the Pilgrims. </sentence><sentence id="5732">And I remember I gave her a bottle of perfume, I think it was Prince Matchabellie, and she wrote me a thanks you note that she's going to use that for some profligacy between her moments of sobriety. </sentence><sentence id="5733">So anyway, that's another thing. </sentence><sentence id="5734">So after I finished, I took the Regents, the New York Regents, and I passed, I think I got only seven, but it was a passing grade, and my English wasn't too bad by then and I also was accepted to Hunter College. </sentence><sentence id="5735">And I was going to start Hunter College in September, but my Aunt had a big family reunion. </sentence><sentence id="5736">My cousin came back from Sweden with her husband and her husband's brothers came to visit. </sentence><sentence id="5737">They had a large house in Stamford, Connecticut, so we had a big party and a big family reunion. </sentence><sentence id="5738">And the older brother of my cousin's husband was a Professor of Bacteriology in Dallas, Texas medical school. </sentence><sentence id="5739">And he said that instead of going to Hunter College, I could come to Dallas, live in their house and maybe do some babysitting. </sentence><sentence id="5740">And they had two children, 4 and 7, and I could work in the laboratory and I could go to the Southwestern University, er, Methodist University. </sentence><sentence id="5741">Southwest at Methodist University. </sentence><sentence id="5742">So, I thought this was a wonderful opportunity to get away from New York, from my Aunt and from my Uncle. </sentence><sentence id="5743">Not that I was ungrateful, but they treated me like a little girl and I was a grown up woman. </sentence><sentence id="5744">So I left. </sentence><sentence id="5745">And with their blessing. </sentence><sentence id="5746">And I lived in the Professor's home and I worked in the laboratory and that's where I met my future husband. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5784">Q: What did you want to study? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5786">A: Well I thought I wanted to study medicine because the laboratory was, and I was very much interested in bacteriology and I was working with mice and there were all kinds of experiments studying polio. </sentence><sentence id="5787">And the Professor had an idea that if you put mice to sleep, not dead but just with the ether and just prevent them from moving around and sort of living in a twilight zone, even though they are infected with polio, they do not develop the symptoms and they will not get paralyzed. </sentence><sentence id="5788">So this is what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="5789">Watching the mice, whether they get paralysis and whether they died, and if they died we had to take their brains out and preserve them and then examine them, so it was very, very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="5790">So I really thought I would study that and at the University I took biochemistry and a couple of other courses and more English and then, June 1, 1947, I got married. </sentence><sentence id="5791">And we moved to Michigan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5799">Q: What was you're husband's name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5801">A: My husband's name was Manual Levin. </sentence><sentence id="5802">There was no middle initial. </sentence><sentence id="5803">And he was originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan. </sentence><sentence id="5804">And that's where the University of Michigan was. </sentence><sentence id="5805">And he was a graduate of the University and the Medical School. </sentence><sentence id="5806">And there was a whole group of, he was an intern in the Medical School in Michigan when the war started and then he enlisted, well he wasn't an enlisted man, he was in the Navy. </sentence><sentence id="5807">I have a picture of him here. </sentence><sentence id="5808">He was a doctor in the Navy. </sentence><sentence id="5809">And he was in the service for five years. </sentence><sentence id="5810">And then when he was discharged, he decided to become a surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="5811">And he had surgical internship and so he wanted to continue his studies and actually, before he left, he was already assistant resident and then he got the three-year residency. </sentence><sentence id="5812">So I had three years in which I could study whatever I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="5813">And tried to get a degree. </sentence><sentence id="5814">So I graduated from University of Michigan in 1949 and I got a degree in Zoology, which was a pre-med. </sentence><sentence id="5815">But then I decided that it would have been probably very difficult at that time to get into medical school. </sentence><sentence id="5816">Women were not really, there were a lot of men that came back from the war and applied. </sentence><sentence id="5817">During the war, two of my husband's sisters were accepted to medical school. </sentence><sentence id="5818">One of them finished, the other one got a Master's in Biochemistry and married a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="5819">So I didn't think that, I only had one year, or a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="5820">So during that time I decided to go to graduate school and I got a Degree in Medical Technology. </sentence><sentence id="5821">So I, we moved to Detroit and for a year I worked at Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital as a Medical Technologist while my husband was trying to establish a surgical practice. </sentence><sentence id="5822">But things were not moving very well, and not only that, but the winter was very hard and we had one bad car accident, not our fault, we just skidded in the snow. </sentence><sentence id="5823">And then I commuted to the hospital by bus. </sentence><sentence id="5824">And if I missed the bus sometimes I had to wait for another three-quarters of an hour, in other words, we just didn't like the weather. </sentence><sentence id="5825">And my husband was always telling me about the fantastic, beautiful, warm California. </sentence><sentence id="5826">And so we decided to look around and we ended up moving to Fresno, California. </sentence><sentence id="5827">And that's where I still live, in Fresno, California. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5858">A: Actually I don't remember exactly the date but I didn't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="5859">And a friend of mine from Czechoslovakia who was not in the camp, I think she came to the United States before the war, no, maybe after the war, but I didn't have the details really, but she was not imprisoned during the camps, and she said that there has been a law passed that all the former inmates and survivors and so on can get restitution. </sentence><sentence id="5860">And it was suppose to be a lump sum depending on the condition, the health condition of the person, there would be a pension. </sentence><sentence id="5861">So I really didn't know much about it and I started to investigate and, as a matter of fact, we came to Paris on a visit, with my second husband, and we visited the Ga-loose-es (ph). </sentence><sentence id="5862">Now the old people, no actually, it was the lady that died, but Mr. Ga-loose (ph) was still alive and his son was a doctor and the daughter was married to a German lawyer who was specializing in the restitutions and he was German, he was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="5863">And he gave me a name of a lawyer that I should contact that would be helpful. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5864">And I contacted him, his name was Mr. Collinger (ph) and we were corresponding back and forth. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5865">And there is a stack of literature on the subject because, as Mr. Collinger (ph) explained, it wasn't his demands for all kinds of proofs and dates and so on, but it was the German government that was </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5866"> very thorough because anybody could claim and they only had so much money to distribute. </sentence><sentence id="5867">So I spent quite a bit of time writing letters and then getting an answer from him and asking for even more answers and it was many, many years of corresponding back and forth until finally I got a request that I be examined by a German doctor. </sentence><sentence id="5868">And that was already after my second husband died so it was after 1977, because I remember my son drove with me to San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="5869">We had an appointment. </sentence><sentence id="5870">And evidently that doctor, that's all he was doing is examining people, or I don't know, it was very, very strange. </sentence><sentence id="5871">The office was very old fashioned in some big office building in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="5872">And I felt very, very uneasy because he was quite rude and he also was not very gentle. </sentence><sentence id="5873">He again gave me a gynecological examination and he poked me all over and it was a very bad experience. </sentence><sentence id="5874">And I know that I felt very bad. </sentence><sentence id="5875">My son was there, I mean, waiting in the waiting room and he didn't know why I came out crying, but I just, I mean, the whole business of camp and everything else just came back to me so vividly that I thought, I'm just going to forget the whole thing and I'm not going to go through with it. </sentence><sentence id="5876">But I did. </sentence><sentence id="5877">Then, the next thing they demanded that I be examined by a psychiatrist, also a German man. </sentence><sentence id="5878">And so that was another trip to San Francisco. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5879">And that lasted most of the day, because first I was given a whole stack of questionnaires to fill out and I think these were the standard sort of questions. </sentence><sentence id="5880">Do I feel that I'm being followed? </sentence><sentence id="5881">Do I have nightmares? </sentence><sentence id="5882">Do I have delusions? </sentence><sentence id="5883">Anyway, these were things that, some of them were quite obvious what I'm suppose to answer if I want to get my restitution. </sentence><sentence id="5884">But anyway, I answered to the best of my ability. </sentence><sentence id="5885">I didn't have to do much lying because I didn't feel that I am being followed, but I certainly was always aware of what was going on around me. </sentence><sentence id="5886">And also I did have nightmares and I, sometimes I didn't feel very good. </sentence><sentence id="5887">There was one incident years and years later, as a matter of fact, it was about six years ago. </sentence><sentence id="5888">When we came back from Europe, we landed, usually we land in San Francisco, but that particular time we took the Pan Am, I think the last year Pan Am was in    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5889"> business, and we landed in New York. </sentence><sentence id="5890">And we had to go through customs. </sentence><sentence id="5891">And the airport in New York was Kennedy's. </sentence><sentence id="5892">But it was so crowded and we got off the plane and then we had to go through all these different corridors and at one point I got separated from Robert and I started to scream. </sentence><sentence id="5893">Because people were pushing from all sides and I just couldn't breath. </sentence><sentence id="5894">And I leaned against the wall and I started to scream. </sentence><sentence id="5895">And the guard or the stewardess or whoever it was came to me and she wanted to know what was wrong and I couldn't breath, I couldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="5896">I was just absolutely petrified. </sentence><sentence id="5897">I mean, that just felt like I was in a gas chamber with all the people pushing and pulling and, it was absolutely horrible. </sentence><sentence id="5898">And I think Robert finally somehow found me and we went, he pushed me around and we went into the larger space out of the corridor into the main area where we could stand in lines waiting for the customs to go through with us, and the passport control, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="5899">But I have incidents like that all through my life, really. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5900"> End of Tape 7. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5901"> Tape 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5902">Q: And, you were saying? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5903">A: So I really cannot stand certain situations. </sentence><sentence id="5904">And I don't like crowds. </sentence><sentence id="5905">I don't like loud noises. </sentence><sentence id="5906">I can't stand anybody screaming at me. </sentence><sentence id="5907">I cannot, I just lose my mind. </sentence><sentence id="5908">I just can't communicate and I have to really try to compose and get a hold of myself. </sentence><sentence id="5909">And I try to avoid situations like that. </sentence><sentence id="5910">And I cannot stand smell of burning gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="5911">When we drive in the car, Robert likes fresh air intake and I want it shut up because he cannot smell the gas and I just, I just don't want any fresh air in the car of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="5912">So some of the things kind of stay with me, but I try to smile, I try to show my happy face most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="5913">But there are times when I get these attacks of fear, of panic, and sometimes it is very difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="5914">But most of the time, I can cope. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5927">Q: Have you found that you think over the years a lot about you're experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5929">A: I can't say that I think a lot, but there may be things like certain incidences that will remind me of things and I, we are making those pilgrimages now to Poland and each time I go I hope that I will find something. </sentence><sentence id="5930">And I know I want, I went through the records here, I mean, that was one of the purposes of the trip, was not just to have the interview but to go through the records. </sentence><sentence id="5931">But I realize that the records I am looking for, they wouldn't be here. </sentence><sentence id="5932">I mean, there is no reason for them to be here because they are not complete and, as I said, the answers I am seeking, first it is probably too late. </sentence><sentence id="5933">You know, in the span of time. </sentence><sentence id="5934">I mean, people are in their 70's and sometimes they don't live that long. </sentence><sentence id="5935">Normally. </sentence><sentence id="5936">So I may be looking for people who just passed away, the normal way. </sentence><sentence id="5937">Like for example, when we were in Poland this last summer, Yesh-ir Mos-tof-ski (ph) was in perfect health we thought. </sentence><sentence id="5938">And he was. </sentence><sentence id="5939">And we had a nice visit. </sentence><sentence id="5940">My daughters, two of my daughters, met both brothers and we had tea and it was just very lovely. </sentence><sentence id="5941">And three days later I found out that Yesh- ir (ph) just died from a heart attack, and sat down to paint one of his painting and asked his    housekeeper to bring him a cup of tea and when she returned with the cup of tea he was stretched out on the floor, gone. </sentence><sentence id="5942">So I know I am searching and probably the thing that I think most often about is my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="5943">And I watched Schindler's List, the movie in the house, we seldom go to movies. </sentence><sentence id="5944">We usually rent laser discs and watch them at home, but we went to the movie and we watched it. </sentence><sentence id="5945">And I think the scene with that little girl, I just couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="5946">I really thought I would start screaming right in the middle of the movie. </sentence><sentence id="5947">And I was holding Robert's hand and trying to just say, it is a movie. </sentence><sentence id="5948">It seemed so real to me that she was about the age of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="5949">And I just thought that what I was seeing on that movie, what I was seeing in the film, really was happening. </sentence><sentence id="5950">And that maybe my sister is somewhere there. </sentence><sentence id="5951">And things like that happen to me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="5952">I don't know whether I mentioned to you that on one of the visits in Poland, Ches-wef (ph) told me that he had a present for me and he handed me an envelope and they were pictures of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="5953">And he said that my father asked to take some pictures and Ches-wef (ph) was an amateur photographer, he had a Lika. </sentence><sentence id="5954">And he took the pictures and he gave me the copies. </sentence><sentence id="5955">He couldn't find the film but you don't have to have film now to make copies, so. </sentence><sentence id="5956">These are probably my, I consider them my very precious possessions, and I am still hoping that maybe something happened and she did survive. </sentence><sentence id="5957">But I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="5958">I know it just wouldn't be possible. </sentence><sentence id="5959">But not knowing whether they were killed in the ghetto or whether they were put on the truck or whether they died on the way, or whether they were put in the gas chamber, or what happened. </sentence><sentence id="5960">Just not knowing is probably much worse than if I really was told. </sentence><sentence id="5961">That this and this and this happened. </sentence><sentence id="5962">And then you just sort of put it away. </sentence><sentence id="5963">This is the same thing like funerals and wakes or memorial services, that you just sort of say good-bye to the person, say good-bye to the event, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="5964">But in this way, you just don't know. </sentence><sentence id="5965">You don't want to consider the person dead because you don't know that they are dead. </sentence><sentence id="5966">And that's probably what keeps me awake very often and makes me sort of lead a double life. </sentence><sentence id="5967">And it's    probably the hardest thing. </sentence><sentence id="5968">Because most of the time, I look pretty. </sentence><sentence id="5969">As I told you that the first time when we talked on the phone, I am not a little old lady, 74 years old. </sentence><sentence id="5970">I take care of myself, I go to the hairdresser, I put make-up on. </sentence><sentence id="5971">And I get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and I go through my exercises and I get dressed and I read the newspaper, eat breakfast, and we get in the car and I go to work. </sentence><sentence id="5972">And all day long I work with young people. </sentence><sentence id="5973">I have a very responsible job in the area that I am working because I'm the one who has to see to it that all the costumes are ready for the performance at the specific time. </sentence><sentence id="5974">And they are. </sentence><sentence id="5975">And this is one of the things that I pride myself, that we haven't, were never late. </sentence><sentence id="5976">That all the costumes are in lockers, all in order, a week before the dress rehearsal. </sentence><sentence id="5977">And then we are already working on the next production. </sentence><sentence id="5978">So I feel that I am doing my job and I am always smiling, and very few people know what really is happening to me. </sentence><sentence id="5979">But I feel that even though I lead sort of a double life, most of it is only maybe 15% of my existence. </sentence><sentence id="5980">And that's why I don't like to be alone and most of the time Robert has to go on a trip, I go with him. </sentence><sentence id="5981">And very often when he has to go back to the office in the evening, I go with him, and I can always work in my office or in my area, in the shop, and wait for him. </sentence><sentence id="5982">But I don't like to be home alone because then, I mean, I don't particularly like to watch television, I like to read. </sentence><sentence id="5983">But it is when I am alone is when I really sort of go back. </sentence><sentence id="5984">And I don't think that one can ever, ever forget. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6043">Q: Do you still have nightmares? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6045">A: Well yes I do. </sentence><sentence id="6046">And Robert can tell you. </sentence><sentence id="6047">And I can't describe exactly what happens but sometimes I wake up and I don't know where I am and sometimes I don't wake up and then I wake up, Robert is shaking me, and I say, "What's the matter with you?" </sentence><sentence id="6048">And he says, "Oh nothing, just go to sleep". </sentence><sentence id="6049">But sometimes he wakes me up and I'm in another room and not in the bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="6050">And I really can't exactly describe what happens. </sentence><sentence id="6051">Probably the most recurring thing is that I'm somewhere in Poland and I am looking for my parents or I'm looking for my sister, or I am running away from something. </sentence><sentence id="6052">But I can't really describe it. </sentence><sentence id="6053">And I don't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="6054">I don't even want to talk about it to Robert. </sentence><sentence id="6055">And I did talk about it to Manny, that's my second husband. </sentence><sentence id="6056">But because I was in a much worse state when we got married, and I told him, I didn't want to get married because I didn't think that I was well enough. </sentence><sentence id="6057">But I knew that he wanted to have children and I didn't know that I should have any children. </sentence><sentence id="6058">And as I told you before, that I really did not, I wasn't a very good mother, and like my kids say, "Well, Margaret brought us up", and I don't think that they really feel deprived and they feel that I deprived them of something, letting Margaret bring them up, but it was better that Margaret was mothering them than, you know, in a good way, than me not doing it. </sentence><sentence id="6059">It was better for me to not do it at all than do it ina bad way. </sentence><sentence id="6060">But I did, I think that the worst part was when the children were little. </sentence><sentence id="6061">Then later on, when they were teen-agers, I did a lot of things with them and we went on trips and we went on a lot of camping trips. </sentence><sentence id="6062">Manny liked to go on camping trips and we had a house trailer and food and then also I participate in the kid's education and I drove them to music lessons, to whatever lessons they had to go to and they all did very well in school. </sentence><sentence id="6063">I mean, when it came to their studies and things, I was able to participate. </sentence><sentence id="6064">But I think that the emotional part, I just couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="6065">I somehow feel that I could have done much more, you know, watching my friends with their children, that I haven't done as much as they did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6094">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="6095">This is why, it is not difficult now because the first time when we went it was a sightseeing trip for Robert. </sentence><sentence id="6096">We went from one town to another and then the Krakow trip, part of the Krakow trip was to go to the different places and to see Ches-waf (ph) and that was the first time I saw Ches- waf (ph) after the war. </sentence><sentence id="6097">And it really was catharsis, I think. </sentence><sentence id="6098">It was rather good for me. </sentence><sentence id="6099">It was a very    short trip, but the following year, we went for a whole month, or even five weeks. </sentence><sentence id="6100">And we did a lot of things, going back to the places. </sentence><sentence id="6101">We went to the camp Poroskov (ph) where my brother was and we walked through the fields and looked at the monuments. </sentence><sentence id="6102">And I think it really was good for me to do it. </sentence><sentence id="6103">And now we are going to go again, the 4th of June, we already have the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="6104">And we will be there this time only three weeks because we want to be one week in London, Robert wants to go to the theatres, and we plan to see our friends, and we planned again, we may even go to Auschwitz again and walk the road from Auschwitz to Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="6105">I did walk it with my daughters a year ago. </sentence><sentence id="6106">And of course, it isn't the same, you walk on a sidewalk, on a paved road, and it is not very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="6107">But I would have preferred to go before they made the paved road, but anyway, we may walk again. </sentence><sentence id="6108">And I think it is, I don't think it is painful as much as it is just getting it out of my system and realizing that life goes on. </sentence><sentence id="6109">That I am alive. </sentence><sentence id="6110">That I walk the road. </sentence><sentence id="6111">There is another thing. </sentence><sentence id="6112">When I learned to drive, and before we came to California, we bought a little Nash Rambler for me. </sentence><sentence id="6113">And we towed it behind the big car so we had two cars. </sentence><sentence id="6114">And I drove the Nash Rambler for several years until finally I was in a car accident and it kind of curled up when I was through with it. </sentence><sentence id="6115">And so we went shopping for a car. </sentence><sentence id="6116">And it was several years ago because I remember Bobby was 4 years old then. </sentence><sentence id="6117">So we went to a Chrysler agency I believe because we were going to look at another Chrysler, and there I backed into a little car. </sentence><sentence id="6118">And I turned around, because I wanted a small car, and I said, "Oh, that's my size! </sentence><sentence id="6119">And it is robin egg blue!" </sentence><sentence id="6120">I loved that color. </sentence><sentence id="6121">And my husband said, "Stay away from it". </sentence><sentence id="6122">And I said, "Why?"

[ </sentence><sentence id="6149">Laughter] No really, this was a very, very, a lot of people ask me, "How on earth can you drive a German made car?" </sentence><sentence id="6150">And I said, "That's the whole point". </sentence><sentence id="6151">That's the whole point. </sentence><sentence id="6152">That I lived to drive a German car. </sentence><sentence id="6153">And not just, well, I didn't like Mercedes Benz because it was too expensive and in those days it was too big, but the Porsche was just my size. </sentence></p></dialogue>

want to be Medical Technologist after all. </sentence><sentence id="6302">And I, when the children were little, especially when, even through my first pregnancy, I took painting lessons. </sentence><sentence id="6303">And I was doing a lot of painting and I enjoyed that very much. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6304">Then I joined Community Theatre. </sentence><sentence id="6305">And they found out that I can paint and act, so I was acting in some plays. </sentence><sentence id="6306">And also they wanted me to help with the scenery. </sentence><sentence id="6307">And since, I really, I knew how to paint pictures but I didn't know that much about scenery, I went to college. </sentence><sentence id="6308">At that time it still was college, now it is a University. </sentence><sentence id="6309">And I enrolled in the Drama Department. </sentence><sentence id="6310">And then they said, well, why don't you just work on you're degree instead of just taking courses. </sentence><sentence id="6311">So I said, fine. </sentence><sentence id="6312">And I acted. </sentence><sentence id="6313">And I was an assistant to the scene designer. </sentence><sentence id="6314">I designed scenery for the Community Theatre and then I designed scenery for our University Theatre and I got a Masters Degree in Theatre. </sentence><sentence id="6315">And, at the same time, I wanted to polish up my skills in painting, so I went to the Art Department and I started getting, you know, just to get some classes in drawing and painting and sculpture. </sentence><sentence id="6316">And then they said, you've got enough credits now, you can really get you're Master's Degree. </sentence><sentence id="6317">So I started to take more graduate classes and I did get a Master's Degree in Art. </sentence><sentence id="6318">And that I got with distinction because I did some innovative process on my sculptures and the thesis was ceramic bowls. </sentence><sentence id="6319">And it was really stone ware. </sentence><sentence id="6320">And then I silver, copper and silver. </sentence><sentence id="6321">Over the stone ware. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6322">And the whole thing was, again, a wonderful catharsis though, because the symbol of the bowl. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6323">When we came to the camp we got a bowl. </sentence><sentence id="6324">One of those big, enamel bowls that were made in, probably in Schindler's factory. </sentence><sentence id="6325">And they are on display. </sentence><sentence id="6326">And here there is just a small case, but in Auschwitz there is a case the size of a small room filled with bowls. </sentence><sentence id="6327">And this was probably, once    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6328"> more, most precious possession. </sentence><sentence id="6329">Because if you didn't have a bowl, you could not get food. </sentence><sentence id="6330">That was the only way you could get you're cup of coffee or you're bowl of soup. </sentence><sentence id="6331">So the bowl was something that you put under you're pillow made out of blanket or a rag. </sentence><sentence id="6332">And you really guarded it with your life, because this was your life. </sentence><sentence id="6333">So I decided to make bowls that are completely useless. </sentence><sentence id="6334">I like pretty things so I made everything very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="6335">But you can't put anything in that bowl, they are either too small or too big or too crocked or too pretty. </sentence><sentence id="6336">You wouldn't put soup in a bowl that has beautiful design inside. </sentence><sentence id="6337">But then it is all goocked up with some kind of acid to make it shiny and polished and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="6338">I don't think the soup would taste very well mixed with the chemicals. </sentence><sentence id="6339">So I made a lot of bowls. </sentence><sentence id="6340">And they are not just bowls, they are containers. </sentence><sentence id="6341">Different types of containers. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6342">And I was making them just in the Art Department. </sentence><sentence id="6343">Some of them are thrown on a wheel, some of them are just built up. </sentence><sentence id="6344">And then when I got through with the stone ware and the enamel, I would move on to the chemistry department, which they gave me a lab there. </sentence><sentence id="6345">And that's where I would perform the forming. </sentence><sentence id="6346">It is quite a complicated process. </sentence><sentence id="6347">If you use copper sulfate and the silver cyanide, and sulfate acid and electricity. </sentence><sentence id="6348">And I had a lot of fun connecting wires and doing things... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6349">[End of Side A of Tape 8] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6350">Q: Go on. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6351">A: Anyway, he gave me a cyanide resuscitation kit. </sentence><sentence id="6352">Just in case I have an accident with the silver cyanide or the gold cyanide that I was working with. </sentence><sentence id="6353">And the cyanide has a bitter almond smell that you can really smell it if it gets spilled and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="6354">Anyway, the resuscitation kit is a, I don't know exactly what it was, I still have it. </sentence><sentence id="6355">This big syringe of something or other. </sentence><sentence id="6356">I don't think I, I told him I don't want to even think of using it, but anyway, and I was laughing and I said, "I know what cyanide is". </sentence><sentence id="6357">And I know it smells like bitter almonds. </sentence><sentence id="6358">That was probably one of the best cures for    me in a certain way because I was working with materials that were the deaths in some, and the hopelessness. </sentence><sentence id="6359">And here I was doing and making beautiful things for the future. </sentence><sentence id="6360">So it is sometimes very difficult, but on the other hand, it is easy if you really want it. </sentence><sentence id="6361">So this is what I was doing and when I finished I had an exhibit at the University. </sentence><sentence id="6362">And then I had an exhibit at the Art Center. </sentence><sentence id="6363">And then everybody was admiring the bowls and Manny wouldn't let me sell any. </sentence><sentence id="6364">And I says, "Well, just a few". </sentence><sentence id="6365">I had made some little ones and those were for sale, but everybody was very upset that I don't want to part with them. </sentence><sentence id="6366">So I said no. </sentence><sentence id="6367">And then my Professor suggested that I send them to several exhibits and every time I send them to exhibits they were accepted. </sentence><sentence id="6368">Most of the time I send slides and then I have to send the real thing and the one at the Oaken Museum, they specialize in crafts and and , they have one of my bowls. </sentence><sentence id="6369">They purchased it. </sentence><sentence id="6370">It was a purchase award. </sentence><sentence id="6371">And it is in the permanent collection. </sentence><sentence id="6372">And then the big thing was a traveling exhibit, which was in St. Paul, Minnesota and at the Renwick Gallery in Washington, and it was photographed for the album, for the souvenir album. </sentence><sentence id="6373">So it was all great honors. </sentence><sentence id="6374">And also I had one bowl exhibit at, and in the catalogue, actually it is more of a book, it's a California Design 11. </sentence><sentence id="6375">So these were the great honors I had. </sentence><sentence id="6376">And when I finally got my Master's Degree, I finally got a job at the University in the Art Department, teaching crafts and design and ceramics and elementary art education. </sentence><sentence id="6377">And I took the class for the elementary art education, which was training teachers who were in child development. </sentence><sentence id="6378">At that time the major in child development because very hard and so we had a lot of students and we taught them, among other things, the basic art procedures that they can use with children. </sentence><sentence id="6379">And I enjoyed that very much because I never did any art with my kids and here I was teaching future teachers and I did quite a few innovative things. </sentence><sentence id="6380">I think I was quite successful at it. </sentence><sentence id="6381">One thing that I would say is, after being this sterility case, I ended up having four children. </sentence><sentence id="6382">Three cribs in one room. </sentence><sentence id="6383">I had four children and none in school and they are supposed to    start at the age of five. </sentence><sentence id="6384">They were just about a year and a year and a half apart. </sentence><sentence id="6385">And that they all became very successful citizens, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="6386">Maxine, the one that lives in Silver Springs, that's her second time in the Washington, D.C. area. </sentence><sentence id="6387">She is a soil scientist and she, after all these years, she finally worked up to a little bit higher position than she started with. </sentence><sentence id="6388">And that's where she gave up the job in Davis, California, because she got another promotion and she decided to come to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="6389">And Maxine is not married. </sentence><sentence id="6390">But Eleanor is a physician, she is a cardiologist. </sentence><sentence id="6391">And she is the Chief of Cardiology at Kaiser Permanente in Santa Clara. </sentence><sentence id="6392">They live in Los Altos and she is married to a physician who is an endocrinologist but he works in research. </sentence><sentence id="6393">And then the next one is Robert, Bobby. </sentence><sentence id="6394">That's the only son. </sentence><sentence id="6395">And he is in New York in finances, whatever that is. </sentence><sentence id="6396">He's a broker and he's also an author of two books on politics. " </sentence><sentence id="6397">Democratic Blueprints" and one that was sort of a promotional book for Bill Clinton. " </sentence><sentence id="6398">Bill Clinton, the Politician", or whatever the title was. </sentence><sentence id="6399">And then the youngest daughter graduated from, well she went to Berkley and then she graduated from Humbolt University, which is in Northern California, in environmental science. </sentence><sentence id="6400">And she was a backcountry ranger for eleven years. </sentence><sentence id="6401">And she was patrolling the area in Kern River Canyon for six months and going to school for six months. </sentence><sentence id="6402">And she finally graduated and then she got her credentials and now she is a sixth grade teacher married to a music teacher. </sentence><sentence id="6403">And she herself is an accomplished musician. </sentence><sentence id="6404">She has played the bassoon and the violin. </sentence><sentence id="6405">And Eleanor, who is the doctor, is an accomplished harpsichord player. </sentence><sentence id="6406">I sort of mention that because, again, life goes on. </sentence><sentence id="6407">And I am looking forward to my grandchildren growing up. </sentence><sentence id="6408">Eleanor has three boys and , the youngest, has a boy and a girl. </sentence><sentence id="6409">And that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
