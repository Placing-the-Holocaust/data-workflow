id="2687">A: We can start with the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2688">I got some kind of an infection. </sentence><sentence id="2689">I think it started with probably some chigger bites or some bug bites that I got working outside. </sentence><sentence id="2690">And I always was quite sensitive and would scratch. </sentence><sentence id="2691">I know that I scratched my legs and then I guess because of the dirt and things that we lived in, I got some kind of an infection. </sentence><sentence id="2692">It might have been also fleabites or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2693">And it was getting worse and worse to the point where my legs were very, very swollen. </sentence><sentence id="2694">And I could not walk even. </sentence><sentence id="2695">Pus was oozing and these were big, round circles all over my shins. </sentence><sentence id="2696">And so they took me to the hospital and they really didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2697">I think they put some Vaseline or something over the wounds and covered it with some gauze and there I was lying and hoping that it will heal. </sentence><sentence id="2698">But at the same time, the German doctors were coming in and drawing blood from us. </sentence><sentence id="2699">And then injecting us with something and I have no idea whether these were suppose to be medications or whatever, but anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2700">Then they were also doing vaginal and rectal examinations with their fingers. </sentence><sentence id="2701">Which wasn't exactly what I considered pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="2702">And it was rather very humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="2703">I just didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2704">I was not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="2705">There were several women that were singled out and we were sort of in a group and it was extremely humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="2706">I was only 20 or so and I just didn't feel that this was exactly the treatment I wanted to have but I was probably worried more about my legs. </sentence><sentence id="2707">And then I think I mentioned it before, that the women, there was a couple of Jewish women doctors and they said that they knew that there was going to be another selection in the hospital so they dismissed me together with some other women because they were afraid that the state I was in, I would have been selected to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="2708">So I was put back into my regular barracks and I barely could walk.

the barracks, which were right on the premises. </sentence><sentence id="2710">So it wasn't like I had to go very far. </sentence><sentence id="2711">And eventually my legs healed but they were, I had

scratching and things that may aggravate the condition. </sentence><sentence id="2714">My legs eventually healed. </sentence><sentence id="2715">It took about another month or so, but anyway, I was all right. </sentence><sentence id="2716">So this was another thing that I wanted to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="2717">The other thing that I wanted to say was that about two months before, two or three months before we were arrested, it might have been around Christmas time or maybe a little bit later, I discovered that I was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="2718">And I went to a Polish doctor, a gynecologist who determined that I was about two months pregnant, maybe two-and-a-half, and he did an abortion right in his office. </sentence><sentence id="2719">And I was very sad that I had to do it but in the circumstances I couldn't possibly have a baby. </sentence><sentence id="2720">And if I did have one, I would have been pregnant when they arrested us and I probably wouldn't have survived anyway and the baby definitely wouldn't have been alive today. </sentence><sentence id="2721">But if you do think like that, if you just keep on thinking all you're life about the child that wasn't born. </sentence><sentence id="2722">So, this was another trauma that I had to live with. </sentence><sentence id="2723">Then I didn't give it much thought of course when I was in the camp, as I said before, that nature takes care of itself and I didn't menstruate since we were put in the prison in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="2724">And I didn't menstruate until I came to New York. </sentence><sentence id="2725">And I really think it was a blessing because I just cannot image thousands of women without any sanitary facilities having their periods. </sentence><sentence id="2726">Now the ones that were in the camp a long time, they and the cappos (ph), some that knew how to get around because their number was just maybe 400 or 300 or so, and they were the rich ones and they might have been normal already, but the rest of us just were sterile I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="2727">But what amazed me was that really, it was almost like a miracle that we didn't menstruate because it would have been a big, big mess. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3160">A: I really don't quite remember. </sentence><sentence id="3161">It could have been, probably around ten days. </sentence><sentence id="3162">And one thing that I remember very distinctly was that sometimes they were dressing the wounds on a table. </sentence><sentence id="3163">We were in bunks all the way around and there was a space in the center and they would put the patient there and several doctors would be standing around her and doing all kinds of things so that we couldn't really see, but one time I saw her legs. </sentence><sentence id="3164">I thought mine were in a bad shape, but her's were so bad that you could see the bone. </sentence><sentence id="3165">The flesh was just practically rotted away. </sentence><sentence id="3166">And one of the things that they would, they didn't do the maggot treatment to me, but it was very popular in Europe to use maggots to treat this kind of wounds. </sentence><sentence id="3167">And I know that her legs were just crawling with maggots. </sentence><sentence id="3168">And evidently maggots were putting some kind of an enzyme or whatever, that was killing the dead tissue. </sentence><sentence id="3169">Or maybe they were eating the dead tissue and that stimulated the granulation and growth of the new tissue. </sentence><sentence id="3170">And that was one of the cures. </sentence><sentence id="3171">So they did use maggots, but they didn't use penicillin. </sentence><sentence id="3172">They didn't use maggots on me, I somehow got better. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3190">A: Well, as I say, it seems to me that they put some kind of an ointment on my wounds and they were somewhat helpful, so that the oozing stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3191">It looked like Vaseline, but I can't believe that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3192">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3193"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 Vaseline alone could have cured, but anyway, at least the things were not full of mud and dirt, which I would have gotten in the regular barracks, or even going to work. </sentence><sentence id="3194">So there were bandages, they bandaged my legs and they were at least kept clean. </sentence><sentence id="3195">I was a pretty healthy and strong person at that time and I guess it was my resistance and just my natural ability to heal. </sentence><sentence id="3196">And to this day I heal very well. </sentence><sentence id="3197">I get a cut on my finger and two days later it is gone, so maybe it was just my ability to heal well. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3208">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3209">I left the hospital because of the on coming selection. </sentence><sentence id="3210">And the doctors that were there, the women doctors, they were Jewish women doctors. </sentence><sentence id="3211">They were afraid that the selection may not be very selective and they may just reduce the number of patients so they didn't want anybody who was well enough to walk out, was asked to walk out. </sentence><sentence id="3212">And as I say, after that, I went back to my barrack and I was able to stand the roll call and I was able to walk to that place where we were plaiting the braids. </sentence><sentence id="3213">And sitting all day, I could still keep my bandages on my legs and then I think a couple of times, as I recall, I went to the hospital and I had the bandages changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3300">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="3301">I just know that, well actually it was more in Auschwitz than in Belsen-Bergen. </sentence><sentence id="3302">In Belsen-Bergen, whatever news we got was when the new transport came. </sentence><sentence id="3303">But all the transports that were coming to Bergen-Belsen were mainly from Holland or from other countries, from smaller countries. </sentence><sentence id="3304">And they were very small transports. </sentence><sentence id="3305">And it seems like, as I mentioned before, that they all seemed to be of prisoners or some political people that were rather taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="3306">As I say, we weren't, we didn't seem to be doomed or anything. </sentence><sentence id="3307">Just like the Holland diamond cutters, they were being sort of guarded and preserved. </sentence><sentence id="3308">And so, if a new transport came, they might have told us what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3309">But we really didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3310">But while we were in Auschwitz, there were underground radios and then also there were a lot of workers who were going outside and coming back in the evening and they would bring some news that what was happening on the front and what was happening with the war. </sentence><sentence id="3311">And at one point we knew that the Russians were coming and that the siege of Warsaw, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="3312">That there was an uprising in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3313">And I just don't remember really. </sentence><sentence id="3314">We were much more concerned about surviving from day to day than worrying what was happening outside. </sentence><sentence id="3315">There were raids, air raids. </sentence><sentence id="3316">There were quite a few air raids and we were hoping that they will bomb but they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3317">The airplanes were

</sentence><sentence id="3321">And we could hear the anti-craft shooting, but I don't think they ever shot down any planes either, but they were just shooting at them. </sentence><sentence id="3322">And so, but we really had very, very little contact with the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="3323">And when we were in Bergen-Belsen, we didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="3324">But we haven't gotten to Bergen-Belsen yet. </sentence><sentence id="3325">We are still in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3326">A couple escaped, there were people escaping.

witness one. </sentence><sentence id="3329">And there were also suicides. </sentence><sentence id="3330">I mean, it was very easy to commit suicide if you could just get to the high voltage wires. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And some people did. </sentence><sentence id="3332">Another thing that happened that was quite a regular occurrence were the latrines. </sentence><sentence id="3333">I mean, we had to go when we were ordered to go and I don't know whether you saw the pictures, I didn't see any pictures in here of the latrines, but it was a cement kind of a block in the center of the barrack with holes. </sentence><sentence id="3334">A double row of holes. </sentence><sentence id="3335">And you were supposed to do your business there. </sentence><sentence id="3336">And that sure was not a very pleasant sight or a very pleasant time. </sentence><sentence id="3337">And this one thing that I was really suffering from was constipation and to this day I still have to be very

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3881">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3882">And actually that probably somewhat might have saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="3883">Because when the British came, I was just recovering from typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3884">I had edema but it was not as progressive as the ones that killed people in three days. </sentence><sentence id="3885">I remember crawling on my hands and knees because my legs were so swollen, it wasn't just my ankles but I think they were swollen all the way to my knees. </sentence><sentence id="3886">And my hands were swollen. </sentence><sentence id="3887">But somehow my eyes and my face weren't as bad. </sentence><sentence id="3888">And I remember I barely could walk. </sentence><sentence id="3889">And there were two or three steps into the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3890">I think the barracks were not on a foundation, but on stilts. </sentence><sentence id="3891">And I know that I crawled up and I just barely could walk. </sentence><sentence id="3892">Now we are coming very close to the liberation now. </sentence><sentence id="3893">Because I started, that that saved my life, that I did have typhus, because I had no appetite. </sentence><sentence id="3894">I know that I hadn't eaten anything for several days. </sentence><sentence id="3895">I know I was very thirsty and I just don't remember that there was water available. </sentence><sentence id="3896">I know people can't live without water, but I just don't remember having any water to drink. </sentence><sentence id="3897">And we knew that something was going on because we could hear shooting, and heavy shooting. </sentence><sentence id="3898">And it seemed to me like there were air raids all the time because the sirens

cigarettes and chocolates and anything else was just for the asking. </sentence><sentence id="4168">And they took a lot of photographs and I remember that they did weigh me and photograph me, just on the street. </sentence><sentence id="4169">It was nothing official. </sentence><sentence id="4170">And I was about 70 or 71 pounds, I was really skinny. </sentence><sentence id="4171">And still in the horrible clothing because they didn't have anything else to give us. </sentence><sentence id="4172">And I think we eventually got some better clothing and I don't know whether they brought them in from some warehouses or wherever, but I know that I did not wear the dress that I came in from Auschwitz, when my cousin took me. </sentence><sentence id="4173">So it seems to me that at one point I, see things went so fast and there is a one big blank of sorts, of the detailed day by day activities, but I know that one thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="4174">And it was shortly after the liberation when I was feeling better. </sentence><sentence id="4175">It might have been maybe two weeks later, maybe more, that I joined an excursion into the village. </sentence><sentence id="4176">And a lot of people were going into the adjoining villages and bringing food and clothing and it seems to me that that's where I got the dress that I was wearing later on.

people left in a great hurry. </sentence><sentence id="4179">And I remember going into one of the houses and there was silverware and a Lika camera and I always was very fond of Lika cameras, I had one and I had to leave it behind in Krakow when we were deported. </sentence><sentence id="4180">So I was just thrilled with the Lika camera. </sentence><sentence id="4181">I don't know what I was going to do with it, but somebody found a pillow case and we started to put the things, you know there were some table cloths and napkins and silverware and the Lika camera, and so we were putting those things in pillow cases. </sentence><sentence id="4182">And then somebody went down to the cellar or the basement and called us. </sentence><sentence id="4183">And there were about four women, there were four of us at that time, and so we went down. </sentence><sentence id="4184">And there were sausages and hams and a side of pork, I mean, there was food that we haven't seen for ages and it

and we loaded it all up with as much food as we could carry, and we went back to the camp and we shared it with other people. </sentence><sentence id="4189">At that time we could already eat normal food. </sentence><sentence id="4190">And we still were hungry all the time even though we could get as much food as we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="4191">It seems to me that the kitchens were going day and night. </sentence><sentence id="4192">And we did not have to stand in line. </sentence><sentence id="4193">They set up tables in sort of cafeteria style and we sat at the tables and ate. </sentence><sentence id="4194">And it was just such a change that it was extremely difficult for us to grasp it and to really know that it is all for real. </sentence><sentence id="4195">Every time I thought, well, you know, we were dreaming about being free and going out and doing things. </sentence><sentence id="4196">And I thought I was still dreaming. </sentence><sentence id="4197">And we were just living in a completely unreal world. </sentence><sentence id="4198">And then one day, I met a young soldier, British soldier. </sentence><sentence id="4199">And he was very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="4200">He spoke a little bit German and I didn't speak much English, but he was very friendly and we were not suppose to fraternize, or they weren't suppose to fraternize with the prisoners, so we were just holding hands and going for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="4201">And then he said that, he was a driver for one of the officers, for an older man. </sentence><sentence

that I would be just perfect for working in a records room, answering questions to people who are coming in looking for relatives and looking for other people. </sentence><sentence id="4206">So I thought this would be kind of neat. </sentence><sentence id="4207">And maybe that's when they gave me a different dress and I just don't quite remember. </sentence><sentence id="4208">But, oh, something else happened before that phase. </sentence><sentence id="4209">I went on another excursion into the village and we went very early in the morning, it was still very dark.
