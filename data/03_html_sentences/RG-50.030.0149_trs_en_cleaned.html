University of Buffalo. </sentence><sentence id="139">It took me about 4 years to do that job. </sentence><sentence id="140">I liked Buffalo very much. </sentence><sentence id="141">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="142">I was settled there. </sentence><sentence id="143">And then one day I got a telephone call from New York. </sentence><sentence id="144">19...Christmas 1938. </sentence><sentence id="145">And it was Cecilia Rasoski on the telephone, head of the...uh...not Joint at that point...it was the...uh...Jewish Refugee Service because already Hitler was in. </sentence><sentence id="146">Refugees were coming in in the 30s, but they weren't running like much later. </sentence><sentence id="147">They were people who had means. </sentence><sentence id="148">Most of them professionals who saw the handwriting on the wall in time and got out. </sentence><sentence id="149">And we were receiving them in Buffalo like in other communities in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="150">And...uh...I thought I was really there for good until the telephone call came from Cecilia Rasoski of the Refugee Service, which was working together with the JDC, and now we'll call it the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="151">And she said to me she had heard from somewhere, somehow that I knew Spanish, and there was a very serious problem in Havana, Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="152">Refugees were beginning to flee from Germany and from other countries in Europe, and...uh...the boats were coming in, but there were problems in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="153">The money at that point was being given by the JDC, but the JDC didn't have the official...uh...it was working together with the National Refugee Service. </sentence><sentence id="154">I didn't even know that I was a employ...employed by the Joint at that time. </sentence><sentence id="155">And so what Cecilia asked me to do was to, with my experiences as a social worker, with my Spanish language...there were multiple problems down in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="156">Would I just go out or go...nobody flew those days...sail to Havana and look over the picture and be helpful? </sentence><sentence id="157">Also with...because of my language abilities with the Cuban government, which at that point in time was very corrupt. </sentence><sentence id="158">It was the time of Batista. ( </sentence><sentence id="159">clearing throat) Some...uh...some people...there were two ways of coming into Havana. </sentence><sentence id="160">One was to get a false visa somewhere in Germany for $165, and the other was to find...to...uh...to...uh... really...uh...have a $500 legal bond which relatives in America would send...would send down to Havana. </sentence><sentence id="161">And...uh... would eventually ended in the S...in St. Louis...the famous affair of the St. Louis, was that...uh...Jews were coming in or the office I was heading was called the Joint Relief Committee. </sentence><sentence id="162">Already the Joint was coming in to it. </sentence><sentence id="163">Actually, the Joint financially always was there. </sentence><sentence id="164">And...uh...they...uh...those who had legal $500 bond were allowed to land and some of them were taken into jails. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="166">And we heard that ships were on the way, and there was at...at one point my whole diagnosis of the situation was that this is no job for just a person like myself to deal with the government, and that's when I called the JDC on the phone direct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Where were you at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: In Havana. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: You joined the Havana office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Havana. </sentence><sentence id="212">Still in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="213">Expecting boats to come in, ships to come in with refugees and  knowing that we wouldn't be allowed eventually to land them all because of this corruption inside of Cuba with Batista. </sentence><sentence id="214">And...uh...I phoned and told...uh...uh...whole story. </sentence><sentence id="215">And then we heard that the next ship that was to come in was the S.S. St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="216">See, the JDC had offices in Paris, and we were in communications like this: New York, Paris, Havana. </sentence><sentence id="217">And so I insisted that this is nothing which I felt I should handle alone. </sentence><sentence id="218">It was more political than social. </sentence><sentence id="219">My Spanish language didn't do any good. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh...And they did. </sentence><sentence id="221">The JDC went down. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="222">And I can't remember the name of the lawyer at this point, but a very competent, legal lawyer...uh...man and was sent down by the JDC who...uh...had his ends with Batista. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I don't think I have to repeat...there're books and stories. </sentence><sentence id="224">and everyone knows what the S.S. St. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225">Louis meant. ( </sentence><sentence id="226">Clearing throat) Our great problem was there were hundreds...I don't remember the statistics, but there were at least 5 to 6 hundred people on that ship. </sentence><sentence id="227">Only a few could disembark who had real $500 bonds, and that ship was stationed there and not allowed to come into the harbor by the...by the Cubans, and it was going to go back to Germany. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="228">Well, the last thing we wanted was for that boat...that boat to go back to Germany because that would have been the end. </sentence><sentence id="229">So for about a week...this is 39...uh...we in Havana, JDC New York, JDC Paris...and it wasn't like today where you could fax and you could phone and you could do things...there weren't all those tech...tech...technological facilities, but we could telephone. </sentence><sentence id="230">I don't think we ever went to sleep. ( </sentence><sentence id="231">laughing) Anyway, books have been written, stories been told. </sentence><sentence id="232">The S.S. did not go back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="233">It was...disembarked in Holland, Paris, London. ( </sentence><sentence id="234">Pause) And from then on there was no more illegal immigration into Havana. </sentence><sentence id="235">It was all legal or...or not, but... And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in retrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our best to save these people from going back to Germany, many of them were caught when the Germans invaded Belgium, Holland, and France. </sentence><sentence id="236">But a lot of them were saved. </sentence><sentence id="237">Anyway, I then decided that I was going to stay on and do a...a nice job, a quiet job in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="238">And one of the things that I learned... call this my in-service training period. </sentence><sentence id="239">I knew nothing about American immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the German language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages and the...uh...the American Consulate in Havana trusted us completely, we really became the right hand of the...of the...uh...American Consulate. </sentence><sentence id="240">Helping with interviews, with languages, with evaluations. </sentence><sentence id="241">They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing. </sentence><sentence id="242">We could do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of great help to them. </sentence><sentence id="243">There were understaffed. </sentence><sentence id="244">And so I stayed on in Havana....39, 40, 41. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="245">And...uh...I...for some... liked...I liked Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="246">I liked the climate. </sentence><sentence id="247">I liked the people. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I wasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job. </sentence><sentence id="249">We were helping to get people to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="250">But one day, one morning the phone rang. </sentence><sentence id="251">And the boss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt. </sentence><sentence id="252">And he said, "Laura, how are you doing?" ( </sentence><sentence id="253">laughing) "How are you doing" was not an expression in those years, but he said, "How are you?" </sentence><sentence id="254">I said, "Fine." " </sentence><sentence id="255">Busy?" " </sentence><sentence id="256">Yal, we're very busy here." </sentence><sentence id="257">Well...so...uh...he said, "How would you like to go to China?" ( </sentence><sentence id="258">Laughing) I have to laugh when I think of it. </sentence><sentence id="259">I said, "China? </sentence><sentence id="260">Where in China?" " </sentence><sentence id="261">Shanghai." </sentence><sentence id="262">I said, "Oh, Yal. </sentence><sentence id="263">Sure. </sentence><sentence id="264">I'd like to go." ( </sentence><sentence id="265">Laughing) I had no idea what he was talking about. </sentence><sentence id="266">I said, "What's the problem?" </sentence><sentence id="267">He said, "Well, we've been...first of all we've had a request from the State Department that you should go to China. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="268">You should go to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because refugees are pouring in from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="270">It's a open port. </sentence><sentence id="271"> No visas are necessary. </sentence><sentence id="272">The Chinese don't care who comes in. </sentence><sentence id="273">We've been sending money to a Jewish committee of local leaders there and..uh...the Embassy is swamped. </sentence><sentence id="274">The Consulate is swamped. </sentence><sentence id="275">The Embassy was in Peking at that time. </sentence><sentence id="276">The Embassy needs help. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="277">The...uh...the State Department doesn't have anyone who knows the German, and so...uh...and they've seen the kind of work you've been doing in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="278">Will you go?" </sentence><sentence id="279">I said, "Alright, I'll go." ( </sentence><sentence id="280">Laughing) That's about as much of decision making as I've ever make. </sentence><sentence id="281">Anyway, I flew up to get really some basic orientation of what was going on there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="282">Nothing was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="283">The Embassy...the Consulate was swamped. </sentence><sentence id="284">There was refugees there who had visas, valid visas that the U.S. was ready for accept for their coming to the United States, but there was no personnel. </sentence><sentence id="285">So...uh...and then, of course, by the time I got there, in 41...much later in 41, May 41...uh...there were almost...there were thousands and thousands of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="286">The situation as very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="287">But I wasn't supposed to do much about that. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was supposed to help the Consulate. </sentence><sentence id="289">Just in retrospect which is (clearing throat) different from the way we travel now...uh...it took...1 went over on the first Pan American clipper that ever trans...that ever sailed in the Pacific. </sentence><sentence id="290">It took 5 days and 4 nights. </sentence><sentence id="291">But it was very much more civilized than the way we travel now. </sentence><sentence id="292">Anyway, my...my...I had to get to Hong Kong first. </sentence><sentence id="293">I couldn't get to China on...on a Pan American, and I had to wait for a whole week in Hong Kong before I could get a ship up the coast to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="294">And when I got there my first...first place I went to as the embassy...the Consulate. </sentence><sentence id="295">They gave me an office, and I began interviewing, helping them. </sentence><sentence id="296">But at the same time I had to get to know the Jewish community structure there of local residents. </sentence><sentence id="297">The chairman was an ex-Dutchman called Spillman, very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="298">And they were they ones who were receiving the JDC money to feed these 8,000 people who needed feeding. </sentence><sentence id="299">So...uh...all this was done with JDC money. </sentence><sentence id="300">I got to...I got to...uh...but the refugees were already...had already heard that someone from the Joint was there. </sentence><sentence id="301">I wasn't supposed to get mixed up...and they were coming to my hotel. </sentence><sentence id="302">At the same time I was sending in all my reports of the situation I found among the refugees and how it was being handled. </sentence><sentence id="303">All of it went through the pouch, and L...very soon...it took me a month. </sentence><sentence id="304">In June...I got there in May...in June I issued a definite ultimatum to the JDC in which I wrote that if I were to stay on they would have to...this is not a one- man job. </sentence><sentence id="305">They would have to send out someone else to work with me. </sentence><sentence id="306">And I knew...I knew that Manny Segal, who also was a social worker whom I knew from Buffalo who was working with me in Havana, always said he'd like to come out. </sentence><sentence id="307">So I said, "Either you send Manny or someone else, but this is not a problem I can handle alone. </sentence><sentence id="308">Or else I'll come home." </sentence><sentence id="309">In June 1941, that ultimatum had been issued. </sentence><sentence id="310">I had no reply yet, but in June 1941, I think it was...the...the exact date isn't important. </sentence><sentence id="311">I think it was the 21st of June, the Germans had walked into the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="312">We, of course, knew this by radio, but it was very distant. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="313">So I got a cable from the JDC a few days after that saying, "In case communications are cut, you are authorized to borrow on the promise of us to repay the amount of money which is required to take care of the needy" (because we had 8,000 eating out of our kitchen; we had a hospital to support, and there was a school). </sentence><sentence id="314">Now these sums seem like nothing today, but in those years it was a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="315">And...uh...so I had this cable. </sentence><sentence id="316">That was June, July, August 1941. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I was just beginning to get to know the whole refugee problem. </sentence><sentence id="318">I continued to work with the...with the embassy...with the Consulate, but my focus was really upon helping these people. </sentence><sentence id="319">And...uh...August 1941, I got another cable. </sentence><sentence id="320">SHIP OUT TO MANILA. </sentence><sentence id="321"> DON'T...DON'T COME HOME. </sentence><sentence id="322">SHIP OUT TO MANILA AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS. </sentence><sentence id="323">Well, to get out at that point...the American marines were all leaving. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="324">There was a feeling of war, but nobody was thinking of Pearl Harbor, of course, as you will hear later. </sentence><sentence id="325">The Japanese had been fighting the Chinese for years before that, but they had never come into the international settlement. </sentence><sentence id="326">So to get a ship...the only ships coming out were ships with Army soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="327">Through the American Embassy, I managed to get on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="328">And I got to Manila. </sentence><sentence id="329">And I had the cable, DON'T COME HOME. </sentence><sentence id="330">So...uh...what does one do? </sentence><sentence id="331">There were...there was a nice Jewish community there. </sentence><sentence id="332">I used to take trips around the island, but I never could stay away very long because I was waiting for instructions. </sentence><sentence id="333">And finally, this is already August. </sentence><sentence id="334">Right? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="335"> Q; August 41. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Huh? </sentence><sentence id="337">41. </sentence><sentence id="338">Uh Huh. </sentence><sentence id="339">September. </sentence><sentence id="340">Telephone call. ( </sentence><sentence id="341">clearing throat) September 1941.September. </sentence><sentence id="342">Telephone call from Mo Levitt from New York.

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="535"> A; Yes. </sentence><sentence id="536">Anyway, it was clear we were beginning to raise money and...uh...all of 1942, and we took over the program in Hong Q and...uh...we were giving IOU's to the people. </sentence><sentence id="537">And we also set up an entirely new committee. </sentence><sentence id="538">The committee which where...which I found when I originally came to Shanghai, most of them had already been interned by the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="539">They weren't around anymore. </sentence><sentence id="540">And...uh...uh...so that I...we began to take on some of the old timers...uh...Polish, non---non-enemy nationals, Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a long time and whom we could trust. </sentence><sentence id="541">And gradually while on the one hand we were working in Hong Q and trying to set up the programs for the helping and the hospital and the money ad all that and raising the money, we were also beginning to train another committee, voluntary committee, to take over because it began to be clear that we were not going to be able to stay out forever because we were enemy aliens. </sentence><sentence id="542">And we got a very good committee. </sentence><sentence id="543">Very, very good committee. </sentence><sentence id="544">Many of them had been...uh...there for many years. </sentence><sentence id="545">Russians who had fled the revolution and who had made their home in Shanghai and who were very fine community leaders and whom we could trust. </sentence><sentence id="546">And the...the one committee that we set up, Mr. Bitker...we called it the Bitker Committee, Mr. Bitker was the Chairman, and we felt very secure in giving him power of attorney after...if anything should happen to us to ensure that part. </sentence><sentence id="547">Then, of course, in the middle of all this, we did a very...uh...unusual thing. </sentence><sentence id="548">Uh...the old kitchens that were feeding the refugees when we arrived...when we took over, were very old Chinese kitchens. </sentence><sentence id="549">And they had to be stoked all the time with coal and more money was going...we made an analysis that more money was going into coal than into nutrition. </sentence><sentence id="550">So what can we do? </sentence><sentence id="551">Then we heard that one day that out in the French concession of Shanghai, there were some new boilers that had just arrived the day before Pearl Harbor and were standing there...uh...assigned to the Sassoon Company, but were never used. </sentence><sentence id="552">So I went up to the Sassoon Company, which was still in business at that point, and I asked them for permission and they said, "We'd be glad to give them to you but they...we as British...as a British company, can't give you that permission. </sentence><sentence id="553">We're as much enemy aliens as you are." </sentence><sentence id="554">So what did we do? </sentence><sentence id="555">We had a very good friend, a Polish engineer who looked at those...uh...boilers and said, "Laura, you've got to get them." </sentence><sentence id="556">So one night when it was dark and...uh...there were millions of people buzzing around on the streets all the time and the...and the rickshaws were going back and forth and nobody was paying any attention to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="557">We hired a group of coolies and this engineer, Manny and I went out to the French concession and we highjacked the two big (laughing) boilers, and brought them through the masses of people going into the...buzzing around in the streets of Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="558">Nobody was paying any attention to us. </sentence><sentence id="559">Taking them over the bridge, and we got them to Hong Q. And from that point on, we built a new kitchen which was really giving nutrition and we burned up the old kitchens. </sentence><sentence id="560">That's one of our fun stories. </sentence><sentence id="561">Anyway, it got to be around the end of...uh...October, November 42, the rumors came and one day we were notified by radio...there were no television in those years...that the Japanese authorities are asking all enemy aliens to prepare themselves for internment. </sentence><sentence id="562">You would be allowed to take in anything you like to your camp. </sentence><sentence id="563">They didn't tell us which camp at that point. </sentence><sentence id="564">Your beds,  1 your...uh...linens, anything that you want to take in. </sentence><sentence id="565">Food...this is...they were beginning to prepare us. </sentence><sentence id="566">And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he was going to an all-men's camp over in Paoting. </sentence><sentence id="567">I had not received a notice yet. </sentence><sentence id="568">So we packed him off, and a month later I got notice. </sentence><sentence id="569">And...uh...I actually took my own folding bed and my own mattress and...and...uh....a trunk full of canned goods and stuff and things and...and then...the...the Japanese were a peculiar race. </sentence><sentence id="570">It's a...an interesting group of people. </sentence><sentence id="571">Uh... They were very, very permission with us, and I was taken to another camp of couples, and single men and single women outside of Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="572">Right now the name of the camp escapes me, but it isn't important. </sentence><sentence id="573">It was the beginning of 43, I think February or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="574">We got to the camp which, of course, was surrounded by barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="575">It was a old school house that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking here and there and everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="576">And...uh...I got into a room with 40 women, and...uh...first thing I did, when I saw the room was to see at the very end there were windows going...getting out to the campus. </sentence><sentence id="577">It was an old school. </sentence><sentence id="578">It had a beautiful campus, and I quickly took my bed and dumped it in that area so that I would...all the 40 women would be in back of me and I would see the campus. </sentence><sentence id="579">That was the first thing I thought of. </sentence><sentence id="580">Anyway, it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="581">That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an oven...stoves, and all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="582">We never burned them again. </sentence><sentence id="583">We just put on more clothes. </sentence><sentence id="584">Now, the Japanese were very good to us I think. </sentence><sentence id="585">Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old Shanghailanders that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and under the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="586">But that's something I've never had. </sentence><sentence id="587">I've never had any kind of feeling about race, color, anything. </sentence><sentence id="588">I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva convention. </sentence><sentence id="589">They gave us everything that was due to us. </sentence><sentence id="590">They brought in the food. </sentence><sentence id="591">We had to cook it ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="592">And they said to us, "Listen, get organized. </sentence><sentence id="593">Put up your committees. </sentence><sentence id="594">Do what you like. </sentence><sentence id="595">We'll bring in the food. </sentence><sentence id="596">And organize your own social activities. </sentence><sentence id="597">Do anything you like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising." </sentence><sentence id="598">And so the first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the camp was that I was there. </sentence><sentence id="599">And someone came to me and said, "We want you to chair our committee because you've had experience." </sentence><sentence id="600">I said, "I am Laura Margolis with no experience. </sentence><sentence id="601">I am a number. </sentence><sentence id="602">I have a number. </sentence><sentence id="603">I don't want to be...I don't want to be known. </sentence><sentence id="604">I don't want to have anything to do with all this. </sentence><sentence id="605">But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs. </sentence><sentence id="606">So I made 9 verv quick as we sav. </sentence><sentence id="607">1. </sentence><sentence id="608">uh_ realized that when vou're near the food. </sentence><sentence id="609">it's important so 7  2 American doctor. </sentence><sentence id="610">And he gave me a permit to get out to the hospital because he said I was very sick, which I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="611">And I got out to the...uh...hospital. </sentence><sentence id="612">It was a English hospital and Dr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the hospital and he remembered me from...from contacts we had before Pearl Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="613">And they put me in a ward, and when he came to make his rounds in the evening and he saw me there, he caught on immediately because no matter what he did, I was in good shape. </sentence><sentence id="614">But he said I was very sick and so he said, "Now, there are two things. </sentence><sentence id="615">You shouldn't be in a ward. </sentence><sentence id="616">I can get you a private room, but if you want a private room you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to Japan for permission. </sentence><sentence id="617">But I can give you a room with another lady on my own responsibility." </sentence><sentence id="618">I said, "I'd rather take the lady...the room with the lady." </sentence><sentence id="619">And what happened there was that she was really a lovely, lovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the German bank in Shanghai and he used to come to visit her every day. </sentence><sentence id="620">And I had no right for visitors. </sentence><sentence id="621">And one day he said to me...he said, "You know," he said, "You are not allowed visitors. </sentence><sentence id="622">Wouldn't you like to tell your friends outside that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?" </sentence><sentence id="623">And that's the way I saw Mr. Bitker. </sentence><sentence id="624">I saw my friends. </sentence><sentence id="625">I got...I got the message out. </sentence><sentence id="626">And...uh...I was there for 3 months. </sentence><sentence id="627">They kept me out in the hospital and then came August...July, August 43. </sentence><sentence id="628">Right? </sentence><sentence id="629">And...uh...Italy surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis and the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said, "Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before coming here I went to the Swiss Consulate because the Swiss had the authority over all enemy aliens." </sentence><sentence id="630">And he said, "You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange. </sentence><sentence id="631">So I'm going to release you now. </sentence><sentence id="632">You go back, start packing and in September you will...uh...be re...on that...on that exchange. </sentence><sentence id="633">Your name is on it." </sentence><sentence id="634">He said I also found out that your name was on the first exchange which was a diplomatic
