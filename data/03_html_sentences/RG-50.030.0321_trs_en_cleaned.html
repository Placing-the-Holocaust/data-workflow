<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I'd like you to start by telling me your name, your date of birth, and your city of birth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Father Henry Van Den Boogard and I was born in Holland in in 1915, so I will be 80 in August. </sentence><sentence id="6">Maybe I don't look that old, but they gave me some makeup to look a little bit younger. </sentence><sentence id="7">I don't know if it works. </sentence><sentence id="8">What else do you want to know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your background? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: My family went from , a big city in the south of Holland to a neighboring town, that was smaller, and my father had a printing business there, and he started a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="16">That is where I grew up there. </sentence><sentence id="17">I went there to grammar school. </sentence><sentence id="18">When it was over my father put me in the school in the neighbor city and he thought that is a better school for a high school, but I didn't like it there. </sentence><sentence id="19">They had brothers there, religious people teaching, and I couldn't get along with the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="20">Everything that went wrong, I was always blamed for it, so I want to get rid of that school. </sentence><sentence id="21">I didn't know how I could get rid of that school. </sentence><sentence id="22">One day it was Ash Wednesday, and we catholics go to church get a little bit of these ashes on your forehead. </sentence><sentence id="23">I thought this was a nice opportunity for me to miss the bus. </sentence><sentence id="24">So, I had to go by a later bus. </sentence><sentence id="25">In the meantime I was waiting I thought that cross that they put on my forehead was too little, so with some ashes I made it larger and each time a little larger and later it covered my whole forehead. </sentence><sentence id="26">I forgot about it and then I went by bus to school and it was a very cold day. </sentence><sentence id="27">It was in 1929. </sentence><sentence id="28">When I came in the class, all the boys started to langh because of that cross. </sentence><sentence id="29">I had forgotten it and I told the teacher I went to church this morning to get the ashes, and he sent me out. </sentence><sentence id="30">He said get of here. </sentence><sentence id="31">I had to stay in the hallway. </sentence><sentence id="32">And there I got my vocation I always tell because then I decided I don't want to go to this school anymore, but how can I convince my father. </sentence><sentence id="33">I thought I'm going to tell him I want to go to the seminary. </sentence><sentence id="34">He listened, so we went. </sentence><sentence id="35">I didn't think that I would be accepted because everybody told me you will be back home after a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="36">So, when I came there, I thought I will fool them a little bit and I thought all the boys will become priests but I was the only one of the class who became a priest. </sentence><sentence id="37">What else do I have to tell? </sentence><sentence id="38">I was then 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="39">I went to the seminary. </sentence><sentence id="40">I was accepted there, but I didn't expect and I prayed a lot that I wouldn't be sent home because of my conduct. </sentence><sentence id="41">My prayers were answered I think. </sentence><sentence id="42">That's what I tell in my sermons, that the prayers are answered. </sentence><sentence id="43">I asked in my prayers that I wouldn't be sent home, so they kept me there and I became a priest after 12, 13 years. </sentence><sentence id="44">I was ordained in 1942, and that was in the middle of the war. </sentence><sentence id="45">Before the war -- during the war already, in 1940, in 1942 more or less, there was a Jewish family in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="46">They were good friends of my uncle, and this gentleman asked me if I could help him. </sentence><sentence id="47">He approached me when I was still a seminarian. </sentence><sentence id="48">He said can you do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="49">I see that it is difficult for us Jews in the country with the Nazis and I would like to go hiding. </sentence><sentence id="50">He was married, and I said I will look into if 1 can find a place. </sentence><sentence id="51">Then in the meantime, my uncle found already a place with his brother, Louis Haza, and he had a sister, Anna Haza, and they both were single and they took him in. </sentence><sentence id="52">There was a husband and wife and a little daughter. </sentence><sentence id="53">The wife was pregnant and in the  time they were hiding there, the little boy was born, and it was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="54">But what happened to them later, their name was , and I never found out if they survived the war or not. </sentence><sentence id="55">When I was ordained in 1942, it was the last Sunday of July then the first Sunday of August was August 2. </sentence><sentence id="56">I said my first mass in Holland and there was a big celebration in town. </sentence><sentence id="57">It was a town of about in those days about 10,000, now there's 20,000 people, but there was a big celebration, and a parade and everything. </sentence><sentence id="58">In the afternoon there was a reception, and the mayor came also to the reception and his name was John , and he was very anti-Nazi, anti-German, and he was very sleepy when he came to the reception. </sentence><sentence id="59">He said you have to excuse me because the whole night I had to visit Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="60">I didn't know there were so many Jews in our home town, but he had to tell them that they had to go into hiding because that same night they would be arrested. </sentence><sentence id="61">And there was a policeman and he was in favor of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="62">He fought always with the mayor because they had different opinions and the mayor was very anti-Nazi so at the end of the war he had to go into hiding himself. </sentence><sentence id="63">That is why I knew there were quite a few Jews in my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="64">Then I didn't do anything until I had a brother-in-law, his father was born in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="65">He just got married, then, in those days, and his father was born in Germany, so the Nazis made all the decedents who were born in Germany, they made them German so they could serve in the military service. </sentence><sentence id="66">But my brother-in-law didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="67">He was the husband of my sister who lives here with me now and my brother-in-law, his name was Robert . </sentence><sentence id="68">He died already about 20 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="69">He asked me if I could help him. </sentence><sentence id="70">So, I had to find out where he could go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="71">I found out then who the leader of the Resistance was in that area. </sentence><sentence id="72">There was , in Rosenthau and he said oh he can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="73">And , would like to mention him because he did a lot for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="74">He's not living anymore but in those days everything was so secret he didn't tell me that he had a Jewish family in his house too hiding. </sentence><sentence id="75">He was working with a priest who was a trappist before. </sentence><sentence id="76">He was still a trappist but they were kicked out of the monastery by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="77">Then he had to find a place so he became a chaplain in a very large nun's convent in Rosenthau. </sentence><sentence id="78">But he was only a name chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="79">What he did was working for people who wanted to go into hiding especially Jews. </sentence><sentence id="80">He did a lot. </sentence><sentence id="81">He was smuggling weapons and things like that and finding hiding places to keep those Jews alive. </sentence><sentence id="82">But he was not very prudent and we thought some day he will be arrested and it happened. </sentence><sentence id="83">He was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="84">His name was . </sentence><sentence id="85">I didn't name his full name, I knew only as Fonse, his nickname, but not his last name. </sentence><sentence id="86">I found it out later. </sentence><sentence id="87">He went to a concentration camp in 5 close to my hometown, but he was last seen in the , in the police office when he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="88">But we never heard of him later. </sentence><sentence id="89">We didn't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="90">Now, when the war was over, the leader of this Resistance in , he became the leader of this concentration camp where no Jews were anymore but were just the Nazi prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="91">I was then assistant in the North, but I went to see him in the South and I visited him, I said, did you ever find out what happened to Fonse, I said don't know, and he said I don't know either, but I know of a famous architect and he knows of somebody in the who works there and he was hiding with priests somewhere in the west of . </sentence><sentence id="92">So, I got the address of the architect and this architect was making a model for a monument in Holland on the for the freedom we got after we were freed by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="93">He said this gentleman he works in an office in the  . </sentence><sentence id="94">It was closed. </sentence><sentence id="95">So, I went there by car, that was given to me by the leader of the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="96">He's a soldier, so when I saw him, it was lunch time, there was nobody anymore in the office, only one gentleman and he knew me. </sentence><sentence id="97">I said how do you know me. </sentence><sentence id="98">He said do you not know me anymore? </sentence><sentence id="99">You helped me go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="100">I said when was that? </sentence><sentence id="101">I said I have no hair I was a prisoner in and they cut my hair I was bald headed and he had a prison suit on and I was going to be executed in the neighborhood of Rosenthau and they brought me there with other prisoners who were going to be executed too but then we were attacked by the English planes and we all left the cars and could go into hiding in the corn field. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was not corn, it was wheat. </sentence><sentence id="103">We could crawl through the weeds the fields to the neighbor town where I was living. </sentence><sentence id="104">It was during the hours that there was a curfew at night, so in the morning I had to go Rosenthau to bring some pictures of Jews who had to have false identification cards and there was a teacher in town who took those pictures. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was an amature. </sentence><sentence id="106">He took those pictures, developed them at night, and early in the morning as soon as the hours were over of the curfew, then I was going to pick them up and bring them to Rosenthau to have my brother-in-law who was hiding he had to make those i.d. </sentence><sentence id="107">cards. </sentence><sentence id="108">So, when I went through the town I saw in a hallway of a house I saw somebody standing in the suit of the prisoner's bald headed and he called me. </sentence><sentence id="109">He said can you find me a place where I can stay. </sentence><sentence id="110">I brought him then to a place where the brother of Doctor DeBeer, he was a physician, and his brother was a priest, he was in hiding too. </sentence><sentence id="111">I brought him there. </sentence><sentence id="112">So, as soon as I told me who he was, I thought this is not the one who was hiding with Fonse so I was just as far as I was in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="113">I did find out. </sentence><sentence id="114">Later on I came to Paris and I wanted to know so badly where Fonse was if he was still living or not so Thad on radio his name if somebody knew about him, his whereabouts to let me know. </sentence><sentence id="115">So, I got a letter from the abbot of the monastery, he said as soon as you know let us know. </sentence><sentence id="116">We want to know what happened to him, too. </sentence><sentence id="117">I got a letter from his relative in Hague, they wanted to know also where Fonse was, if he was still living. </sentence><sentence id="118">But then I got a letter from a doctor in , where the concentration camp was. </sentence><sentence id="119">He said I saw when he was dead, I had to make a certificate that he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="120">He was killed on that day. </sentence><sentence id="121">It was two weeks after he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="122">Now there is some monument for Fonse in that nun convent and he's on the list of the ones who were killed in . </sentence><sentence id="123">But, now we don't know much about him, but I wanted to emphasize more what , the leader of the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="124">And Fonse , this priest what they did for the Jews because it was never recognized. </sentence><sentence id="125">Nobody knew and nobody knew the names. </sentence><sentence id="126">They never gave the names, but I know, because I worked with them that they were hiding Jews making false papers for them, i.d. </sentence><sentence id="127">cards and trying to keep them alive by finding food so I would like to emphases that now that I have the opportunity to make it known what they did during the war. </sentence><sentence id="128">So, that is what I usually did. </sentence><sentence id="129">I didn't do much myself, only I did on my bike brought id. cards to people who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="130">Once I was asked by to bring a few guns in a shoe box on the back of my bike to the town where I was living for the underground. </sentence><sentence id="131">I did it and I put two Dutch catechisms on top of them so if I had to open maybe I thought it could save me. </sentence><sentence id="132">When I drove back on my bike, there were no cars on the road anymore only and I saw far away that there was control by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="133">People some people had some food they took the food away, and they used it for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="134">And I thought, what will they do now. </sentence><sentence id="135">When I go back they will see that I have something to hide. </sentence><sentence id="136"> Then it's more dangerous for me. </sentence><sentence id="137">So, I thought, the Lord will help me. </sentence><sentence id="138">So, I went through it and when they stopped me, what's in that box and then I got an idea. </sentence><sentence id="139">I said I don't know what's going on today but the third time I have to open that books everybody wants to know what's in that box. </sentence><sentence id="140">Then he said okay go ahead, so I was shaking very much but I saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="141">That's what I did, but it got a little bit too dangerous for me there in the South. </sentence><sentence id="142">They found out what I did, so I was advised to go into hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Okay, I just want to ask you a little bit more about this period in the South. </sentence><sentence id="275">I'm going to back track a bit. </sentence><sentence id="276">When the Nazis came into Holland, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="277">What was the reaction? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="282">What was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: I was in the seminary and it was before I was ordained and I remember from a window in the seminary we were watching when they marched into the town, and we were extremely mad because they invaded our country and we tried to defend it with only a few days that our soldiers could defend our country, but then they just overthrew us. </sentence><sentence id="284">There was no end to it. </sentence><sentence id="285">We were extremely mad, and then they were going to throw bombs, that was before. </sentence><sentence id="286">The older seminarians had to go into the basement and we spent their nights and days in the basement, but what was going on in other towns we didn't know too well. </sentence><sentence id="287">I only went at night, early before the other seminarians and the teachers they got up. </sentence><sentence id="288">I went already to Rosenthau on the bike after the curfew hours to bring pictures and books to the people who were hiding to keep them busy and to have their false i.d. </sentence><sentence id="289">cards made. </sentence><sentence id="290">It was all I knew about the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="291">I didn't know what was going on in other towns. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: How did you know about this man who was leader of the Resistance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: There was a seminarian and he worked in the underground too. , </sentence><sentence id="304">was his name, and he had relatives in the town and they knew who their leader was, and I had to force him to let me know who he was and as soon as I knew, it was already before I was ordained, I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="305">He was very friendly and he was living still quite a few years after we were liberated, but then he died. </sentence><sentence id="306">But his son is still living and his son is now I think he was in those days about 15 years old and he said his father was a little bit crazy. </sentence><sentence id="307">In those days he couldn't talk about anything after the liberation about then what he did during the war for the people who were hiding in the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="308">He was so proud of it, but during the Resistance he didn't tell anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="315">Q: What motivated you? </sentence><sentence id="316">How come you decided to take this on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: It was just my Christian duty I thought to help people who were in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="320">I had to do what I could to help them, and it was also because it was for my relative, my brother-in-law to find a hiding place and then I thought I only have to find a hiding place and he was very intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="321">He knew several languages very well, but he didn't know Latin, he couldn't stand it so I brought him books to study Latin and books from the library that he could read and I thought that is it. </sentence><sentence id="322">But then this leader , he wanted little by little, more and more to do something for the Resistance, so I came very much involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="323">So,  and Father Fonse. </sentence><sentence id="324">Father Fonse I saw at house very </sentence></p><p><sentence id="325"> often, and I knew that the only thing he did was working for the people who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="326">He could go to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="327">He had papers. </sentence><sentence id="328">He brought many people over the border to bring them to England and after there was a priest also in the seminary. </sentence><sentence id="329">He was a teacher, and he had a contact with the underground, but there was not a good contract because the people he recommended to bring to be brought to Switzerland, they all got caught. </sentence><sentence id="330">They all got taken prisoners, so he asked me if I could give the address, so I gave the address of the contact I had. </sentence><sentence id="331">This priest died a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="332">Then when it got too warm for me I had to go there were many priests home because during the war we wanted to go before the war already to the Mission countries, to Indonesia or South America. </sentence><sentence id="333">I didn't care, but we couldn't leave the country because we were occupied by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="334">They didn't let us go, so I had to find a place to work as a priest so somebody found for me a place in the northern part of Holland, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="335"> . [ </sentence><sentence id="336">became their assistant, but that was a town that was quite abandoned and there were very poor people living in huts. </sentence><sentence id="337">They were digging, one of those things used for fuel, like bread, this dried plants from centuries and they were living in huts and that was an ideal place to hide their people in that place. </sentence><sentence id="338">There I knew some people that worked with me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="339">For example, a retired nurse. </sentence><sentence id="340">She was living across the street directly her name was Sister Nista, they called the nurses always sister. </sentence><sentence id="341">She was not a nun but this Sister Nista, and she did a lot for the people that were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="342">She helped me a lot too. </sentence><sentence id="343">The pastor he acted like he was helping a lot but he was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="344">He was very afraid so I never told him what I did during the war. </sentence><sentence id="345">One day -- can I keep it for later -- is the tape almost finished because I cannot tell too much about the time I was up north. </sentence><sentence id="346">One day I had at the beginning already several people hiding and they were from Amsterdam and one day two ladies came on a bicycle all the way from Amsterdam and I don't know how many kilometers, maybe 200 kilometers because it was close to the German border, and they came and asked me where their husbands were. </sentence><sentence id="347">They knew that they were there and that I had them hiding and I gave them the addresses. </sentence><sentence id="348">They stayed a few days and then they went back to Amsterdam, but I had a friend, who passed away in Amsterdam, Father , and he couldn't write, so nobody knew where I was. </sentence><sentence id="349">I said would you please give my regards to Father </sentence></p><p><sentence id="350"> who is in Amsterdam in the parish and tell him that I knew him well. </sentence><sentence id="351">So, they did. </sentence><sentence id="352">Father asked them is there still food in that place where he is, and they said it seems so because he's providing food for our husbands. </sentence><sentence id="353">Then I got a ship of kids from people -- should I tell that later? </sentence><sentence id="354">Father he collected many kids and they were catholic kids, Protestant kids and Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="355">He chartered a ship and he couldn't let me know but there was one nurse who came with those kids and the ones who owned the ship they went over and started to say , they came over canals and rivers to the town where I was. </sentence><sentence id="356">One day on the first Friday of the month, I was hearing confessions and I saw a gentleman coming in church and he looked around and he saw me and he came to me and said are you Father Henry from the beaugard and I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="357">He said I am from Itica and Itica is a town that is close to where he was and he said there's a ship in Itica staying over night on the river and it's full with kids and they're starving. </sentence><sentence id="358">There was no food enough to keep them alive in Amsterdam and Father collected them and he heard that there was still food so quickly I had to find all places, families who wanted to take a kid. </sentence><sentence id="359">But after that, after I had placed those kids, I didn't know their names. </sentence><sentence id="360">I  didn't know which religion they had. </sentence><sentence id="361">I didn't know anything about them. </sentence><sentence id="362">Later on, Jews came. </sentence><sentence id="363">They all got that address from Father , and then I got a couple of Jews and then I got another couple and then more and more and I never knew if they were Jewish or not, and I found places for them, and there was a baker. </sentence><sentence id="364">There was an organization also, an underground organization in that town and there was a Protestant Minister and he belonged to that organization and he could get the rations, the coupons, and I got from him enough coupons all the time for all the people in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="365">But one day he asked me to give him a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were. </sentence><sentence id="366">I said I'm not going to do that because we are not going to give any names and I don't know their names. </sentence><sentence id="367">Then we have to stop to get you coupons. </sentence><sentence id="368">I said then I'll have to find another way. </sentence><sentence id="369">So, I found then a group in , that was another town, and I got in contact with the underground there and from them I got the coupons which | needed until they changed their mind in the town where I was and I got coupons from them again. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="370"> End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: When I was there up north, they asked me many times from the Holocaust, can you give any names. </sentence><sentence id="372">How people did you help? </sentence><sentence id="373">I said I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="374">I didn't know who was a Jew or who was not a Jew, but I knew there were many Jews among them, and there were a few who got a little bit homesick, and they wanted to go close to Amsterdam where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="375">Then I there was no way to travel by train. </sentence><sentence id="376">There was no train going any more, no bus. </sentence><sentence id="377">No cars, there were no cars, only by bike. </sentence><sentence id="378">Then I found I could borrow a few bikes, and then they had little boys who were strong enough for the ride from . </sentence><sentence id="379">We went to I don't remember, with the underground. </sentence><sentence id="380">In there was a river, and it was difficult to cross that river because there was so much control from the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="381">So, I could bring him to with the bike and then those people who were hiding, those adults, riding the bike and on the back seat was a little boy but the boy was strong enough to ride back to the home town. </sentence><sentence id="382">That was a whole day riding. </sentence><sentence id="383">I think it was. </sentence><sentence id="384">I don't know how far it was. </sentence><sentence id="385">I went with six people and it was a distance of a few hundred yards between me and the next one and the next one, and I said, I was in front, when I put my hand on the lantern, that means there is danger. </sentence><sentence id="386">See that you find a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="387">Don't continue. </sentence><sentence id="388">I'll find you later, but we didn't need it. </sentence><sentence id="389">So, I did it several times to bring people back to &gt; but had to cross the river. </sentence><sentence id="390">I gave there in the hands of the underground and there was a lot of people who worked for the Nazis, the , and they got some tickets to cross the river in the morning and in the evening, and the underground they got hold of some of those tickets and they could give it us. </sentence><sentence id="391">So, those people were and got a ticket too and walked over the bridge with those people to the other side and then they had to find their way. </sentence><sentence id="392">But they never found out who they were in the town there was a pastor from , and I became quite popular there because people were saying since Father is here, something is done for the people that went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="393">It was known. </sentence><sentence id="394">I didn't tell people, but they found out anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="395">Then the pastor got a little bit jealous. </sentence><sentence id="396">He said before Father came here nothing was done, so much is done for the people that went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="397">That is why I didn't tell the pastor anything, but later on I had no more places to hide, no more families, then I asked the pastor can I use the parish hall. </sentence><sentence id="398">The parish hall was not used for anything. </sentence><sentence id="399">He first said no and I got a little bit upset about it, and later he came to me and said it's all right, you can use the parish hall. </sentence><sentence id="400">So, I found straw to sleep on and pots and pans and everything and then I had so many people because we are close to the German border, it was at the end of the war and many people could come through -- it was a march between our countries and we were about a mile from the German border, and once I remember they told me that there were a few people they called , because there was a before and then many people were picked up and they had to work ina factory and they could escape and then they went through the swamp to their hometown. </sentence><sentence id="401">Then they told me there are a few more, so I thought I'm going to meet them on the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="402">Then I saw them walking, and I knew one of them. </sentence><sentence id="403">He was a former seminarian. </sentence><sentence id="404">He said what are you doing here in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="405">You are not in Germany, you are here in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="406">Then they cried. </sentence><sentence id="407">They were dirty and full of lice and so on. </sentence><sentence id="408">They had gone through the march. </sentence><sentence id="409">There was a lot of water and so on. </sentence><sentence id="410">There was not a road. </sentence><sentence id="411">So, I said go into church. </sentence><sentence id="412">I come in the church through the rectory and you can take a bath. </sentence><sentence id="413">They give some clean  clothing and so on and some food and then I'll find a place for you to hide here. </sentence><sentence id="414">What the two of them were I don't know, but the other one he was a catholic. </sentence><sentence id="415">His name was Chris , and then there was the one I knew from the seminary. </sentence><sentence id="416">What else can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="417">I had many kids in different places and I didn't know their names and I didn't know their religion but they had to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="418">Then I found out there were quite a few Jewish kids among them, too. </sentence><sentence id="419">There was one catholic boy and he heard two years ago when I was celebrating my golden anniversary in my hometown, he heard about, and he was one of those kids and he was now a rich guy close to Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="420">He was an exporter of tulip bulbs to foreign countries, and he came to the reception. </sentence><sentence id="421">Now, last year or this year he came to visit me, but I didn't like him very much because he was very egotistic and never paid anything. </sentence><sentence id="422">He was here for about six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="423">I went with him to Virginia to cut the time a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="424">I had to pay everything and he was not satisfied with the food that my sister made. </sentence><sentence id="425">He asked for other food, so I couldn't stand him any more. </sentence><sentence id="426">I was glad when the six weeks were over, but that was one of the boys. </sentence><sentence id="427">That's the only that I knew the name from. </sentence><sentence id="428">All the other ones I never knew the name. </sentence><sentence id="429">His name was Chris 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: How come you didn't know anyone's names? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Because you didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="493">It was too dangerous to find out the names. </sentence><sentence id="494">The names of those kids I don't know if it was in those days that you were hiding them if I knew the names, but I don't remember any. </sentence><sentence id="495">I don't know if I got the names. </sentence><sentence id="496">I didn't know the names of the people we were hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="502">Q: Let me ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="503">When you were hiding people, did you just hide everybody that came through, or was there a priority? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: They had to have a note from Father in Amsterdam, and he signed it only A.V., Adrian , and then I trusted them. </sentence><sentence id="507">But one morning, in the middle of the night one day, I heard the bell ring very little, and I had my room on the second floor of the rectory and I had my window there outside and I looked out of the window and there was a German soldier staying and they had long overcoats, and he said can I talk to you. </sentence><sentence id="508">I said what about. </sentence><sentence id="509">I would like to talk to you, so I let him in, and I thought I have to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="510">He told me that he was a German soldier and that his family was in Germany, but he said I don't think that we will win the war. </sentence><sentence id="511">I don't want to fight any more, I want to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="512">He asked me if I could give him the address of the leader of the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="513">I said I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="514">I didn't trust him. </sentence><sentence id="515">I thought maybe that the Nazis that they sent him over in the middle of the night to find out who are the ones helping the Nazis and the people were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="516">I asked to the pastor's bedroom, he said kick them out, kick them out. </sentence><sentence id="517">He was in bed. </sentence><sentence id="518">I gave him food. </sentence><sentence id="519">I gave him a sandwich. </sentence><sentence id="520">I said I'm sorry, I cannot help you. </sentence><sentence id="521">He left finally, after insisting very much about what the address is. </sentence><sentence id="522">I don't know any address. </sentence><sentence id="523">He said what do you do with people. </sentence><sentence id="524">Well, I tell them the same thing that I don't know how to help them. </sentence><sentence id="525">Later on I was very worried that maybe it is the truth that he was a real soldier that he wanted to go into hiding and my conscious was bothering me so much that I didn't help him. </sentence><sentence id="526">But I thought on the other hand maybe he would have given the names of the ones that were in the Resistance  and they all would be arrested, so I tried to forget about it, but I never could forget it. </sentence><sentence id="527">A few ladies later a policeman from the town came directly and told me that it was too much known that I did something for people who were hiding and I had to go into hiding myself. </sentence><sentence id="528">So, I went to a couple a brother and a sister. </sentence><sentence id="529">They were single, and they were already older and he was a furniture maker, and I could go into hiding there, but it was not far from the rectory. </sentence><sentence id="530">Through the window, my bedroom window I could see the rectory. </sentence><sentence id="531">I watched at night all night if I could see Germans coming to the rectory to pick me up, but I didn't see anybody, and after a week nobody came so I started again to live in the rectory. </sentence><sentence id="532">That's about all I can remember from the time I was there in the northern part. </sentence><sentence id="533">Everything was the same all the time. </sentence><sentence id="534">Helping Jews, helping other people who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="535">People who were picked up a lot of them who had to work in factories in Germany who came through the march. </sentence><sentence id="536">I had to find places. </sentence><sentence id="537">I had to find food for them and to keep them alive. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was difficult because those people didn't get rations, and those people who got rations got very little too, so I had to go to that was another town where many farmers, and I went through the fields of the moss, no, that dried stuff that they use for fuel, peat, there was only railroad track for those small railroad cars. </sentence><sentence id="539">Take a bike over those beams, and there was a shorter way too but there was no control. </sentence><sentence id="540">They went from farm to farm and back for some food. </sentence><sentence id="541">I got here potato and a little piece of meat so from a baker I got many rations from the underground. </sentence><sentence id="542">I told you that already. </sentence><sentence id="543">I did have money. </sentence><sentence id="544">I got some money from a girl who was working in the black market and her conscience was bothering her I think and she gave me sometimes 100 then 200 , money I used because there was not enough to buy all the food. </sentence><sentence id="545">So, I said, I will pay you back after the war is over. </sentence><sentence id="546">I don't have any money now. </sentence><sentence id="547">So, when I was on vacation from the United States in Holland, I went to that town and that couple was still living, the baker. </sentence><sentence id="548">The baker's wife said are you coming to pay the bill for all the bread you got here. </sentence><sentence id="549">I said oh, I forgot all about it anymore, but she died, but he is still living, and I saw him the last time I was in that town. </sentence><sentence id="550">He was an old man in his 90s, but he was a good friend. </sentence><sentence id="551">Hartman was his name, and he helped a lot. </sentence><sentence id="552">He had also people hiding in his house. </sentence><sentence id="553">I don't know if they were Jewish or not, and I told you about the electricity. </sentence><sentence id="554">We were without electricity but we still had a line outside. </sentence><sentence id="555">Now, it's all under the ground, and the Germans they cut it all to the houses, but the baker still had electricity because he had to bake bread for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="556">One night I could steal that electricity to have light in the rectory, but the pastor didn't want to know. </sentence><sentence id="557">One day yet very late and they went when it was already dark. </sentence><sentence id="558">They said it's now too dark to make the connection, I said no I don't want to sit by candle all night. </sentence><sentence id="559">So, but then it was in the dark and I couldn't see it too well and I missed it and it was sparking sparks like fireworks, sparks all over, and then I had to call an electrician early in the morning to restore it. </sentence><sentence id="560">The baker couldn't bake bread early in the morning for the Nazis, but they never found out. </sentence><sentence id="561">But people know now about it, but a few later last time I was in Holland I went to that town and I went to the church, this is a new church in another place and when I was there in the rectory were very abandoned. </sentence><sentence id="562">I thought I go to the cemetery to see the names of the graves of the people I knew. </sentence><sentence id="563">There was somebody working in the cemetery and I said, did you know all those people, he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="564">I said what's your name? </sentence><sentence id="565">He said are you a policeman or so? </sentence><sentence id="566">I said no I'm Father Henry Van Den Boogard. </sentence><sentence id="567">He said are you Father Henry Van Den Boogard? </sentence><sentence id="568">He hadn't seen me in 50 years and he married a girl who was a sister of the girl who worked at the rectory. </sentence><sentence id="569">He came now  too to my golden wedding anniversary to the reception. </sentence><sentence id="570">There were about 16 people from that Parish and they had to come all the way from the north. </sentence><sentence id="571">They had to drive for hours to get there and four hours to go back. </sentence><sentence id="572">I don't remember too much about those days in the north. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="642"> ? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="643">A: I tried to find out. </sentence><sentence id="644">I was there until the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="645">As soon as the war was over I wanted to go to see if my family was still living, because they fought a lot there, and there was no contact at all. </sentence><sentence id="646">So, as soon as possible, I had an opportunity once in who was originally his parents were living in the Parish, but he was a soldier during the war in 1940, and he was in the south. </sentence><sentence id="647">His group had to go to England and he became an English soldier. </sentence><sentence id="648">After the war he came with the people to liberate the country and he came to visit his parents in a pick up truck. </sentence><sentence id="649">He didn't see his parents for a long time and he heard about him. </sentence><sentence id="650">I went to him and I said, are you going back, he was closer to the hometown of my parents so I could go with him in the truck and bike through the cities, which soon after the war because I remember on them there was a city that as evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="651">There was nobody living any more. </sentence><sentence id="652">It was a dead city, not even a dog you could see on the street. </sentence><sentence id="653">There we stopped for a while. </sentence><sentence id="654">Do you have any more questions? </sentence><sentence id="655">It's easy for me to talk when you ask me questions. </sentence><sentence id="656">I am now to the point where I would like to be asked. </sentence><sentence id="657">I told all I can remember more or less. </sentence><sentence id="658">This 50 years ago, my memory is not too good anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="675">Q: When you said you were in until the end of the war, do you remember what year you went there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="677">A: Yes, I think it was in "44 until the war was over in "45. </sentence><sentence id="678">No, I was there longer, a little more than a year, I think. </sentence><sentence id="679">Very close to the Rectory there was a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="680">He had a big farm, and he was a Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="681">He was from , and he was a Nazi, and he watched us all the time. </sentence><sentence id="682">I knew that they had to be very careful, but I didn't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="683">I didn't know what happened to him, but after the war all the Nazis were picked up and punished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="691">Q: You were right near the border, so were there a lot of Germans and Nazis around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="693">A: No, not in the town where I was because there was a highway that went through the office where the Nazis were controlling everything that came through, and then there was a side road and maybe about two or three miles long and there was that town, along side a small canal where I lived, where all those poor people were living, and we were not bordered by Germans at all. </sentence><sentence id="694">Only they tried to find out later when I found that German soldier in the middle of the night standing there in front of the rectory. </sentence><sentence id="695">I wanted to have some names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="699">Q: What about Dutch Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="701">A: Oh, yeah, they were hidden by the people. </sentence><sentence id="702">After the war they were picked up and they had to parade through the streets with their hands on their head and soldiers surrounding with their  rifle and the people were shouting at them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="703">Also, the girls who dated German soldiers their hair was cut off completely. </sentence><sentence id="704">They were bald headed, and so I had some books with a lot of pictures but I lost them all in Chile, pictures about the concentration camps and so on. </sentence><sentence id="705">During the war I didn't know too well what happened to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="706">I knew that that they were put in concentration camps, but I didn't know that they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="707">I heard it after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="715">Q: When you were going around this area looking for food, going to farmers, did they know why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: Yes, I had to tell them, but I didn't tell them for Jews because that was too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="718">When they would know that you were helping Jews they would put you in a concentration camp and kill you, but I said certain people a lot of them were picked up on the street and in the churches to work in factories in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="719">| acted like it was all for them. </sentence><sentence id="720">The Hollands were very helpful when a priest came there to ask for food, sometimes they got one potato. </sentence><sentence id="721">Sometimes I got a little piece of bacon and so on, but it all added up. </sentence><sentence id="722">But I didn't want to bring it to the rectory because the pastor had two sisters living there that took care of him but they want to have as much as possible for themselves, so I went first to Sister Nista across the street, that nurse, and I stored them there. </sentence><sentence id="723">At once she helped people who went into hiding, Jews or no Jews, and there was a guy who came there and he was hiding there in her place and the pastor and the people didn't know if he was a traitor or not. </sentence><sentence id="724">So, some from the underground came there and interrogated him and they acted like they were Nazis and he said I'm Nazi too, and he showed them the papers. </sentence><sentence id="725">Then finally he said we are not Nazis, we are from the underground too, and then he showed papers that he was from the underground, so they didn't know, but they let him smoke a cigarette and took him outside and killed him with a hammer, and they buried him in the peat and that happened before I came there. </sentence><sentence id="726">I knew exactly where he was buried and the companies were digging for that peat, they were getting close to that grave and I was afraid that they would find him, so I told him they had to go to another place. </sentence><sentence id="727">I don't know how I told them, but they didn't dig there further, so they didn't find the body. </sentence><sentence id="728">I don't know what happened with that body later either because when the war was over, I had a lot of people in the parish house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: How many? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: Sixty, I think, to eighty, and then they left and then the new ones came in and I told one of the guys to put all the names down, but they never got the paper with all the names. </sentence><sentence id="744">It was difficult to keep them alive to find food. </sentence><sentence id="745">When the war was over we just said, I told the pastor I think we are liberated. </sentence><sentence id="746">They didn't come to us. </sentence><sentence id="747">They forgot us. </sentence><sentence id="748">They went to towns, the Allied and I think ring the bell and we are liberated too and then the pastor and I went on the bicycle over the border there was no control any more but there were some Canadians on the other side in German and I didn't remember much English but I tried to talk to them a little bit and they asked me for an i.d. </sentence><sentence id="749">card. </sentence><sentence id="750">They didn't know if I was safe or not, but we went to the pastor to get some mass wine and candles. </sentence><sentence id="751">In Germany they had everything planned here we didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="752">That's what happened after the war. </sentence><sentence id="753">Then there was a  band but here you have high schools with band, but there they are adults and they don't have uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="754">They just get together and form a band, and they came to bring a serenade to the Jews who were hiding in the Parish hall. </sentence><sentence id="755">I remember that they standing there in their sloppy clothes. </sentence><sentence id="756">Their overalls are dirty. </sentence><sentence id="757">They are standing there all in line, but soon when I found out that it was a soldier from the Allies, he was a Hollander, and he was also at my reception a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="758">I still have pictures of him here and I could just go with him to my home town, then the Pastor who was a little bit jealous of me because I was getting too popular he got a letter that I was appointed for Chile and he arranged right away for my farewell party. </sentence><sentence id="759">When I came back there was a farewell party and I didn't know where all those people who went into hiding where they went. </sentence><sentence id="760">They didn't know my name either, so I don't know, I went to the south and had a vacation and prepared to go to South America. </sentence><sentence id="761">So, I don't know what happened later. </sentence><sentence id="762">Only one I found and he had tuberculosis and he was in one of the provinces laying in bed. </sentence><sentence id="763">I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="764">I think he got t.b. </sentence><sentence id="765">in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="766">I don't know what happened to him either. </sentence><sentence id="767">I don't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="768">I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="769">I did remember it because I went to see him and it was far away from the town where I was assistant. </sentence><sentence id="770">It was between him and my parents in . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: These people who were hiding there, did they hide for a few months and then move on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: Some did. </sentence><sentence id="802">Some did until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="803">Some got homesick and it was difficult for the Jews because they were told they couldn't go out. </sentence><sentence id="804">They were locked up day and night for a long time, and I remember that once, one of the assistants came and he said this Jewish family and they can't stand it any more and they get out at night and walked around and that is so dangerous they bring the people where they are hiding in danger too, and we have to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="805">But I didn't want to have them killed, so there was one of the Resistance to save those people where they were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="806">So, I went to those Jews and told them to be careful and said you bring those people who are helping you into danger. </sentence><sentence id="807">I can't understand why you are getting so restless. </sentence><sentence id="808">If you stay day in night in that hiding place you ought to have some friends once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="809">That was the end of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q: Were some of them trying to go through Holland and go south through France and Spain? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="843">A: I did all on my own. </sentence><sentence id="844">I worked a lot with that nurse across the street. </sentence><sentence id="845">She was a retired nurse, Nista, and I remember her name very well, but I don't remember the name of that nurse that came with all those kids. </sentence><sentence id="846">She was staying with the nurse, Nista. </sentence><sentence id="847">That's what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="848">I did it all on my own. </sentence><sentence id="849">I didn't want to tell anybody. </sentence><sentence id="850">I didn't even want to know the pastor or his sisters or the girl who worked there. </sentence><sentence id="851">The girl who worked there remembers still many things that I was a signet because she was about 17 years old at that time, I think, she came here last year. </sentence><sentence id="852">You have seen her | think. , </sentence><sentence id="853">She was here for a vacation for three weeks when I met her in Holland I heard her brother-in-law worked in the cemetery where I went and he said he was the brother-in-law of . </sentence><sentence id="854">He told me where she worked. </sentence><sentence id="855">So, I went to see her. </sentence><sentence id="856">She was a widow now, and when he came -- in Holland we don't wear a collar. </sentence><sentence id="857">It's just a tie, and she didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="858">When I finally said who I was oh, she was so surprised after so many years to see me again and then I invited why don't you come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="859">So, she did later. </sentence><sentence id="860">She came for three weeks, and she writes me now, long letters with all nonsense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: But you were hiding many people in the Parish hall so obviously the other people in the Rectory knew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: Oh, yes, they knew that yes. </sentence><sentence id="882">But they didn't know they were Jews among them. </sentence><sentence id="883">That had to be the most secret thing that we had to keep about Jews because that was too dangerous for the people who were helping them and the Jews themselves. </sentence><sentence id="884">Because the Jews were the enemies of the Nazis, but there were many people who went into hiding because they didn't want to work in Germany or they were picked up and were sent to factories and they ran away from there and came back to Holland and had to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="885">So, they were in Holland and hiding together with the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
