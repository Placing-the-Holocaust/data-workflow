parade and everything. </sentence><sentence id="8">In the afternoon there was a reception, and the mayor came also to the reception and his name was John , and he was very anti-Nazi, anti-German, and he was very sleepy when he came to the reception. </sentence><sentence id="9">He said you have to excuse me because the whole night I had to visit Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="10">I didn't know there were so many Jews in our home town, but he had to tell them that they had to go into hiding because that same night they would be arrested. </sentence><sentence id="11">And there was a policeman and he was in favor of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="12">He fought always with the mayor because they had different opinions and the mayor was very anti-Nazi so at the end of the war he had to go into hiding himself. </sentence><sentence id="13">That is why I knew there were quite a few Jews in my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="14">Then I didn't do anything until I had a brother-in-law, his father was born in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="15">He just got married, then, in those days, and his father was born in Germany, so the Nazis made all the decedents who were born in Germany, they made them German so they could serve in the military service. </sentence><sentence id="16">But my brother-in-law didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="17">He was the husband of

</sentence><sentence id="22">There was , in Rosenthau and he said oh he can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="23">And , would like to mention him because he did a lot for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="24">He's not living anymore but in those days everything was so secret he didn't tell me that he had a Jewish family in his house too hiding. </sentence><sentence id="25">He was working with a priest who was a trappist before. </sentence><sentence id="26">He was still a trappist but they were kicked out of the monastery by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="27">Then he had to find a place so he became a chaplain in a very large nun's convent in Rosenthau. </sentence><sentence id="28">But he was only a name chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="29">What he did was working for people who wanted to go into hiding especially Jews. </sentence><sentence id="30">He did a lot. </sentence><sentence id="31">He was smuggling weapons and things like that and finding hiding places to keep those Jews alive. </sentence><sentence id="32">But he was not very prudent and we thought some day he will be arrested and it happened. </sentence><sentence id="33">He was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="34">His name was . </sentence><sentence id="35">I didn't name his full name, I knew only as Fonse, his nickname, but not his last name. </sentence><sentence id="36">I found it out later. </sentence><sentence id="37">He went to a concentration camp in 5 close to my hometown, but he was last seen in the , in the police office when he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="38">But we never heard of him later. </sentence><sentence id="39">We didn't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="40">Now, when the war was over, the leader of this Resistance in , he became the leader of this concentration camp where no Jews were anymore but were just the Nazi prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="41">I was then assistant in the North, but I went to see him in the South and I visited him, I said, did you ever find out what happened to Fonse, I said don't know, and he said I don't know either, but I know of a famous architect and he knows of somebody in the who works there and he was hiding with priests somewhere in the west of . </sentence><sentence id="42">So, I got the address of the architect and this architect was making a  . </sentence><sentence id="43">It was closed. </sentence><sentence id="44">So, I went there by car, that was given to me by the leader of the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="45">He's a soldier, so when I saw him, it was lunch time, there was nobody anymore in the office, only one gentleman and he knew me. </sentence><sentence id="46">I said how do you know me. </sentence><sentence id="47">He said do you not know me anymore? </sentence><sentence id="48">You helped me go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="49">I said when was that? </sentence><sentence id="50">I said I have no hair I was a prisoner in and they cut my hair I was bald headed and he had a prison suit on and I was going to be executed in the neighborhood of Rosenthau and they brought me there with other prisoners who were going to be executed too but then we were attacked by the English planes and we all left the cars and could go into hiding in the corn field. </sentence><sentence id="51">It was not corn, it was wheat. </sentence><sentence id="52">We could crawl through the weeds the fields to the neighbor town where I was living. </sentence><sentence id="53">It was during the hours that there was a curfew at night, so in the morning I had to go Rosenthau to bring some pictures of Jews who had to have false identification cards and there was a teacher in town who took those pictures. </sentence><sentence id="54">He was an amature. </sentence><sentence id="55">He took those pictures, developed them at night, and early in the morning as soon as the hours were over of the curfew, then I was going to pick them up and bring them to Rosenthau to have my brother-in-law who was hiding he had to make those i.d. </sentence><sentence id="56">cards. </sentence><sentence id="57">So, when I went through the town I saw in a hallway of a house I saw somebody standing in the suit of the prisoner's bald headed and he called me. </sentence><sentence id="58">He said can you find me a place where I can stay. </sentence><sentence id="59">I brought him then to a place where the brother of Doctor DeBeer, he was a physician, and his brother was a priest, he was in hiding too. </sentence><sentence id="60">I brought him there. </sentence><sentence id="61">So, as soon as I told me who he was, I thought this is not the one who was hiding with Fonse so I was just as far as I was in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="62">I did find out. </sentence><sentence id="63">Later on I came to Paris and I wanted to know so badly where Fonse was if he was still living or not so Thad on radio his name if somebody knew about him, his whereabouts to let me know. </sentence><sentence id="64">So, I got a letter from the abbot of the monastery, he said as soon as you know let us know. </sentence><sentence id="65">We want to know what happened to him, too. </sentence><sentence id="66">I got a letter from his relative in Hague, they wanted to know also where Fonse was, if he was still living. </sentence><sentence id="67">But then I got a letter from a doctor in , where the concentration camp was. </sentence><sentence id="68">He said I saw when he was dead, I had to make a certificate that he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="69">He was killed on that day. </sentence><sentence id="70">It was two weeks after he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="71">Now there is some monument for Fonse in that nun convent and he's on the list of the ones who were killed in . </sentence><sentence id="72">But, now we don't know much about him, but I wanted to emphasize more what , the leader of the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="73">And Fonse , this priest what they did for the Jews because it was never recognized. </sentence><sentence id="74">Nobody knew and nobody knew the names. </sentence><sentence id="75">They never gave the names, but I know, because I worked with them that they were hiding Jews making false papers for them, i.d. </sentence><sentence id="76">cards and trying to keep them alive by finding food so I would like to emphases that now that I have the opportunity to make it known what they did during the war. </sentence><sentence id="77">So, that is what I usually did. </sentence><sentence id="78">I didn't do much myself, only I did on my bike brought i.d. </sentence><sentence id="79">cards to people who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="80">Once I was asked by to bring a few  Then it's more dangerous for me. </sentence><sentence id="81">So, I thought, the Lord will help me. </sentence><sentence id="82">So, I went through it and when they stopped me, what's in that box and then I got an idea. </sentence><sentence id="83">I said I don't know what's going on today but the third time I have to open that books everybody wants to know what's in that box. </sentence><sentence id="84">Then he said okay go ahead, so I was shaking very much but I saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="85">That's what I did, but it got a little bit too dangerous for me there in the South. </sentence><sentence id="86">They found out what I did, so I was advised to go into hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: Yes, I had to tell them, but I didn't tell them for Jews because that was too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="359">When they would know that you were helping Jews they would put you in a concentration camp and kill you, but I said certain people a lot of them were picked up on the street and in the churches to work in factories in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="360">| acted like it was all for them. </sentence><sentence id="361">The Hollands were very helpful when a priest came there to ask for food, sometimes they got one potato. </sentence><sentence id="362">Sometimes I got a little piece of bacon and so on, but it all added up. </sentence><sentence id="363">But I didn't want to bring it to the rectory because the pastor had two sisters living there that took care of him but they want to have as much as possible for themselves, so I went first to Sister Nista across the street, that nurse, and I stored them there. </sentence><sentence id="364">At once she helped people who went into hiding, Jews or no Jews, and there was a guy who came there and he was hiding there in her place and the pastor and the people didn't know if he was a traitor or not. </sentence><sentence id="365">So, some from the underground came there and interrogated him and they acted like they were Nazis and he said I'm Nazi too, and he showed them the papers. </sentence><sentence id="366">Then finally he said we are not Nazis, we are from the underground too, and then he showed papers that he was from the underground, so they didn't know, but they let him smoke a cigarette and took him outside and killed him with a hammer, and they buried him in the peat and that happened before I came there. </sentence><sentence id="367">I knew exactly where he was buried and the companies were digging for that peat, they were getting close to that grave and I was afraid that they would find him, so I told him they had to go to another place. </sentence><sentence id="368">I don't know how I told them, but they didn't dig there further, so they didn't find the body. </sentence><sentence id="369">I don't know what happened with that body later either because when the war was over, I had a lot of people in the parish house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: How many? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: Sixty, I think, to eighty, and then they left and then the new ones came in and I told one of the guys to put all the names down, but they never got the paper with all the names. </sentence><sentence id="385">It was difficult to keep them alive to find food. </sentence><sentence id="386">When the war was over we just said, I told the pastor I think we are liberated. </sentence><sentence id="387">They didn't come to us. </sentence><sentence id="388">They forgot us. </sentence><sentence id="389">They went to towns, the Allied and I think ring the bell and we are liberated too and then the pastor and I went on the bicycle over the border there was no control any more but there were some Canadians on the other side in German and I didn't remember much English but I tried to talk to them a little bit and they asked me for an i.d. </sentence><sentence id="390">card. </sentence><sentence id="391">They didn't know if I was safe or not, but we went to the pastor to get some mass wine and candles. </sentence><sentence id="392">In Germany they had everything planned here we didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="393">That's what happened after the war. </sentence><sentence id="394">Then there was a  2 band but here you have high schools with band, but there they are adults and they don't have uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="395">They just get together and form a band, and they came to bring a serenade to the Jews who were hiding in the Parish hall. </sentence><sentence id="396">I remember that they standing there in their sloppy clothes. </sentence><sentence id="397">Their overalls are dirty. </sentence><sentence id="398">They are standing there all in line, but soon when I found out that it was a soldier from the Allies, he was a Hollander, and he was also at my reception a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="399">I still have pictures of him here and I could just go with him to my home town, then the Pastor who was a little bit jealous of me because I was getting too popular he got a letter that I was appointed for Chile and he arranged right away for my farewell party. </sentence><sentence id="400">When I came back there was a farewell party and I didn't know where all those people who went into hiding where they went. </sentence><sentence id="401">They didn't know my name either, so I don't know, I went to the south and had a vacation and prepared to go to South America. </sentence><sentence id="402">So, I don't know what happened later. </sentence><sentence id="403">Only one I found and he had tuberculosis and he was in one of the provinces laying in bed. </sentence><sentence id="404">I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="405">I think he got t.b. </sentence><sentence id="406">in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="407">I don't know what happened to him either. </sentence><sentence id="408">I don't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="409">I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="410">I did remember it because I went to see him and it was far away from the town where I was assistant. </sentence><sentence id="411">It was between him and my parents in . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="440">Q: These people who were hiding there, did they hide for a few months and then move on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="442">A: Some did. </sentence><sentence id="443">Some did until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="444">Some got homesick and it was difficult for the Jews because they were told they couldn't go out. </sentence><sentence id="445">They were locked up day and night for a long time, and I remember that once, one of the assistants came and he said this Jewish family and they can't stand it any more and they get out at night and walked around and that is so dangerous they bring the people where they are hiding in danger too, and we have to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="446">But I didn't want to have them killed, so there was one of the Resistance to save those people where they were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="447">So, I went to those Jews and told them to be careful and said you bring those people who are helping you into danger. </sentence><sentence id="448">I can't understand why you are getting so restless. </sentence><sentence id="449">If you stay day in night in that hiding place you ought to have some friends once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="450">That was the end of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
