So the German couldn't do anything, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="190">So he chased us away. </sentence><sentence id="191">So when he chased us away, we stood again. </sentence><sentence id="192">So now, the Polish kids, they chased us away and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things. </sentence><sentence id="193">So we had to go home without bread and without anything. </sentence><sentence id="194">And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the Vistula, from the river; and this is like 4 miles. </sentence><sentence id="195">So we took 2 pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="196">Me and my sister took 2 pails of water, and we walked. </sentence><sentence id="197">We carried the pails so when we had to pass by a Polish neighborhood, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out and make us walk back. </sentence><sentence id="198">Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the city. </sentence><sentence id="199">Every citizen was on his own, and they know they lost their country. </sentence><sentence id="200">Still the hatred. </sentence><sentence id="201">The anti- Semitism those Polish people had toward the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="202">For no reason at all! </sentence><sentence id="203">Now they felt that they can do with the German help what they always want to do. </sentence><sentence id="204">And here they got somebody to point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with the water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry that far pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="205">So this went on for a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="206">You know with that thing. </sentence><sentence id="207">Finally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I remember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a street in Warsaw, the Nalevki. </sentence><sentence id="208">And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot. </sentence><sentence id="209">I don't  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection couldn't grab too much. </sentence><sentence id="210">And little by little, they cleaned out the warehouse, they cleaned out the factory. </sentence><sentence id="211">They took away the machines. </sentence><sentence id="212">Everything they loaded up in truck, and I don't know where they had it. </sentence><sentence id="213">So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that factory, we lived awhile. </sentence><sentence id="214">We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2 years, you know. </sentence><sentence id="215">And after...this was around 1941...1942. </sentence><sentence id="216">1941 or 42 it start getting very bad, because the ghetto was closed in. </sentence><sentence id="217">They made a wall around the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="218">I had to wear a arm band with the star of David. </sentence><sentence id="219">Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest sister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the street, she had a arm band, you know, with a...with a star of David. </sentence><sentence id="220">And everybody in the house had always ready, uh, how you say a rucksack with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be protected. </sentence><sentence id="221">That was my father's idea. </sentence><sentence id="222">We don't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="223">First day here, they clean out this street. </sentence><sentence id="224">They clean out this street. </sentence><sentence id="225">You walk out in the street. </sentence><sentence id="226">You don't know if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the street and they need 100 people to go to work, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you. </sentence><sentence id="227">When we lived in that building, we lived near a courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="228">One time each house had like a committee, and they were directing all the rules. </sentence><sentence id="229">One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="230">So who'll they take? </sentence><sentence id="231">Elderly people, they can't take. </sentence><sentence id="232">The youngsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people. </sentence><sentence id="233">And from that house by us, we had to give them 3 people. </sentence><sentence id="234">So each house, like 10 building, used to give 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="235">And 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away. </sentence><sentence id="236">When they came back, nobody recognized them. </sentence><sentence id="237">Each one was swelling. </sentence><sentence id="238">I remember that I had a friend. </sentence><sentence id="239">His name was Schemick. </sentence><sentence id="240">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="241">His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="242">And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the ghetto to eat. </sentence><sentence id="243">There was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="244">You couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations. </sentence><sentence id="245">It's your pot luck. </sentence><sentence id="246">If you don't have it, you die, and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="247">Finally when they start bringing people out from the ghetto, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the ghetto, we'll give you 3...3 pounds of bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="248">And if you just register, you want to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="249">Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and marmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="250">They just went and they signed up. </sentence><sentence id="251">Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that place, they got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to that place, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads. </sentence><sentence id="252">And they pushed them into the trains; and they pushed in so many people in the trains that they actually couldn't eat that bread. </sentence><sentence id="253">There was no room even to cut the bread. </sentence><sentence id="254">So what happened. </sentence><sentence id="255">Well, they send them to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="256">The trains came back with the same bread because in the trains they used to put in 350 to 400 people in a cattle car and you had standing room only. </sentence><sentence id="257">You couldn't even sit. </sentence><sentence id="258">You couldn't even stand. </sentence><sentence id="259">You were just pressed like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="260">So the bread and the marmalade when the people had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in Treblinka, they had to undress and they had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="261">So the same breads and the same marmalade came back for the new transport. </sentence><sentence id="262">And this went on constantly. </sentence><sentence id="263">Now the 22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was home and there was, uh, a...a raid. </sentence><sentence id="264">The SS came, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the court yard, and I said to my mother, "What we gonna do?" </sentence><sentence id="265">So she says, "You don't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="266">I got a paper. </sentence><sentence id="267">Your daddy works." </sentence><sentence id="268">My father was working as a mechanic in a...in the ghetto for the...for the...in the factory they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots. </sentence><sentence id="269"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection along to make the 10,000 up. </sentence><sentence id="270">And that's what probably happened that day. </sentence><sentence id="271">They needed a couple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes from their Umshagplatz where all the trains went to Treblinka, so the first thing they did, ran into those court yards, and they grabbed the people. </sentence><sentence id="272">And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, my father came home and I told him what happened and I said to him, "Well, I...L...I can't be here anymore." </sentence><sentence id="273">You know, like I just can't find myself a place. </sentence><sentence id="274">First of all, I says you go away in the morning to work. </sentence><sentence id="275">I have to stay here by myself. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I don't know what can happen. </sentence><sentence id="277">Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers. </sentence><sentence id="278">I don't work. </sentence><sentence id="279">And if you don't have no papers, you don't work. </sentence><sentence id="280">It's just like, uh, you don't exist. </sentence><sentence id="281">So I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="282">So I spoke...I had a friend of mine...a kid I went to school with him, and he told me, "There is a guy who lives next house, and he works on the on the airport in Warsaw for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the airport. </sentence><sentence id="283">This is a good job, and you can stay there and at least you're going to be safe a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="284">I told this to my father and I said to him, you know, we're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay off a German. </sentence><sentence id="285">And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna tell you what happened. </sentence><sentence id="286">That's...some day he came. </sentence><sentence id="287">My father gave him the money. </sentence><sentence id="288">I took with me...1 remember like now...I took with me a leather briefcase. </sentence><sentence id="289">I took with me maybe 200 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="290">That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin. </sentence><sentence id="291">My father says, "You take this." </sentence><sentence id="292">And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before. </sentence><sentence id="293">So I didn't have a chance even to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="294">He says, "Take it with you." </sentence><sentence id="295">So I went and I took this. </sentence><sentence id="296">And I remember like now the guy took us and we walked on the street in the ghetto...what nobody is allowed to walk, but he had a paper from the...from the...from the German Air Force, that he's bringing some people to work for the airplanes or something, so... And I saw these German SS. </sentence><sentence id="297">They're walking around and looking at us, see somebody and here they see four people walking in the middle of the street with any kind of fear with this look in them, so one soldier came over he asks for Ausweiss, so we showed him the paper and he says, "Go ahead." </sentence><sentence id="298">If you walked about about maybe 20 minutes and after I saw...I was there, I saw a German in an air force uniform waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="299">He had half a hand because he must have been shot or something, so he's got...one arm was loose and he came over and he spoke to this guy and the says to him, three guys. </sentence><sentence id="300">He put us in a street car, you know,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection airplanes, the military airplanes, little things like this, not major stuff. </sentence><sentence id="301">And they used to feed us, maybe 2 slices of bread a day and a soup, a watery soup. </sentence><sentence id="302">But we had good quarters to sleep because in those quarters used to sleep the soldiers and this was an empty barrack so we had to sleep, we had good quarters. </sentence><sentence id="303">There's no...
