<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Tell us then, uh, what happened to this family when the Germans came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="156">When the Germans came in, my father...1 mean actually we were...we had no food in the house. </sentence><sentence id="157">It was not like here. </sentence><sentence id="158">You had always something in the house. </sentence><sentence id="159">In Europe, everything you need, you used to go out every day in the store, and you used to buy. </sentence><sentence id="160">When the war broke out, the water was cut off. </sentence><sentence id="161">There was no gas in the house to cook anything. </sentence><sentence id="162">There was no food. </sentence><sentence id="163">So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some bread or the necessary things. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour pickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of streets, there was a factory, they used to produce pickles. </sentence><sentence id="165">A Polish factory! </sentence><sentence id="166">And they call it Original, and they used to have the pickles in tents like...small tents, and large ones. </sentence><sentence id="167">As I found out, so I went with a friend of mine and somehow we got in to that building in the night, even when the bombs were falling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about 5 pounds and we dragged it home, and this we lived for a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="168">Just on pickles!And once in a while, we got bread. </sentence><sentence id="169">But we had some rice. </sentence><sentence id="170">So we had rice and pickles. </sentence><sentence id="171">And this went on for...for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="172">There were houses burning. </sentence><sentence id="173">I mean it was...to describe a regular hell, because there was no water to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the fires go. </sentence><sentence id="174">It just happened the house we lived that nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="175">Like next house, third house, in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the houses and look for something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="176">And this kept on for 4 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="177">When the Germans came in, so they didn't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="178">New rules. </sentence><sentence id="179">New Regime. </sentence><sentence id="180">They first thing they did, they made a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="181">You are not allowed to walk the street. </sentence><sentence id="182">But still there was no food. </sentence><sentence id="183">So the only thing they did was on the corner someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have field kitchens, and they used to give to the people bread and salamis. </sentence><sentence id="184">This is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="185">Right when they walked in. </sentence><sentence id="186">I found this it out through a friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="187">When you go over there, let's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there is a field kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="188">You gonna go over there, you gonna get something. </sentence><sentence id="189">I remember like now I took my older sister. </sentence><sentence id="190">We walked and we walked and...and still the fires were on both sides, but the war was ended already. </sentence><sentence id="191">They occupied the city. </sentence><sentence id="192">We came over there. </sentence><sentence id="193">We saw a line of people, and we stood in the line for that bread and the salami and sometime they gave you two breads. </sentence><sentence id="194">When I got to the line, a Pole...a Polish kid came out and said to the German, "He's Jude." </sentence><sentence id="195">You know like...the German didn't even know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the Polish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like "Don't give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="196">He's a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="197">So now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="198">So he chased us away. </sentence><sentence id="199">So when he chased us away, we stood again. </sentence><sentence id="200">So now, the Polish kids, they chased us away and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things. </sentence><sentence id="201">So we had to go home without bread and without anything. </sentence><sentence id="202">And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the Vistula, from the river; and this is like 4 miles. </sentence><sentence id="203">So we took 2 pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="204">Me and my sister took 2 pails of water, and we walked. </sentence><sentence id="205">We carried the pails so when we had to pass by a Polish neighborhood, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out and make us walk back. </sentence><sentence id="206">Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the city. </sentence><sentence id="207">Every citizen was on his own, and they know they lost their country. </sentence><sentence id="208">Still the hatred. </sentence><sentence id="209">The anti- Semitism those Polish people had toward the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="210">For no reason at all! </sentence><sentence id="211">Now they felt that they can do with the German help what they always want to do. </sentence><sentence id="212">And here they got somebody to point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with the water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry that far pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="213">So this went on for a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="214">You know with that thing. </sentence><sentence id="215">Finally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I remember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a street in Warsaw, the Nalevki. </sentence><sentence id="216">And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot. </sentence><sentence id="217">I don't know how or why. </sentence><sentence id="218">This is the first time I heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="219">They took out 53 people from that building, men, women, children, and they killed them instantly. </sentence><sentence id="220">This is maybe 2 weeks after they walked in....in the town. </sentence><sentence id="221">And...and I don't now that...what happened with that soldier, how he got shot over there, and this was in the Jewish district, you know, and they took out 53 people and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="222">And since then everybody knew that something terrible is going to happen to the Jewish people in that District. </sentence><sentence id="223">Now what happened to our place is that the German's find out about my grandfather's factory and the store, so every day you see trucks came in and they loaded up. </sentence><sentence id="224">They cleaned out little by little everything. </sentence><sentence id="225">My father and my grandfather, we grabbed some stuff and we kept it in the house. </sentence><sentence id="226">Not much because you    couldn't grab too much. </sentence><sentence id="227">And little by little, they cleaned out the warehouse, they cleaned out the factory. </sentence><sentence id="228">They took away the machines. </sentence><sentence id="229">Everything they loaded up in truck, and I don't know where they had it. </sentence><sentence id="230">So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that factory, we lived awhile. </sentence><sentence id="231">We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2 years, you know. </sentence><sentence id="232">And after...this was around 1941...1942. </sentence><sentence id="233">1941 or 42 it start getting very bad, because the ghetto was closed in. </sentence><sentence id="234">They made a wall around the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="235">I had to wear a arm band with the star of David. </sentence><sentence id="236">Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest sister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the street, she had a arm band, you know, with a...with a star of David. </sentence><sentence id="237">And everybody in the house had always ready, uh, how you say a rucksack with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be protected. </sentence><sentence id="238">That was my father's idea. </sentence><sentence id="239">We don't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="240">First day here, they clean out this street. </sentence><sentence id="241">They clean out this street. </sentence><sentence id="242">You walk out in the street. </sentence><sentence id="243">You don't know if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the street and they need 100 people to go to work, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you. </sentence><sentence id="244">When we lived in that building, we lived near a courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="245">One time each house had like a committee, and they were directing all the rules. </sentence><sentence id="246">One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="247">So who'll they take? </sentence><sentence id="248">Elderly people, they can't take. </sentence><sentence id="249">The youngsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people. </sentence><sentence id="250">And from that house by us, we had to give them 3 people. </sentence><sentence id="251">So each house, like 10 building, used to give 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="252">And 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away. </sentence><sentence id="253">When they came back, nobody recognized them. </sentence><sentence id="254">Each one was swelling. </sentence><sentence id="255">I remember that I had a friend. </sentence><sentence id="256">His name was Schemick. </sentence><sentence id="257">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="258">His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating, from the undernourishment those people had. </sentence><sentence id="259">What did they do? </sentence><sentence id="260">They dig some kind of dam in the water. </sentence><sentence id="261">They were standing all day long in the water in digging the ground, and from this they got swelling, and they were undernourished, and this kid lived about 2 weeks after they send him home he died because he was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="262">And this kept on like this, and my father was still home. </sentence><sentence id="263">My mother was still home. </sentence><sentence id="264">My sisters were home, and still we went some...and...in time of the night, we had schooling, like people made a school for 3, 4 children. </sentence><sentence id="265">They shouldn't forget what they learn, and we had libraries. </sentence><sentence id="266">We went in the libraries. </sentence><sentence id="267">We read books. </sentence><sentence id="268">We still think sometime sometime will get better. </sentence><sentence id="269">In the meanwhile, we had...there was a Polish newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="270">Actually it was a newspaper where the German printed but in Polish language, and this was smuggled in in the ghetto and we read it. </sentence><sentence id="271">We heard only about the Germans winning the war and they win this and this and this. </sentence><sentence id="272">We didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="273">The radios was not allowed to have because they took all the radios from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="274">They took away one night and made a decree, everybody has a radio, fall coats, good clothes, this has to be given away. </sentence><sentence id="275">And we didn't have no news actually what happened on the other side of the world. </sentence><sentence id="276">And this went on like this until 1942.42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well, we need people to go Ost [NB: to the east], means for work. </sentence><sentence id="277">And the hunger in the ghetto was so great, was so bad, those people were laying on the streets and dying, little children went around begging, and, uh, everyday you walked out in the morning, you see somebody is laying dead, covered with newspapers or with any kind of blanket they found, and you found those people used to carry the death people in little wagons, used to bring them down to the cemetery and bury them in    mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="278">And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the ghetto to eat. </sentence><sentence id="279">There was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="280">You couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations. </sentence><sentence id="281">It's your pot luck. </sentence><sentence id="282">If you don't have it, you die, and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="283">Finally when they start bringing people out from the ghetto, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the ghetto, we'll give you 3...3 pounds of bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="284">And if you just register, you want to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="285">Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and marmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="286">They just went and they signed up. </sentence><sentence id="287">Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that place, they got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to that place, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads. </sentence><sentence id="288">And they pushed them into the trains; and they pushed in so many people in the trains that they actually couldn't eat that bread. </sentence><sentence id="289">There was no room even to cut the bread. </sentence><sentence id="290">So what happened. </sentence><sentence id="291">Well, they send them to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="292">The trains came back with the same bread because in the trains they used to put in 350 to 400 people in a cattle car and you had standing room only. </sentence><sentence id="293">You couldn't even sit. </sentence><sentence id="294">You couldn't even stand. </sentence><sentence id="295">You were just pressed like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="296">So the bread and the marmalade when the people had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in Treblinka, they had to undress and they had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="297">So the same breads and the same marmalade came back for the new transport. </sentence><sentence id="298">And this went on constantly. </sentence><sentence id="299">Now the 22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was home and there was, uh, a...a raid. </sentence><sentence id="300">The SS came, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the court yard, and I said to my mother, "What we gonna do?" </sentence><sentence id="301">So she says, "You don't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="302">I got a paper. </sentence><sentence id="303">Your daddy works." </sentence><sentence id="304">My father was working as a mechanic in a...in the ghetto for the...for the...in the factory they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots. </sentence><sentence id="305">So he was like taking care of all the machineries and she has a paper that her husband works for the Germans so she says, "Don't worry, I mean." </sentence><sentence id="306">I says, "But I have to worry because I am over 17. </sentence><sentence id="307">And if they see me, they will grab me." </sentence><sentence id="308">So she says, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="309">You go hide." </sentence><sentence id="310">So I was hiding in the house and she went downstairs with my 3 sisters. </sentence><sentence id="311">Everybody was having that...that thing on the back of the thing with a piece of bread with a...with a schmatles (ph) inside. </sentence><sentence id="312">I don't know what they keep inside. </sentence><sentence id="313">And that's how they went downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="314">And this is the...the last time I saw them. </sentence><sentence id="315">Because the Germans even if they saw the paper, they just took the paper like this and ripped it apart and they took them out. </sentence><sentence id="316">That time they took about 10,000 people to the place Umschlagplatz took the people to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="317">I was laying, hidden in a room on the top of the ceiling. </sentence><sentence id="318">They made like a blind room. </sentence><sentence id="319">If you wouldn't know it, you wouldn't know it's a room. </sentence><sentence id="320">But it's actually was like a hideaway on the top of the ceiling. </sentence><sentence id="321">And I was laying there, and I heard the Germans came into the house and they take them out downstairs, and I was laying there. </sentence><sentence id="322">I didn't know what to do, what to say. </sentence><sentence id="323">And I figured because of the paper, he's going to read the paper and he's going to say, "Oh, well, and he's going to let him stay." </sentence><sentence id="324">And he tell them to go downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="325">In the courtyard, there was already hundreds of people like this, and they took them away. </sentence><sentence id="326">This was around 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="327">And this was that day on July 1942. </sentence><sentence id="328">And another thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="329">If they have, uh, a norm. </sentence><sentence id="330">That means they need 10,000 people every day, and if they had 8,000, they just went around on the street and just grabbed everybody who comes    along to make the 10,000 up. </sentence><sentence id="331">And that's what probably happened that day. </sentence><sentence id="332">They needed a couple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes from their Umshagplatz where all the trains went to Treblinka, so the first thing they did, ran into those court yards, and they grabbed the people. </sentence><sentence id="333">And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, my father came home and I told him what happened and I said to him, "Well, I...L...I can't be here anymore." </sentence><sentence id="334">You know, like I just can't find myself a place. </sentence><sentence id="335">First of all, I says you go away in the morning to work. </sentence><sentence id="336">I have to stay here by myself. </sentence><sentence id="337">And I don't know what can happen. </sentence><sentence id="338">Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers. </sentence><sentence id="339">I don't work. </sentence><sentence id="340">And if you don't have no papers, you don't work. </sentence><sentence id="341">It's just like, uh, you don't exist. </sentence><sentence id="342">So I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="343">So I spoke...I had a friend of mine...a kid I went to school with him, and he told me, "There is a guy who lives next house, and he works on the on the airport in Warsaw for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the airport. </sentence><sentence id="344">This is a good job, and you can stay there and at least you're going to be safe a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="345">I told this to my father and I said to him, you know, we're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay off a German. </sentence><sentence id="346">And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna tell you what happened. </sentence><sentence id="347">That's...some day he came. </sentence><sentence id="348">My father gave him the money. </sentence><sentence id="349">I took with me...1 remember like now...I took with me a leather briefcase. </sentence><sentence id="350">I took with me maybe 200 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="351">That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin. </sentence><sentence id="352">My father says, "You take this." </sentence><sentence id="353">And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before. </sentence><sentence id="354">So I didn't have a chance even to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="355">He says, "Take it with you." </sentence><sentence id="356">So I went and I took this. </sentence><sentence id="357">And I remember like now the guy took us and we walked on the street in the ghetto...what nobody is allowed to walk, but he had a paper from the...from the...from the German Air Force, that he's bringing some people to work for the airplanes or something, so... And I saw these German SS. </sentence><sentence id="358">They're walking around and looking at us, see somebody and here they see four people walking in the middle of the street with any kind of fear with this look in them, so one soldier came over he asks for Ausweiss, so we showed him the paper and he says, "Go ahead." </sentence><sentence id="359">If you walked about about maybe 20 minutes and after I saw...I was there, I saw a German in an air force uniform waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="360">He had half a hand because he must have been shot or something, so he's got...one arm was loose and he came over and he spoke to this guy and the says to him, three guys. </sentence><sentence id="361">He put us in a street car, you know, because a Jew was not allowed to ride the street car. </sentence><sentence id="362">And here we got those things you know because we are afraid to take it off. </sentence><sentence id="363">So he said to us, "We should take them off and he is going to stay with us, and he paid for us on the street car, those tickets, and we went all the way to Okence (ph). </sentence><sentence id="364">Okence (ph) is like Kennedy Airport from New York, you know, like. </sentence><sentence id="365">And I was over there...in Okence (ph), I was over there 16 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="366">RIght. </sentence><sentence id="367">I was in Okence (ph) from May...No...from July, August...No. </sentence><sentence id="368">I went to Okence (ph)...I went August, September, November...3 months....4 months...16 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="369">And we didn't know what happened to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="370">We know that there's no people left over there. </sentence><sentence id="371">Everybody is out. </sentence><sentence id="372">I didn't know what happened to my father. </sentence><sentence id="373">I didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="374">And I was there 16 weeks, and we worked by coal. </sentence><sentence id="375">We unload wagons of coal for the Germans used to use for heating up the systems and some wagons of coals went to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="376">So this was mine job, to unload and load coals. </sentence><sentence id="377">And once we clean airplanes...once in a while they took us to clean out the    airplanes, the military airplanes, little things like this, not major stuff. </sentence><sentence id="378">And they used to feed us, maybe 2 slices of bread a day and a soup, a watery soup. </sentence><sentence id="379">But we had good quarters to sleep because in those quarters used to sleep the soldiers and this was an empty barrack so we had to sleep, we had good quarters. </sentence><sentence id="380">There's no... We had a little bed with a mattress. </sentence><sentence id="381">This is very unusual and, uh, the only thing was no was no food. </sentence><sentence id="382">So that money that I have, a couple of hundred zlotys, this lasts me for awhile to buy myself, and over there where we used to go to work, I used to take coal. </sentence><sentence id="383">I used to stuff myself in mine coat, and the coat used to weigh 20 pounds because I used to cut out the underline and used to stuff with coals. </sentence><sentence id="384">When I walked from the...from the air field back to the barracks, I used to ask the soldiers, the German air force...they weren't that bad...the air force. </sentence><sentence id="385">They weren't that bad because they probably were not indoctrinated like the German SS or the Gestapo, so I used to say to him, "You see how dirty I was. ( </sentence><sentence id="386">in German) I have to buy soap to wash my face." </sentence><sentence id="387">He said, "Sure." </sentence><sentence id="388">So they used to walk slow. </sentence><sentence id="389">I used to run across the street. </sentence><sentence id="390">There was little stores from Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="391">They have little stores. </sentence><sentence id="392">They used to sell bread. </sentence><sentence id="393">They used to sell soap. </sentence><sentence id="394">They used to sell candies. </sentence><sentence id="395">And I used to go in and I used to say in Polish to them, "You want a coal." </sentence><sentence id="396">Oh, they were...they went crazy, because they weren't allowed to have coal. </sentence><sentence id="397">I mean the Germans took everything away. </sentence><sentence id="398">And I used to walk like this. </sentence><sentence id="399">I bend down, I scouped everything up, put in the pail and they gave me sometimes...they gave me a half a bread. </sentence><sentence id="400">Sometimes they gave me some a piece of salami. </sentence><sentence id="401">Sometime they gave me some candies. </sentence><sentence id="402">Sometimes a pack of cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="403">I mean, that's all I need. </sentence><sentence id="404">I didn't need no money. </sentence><sentence id="405">I need to bargain with them. </sentence><sentence id="406">I need to deal with them. </sentence><sentence id="407">And this went on for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="408">Once I heard there's people starting to run away, from that camp, and I says, "Where do they running?" </sentence><sentence id="409">They found out that some people still live in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="410">And I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="411">I didn't know where to run...to who to run. </sentence><sentence id="412">And this every night, I used to sleep and I used to think how will I get out from here. </sentence><sentence id="413">Maybe my father's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="414">Maybe my mother came back. </sentence><sentence id="415">Who knows?

" </sentence><sentence id="512">I tell you what," I says, "we gonna go down and I'll give you the money." </sentence><sentence id="513">So I picked the street... remember that now, the Jelasna (ph) Street. </sentence><sentence id="514">All the houses were bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="515">And when that street car stopped, I said, "I am gonna get down now, and he followed me. </sentence><sentence id="516">So he walked in with me in a bombed out house, and he said, "Now, give me your money. </sentence><sentence id="517">If not, I am gonna turn you in." </sentence><sentence id="518">So, I bend down and I wanta take out the money from my sock. </sentence><sentence id="519">And he was so greedy and he looked on if I don't leave anything over there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="520">And he bend down...he wants to see. </sentence><sentence id="521">So I grabbed    a stone and I just hit him in the face. </sentence><sentence id="522">And he fell down. </sentence><sentence id="523">He fell down. </sentence><sentence id="524">I didn't hurt him or anything. </sentence><sentence id="525">He just fell down. </sentence><sentence id="526">So when he fell down, I run out. </sentence><sentence id="527">And I ran out...I ran...I don't know what happened to him, but I ran so fast because I lost...I lost the 20 zlotys I had, and I ran out. </sentence><sentence id="528">And I know if I will catch, the next thing that will take me to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="529">And I had the change where the lady, the Polish woman gave me for the coal and I ran to the thing and I got the street car and I went to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="530">And I know up to 7:00 they let in all the people. </sentence><sentence id="531">Here was already 7:30. </sentence><sentence id="532">And I says, "Where will I be." </sentence><sentence id="533">I went over there. </sentence><sentence id="534">I saw about 20 people still standing over there. </sentence><sentence id="535">In one group 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="536">In one group 50 people. </sentence><sentence id="537">There's still a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="538">And I mixed myself in and I had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="539">I haven't got anything. </sentence><sentence id="540">I couldn't say I worked any place. </sentence><sentence id="541">I just ran away from a work place. </sentence><sentence id="542">And here the SS stand by the ghetto, by the wall, and they let in the people where they worked outside on German arbeits, German work places. </sentence><sentence id="543">I went over there and I went to one man and I says, "Where's these people from?" </sentence><sentence id="544">So he tell me. </sentence><sentence id="545">He says, "We work in a...in someplace where they cut food all day long." </sentence><sentence id="546">I was looking for a place where they do with coal because cutting wood you don't get dirty in the face and the hands. </sentence><sentence id="547">Finally, I found people that were working some kind of masonry. </sentence><sentence id="548">They were all dirty, no... I says, "I am gonna hitch myself out to hem." </sentence><sentence id="549">I go over there to them and everybody passes by and everybody has to raise their hands because they are frisked. </sentence><sentence id="550">One carries a bread, one carries potatoes, one carries red beets...red beets, and one carries...any little thing. </sentence><sentence id="551">I don't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="552">That's suscipicious already. </sentence><sentence id="553">I don't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="554">And here the people were. </sentence><sentence id="555">They go through and everybody stays like this with their hands up. </sentence><sentence id="556">When I get to them, the German...the...the man that stays by the gate...the SS calls me and says, "Where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="557">I says, "I work for those people." </sentence><sentence id="558">He says in German, "How...how come you don't have anything with you. </sentence><sentence id="559">You see all those people...one has got a bread, one has got potatoes, one has got this...and you don't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="560">I says to him I am very poor and I says I don't have time to buy anything to day because I worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="561">I had to unload a whole train with coal. </sentence><sentence id="562">He says, "Is that so." </sentence><sentence id="563">He went over to the next guy. </sentence><sentence id="564">He had two breads. </sentence><sentence id="565">He took away one from him and he gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="566">And this is the same guy who wouldn't even let me in next to him. </sentence><sentence id="567">And I passed him and I went in to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="568">I went to the other side and I had a bread. </sentence><sentence id="569">So this guy ran over to me and says, "Give me back my bread. </sentence><sentence id="570">That's mine." </sentence><sentence id="571">So I was afraid to start making a commotion because there were Jewish police, there were German Police, there were Polish police. </sentence><sentence id="572">So I gave them the bread and I said, "Thank God, I am on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="573">Forget about it." </sentence><sentence id="574">I came in to the other side and I have to look where my father is. </sentence><sentence id="575">Now I found out I have to go through three...three...how do you say it...three posts, with the soldiers to go through these. </sentence><sentence id="576">So I went to a friend what I know he was in ghetto, and I asked him what to do. </sentence><sentence id="577">He says, "I can't give you no papers. </sentence><sentence id="578">There's nobody here. </sentence><sentence id="579">Everything is bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="580">There's no people here. </sentence><sentence id="581">People...very few people. </sentence><sentence id="582">He says, "You have to figure out for yourself what to do." </sentence><sentence id="583">I found a way how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="584">I saw there's people going in groups. </sentence><sentence id="585">They're going in groups, like six people, they go through the gate or 8 people. </sentence><sentence id="586">I went to the gate and I said to the six people, "where are you working." </sentence><sentence id="587">Some speak German and some don't because I learn a little bit German to speak when I was working over there at the...at that military airport. </sentence><sentence id="588">So I make believe that I am the leader of those 8 people and I said in German, "You should all stand in one line. </sentence><sentence id="589">You give me all the papers." </sentence><sentence id="590">And I went over there to the soldier and I    says to him in German, you know like big deal, I says to him, "Look, I got 8 people going to work and this is the papers." </sentence><sentence id="591">He looked on the papers. </sentence><sentence id="592">He didn't ask me for the papers. </sentence><sentence id="593">It was a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="594">He didn't ask me. </sentence><sentence id="595">He just saw...because they have respect for people they are...they are, let's say, leaders. </sentence><sentence id="596">So there he thought as I'm the leader for them, so...you don't ask a leader for papers. </sentence><sentence id="597">So those 8 people went and I went with them and that's how I went over there and after I went on the house where my father lives. </sentence><sentence id="598">And I remember like now, it's fourth floor and I walked up, opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="599">It was in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="600">Here he saw me. </sentence><sentence id="601">He said, "What are you doing here, Ike?" </sentence><sentence id="602">I says, "Look, I couldn't wait until you send somebody to take me." </sentence><sentence id="603">So...and this is the time when I stood there and my father took me in in that factory. </sentence><sentence id="604">He went to the boss, the German boss what owns...he was like...and he took me in and I was working over there until... | went through three, four selections over there when they took away the people. </sentence><sentence id="605">I...one selection was January 1943. </sentence><sentence id="606">One day... You remember that. </sentence><sentence id="607">One day they called us all downstairs, came in a big deal from the SS men, the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="608">They lined us all up. </sentence><sentence id="609">I remember like now I had a pair of boots and I had coveralls or overalls. </sentence><sentence id="610">I don't know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="611">And I was sitting there and he went 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out. </sentence><sentence id="612">He didn't make 10. </sentence><sentence id="613">Every sixth men he took out. </sentence><sentence id="614">I was 4. </sentence><sentence id="615">My father was 5. </sentence><sentence id="616">I was standing right next to him. </sentence><sentence id="617">The 6th one was out. </sentence><sentence id="618">After he went 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6 out, out. </sentence><sentence id="619">Anda truck was standing right there so they took out about maybe 60 people or 80 people, put them on the truck. </sentence><sentence id="620">Didn't see them anymore. </sentence><sentence id="621">This was the first selection was that time. </sentence><sentence id="622">And I was working in that place until the ghetto uprising. </sentence><sentence id="623">It was the ghetto uprising, that's the time it started the whole problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
