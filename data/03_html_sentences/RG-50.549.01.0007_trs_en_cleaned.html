<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Oh, we were, we were, we were very an... very, very angry. </sentence><sentence id="368">But, what, what can | tell you? </sentence><sentence id="369">We were very, very rough, very arrogant in, in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="370">Like we went on a train and they ask for a, for a train ticket. </sentence><sentence id="371">We used to say, "Hitler paid already." </sentence><sentence id="372">We    Erwin Baum 12 December 5, 1995 Page 12 never stood in line -- like, like taking advantage of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="373">But after awhile, we calmed down. </sentence><sentence id="374">We calmed down, because we say, "Hey, what's the use, after all, you cannot blame the whole, the whole nation for it. </sentence><sentence id="375">Here, now, the Nazis, | thought were arrested and taken care of, and the children of them are regretting, and then they're feeling with us, they're nice to us." </sentence><sentence id="376">So you know, they try to brainwash us, and as a young person, from bad to good, you got kind of a little bit brainwashed and, and, and calmed down, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: What do you mean brainwashed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: That they say, "It's not my fault, | didn't know, my daddy, you know, it was very bad, he was forced into it. </sentence><sentence id="393">He didn't mean to do it. </sentence><sentence id="394">If he wouldn't join the Nazi party, he would go also to concentration camp." </sentence><sentence id="395">And, and | saw these things happen because there were certain times where, where SS soldiers were brought to concentration camp for not fulfilling the orders that they received. </sentence><sentence id="396">| didn't know exactly what the orders were. </sentence><sentence id="397">Like one very high rank officer came to concentration camp and he was stripped of the uniform, put on concentration camp uniform, shaved the head, and we had to speak to him. </sentence><sentence id="398">He says, "Well, | was a very high rank officer and | came home on vacation and my wife and the children were deported to a camp." </sentence><sentence id="399">He says, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="400">Because apparently, his wife's grandfather descended from a gypsy. </sentence><sentence id="401">So that made her also a gypsy, they put in concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="402">So he came back, he says, "Who am | fighting    Erwin Baum 13 December 5, 1995 Page 13 for?" </sentence><sentence id="403">You know, so he came to concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="404">So, this way the Germans of the war made us believe somehow that they were not completely to blame, that they were, were brainwashed, that, that circumstances brought them to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="421">Q: And yet, it seemed reasonable at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: | mean, | was reasonable, because after all, |, | didn't read any books. </sentence><sentence id="424">| wasn't that my -- that much educa...educated. </sentence><sentence id="425">After the war, | didn't feel like going back to school and, you know, | wanted to roam around, to drive my car, to show off, go to dancing, be with girls, and my dream was to have a beautiful blue suit with white stripes. </sentence><sentence id="426">It was impossible to get it, but somehow | got it. </sentence><sentence id="427">So like after the war, whatever | wanted, it came to me, it fell into my lap, very easy. </sentence><sentence id="428">So | stopped thinking ab...about the past. </sentence><sentence id="429">| mean, it happened, it's unrepairable and when | found my two brothers, | was very, very, very, very happy and we kind of started a new life again. </sentence><sentence id="430">And as | said, the war broke out in Israel and my brother went. </sentence><sentence id="431">| says, "What am | sitting here in Luxembourg?There's no future here. </sentence><sentence id="432">| go to Israel." </sentence><sentence id="433">And | went to Israel and then | went to the, to the Israeli Navy as a volunteer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: Why did you, why did you decide to...did you have strong militant feelings about...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: Not militant, | had the feeling for a Jewish state, for a Jewish state, that's Israel you know, that's all | knew. </sentence><sentence id="449">Because the camps, the UNRRA camps that | used to visit, you know, and all the girls, | used to socialize with a beautiful girl, and she says, "Oh, I'm not going to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="450">I'm not going to." </sentence><sentence id="451">Because people used to make, start making    Erwin Baum 14 December 5, 1995 Page 14 applications to go to United States, you know, had to wait for a quota. </sentence><sentence id="452">And people say, "I'm going to Eretz, I'm going to Eretz Israel", I'm going to Eretz Israel." </sentence><sentence id="453">And here, war breaks out and the word came around that young men should go to Israel to, to defend the country. </sentence><sentence id="454">So what was | then, 21 or 22, "What am | sitting here, sitting in Luxembourg? </sentence><sentence id="455">I'm with people that |, that | don't know, all alone, and | have a brother that came up from concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="456">| want to be with him." </sentence><sentence id="457">So | went to Israel, then | was in the Navy and | met my wife, got married -- while | was in the Navy, a beautiful wedding -- and the war ended and then they had to liberate me because it was not aliyah(r), was just a volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="458">And then | got angry in Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
