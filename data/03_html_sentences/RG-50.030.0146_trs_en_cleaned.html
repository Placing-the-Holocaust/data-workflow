It was really like a war zone. </sentence><sentence id="693">And this is how we finally arrived in a camp called Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="694">Bergen-Belsen were...was just the opposite of a camp from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="695">In Auschwitz, at least there we worked. </sentence><sentence id="696">And every once in a blue moon, we...we went into the showers. </sentence><sentence id="697">As much as we were afraid to go to the showers, because we didn't know if the showers would give us water or gas; but we showered once in a blue moon. </sentence><sentence id="698">Over there [NB: Bergen-Belsen], we had no showers. </sentence><sentence id="699">We had no toilets. </sentence><sentence id="700">In Auschwitz, we had a barrack which was nothing but a toilet. </sentence><sentence id="701">One long toilet. </sentence><sentence id="702">How was the toilet made? </sentence><sentence id="703">The toilet was um a plank with two holes. </sentence><sentence id="704">One opposite the other. </sentence><sentence id="705">Two rows. </sentence><sentence id="706">And people would have to use those...those um um holes to...to do their business. </sentence><sentence id="707">And one person would walk right in the middle of those...those holes with a whip in their hand. </sentence><sentence id="708">God forbid if you missed the hole. </sentence><sentence id="709">They would hit us. </sentence><sentence id="710">And when we came into Bergen-Belsen and I was looking for the toilet barracks, there was none. </sentence><sentence id="711">So I found out that they had made a ditch, and we had to go in the ditch and do it. </sentence><sentence id="712">The decay and the filth in Bergen-Belsen was undescribable. </sentence><sentence id="713">The conditions, the food... We had no...um my barrack had no...no um um...not bunks to sleep on. </sentence><sentence id="714">They gave us straw mats. </sentence><sentence id="715">We slept on straw mats. </sentence><sentence id="716">After a month, the straw mats got rotten, and we had to throw them away. </sentence><sentence id="717">So I slept on the bare floor. </sentence><sentence id="718">I had nothing to sleep on. </sentence><sentence id="719">The little girl that I was with, that was the only one that I was able to um um keep with on the death march, her name was Christiane. </sentence><sentence id="720">And I ...I stuck with her. </sentence><sentence id="721">She was the only girl from...she was from France, and I was from Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="722">But we both spoke French, so we ...we...we stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="723">She was a year younger than I am. </sentence><sentence id="724">She never knew why she came into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="725">She didn't even know she was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="726">I don't even know how she was caught. </sentence><sentence id="727">And she was a very young, naive little girl; and I kind of protected her, as young as I was. </sentence><sentence id="728">She...I had promised the other girls that I was going to take care of her, because we were separated from the other group, from the other Belgian people. </sentence><sentence id="729">So I felt like a duty, that she was part of me; and I kind of protected her. </sentence><sentence id="730">And um I guess that gave me the strength to carry on, because I kind of worried about her. </sentence><sentence id="731">And the life in Bergen-Belsen was just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="732">We had...the...the rations were the same. </sentence><sentence id="733">And the people just died like flies over there, because there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="734">We had...we had no work over there. </sentence><sentence id="735">We just sat around. </sentence><sentence id="736">And we walked around--in the decay, in the dirt, between the...the um um ditches from the bathrooms. </sentence><sentence id="737">The smell was horrible; and...and people were...got sick. </sentence><sentence id="738">People got diphtheria, the runs; and it was terrible catching. </sentence><sentence id="739">And um finally, the little girl got sick. </sentence><sentence id="740">I...you would go and stay in front of kitchens, hoping that somebody would see me that knew me from Auschwitz, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="741">I was hoping would give me something. </sentence><sentence id="742">And finally, um twice some people gave me--one time a little bit of coffee and one time a little bit of soup--that I ran back to Christiane to give it to her. </sentence><sentence id="743">And Christiane died in my arms while I was feeding her a little bit of the coffee. </sentence><sentence id="744"> I wanted her to have a little bit of hot um coffee, and she died in my arms. </sentence><sentence id="745">But before she died, she had gotten delirious from the fever. </sentence><sentence id="746">Afterwards, I found out it was typhus that she had. </sentence><sentence id="747">And she got delirious. </sentence><sentence id="748">It was the middle of the night, and she saw her family in her fever. </sentence><sentence id="749">So she started...she got up, and she wanted to run to her family. </sentence><sentence id="750">She cried in French, "Mama!" </sentence><sentence id="751">And she wanted to go to them. </sentence><sentence id="752">And, naturally, she was stepping on the sleeping people, and she made a commotion. </sentence><sentence id="753">So I tried to calm her, and lay her down. </sentence><sentence id="754">And while I was trying to calm her, the Blockalteste--which is the woman in charge of the um barrack-- came down on me with a stick. </sentence><sentence id="755">And she started beating me. </sentence><sentence id="756">She beat me so much, until the the stick broke. </sentence><sentence id="757">And I laid there for two days. </sentence><sentence id="758">I couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="759">I was so bruised and broken up. </sentence><sentence id="760">And it was right after that that Christiane died. </sentence></p></dialogue>

First, in the beginning, I couldn't look at her. </sentence><sentence id="1298">I was afraid to look at Christiane on top of that pile. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I knew where she was. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And I knew what she had on. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Christiane had a skirt--a little skirt, a thin little skirt--and a navy blue jacket. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And finally my guilt couldn't take it any more. </sentence><sentence id="1303">I said I had to go and look at Christiane. </sentence><sentence id="1304">So I went out, and I looked at Christiane. </sentence><sentence id="1305">And one thing puzzled me...and I didn't understand what was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1306">Christiane's skirt was taken away, and she was bare from the waist down. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Nothing but bones and skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="1308">Just like you see in the...in the pictures, or in the movies they show. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And she had a white jacket on. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I says, "Why is her jacket white? </sentence><sentence id="1311">Why would somebody take off the blue jacket, and put a white jacket?" </sentence><sentence id="1312">So I went closer by of the pile...to the um skeletons, the dead people. </sentence><sentence id="1313">And I looked up; and underneath that white, I saw the navy blue. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And the outside of the white was lice. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Big white lice, like the size of black ants that you see sometimes, the black ant crawling in the dirt. </sentence><sentence id="1316">That's as big as those lice were. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And they covered that navy blue little jacket; and it made the jacket look white or grayish. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And it shocked me so that I almost fell on the... under the dead cadavers. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And I ran away and I never looked at Christiane again anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1320">I was so...it...it...it just took everything out of me. </sentence><sentence id="1321">I couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="1322">They were eating Christiane up, this... From...from...from the terrible--the lice, the decay, the filth. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And this is how she ended up, a young fifteen year old girl. </sentence><sentence id="1324"> And after that, I was so disillusioned. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I had nothing to fight anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1326">My morale was so down. </sentence><sentence id="1327">And I think I came down with the typhus what Christiane had. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And I couldn't work anymore, and I couldn't get up anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And I laid there; and one day I had to go to the um bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And I had to go at night. </sentence><sentence id="1331">And they...and I fell; and coming back from the bathroom, somebody pushed me and bruised me on my leg. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And from the bad nutrition and the bruise developed into a terrible big bruise. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And I don't know what happened to my leg, but it was like on fire. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And no medication, and no um um medicine. </sentence><sentence id="1335">It...it was like um um a fire was on my leg, and a bump; and um I would not let nobody touch it. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And I was very weak with the typhus, and I couldn't walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1337">And I laid there like a skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="1338">And this is how I was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1339">When I was liberated, I couldn't um lift my head up. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Finally, after two days, I asked two inmates to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And I could look out the window and see what a soldier looked like. </sentence><sentence id="1342">And then they laid me down again. </sentence><sentence id="1343">And then I found out, after the um... probably days, told the um...the um army...
