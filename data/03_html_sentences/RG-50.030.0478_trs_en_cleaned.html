<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1237">Q: So the Czech -- the Czechs were not like the Austrians? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1239">A: No, definitely not, but there were some who very soon adapted themselves to raising the arm, and -- yeah, you know, I think the Czechs had the -- I don't want to sound im -- missing the right word, but it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="1240">They were not deeply involved in anything spiritual, I mean, they were 400 years under the Austrians, under the Hapsburgs before World War I, then for 20 years -- and they tolerated it and cooperated, and they had to live -- make a living. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Then for 20 years they were free, from eight -- 1918 till ? </sentence><sentence id="1242">38, and there were great Czech patriots. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And when the Germans occupied, many became sympathizers, and collaborants -- collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="1244">Then there were again great Czechs after deg45. </sentence><sentence id="1245">There were fighters for Czech freedom 10 minutes before the war ended, and -- not 10 minutes, two days. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And then the Communists took over, they became the great Communists. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And in 1989, the biggest Communists, who were Etta Truff, and -- made all the money and stole all the money, they were the ones, the first ones who privatized state enterprises. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And with their Communist connections, they got it for almost nothing, and today they're millionaires. </sentence><sentence id="1249">So they can adjust in the [indecipherable] so, any condition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1261">Q: And were you frightened when you saw the Germans come in, the Wehrmacht come in? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1953">A: -- until it was filled. </sentence><sentence id="1954">Anyway, I started to say that until 1938, those barracks were used -- occupied and used by the military and since the German occupation, there was no military in those barracks, they were closed. </sentence><sentence id="1955">And of course, they started to deteriorate, a lack of maintenance, and weather, and rusty and dusty, and -- and repairs, the floor, the pipes. </sentence><sentence id="1956">So -- but I couldn't get anybody to help me to prepare the kitchens, because they had their assigned job. </sentence><sentence id="1957">Until later they got the idea that it's good to have some relations with the kitchen under the conditions we were living at, and they came and helped, that they did some manual work, and the engineers did some repair. </sentence><sentence id="1958">And they finally got the one kitchen going. </sentence><sentence id="1959">There were two kitchens in the Sudeten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1967">Q: Two kitchens in the Sudeten. </sentence><sentence id="1968">So what ha -- how did people eat when you first came? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1973">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1975">A: -- prepared meals. </sentence><sentence id="1976">So for three days we took -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1979">Q: Your own food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1981">A: -- our own food, and we were able on the third day already to prepare a soup, and -- and bread was delivered for the 342. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1983">Q: So, did you make the soup because you didn't have any help? </sentence><sentence id="1984">Who made the soup? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1987">A: That wasn't difficult to make, the soup, that if you did nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="1988">That -- that -- the other cook was there, we worked together. </sentence><sentence id="1989">He was not very enthusiastic about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1993">Q: And what did you have, huge -- huge pots? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1995">A: Kettle, like you saw in that picture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1997">Q: In picture, huge -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1999">A: Huge, yeah, 400 liter, hundred gallon kettles. </sentence><sentence id="2000">Some were steam heated from a central steam line, which then had to be augmented, the capacity I mean, of which. </sentence><sentence id="2001">And some burn coal. </sentence><sentence id="2002">So there -- you found -- I'm jumping ahead again. </sentence><sentence id="2003">Okay, we're in that kitchen and preparing it and we got ready, and six days later, a transport of thousand people came from Brno, that's the capital of Moravia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2009">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2011">A: And what -- it was the job of the Council of Elders, and now while -- if the Council of Elder was in Terezin, so there were other officials in Prague, and those big communities, that had to put the thousand people to fill a transport, on German orders. </sentence><sentence id="2012">This is a terrible responsibility to decide whom you dislocate from their regular life, which was lousy already anyway, but it was something known, and send them away. </sentence><sentence id="2013">But what they did, they kept families together. </sentence><sentence id="2014">In my case it was negative, because they wanted me to be together with my parents, so they came three weeks after me, while they otherwise might have, by chance, stayed longer in their accommodations at home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2020">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2022">A: And this principle prevailed also when transports were put together from Terezin to the east. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2024">Q: They would bra -- keep families together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2026">A: Families together, unless one of the family members were -- was in a job -- it could work both ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or -- or for maintenance of the town -- functioning of the town, they either kept the one and send the rest, or they kept the whole family back. </sentence><sentence id="2027">And I don't know who and why and how these decisions were made, but these were three ways of people staying in Terezin till the end, or being shipped out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2030">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2031">Now, Edgar, you're 17 years old in 1941 when you're deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2036">Q: Seven -- 17 and a half, that's right, because in February you're going to be 18. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2038">A: 17 and a half. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2040">Q: That's right, in 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2042">A: Almost three quarter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2044">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2045">Do you feel as an adult man at this point? </sentence><sentence id="2046">I mean, how -- what is it -- who -- who are you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2050">A: It's hard for me to say, it y -- sounds like bragging, but my wife wa -- brings that up, whereas that it was unbelievable that age 17 and three quarters, I could organize the setting up of the kitchen, and not only that. </sentence><sentence id="2051">When that first transport came of -- I don't remember what the other one did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2054">Q: The other cook? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2056">A: He was the -- yeah, he -- he worked alone, but he did not initiate anything. </sentence><sentence id="2057">I think he was mad that he was taken out of his regular life. </sentence><sentence id="2058">With that first transport, I mention whole families came, so I had somebody staff the kitchen with women who knew about food, who knew about preparation of food, understood food, although they never worked for thousand people, I -- I -- neither did I. But at least somebody who knows how to handle food -- food. </sentence><sentence id="2059">Now, there was flour in -- in the warehouses. </sentence><sentence id="2060">There was some sugar, there was some margarine, and interestingly, there was plenty of spices. </sentence><sentence id="2061">Pepper, paprika, caraway. </sentence><sentence id="2062">I guess that was not a -- an item the Germans were short of. </sentence><sentence id="2063">But there was no vegetable, there was no fruit. </sentence><sentence id="2064">There was occasionally some marmalade, and not to jump too fast, we started up one kitchen, and then, or after that first transport, every second day, third day, another thousand people came. </sentence><sentence id="2065">And I don't remember how many thousands that Sudeten held, but when it was full, the Germans decided to separate women from the men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2077">Q: So at first when they came to the Sudeten, they were together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2079">A: Often families together, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2080">And I never went up to look how they a-accommodated with a -- a family occupies one of the three sections of the bunk, or above each other, or - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2083">Q: And how -- how were the -- do you know how the bunks were set up? </sentence><sentence id="2084">Is this like a dormitory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2087">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2089">Q: Or were there actually separate room? </sentence><sentence id="2090">There were not separate rooms, it was all -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2093">A: No, no, there was the -- this military barrack -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2095">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2097">A: -- was one long -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2099">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2101">A: -- one long room, and then they put up the bunks this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2103">Q: So where are you staying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2105">A: I was staying in one -- one of -- one -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2107">Q: One of these bunks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2109">A: One of these bunks, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2110">I wasn't privileged yet, later I had some privileges. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2113">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="2114">And did you have bunkmates? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2117">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2118">So when they se -- decided to separate the women from the men, they designated the Dresner for the women. </sentence><sentence id="2119">That other cook went there, and with the women went girls of all ages, and boys under age 15. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2123">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2125">A: Those 15 and older stayed there, and they were assigned jobs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2127">Q: Stayed in Sudeten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2129">A: Everyone -- everyone had some job designated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2131">Q: So Sudeten is first, then Dresden is second? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2133">A: Then Dresner, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2135">Q: Is it Dresden or dres -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2136">A: Dresner. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2137">Q: Dresner. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2149">Q: He did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2151">A: He did. </sentence><sentence id="2152">But he stayed there, and when Dresner was full and another barracks was -- the kitchen to be set up, I went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2155">Q: So then who took over in Sudeten? </sentence><sentence id="2156">You -- you don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2159">A: I hope by that time people were already capable of running -- what was interesting, most of the so-called head chefs in those kitchens, were former butchers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2161">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2163">A: Although the -- no meat was handled. </sentence><sentence id="2164">Oh yes, when the horse died somewhere in the neighborhood, we got it in -- we got it -- we got -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2167">Q: You got in the meat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2169">A: We got the meat. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And if there was a butcher store originally, for the germ -- yeah -- I'm handling it too fast. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2173">Q: That's okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2175">A: We were isolated and walking from barracks to barracks or to the workplace, accompanied by gendarmes. </sentence><sentence id="2176">By June 1942, the last of these town inhabitants was evacuated by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2177">I don't know how they were accommodated, whether they found them, but that wasn't my problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2181">Q: Whe -- when -- when in 1942 did this happen? </sentence><sentence id="2182">Early? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2185">A: June. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2187">Q: June of 1942? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2189">A: June deg42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2191">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2193">A: And from then on, the gates of the barracks were open, and when you finished your job, your work, your assigned work, you could go with that family and move around without being accompanied or guarded. </sentence><sentence id="2194">So I went from barrack to barracks, and part of just preparing the kitchen, was also training people to -- to -- I did get information of what is in the -- in the warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="2195">And I got information how many people are already living there. </sentence><sentence id="2196">So based on that, I made use of supplies for individual barracks, and later on even a sophisticated menu, how many grams of what to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2201">Q: Really? </sentence><sentence id="2202">So how did you figure this out? </sentence><sentence id="2203">I mean, these are much larger populations than you were ever trained to feed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2207">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2208">I told you, there's one -- there were some women who were able to administer the kitchen, not just the butchers, and that [indecipherable] it's -- it's funny that there was no meat, but the butchers seemed to be the best administrators of a kitchen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2211">Q: Did -- w-were you the person who was in control of the amount of -- of whatever ingredients could be sent, whether it was flour, it was sugar, it would be sent to this barrack, or that barrack, or this kitchen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2213">A: That -- that started out this way. </sentence><sentence id="2214">Later there were people who were in business, food business, so I had stores at -- and groceries and -- and other related business. </sentence><sentence id="2215">They became -- they became the warehouse -- o-operating the warehouse, and this -- they didn't got the information, and without my interference or -- or participation, based on the initial set-up, delivered directly to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2219">Q: And were there equal rations given to each barrack, or were there different -- differences in the barracks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2221"> A Not in the barracks, the difference was -- and that was -- you know, the Council of Elders had very -- they were, so to say, the town administration. </sentence><sentence id="2222">They were actually a cabinet, there was a man designated for transportation and for labor and for health and for supply, and -- and other departments. </sentence><sentence id="2223">But they had very little room for initiative. </sentence><sentence id="2224">That was all based on strict rules set by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2225">However they, where possible, they applied their own decision making. </sentence><sentence id="2226">Like for instance for the children, and that was a little bit later, the -- a children's kitchen was -- was created, that had more of the food a growing child needs, because children were our future. </sentence><sentence id="2227">And they decided those who had hard labor assignments to get more food. </sentence><sentence id="2228">Of course, that was taken away from the general population, but the general population was so large, that the few privileged groups -- and it wasn't privileged, was rewarded appropriately, larger por -- rations. </sentence><sentence id="2229">But it did not impact tremendously. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2239">Q: You don't think it impacted the general population very much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2241">A: Not much was taken away from all the thousands of the regular population to feed the few -- to improve the ration of the children and the -- those who have hard -- performed hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="2242">So at -- this way I was hopping from one barrack to another, trying to get the most capable person to stay behind and run it, all while I was 18 - 18 and a half. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2245">Q: Did you feel -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2247">A: Important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2249">Q: -- important, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2251">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2253">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2255">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2256">I -- I don't think -- I liked to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2257">I felt good having a responsibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2261">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2263">A: Being trusted and so, yeah, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2265">Q: Did -- did you have contact with the Council of the el -- Elders, with Schliesser, after you got there? </sentence><sentence id="2266">Was there meet -- for instance, a meeting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2269">A: It -- it -- not -- really not, really not. </sentence><sentence id="2270">He had his jobs to do, and I did mine, and there was no -- he did -- except those, as I said, the instructions as to portion size for the kids, and then the decision to create a kit -- a children's kitchen and a diet kitchen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3388">A: How did it come about? </sentence><sentence id="3389">Now there is a -- a saying going around, and you must have heard it, that the Germans picked Theresienstadt as a town to show off with. </sentence><sentence id="3390">It wasn't that way. </sentence><sentence id="3391">I mentioned it among other things in their hometown, they had to turn in their musical instruments, and some didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3392">And some even had the chutzpah, people who will read this may know what that means, had the guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those instruments with i -- within those 110 pounds, instead of food and clothing, into Terezin, because they were so -- such ardent musicians, amateurs and professionals, who loved to play, and because everybody thought it's going to be over in six months. </sentence><sentence id="3393">I spoke about the optimism. </sentence><sentence id="3394">When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months. </sentence><sentence id="3395">So they played in attics, and in cellars, to stay in shape for when they come out, they should be in the same performance level as they came in. </sentence><sentence id="3396">And although there are no -- were no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped them, they found out. </sentence><sentence id="3397">And now a terrific fright and concern gripped everyone in the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few Germans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment. </sentence><sentence id="3398">So what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the transport, with -- and these people were marked, when they were in the transport, in Auschwitz they know who they are, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate side, punishing side, or the small fortress. </sentence><sentence id="3399">So nobody wanted to involve their wife, parents, children, siblings in such a punishment, so there was a big concern. </sentence><sentence id="3400">The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein told the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I'm paraphrasing, why would you punish these few people? </sentence><sentence id="3401">Look at the amount of talent you have accumulated here, why don't you think of a program where you can utilize them to show the world how well you treat the Jews? </sentence><sentence id="3402">That's when this idea came into being. </sentence><sentence id="3403">It was not a preconceived idea with the Germans before the ghetto was created. </sentence><sentence id="3404">So not only were these Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were brought in from Prague, and before they determined how they are going to do -- show the world how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification program in anticipation of that, and a free time activities department was created. </sentence><sentence id="3405">And in the frame of this orchestras -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from United States, so we had a five member -- what is it called? </sentence><sentence id="3406">Ghetto swingers. </sentence><sentence id="3407">Ghetto swingers jazz team. </sentence><sentence id="3408">Then there were the two musicians who played in the cafe. </sentence><sentence id="3409">One of them was my cousin, the accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one was a violinist. </sentence><sentence id="3410">And -- and other of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and not the Council of Elders could have imagined what's getting news there. </sentence><sentence id="3411">And not only music, there were theaters -- there were all the actors from -- from all these towns. </sentence><sentence id="3412">The theater, cabaret, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at the Germans, in Czech language. </sentence><sentence id="3413">Maybe some even in German, I don't know about those. </sentence><sentence id="3414">And this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the life that was destined for us. </sentence><sentence id="3415">There were lectures. </sentence><sentence id="3416">There were 1240 lectures on different subjects. </sentence><sentence id="3417">This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity -- free time activity list, by professors, chemists, biologists, rabbis. </sentence><sentence id="3418">Nobody went to the temple, but they went there to listen to the rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3419">And people who had no interest in chemistry and so, went to j -- just to get diversification, and -- and getting away from -- from this dread life of ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3420">By the way, they called -- you know, Terezin in German is Theresienstadt, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to Theresienbath, which is a Theresien spa. </sentence><sentence id="3421">I didn't say it when we were on the subject. </sentence><sentence id="3422">So it is an unbe -- there was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or anywhere else, in a day. </sentence><sentence id="3423">And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their sleeping time, because they were not really strong with the -- with the food they were getting, and I don't take blame for it. </sentence><sentence id="3424">I just did what was -- we had. </sentence><sentence id="3425">But it was -- it was unbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3465">Q: And was this -- when Schacter came in December and started those little choirs in the men's barrack, and then the women's barrack, was -- was that secret at that point, or that's -- that was okay at that point? </sentence><sentence id="3466">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3469">A: Again, there were no Germans in the barracks, and the gendarmes were out at -- outside at the gate, and this was happening in the cellar after work. </sentence><sentence id="3470">I don't think it was clandestine or illegal, it was just unofficial and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3473">Q: So that the permission that was gotten because Epstein said something to the Germans was to bring in the instruments? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3475">A: That was only after it was decided that that's a good idea, we'll take advantage of it, and we divide -- deci -- devise a program that will help them to project them to the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3477">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3479">A: But I don't understand, they had occupied all of Europe, America was across the Atlantic, why would they have to care to show a good report card with good behavior or good treatment of the Jews? </sentence><sentence id="3480">I -- that's what I was thinking about, who -- for whom did they need this? </sentence><sentence id="3481">They were the masters of the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3485">Q: And all of this cultural activity, and intellectual activity started in 1942 as far as you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3487">A: End of deg42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3489">Q: End of deg42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3491">A: End of deg42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3493">Q: Now did you -- besides -- if -- if you were rehearsing as much as -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3495">A: When you say that the -- that -- that [indecipherable] was happening before this okay by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3496">That was still not secret, but was not official. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3499">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="3500">And that was performed publicly before it was part of this other plan? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3503">A: That was performed in that cellar, and then it was performed in that auditorium of that boy's home that we circled there, next to the town's square. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3505">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="3506">Did you also go to performances of other groups, as well as being in rehearsals, or did you [indecipherable] too much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3509">A: I -- I did, but not too many, because I was -- I -- I f -- I went to cabarets because that was really important to -- you know, when you are -- when you are under the -- somebody's thumb, if you can play a trick on him, makes you happy. </sentence><sentence id="3510">So be -- being part of this -- this verbal dart throwing gave you even more an uplift than -- than -- than the singing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3514">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="3515">Really? </sentence><sentence id="3516">Did you -- did you go to lectures? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4109">Q: Do you have any idea how many people understood that if they could be protected, they would not be put in the transport? </sentence><sentence id="4110">You felt protected, insofar as -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4129">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4131">A: So then you would feel -- should feel bad, although they may be going in the next transport, but at that time you did something that -- it wasn't right. </sentence><sentence id="4132">When I speak in schools, I had a sixth grader ask me, "Do you feel guilty that you survived?" </sentence><sentence id="4133">And that's a heavy question for a sixth grader. </sentence><sentence id="4134">And I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="4135">I don't feel guilty, because I would fe -- I -- I fe -- I would feel guilty if 1 would have caused somebody else to die, but I don't feel guilty that I survived, I only feel sad for those who didn't. </sentence><sentence id="4136">And this -- that -- you get some of these tough questions from those kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4143">Q: Did you ever feel -- forget guilty, because clearly you didn't do something against anybody, right? </sentence><sentence id="4144">But there is a kind of -- I don't know whether I want to call it moral compromise one makes. </sentence><sentence id="4145">You can't be morally pure in a situation like that. </sentence><sentence id="4146">So the fact that you're protected always means that someone else is unprotected. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4194">Q: [inaudible]. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4210">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4212">A: And there was a shoe store and the clothes store, and I think I told you about it. </sentence><sentence id="4213">They put the -- the clothing that was in that warehouse was suddenly put out, put on coat -- a co -- coat hangars, and exposed and exhibited in that store, and the shoes, too. </sentence><sentence id="4214">And that was that -- the only benefit of that money. </sentence><sentence id="4215">You could buy for the -- get the money, because after three years, your shoes wear, and your clothes wear, you have not much to change. </sentence><sentence id="4216">So that was a benefit. </sentence><sentence id="4217">There was a grocery store, and they were selling there mustard and relish. </sentence><sentence id="4218">I don't know, the Germans must have had a -- a surplus of those two items. </sentence><sentence id="4219">But it was a good -- good to -- to vary a taste of your slice of bread that you got. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4228">Q: And who got the -- everybody get the money, or only a certain portion of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4230">A: Those who worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4232">Q: Those who worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4234">A: Those who worked. </sentence><sentence id="4235">And you [indecipherable] enough you could take a friend. </sentence><sentence id="4236">You paid for tickets for the -- for those performances. </sentence><sentence id="4237">And I don't know what else you could use your money for, the stores, the bank, the -- the [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4242">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4244">A: And you could buy a stamp, that you could send somebody in Prague, which they woos -- would use the stamp to send you a food package. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4246">Q: So you could receive food packages? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4248">A: You could get a food package. </sentence><sentence id="4249">There's no guarantee th -- that you get everything that's in the package. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4252">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4254">A: Some the Germans would steal, and some th -- take out, consider contraband. </sentence><sentence id="4255">And you know, if they send a loaf of bread it was cut open to see where there's anything inside that shouldn't be there. </sentence><sentence id="4256">Like in prisons. </sentence><sentence id="4257">And so -- and some was stolen by the people who worked in that Terezin Post Office, other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4258">That's the dark side of the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="4259">And so these were the few things I can remember the money was good for. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4266">Q: So if this starts in "43, all the preparations, is that when Schacter comes up with the idea of the Verdi Requiem? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4268">A: For some reason, in January deg43, the last transport was sent away, and here we are in July, and no transports since January. </sentence><sentence id="4269">I have no idea why. </sentence><sentence id="4270">Everybody was up and happy, that this is the end of deportations. </sentence><sentence id="4271">So he also had got the courage to start to implement what he was thinking the Requiem, knowing, or at least anticipating that this choir will stay together. </sentence><sentence id="4272">There was a huge uproar when he came up with that idea. </sentence><sentence id="4273">All the scholars and professors, and the -- and the bor -- the borders -- the -- the elder -- the -- the Council of Elders, they all protested for different reasons. </sentence><sentence id="4274">The -- the scholars and the rabbis, why would you as Jews in a Jewish ghetto perform a Catholic mass for the dead, when there are comparable works on Jewish themes? [ </sentence><sentence id="4275">indecipherable] and so, which cannot be performed in -- anywhere in occupied Europe, and this is the only place you could. </sentence><sentence id="4276">He did not give in to this. </sentence><sentence id="4277">He didn't say it openly because it was dangerous to say, but I know that he -- his mind was on being -- wanting to be able to sing to the Germans in Latin what he couldn't tell them in German to their face. </sentence><sentence id="4278">Like the -- the [indecipherable] the day of wrath, the [indecipherable] that it -- i-in this book, the names of all the sinners are inscribed, and none will escape the punishment. </sentence><sentence id="4279">So this -- there were about three or four such occasions. </sentence><sentence id="4280">And this is what drove him to get it out of him, and be able, even for distance, in the absentia, to tell the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4295">Q: You mean whether the Germans were there or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4297">A: Pardon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4299">Q: Wh -- you're saying whether the Germans were there or not to hear it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4301">A: No, yeah, they were not there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4303">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4305">A: And the Council of Elders thought, if the Germans find out the intentions behind this performance, that will really be dangerous for the singers and for him, and maybe even implications for the rest of the population. </sentence><sentence id="4306">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4309">Q: Ine -- I need to interrupt you, I'm sorry -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4324">A: Really upset. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4326">Q: -- upset if the Germans would find out. </sentence><sentence id="4327">Now, let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="4328">You said you know from Schacter what -- what he was really feeling. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4332">A: That was the driving thought behind -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4334">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4335">Yeah, is -- is that because you were rooming with him at this time, and you talked with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4338">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4339">This friend of mine, the lawyer, meanwhile was deported, and we found in a attic of a house in the a backyard of one of those private houses, that must have been a mother-in-law arrangement, and the stairs up to the attic, and with a carpenter connection again, we got a -- a little separation, and we had a room with privacy for the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="4340">And so I was pretty much informed about him, his lifestyle, his thoughts, and his determination. </sentence><sentence id="4341">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4346">Q: But let me ask you -- I -- I just want to know -- understand something. </sentence><sentence id="4347">You -- did you meet him separately from joining the choir, or only when you joined the choir? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4350">A: Through the choir -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4352">Q: Through [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4354">A: -- we met, and for -- for some reasons, including that I provided some more food for him, we Ca -- we came close. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4356">Q: You got together, I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4358">A: I still mention, I don't have any complexes that he would have found in me a -- a level companion, cause I was a young guy, and his circle were the musi -- social circle were the musicians, the composers, and he had other interests. </sentence><sentence id="4359">But we were very close, and very good, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4362">Q: And what was the difference in age between the two of you, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4364">A: He was born 1905, so it was about 19 years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4366">Q: That's a big difference, yes. </sentence><sentence id="4367">But you -- you spent a lot of time together, I gather? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4370">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4371">Not a -- not a lot. </sentence><sentence id="4372">We were both -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4376">Q: Busy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4378">A: -- during the day we were both working, and then -- he then became part of that free time department. </sentence><sentence id="4379">And I think his assignment, his job was working within this department so he didn't have to go somewhere to a -- I don't know stone quarry, or whatever he worked in in that. </sentence><sentence id="4380">So that was his day job. </sentence><sentence id="4381">And then in the evening, after everybody finished, they came for rehearsal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4386">Q: So did he tell you ver -- talk to you about wanting to do the Verdi Requiem? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4388">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4390">Q: And he told you what -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4392">A: And he said why, that we can't tell them in German, and I -- it's -- it's -- it has to come out, and this is one way I can get it out. </sentence><sentence id="4393">And when he was told about all the dangers, he told everyone in the choir, "It is assumed to be dangerous to you, to us, to the rest of the inmates here. </sentence><sentence id="4394">So if you don't want to be part of it, I don't feel bad if you leave." </sentence><sentence id="4395">Nobody left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4400">Q: And what did the council th-think about the danger, that -- that somehow the Nazis would discover his intention? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4402">A: That if they find out that he -- that the purpose of this was to tell them, you bastards, you going to get it at one point, that they will not appreciate it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4404">Q: But let me ask you something, when you read the words of the Verdi Requiem, it's als -- there's also words of forgive these people, whoever they are, who -- who, and the Requiem is speaking about both the wrath of God and begging for forgiveness, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4406">A: Yes, so this -- this part we ignored. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4408">Q: But you sang it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4410">A: And -- yeah, ignored as a -- as a thought -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4412">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4414">A: -- that propelled us to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4416">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4418">A: And in saying the -- the Libera me, was interpreted as set me free from here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4420">Q: So some of it was said for the Jews, and some of it was said against the -- the Nazis, as the interpretation, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4422">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4424">Q: When -- when you were rehearsing, did you feel this kind of emotion, that you -- wh- when -- just when you're rehearsing yourself -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4426">A: No, I just felt I'm part of a group that despises the Germans and the Nazis, and that this is the best we can do to get even with them within our capabilities. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4428">Q: What was the -- were the rehearsals more intense than when you did "The Bartered Bride," and "The Magic Flute," and "The Marriage of Figaro"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4430">A: It was, because it was a different language, and it was much more difficult music. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4432">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4434">A: And much more concentration was required. </sentence><sentence id="4435">And some people who didn't work in the kitchen, were not so well-fed to really dedicate themselves to such a -- that was a hard -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4438">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4440">A: -- work on a half empty stomach. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4442">Q: Yes, it's difficult singing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4444">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4445">So with the fact that there were no transports, he was encouraged that he"! </sentence><sentence id="4446">have an easy job, as easy as this can be. </sentence><sentence id="4447">Th -- am sure Toscanini would have never undertaken it with -- with well-fed people, to teach them without a score. </sentence><sentence id="4448">So it took six weeks -- we were six weeks into the rehearsal when the rumors sprung up the transports will resume. </sentence><sentence id="4449">So every time a transport is put together, people from different sectors are involved. </sentence><sentence id="4450">And so the choir members anticipated that some of them will definitely be included in the transport. </sentence><sentence id="4451">So they pushed him to make one performance for them, for their hard work, so they can enjoy performing it. </sentence><sentence id="4452">And he would not, because it wasn't up to his standards yet. </sentence><sentence id="4453">But then it became known that by September six, 5,000 people will be deported. </sentence><sentence id="4454">He couldn't resist, because he knew a lot of them will be in it, and he made a performance for them and their families and friends, not the 0 -- open, public sh -- performance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4466">Q: So this is September deg43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4468">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4470">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4472">A: And the irony with this, the sad irony, that these 5,000 people -- about -- he lost about half the choir, and these people went to Auschwitz and they came there, and they were treated differently than anybody else who came before them and after them. </sentence><sentence id="4473">They could retain their clothes, they could retain their luggage, and they went into a camp which was from then on called the family camp. </sentence><sentence id="4474">They lived together, not in privacy, but families were together. </sentence><sentence id="4475">And they were there for six months, and they were not working, they did not -- and this Freddie Hirsch, he took care of the kids, entertained them and taught them. </sentence><sentence id="4476">Als -- also made sport with them, and art, and he really took care of the kids. </sentence><sentence id="4477">And this group was held there while the Germans were negotiating with the allies in exchange of the German prisoners of war for these Jews, and also some war material. </sentence><sentence id="4478">They wanted some trucks, and -- and of course the allies wouldn't give the Germans another few thousand soldiers that will then turn against them, and trucks that they will use in the war against them. </sentence><sentence id="4479">So when the negotiations fell through, in one night, all of those who were still alive from the 5,000 went into the gas. </sentence><sentence id="4480">Was exactly three months -- six months later, on March eight. </sentence><sentence id="4481">And this is also -- on March seventh is the -- was Masaryks" birthday, President Masaryk, the first -- the creator of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="4482">So could be that had something to do with it, because they were -- they were planning the -- timing some things to coincide with some -- something that gives you a bigger -- a ce -- bor -- bigger pain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4495">Q: Was Schacter worried that he was going to be deported at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4497">A: No, hadn't -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4499">Q: No, because -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4501">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4503">Q: Was he protected in some way, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4505">A: Not that I knew, but those people who put together the transport list had some kind of directives whom to leave out, as long as it was possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4507">Q: And as far as you know, who was it who put together these transport lists? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4509">A: There was a department, it was called evidence. </sentence><sentence id="4510">Evidence is where all the files about every single one who came into Terezin was kept. </sentence><sentence id="4511">A card with a name, with a transport, date of birth, a transport when they came in, and -- and also the transporting date when they left Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="4512">I did after the war search, y -- my parents survived, in spite of Schliesser being sent to Auschwitz, and myself, my parents survived. </sentence><sentence id="4513">I thought the easiest thing would have been if he had written on top of the card -- of their card, do not deport it, initial it, that would have been the easiest. </sentence><sentence id="4514">I got copies of those cards, there's nothing there, and I was researching how he did it, because he must have done it, because it's inconceivable that two, old, useless people would stay there, especially before the Red Cross came, they deported a lot of old people, they wanted only -- they wanted the Red Cross only to see young, good looking people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4521">Q: Maybe there was a special section for cards, a different place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4523">A: So the -- the staff in that office -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4525">Q: Would do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4527">A: -- did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4529">Q: And was that then approved by the council, or did they just do it themselves? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4531">A: The head of the Council of Elders had to sign the transport list. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4533">Q: List. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4535">A: And then later we get to why he was -- and the whole Council of Elders was sent away. </sentence><sentence id="4536">He must have found out where they go, and what's happening, and their destination, and he refused to sign it. </sentence><sentence id="4537">He told the camp commander, you sign it. </sentence><sentence id="4538">So he, the camp commander, must have guessed that he knows what's happening, and didn't want the word to be spread among the inmates because a panic would be created. </sentence><sentence id="4539">So the whole council left. </sentence><sentence id="4540">But even though in September six, and the -- half the choir left, and they have -- they have -- he has recruited new people and started the whole thing from the beginning with them. </sentence><sentence id="4541">And he lost one more time, less people, and recruited new and started a third time with new people. </sentence><sentence id="4542">And then in January 44 was the first performance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4551">Q: With the new -- with the new group. </sentence><sentence id="4552">Did any of the soloists get deported -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4555">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4557">Q: -- or was it only among the choir? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4559">A: Maybe some. </sentence><sentence id="4560">I didn't know all of them -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4563">Q: [indecipherable] yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4565">A: -- but those [indecipherable] Schacter did not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4567">Q: Uh-huh, in -- in the Requiem group -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4569">A: Yeah, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4571">Q: -- the soloists did not get deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4573">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4575">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4577">A: And he had two for each part, should something happen to one, he has a replacement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4579">Q: Another person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4581">A: [indecipherable] good organi -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4583">Q: And when you did the September performance, September "43, before that first deportation, was that with a piano accompaniment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4585">A: Everything was only piano -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4587">Q: Only piano. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4589">A: All the time, only piano. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4591">Q: And did he -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4593">A: And when I listen now to a Requiem with a concert, and a -- the -- the trumpets and the drums, I said how -- it seemed to us like -- like absolutely perfect performance, just the piano. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4595">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4597">A: And a crappy piano on top of it. </sentence><sentence id="4598">How did they bring out all these -- these impressions, these results [indecipherable] of -- that the orchestra can provide. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4601">Q: And did he play the piano, or did he do the conducting and someone else played? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4603">A: No, bu -- there -- during the rehearsal he played the piano, and do -- and during -- in the performance, Gideon Klein played. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4605">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4607">A: They were very close together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4609">Q: And did Gideon kli -- Klein ever play at the rehearsals? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4611">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4613">Q: So it's a -- it's somewhat odd, however, to play only at a performance, and never at a rehearsal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4615">A: Gideon Klein had other work to do -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4617">Q: Yeah, well he's -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4619">A: -- he -- he was composing -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4621">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4623">A: -- and he was playing per -- giving performances. </sentence><sentence id="4624">Schacter, that's why I said he didn't tolerate any inattention, because everybody had to look at his eyes, and see when he gets the signal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4627">Q: Do you remember anything ever going wrong in the concerts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4629">A: Wrong? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4631">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4633">A: In the concert? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4635">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4637">A: I'm sure it did, but everybody was so grateful for it that -- that either they didn't notice, didn't want to notice, didn't make an impact on them, they were happy to -- to be part of it whether active or passive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4639">Q: Now, once you started giving performances, or Schacter is conducting the performances of the Requiem, starting in January deg44 -- January deg44, right? </sentence><sentence id="4640">You give about 14 or 15 -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4643">A: 15, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4645">Q: 15 performances. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4647">A: And each time with less singers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4649">Q: So you ne -- he never restarts again, he just accommodates? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4651">A: Only three times. </sentence><sentence id="4652">Only three times he started to -- with new people. </sentence><sentence id="4653">And then after the 15", he was left with 60 singers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4657">Q: Out of 150. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4659">A: And not the same amount in each voice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4661">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4663">A: So he didn't want it. </sentence><sentence id="4664">But then came the order from camp commander, that he wants a performance of the Requiem for high SS officials who came from Vienna and Prague, from Berlin, to shake the hands of the Red Cross people who were also invited -- no Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4667">Q: This is -- this is Rahm, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4669">A: Rahm, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4670">And you know they had to pay homage to the Red Cross [indecipherable] and so now, I didn't know -- he didn't want to do it with the -- with the regular choir, but it was an opportunity he was dreaming of. </sentence><sentence id="4671">Not only can he sing it to them for distance, but he has them right in front of him, they are sitting there, and he can really tell them. </sentence><sentence id="4672">And the paradox again is, that we all thought -- we told him, and the Germans were the only ones who knew that we were actually singing our own Requiem. </sentence><sentence id="4673">You know, they knew where we will end up. </sentence><sentence id="4674">They didn't think that there would be some survivors. </sentence><sentence id="4675">So that was a mutual giving it to each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4683">Q: And the Germans knew what was being sung, because they knew the Catholic liturgy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4685">A: I think -- I'm sure, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4686">But I think they -- they thought it's a -- it's a musical performance, and -- but they also understood the meaning of it, and what's going to happen with us, that this is -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4689">Q: Your own Requiem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4691">A: Our own eulogy. </sentence><sentence id="4692">The -- when this Red Cross came, I couldn't understand that they accept the German conditions that they will not interview people at random on the street, only special auditioned people that the Germans prepared to meet them. </sentence><sentence id="4693">And they knew that they're saying lies, but it was again against the threat of the whole family being endangered if they refuse. </sentence><sentence id="4694">So they did it. </sentence><sentence id="4695">But I don't -- still don't understand, if you were psychologist, rather than philosophy doctor, I would ask you, how is it possible to audition, and indoctrinate little kids to the same performance? </sentence><sentence id="4696">When they came to the playground, and there were some kids who never been on a playground because they were not allowed at home to go, the little ones. </sentence><sentence id="4697">When they came for the chocolate bar that was on the table in front of the playground, the only one uniform was Rahm, and they had to address him uncle, and they, "Uncle Rahm, again chocolate?" </sentence><sentence id="4698">As if they were already fed up with chocolate, and there were some kids who never knew what chocolate was because it wasn't on their ration tickets at home. </sentence><sentence id="4699">This I don't understand, how they got the kids to do that. </sentence><sentence id="4700">Maybe they told them you're going to play a theater or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4701">But this were tough for me to understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4713">Q: Did you see that? </sentence><sentence id="4714">Were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4717">A: No, not -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4719">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4721">A: -- not, I didn't -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4723">Q: Were you told that at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4725">A: Yeah, yeah, by the -- the -- those who were in charge of the kids. </sentence><sentence id="4726">And the agriculture workers, and my wife among them, dressed in shorts, and nice blouse, marching by with the rake, or the -- the -- the spade over the shoulder, singing happy songs going to work. </sentence><sentence id="4727">And the orchestra was playing in that pavilion on the -- on the sta -- on the town square. </sentence><sentence id="4728">It was a real happy town. </sentence><sentence id="4729">This doesn't belong to my li -- yeah, I hear the party. </sentence><sentence id="4730">After the war, in -- in Newton was a Harvard philosophy psychology professor who researched to write a book about the Red Cross, International Red Cross at that time, what they should have done and didn't do, and they shouldn't have done and did do. </sentence><sentence id="4731">And he was researching it, and I knew about it because I was translating his papers that he brought from Germany, from Austria, even the French. </sentence><sentence id="4732">And at one point he told me he had an appointment with the then president of the International Red Cross, Dr. Rossler. </sentence><sentence id="4733">In his office, in his factory -- he had aluminum, a huge aluminum factory in Switzerland, and he came there, and the secretary says, "Oh, Dr. Rossler called, he apologizes, he'll be an hour, hour and a half late from another appointment. </sentence><sentence id="4734">Make yourself comfortable in the library." </sentence><sentence id="4735">Brought in cup of coffee, said [indecipherable] whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4736">And he perused -- and he found documents that he had branch factories in Austria and in Germany where he used prisoners from concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="4737">So how much was his enthusiasm to confront Germans, the Nazis? </sentence><sentence id="4738">Speaks for itself. </sentence><sentence id="4739">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4756">Q: Were you supposed to be interviewed by anybody during this time? </sentence><sentence id="4757">Where -- where were you when they were visiting, did you see them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4760">A: I -- I was just doing my work, I was not -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4762">Q: Are you surprised that nobody said anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4764">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4766">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="4767">You think that fear was -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4770">A: And I'm sorry they didn't, but some single guy who didn't have a family could have spilled the beans, but it wouldn't have helped, because this was called the International Red Cross, but the seven directors all were Swiss. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4772">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4774">A: There was no internationality in that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4776">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4778">A: And so it was very well done, like a real Potemkin village, that the Germans orchestrated. </sentence><sentence id="4779">Before that cross -- Red Cross came I mentioned the old people -- a lot of old -- thousands of old people were deported, and after that, it must have been under the influence of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto that the Germans did not want it to happen in other ghettos as well, so all able bodied people who were not necessary for the war industry, and like agriculture for where they produced for the Germans, and those who were necessary to maintain the functioning of the town, of the ghetto as such, the physical functioning, were all deported, and Schliesser was gone, and I was among -- the kitchens were running, so I was no I-longer needed. </sentence><sentence id="4780">So that was end of September deg44. </sentence><sentence id="4781">I went and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4787">Q: Let me -- let me -- let me hold it for one second. </sentence><sentence id="4788">This performance for the Germans, was it Germans sitting in the front row? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4791">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4793">Q: And you can see them, and who -- do you see Eichmann. </sentence><sentence id="4794">Is he there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4797">A: I didn't know Eichmann -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4799">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4801">A: -- | -- he -- he jus -- it is said that he was there, but -- and it -- we often heard Eichmann is in Terezin, transports will go. </sentence><sentence id="4802">They knew that he was in charge of transports. </sentence><sentence id="4803">But I never saw him face to face, so I wouldn't have recognized him among that group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4807">Q: Now, I know that you reported -- you reported in octo -- October one of 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4809">A: October oneth, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4811">Q: So then [indecipherable] what happens between September -- the perfor -- the -- wait a second, June -- I'm sorry, June of "44 and October? </sentence><sentence id="4812">Does Schacter keep you folks singing? </sentence><sentence id="4813">There's a few months there after -- after the Red Cross visit, or is he deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4817">A: He was deported after me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4819">Q: After you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4821">A: I didn't know -- when I left -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4823">Q: I see, he was still there -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4825">A: -- he was still there, and I didn't know or think that he will be also deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4827">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="4828">So does the choir -- does he keep working with people? </sentence><sentence id="4829">Do you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4833">A: We -- we went -- after the Red Cross visit, we still did -- we perfor -- we performed, and that was not much of a choir required, Pergolesi's "La Serva Padrone", it was mainly soloists and a small choir, but -- and we were doing mainly get-togethers with anyone who wanted could come and -- and listen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4835">Q: So it became much more informal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4837">A: Yeah, informal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4839">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="4840">Did you end up learning music? </sentence><sentence id="4841">Could you read music by this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4845">A: No, but Schacter taught me. </sentence><sentence id="4846">He started to teach me to play the piano, then I started to read music. </sentence><sentence id="4847">And unfortunately, it didn't go for very long, and after the war I had no chance to resume. </sentence><sentence id="4848">I had to work to maintain my parents and myself because we had nothing except what they had left from the 110 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="4849">I had nothing, coming from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="4850">So there was never an opportunity for me to break and study music. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4857">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="4858">We have to turn -- change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4866">A: It was before that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4868">Q: And so they were deported before the performance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4870">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4872">Q: Was that also surprising to you that that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4874">A: We found out that -- why it happened, I don't know that -- how -- how it became known, but we found out in the -- on the street that the Germans were [indecipherable] for this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4876">Q: Right, for the sort of undercover -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4878">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4880">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4881">Now, you said that Schacter was a very sweet guy when he wasn't being a conductor, but once he was going to be serious about his music, he was a tyrant. </sentence><sentence id="4882">Was he also charismatic? </sentence><sentence id="4883">Was he also a very compelling person, or was he just very strict when he was doing his -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4888">A: While we were working? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4890">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4892">A: I don't know what do you mean by charismatic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4894">Q: Well, we -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4896">A: He just was -- he demanded full attention, there was -- there was nothing else but rehearsing, and if you wanted to be with him, you had to pay full attention. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4898">Q: I think what I mean is, obviously people wanted to be with him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4900">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4902">Q: It wasn't just the music, because you could have somebody in front of you who is conducting, who you didn't want to be with, right? </sentence><sentence id="4903">I mean, the music alone wouldn't necessarily be enough if someone wasn't interesting, or taught you well. </sentence><sentence id="4904">I mean, he had to have something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4908">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4910">Q: When he was teaching you piano, was he easier on you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4914">Q: He was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4916">A: This wa -- yeah, well this was -- he was not aiming to make me acam -- academy member, but he was starting to teach me music. </sentence><sentence id="4917">Whether it was the relationship that he was easier, but he did not have a -- I don't think he set a goal for himself where I should be at what time -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4920">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4922">A: -- with my piano knowledge, but [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4924">Q: Now didn't he also give some recitals, piano recitals, or did he accompany people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4926">A: I think he did accompany some. </sentence><sentence id="4927">Not very often, but I don't think he gave recitals -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4930">Q: Did he compose? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4932">A: -- because there were better pianists than he was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4934">Q: Uh-huh, than him, uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="4935">And was he a composer also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4938">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4940">Q: So he was primarily a conductor, yes. </sentence><sentence id="4941">Did he ever conduct some of the work of the composers who were working in Terezin, Olan, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5917">A: That kind of material. </sentence><sentence id="5918">It did not insulate me any more from the cold, but it didn't hurt like the -- that shoe. </sentence><sentence id="5919">But early in the morning on the third day I felt -- I -- I will be one of those shot on the road. </sentence><sentence id="5920">I am weak, tired, tough trying to drag my feet. </sentence><sentence id="5921">And the kids were in -- in fairly good shape, because I mentioned the smaller ones and skinny one tolerated it better. </sentence><sentence id="5922">So I said, if I stay here, I get shot. </sentence><sentence id="5923">I try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="5924">Whatever chance I have, I will take it. </sentence><sentence id="5925">If it's 10 percent, I'll take 10 percent of success to escape. </sentence><sentence id="5926">And so I told them, stay together and help each other if you need to, and I can't any more, and I have no use to you anyway. </sentence><sentence id="5927">So we come to a forest, tall forest on both sides of the road, no moon, real dark. </sentence><sentence id="5928">So that was the moment. </sentence><sentence id="5929">I slipped to -- into the ditch on the side of the road. </sentence><sentence id="5930">I don't know why I didn't encourage the kids to do it too, but I felt 1 don't want to be responsible in case -- you know, to suggest something where they may suffer. </sentence><sentence id="5931">And I laid down in the snow, face down. </sentence><sentence id="5932">And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me. </sentence><sentence id="5933">And whether it was the dark, or whether it was frozen fingers, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="5934">He shot me under the arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib. </sentence><sentence id="5935">And the snow -- the -- the blood was color -- starting to color the snow, and that was good, because nobody else attempted a second shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly had strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people, other prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot. </sentence><sentence id="5936">So we huddled together and used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in January in the forest with this -- just a cotton uniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other. </sentence><sentence id="5937">And in the morning we went to the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign where we are, what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="5938">And we see the top of the hill another camp. </sentence><sentence id="5939">The gate is open, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out. </sentence><sentence id="5940">So inside the forest we ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we asked one of the prisoners, "Well what -- well what is this?" </sentence><sentence id="5941">He said, "I don't know, but before dawn, all the Germans jumped into car -- into the trucks and took off." </sentence><sentence id="5942">Didn't even take the time to liquidate the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades. </sentence><sentence id="5943">So what really happened, in that area, a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German front. </sentence><sentence id="5944">And of course they didn't want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the trucks and left in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="5945">We -- I went into the camp, and saw guys from our camp. </sentence><sentence id="5946">I said, "Where were you located?" </sentence><sentence id="5947">Sort of the last block, because that was the last group that arrived there. </sentence><sentence id="5948">And I found the two kids there, and we started to look for food, but we didn't find any, because those who were there already, they plundered the -- the -- the potato storage, and all -- all other storages. </sentence><sentence id="5949">But somebody told us there's, on the side the road, is a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS, and there's food in their pantries. </sentence><sentence id="5950">So we went there, not far, and there's food. </sentence><sentence id="5951">Everything except bread. </sentence><sentence id="5952">They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran. </sentence><sentence id="5953">The speed at which they ran wa -- showed itself. </sentence><sentence id="5954">That was unfinished food, even unfinished food on the table, and the rest was burned in the oven, or on top of the range. </sentence><sentence id="5955">So we had food, and there was no -- at that time there was no refrigeration in Europe [indecipherable] I don't know, a few people may have had a refrigerator, and -- we want to break -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6041">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6043">A: We stopped in that village, and I mentioned there were no refrigerators used. </sentence><sentence id="6044">If this is a kosher tape I can't mention it. </sentence><sentence id="6045">People were -- had all kinds of preservation methods of food without refrigerator. </sentence><sentence id="6046">So the first thing I found was a -- like a gallon jug glass jar, with roasted pork, covered with rendered lard, which prevents the -- the oxygen reaching the meat, and the meat therefore, does not spoil. </sentence><sentence id="6047">And after months of Auschwitz diet, and three days absolutely nothing, I dug into that lard, and ate it like that. </sentence><sentence id="6048">No bread, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="6049">And I still don't understand that this didn't kill me faster than -- than the Auschwitz diet. </sentence><sentence id="6050">But it had a effec -- had it's effects. </sentence><sentence id="6051">This was a huge place, the -- that camp was called Blechhammer, and it was part of a huge industrial complex. </sentence><sentence id="6052">All the camp inmates were working in it -- of forced laborers from occupied countries were there, and POW's were also there, and were working. </sentence><sentence id="6053">We found the camp of the British prisoners of war, and for some reason -- they were bombing London, but for some reason they were treating the British POW's very well. </sentence><sentence id="6054">We found in that barrack warm uniforms, boots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of toilet paper, which saved us from result of the way we were eating. </sentence><sentence id="6055">There were 10 of us in -- in one of those barracks, there were two toilets, one on each end, and that wasn't enough. </sentence><sentence id="6056">So they brought from the village, I don't know, somewhere, a huge half barrel, like a big whiskey barrel. </sentence><sentence id="6057">I put two boards across so four could sit at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="6058">That bad it was. </sentence><sentence id="6059">I started to improvise cooking, and one guy was helping me, and eight did -- the rest of the 10, the eight went to town to bring supplies. </sentence><sentence id="6060">The one kid I mentioned was working the carpentry shop in Terezin, he made a sled so more stuff could be brought. </sentence><sentence id="6061">And there's one point he brought the whole - - took out from one of those houses a kitchen stove, including the pipes. </sentence><sentence id="6062">He installed it, and then we were really cooking. </sentence><sentence id="6063">The Russian soldiers came to eat, to us, because they didn't get food like that. </sentence><sentence id="6064">It was another compliment for the aunt. </sentence><sentence id="6065">And we're cooking till 10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn't a bite to be had. </sentence><sentence id="6066">That's how we ate. </sentence><sentence id="6067">No -- no control. </sentence><sentence id="6068">And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism is, everybody is even, and it's the best system, until a Jewish officer came, a Russian Jewish officer, said, "Don't believe a word." </sentence><sentence id="6069">We were thinking of Communism, because that's a -- was presented to us as a real equal society, a society of equal people. </sentence><sentence id="6070">But he set us straight. </sentence><sentence id="6071">We were six weeks in that British barracks, because between where we were, and our home, they were still fighting. </sentence><sentence id="6072">You know, from the east front, we were here, and Prague was here, and the Russians were only getting there. </sentence><sentence id="6073">So for six weeks we suffered terrible diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="6074">And in spite of it, I gained 79 pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking. </sentence><sentence id="6075">I said -- what's her name, I fi -- know this -- this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have gone crazy if she heard that somebody gained 79 pounds in six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="6076">And everybody -- after six weeks we moved out of there, and went to Katowice -- here come friend of the spelling. </sentence><sentence id="6077">And they put us up in the schoolhouse where or -- other -- other form of prisoners were. </sentence><sentence id="6078">And the Polish Red Cross gave us identification papers based on what we told them, because we didn't have anything to show. </sentence><sentence id="6079">But we needed something because we were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don't know how long we were there. </sentence><sentence id="6080">One of the tenant was a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some money. </sentence><sentence id="6081">And next day he comes and says, "Come with me, they need a cook in the employees cafeteria, in the manager's restaurant." </sentence><sentence id="6082">I have absolutely no recollection that I worked there, until I read one of the two kids memoirs, where he names the factory. </sentence><sentence id="6083">So the name immediately sprang up, and I knew I know it. </sentence><sentence id="6084">But even with that knowledge, I could not remember that I worked there. </sentence><sentence id="6085">But I must have, because they all told me, and I brought food to the school for them. </sentence><sentence id="6086">So -- and I don" know how long we were there. </sentence><sentence id="6087">Somehow time is not very noticeable, if you don't have a calendar, you don't have a routine, and that responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="6088">Okay, and then we picked ourselves up and went home by means of freight trains, military trucks, horse-drawn carriages, walking. </sentence><sentence id="6089">We were already strengthened -- strong by that time. </sentence><sentence id="6090">The day we moved out from that British barrack, the diarrhea stopped like immediately. </sentence><sentence id="6091">And our digestive systems started to work normally, cause we didn't eat like pigs any more. </sentence><sentence id="6092">Oh, there was a -- and one story, and it's a funny story, one of the guys came and said down a little past the village is a pig farm, and a lot of pigs there, and nobody's watching them, feeding them. </sentence><sentence id="6093">So I found some -- a little hammer and a piece of rope, and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig with the sled. </sentence><sentence id="6094">And I go there, and there were lots of pigs running around, and they were in the building. </sentence><sentence id="6095">So I found one, tied a rope to his hind leg, and tied the rope to the -- to that column, the supporting column, and hit him on the head, that's how you kill pigs. </sentence><sentence id="6096">But the hammer was small, and I was not strong enough yet, and when you hit them here, it swells up and you can never break his skull any more. </sentence><sentence id="6097">So it was screaming there, and suddenly we hear machine gun fire. </sentence><sentence id="6098">I -- oh my God, the Germans are back. </sentence><sentence id="6099">So we look out, and on top of that farm, a Russian column, military column pass by, and one was shooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as they ro -- drove by. </sentence><sentence id="6100">And the guy sees me with a knife, and commandeered me to about 12 or 13 pigs to eviscerate them. </sentence><sentence id="6101">They want -- he want only the meat, not the innard. </sentence><sentence id="6102">So I did that, and I said, "Now I worked for you, now you come and shoot my pig." </sentence><sentence id="6103">And one of those wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [indecipherable] soldier. </sentence><sentence id="6104">So we had one and a half pig, and a innards from a liver, and the organs from 12 more pigs. </sentence><sentence id="6105">I don't even know how we brought it all on that sled. </sentence><sentence id="6106">We were rendering the lard till 10 at night. </sentence><sentence id="6107">And there was no worry about refrigeration, it was cold enough. </sentence><sentence id="6108">So that -- we consumed all that -- I'm sorry -- okay, we started on our way home from Katowice, and we had to go -- I told you all the means we went, but I have to turn around to tell you -- to give you the direction. </sentence><sentence id="6109">We were here, in Katowice. </sentence><sentence id="6110">We went to the Ukraine, to Romania, to Hungary, Austria and Prague. </sentence></p></dialogue>
