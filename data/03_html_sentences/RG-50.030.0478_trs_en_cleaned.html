starting to color the snow, and that was good, because nobody else attempted a second shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly had strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people, other prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot. </sentence><sentence id="6481">So we huddled together and used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in January in the forest with this -- just a cotton uniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other. </sentence><sentence id="6482">And in the morning we went to the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign where we are, what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="6483">And we see the top of the hill another camp. </sentence><sentence id="6484">The gate is open, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out. </sentence><sentence id="6485">So inside the forest we ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we asked one of the prisoners, "Well what -- well what is this?" </sentence><sentence id="6486">He said, "I don't know, but before dawn, all the Germans jumped into car -- into the trucks and took off." </sentence><sentence id="6487">Didn't even take the time to liquidate the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades. </sentence><sentence
