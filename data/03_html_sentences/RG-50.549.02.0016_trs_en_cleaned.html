<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: I'd like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall reading something about liberation day and you were in a town in France where they were -- German soldiers were being led through town? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Do you remember what you were feeling that particular day, after -- after so many years on the run and so much uncertainty? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Well, it -- it -- it -- it was -- there was elation. </sentence><sentence id="180">There was jubil -- jubilant attitudes, you know. </sentence><sentence id="181">In the streets it was festive, carnival-type. </sentence><sentence id="182">And people were rejoicing that -- that -- to see that the Germans had been defeated because the atrocities -- in fact, I write that in the book, down the street, th-they were -- they were carrying placards, "Remember </sentence></p><p><sentence id="183"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 7 Orodure", that's the town that they burned down, you know. </sentence><sentence id="184">Euphoria, that's the word. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="185">Wh -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="187">You -- you were feeling euphoric, yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="189">The mood was euphoric. </sentence><sentence id="190">And then with it came a sobering moment, mixed in with that euphoria. </sentence><sentence id="191">That while the war is finished, there are families somewhere from whom we hadn't heard. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, to us this was the beginning of a new chapter of finding out and searching. </sentence><sentence id="193">And being here dealing with things. </sentence><sentence id="194">When Paris was liberated, in "44 - - in August "44, we knew that Germany was not defeated yet. </sentence><sentence id="195">In fact, that same year, in the -- in the fall, came the Battle of the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="196">And in that counter attack by the Germans, they advanced far enough for Paris to feel that there might be another -- a re-occupation. </sentence><sentence id="197">That never happened. </sentence><sentence id="198">The allies -- allies prevailed. </sentence><sentence id="199">But that was that moment. </sentence><sentence id="200">Germans were still kicking -- alive and kicking. </sentence><sentence id="201">And when the landing took place in "44, during that period, in June of "44, the deportations from southern France, from Vichy, France towards Drancy and Auschwitz were still going on. </sentence><sentence id="202">So even that euphoric moo-mood, about the landings, had to be tempered with -- with the knowledge that people are still being sent away. </sentence><sentence id="203">But then when -- when -- in 1945, in May of "45, the armistice was signed, there was a different attitude. </sentence><sentence id="204">Now, we knew that the war was ended and we had to deal with the aftermath. </sentence><sentence id="205">For many of us, that had to do with family, because we had left our families and loved ones and some of it -- some of them left with their families, but in the process of fleeing, of going to France and living on the Vichy, some of those fa-families had been separated. </sentence><sentence id="206">Young men were hiding out while their parents were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 8 deported. </sentence><sentence id="207">That happened quite often, you saw that in the movies with -- with "Au revoir mes enfants" and you had so many other things and -- and so in Freedman in the wrote -- the wro -- who wrote that book, "When Memory Comes", he was taken to a convent and his parents were deported and never came back. </sentence><sentence id="208">And finally he got back to his Judaism, because he -- he was converted by the padres and -- no, bu -- bu -- no, he went to a -- not to a con -- he went to a monastery, I think. </sentence><sentence id="209">So anyway, we all had to deal with these things and knowing that the war was over was very good, but there was the family's story and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it was the great uncertainty, who had survived and who had not survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: And how did you go about beginning to deal with it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: I tried to start searches. </sentence><sentence id="236">Red Cross and other venues and did actually not find out until 1962 what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="237">That was from "47 to "62, 15 years -- what happened to my mother and sisters, which is also in -- in the book. </sentence><sentence id="238">And how I dealt at the moment? </sentence><sentence id="239">At that moment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years old, I had survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="240">I had received my papers to come to America. </sentence><sentence id="241">And frankly I was looking forward to getting away from the continent there. </sentence><sentence id="242">It had not been too kind to me, to say the least and of course, France, beautiful country. </sentence><sentence id="243">Countries are always beautiful, it's what the people do that's not so good, often, you know. </sentence><sentence id="244">But France to me was -- was a country that I wanted already to get away from because I had been in jail and I had been deported and I had been beaten up and so on. </sentence><sentence id="245">I -- I looked forward to coming to America, wh-where I knew I had family USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 9 and start a new life. </sentence><sentence id="246">And that's what I was dealing with. </sentence><sentence id="247">I did not dwell too much on the fact that I better stay in Europe and try to find my mother and sisters, because I had reached out to Red Cross and other agencies and I never heard anything. </sentence><sentence id="248">And of course at that time, the communication system had not developed to the point where you knew who had survived, who had not survived. </sentence><sentence id="249">So I -- I wanted to be just getting away from there and I knew that staying there wouldn't advance anything from me emotionally, because I'd only be still under the -- the impact of what happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="250">And I looked forward to make a break. </sentence><sentence id="251">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="252">I came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="253">I did not dwell too much on the sentimentality. [ </sentence><sentence id="254">indecipherable] stay here and -- and -- and -- and - - and f -- and fight it to the end, because the continent was no longer for me, you see? </sentence><sentence id="255">I wanted to get away from it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: How did you support yourself? </sentence><sentence id="279">You were a young man and for those two years before you came to America? </sentence></p></dialogue>
