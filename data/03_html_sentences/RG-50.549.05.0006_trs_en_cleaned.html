<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: In France? </sentence><sentence id="83">They came very, not in force. </sentence><sentence id="84">They came very, very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="85">The reason, I think, they got the whole thing so easy is because the French people are very anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="86">So, for them 3 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 4 to give the address or to reveal where the Jew were living, it was not a problem. </sentence><sentence id="87">And I don't mean to say all of them, because a lot of police... we did have a neighbor, across from our apartment, who was from the police. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I even remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="89">His name was Mr.Reddler (ph). </sentence><sentence id="90">And every time something did happen, he came in our door, knock on the door and said, "Be careful. </sentence><sentence id="91">They're going to do this, they're going to do this." </sentence><sentence id="92">So, I don't mean to say all the Frenchmen, but I said at least the majority of the French people were anti-Semitic. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: It's okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: It's the, my feeling...

I say this the other day to a black guy. </sentence><sentence id="129">He was very surprised. </sentence><sentence id="130">And coming from me, I think it was not a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="131">But I said, "I think you're very lucky, your grand-grandparent was brought in United State. </sentence><sentence id="132">At least now you can drive a car. </sentence><sentence id="133">You can have a nice home, instead of being in Africa where you'd be starving. </sentence><sentence id="134">You wouldn't have any clothes to put on your back and anybody can kill you. </sentence><sentence id="135">And this for me is racism. </sentence><sentence id="136">Here racism is not this. </sentence><sentence id="137">They are not racist, so I don't understand why you call yourself African-American. </sentence><sentence id="138">You are American from two, three or four generations. </sentence><sentence id="139">And it's not because your parents were slave." </sentence><sentence id="140">And when you know the story about the slave, it's not the American who took the black people. </sentence><sentence id="141">It's the chief of the village, who give black people to the American. </sentence><sentence id="142">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: What kind of response did you get? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Most of the time they said, "Well it's a way of things. </sentence><sentence id="166">You have a different way of speaking." </sentence><sentence id="167">And I said, "You know, I, as a Jewish person cannot be a racist. </sentence><sentence id="168">So, if I tell you this, it's because coming from another country, I'm surprised the way you deal with your slave story. </sentence><sentence id="169">You feel sorry for yourself, but you're so lucky to be in a country where you have freedom and you can live like any other person. </sentence><sentence id="170">You're Black? </sentence><sentence id="171">Sure it's, you can see a black man, but sometimes you can recognize a Jewish boy and so it's nothing worse to be Black or to be Jew, but I don't want to fight the country for this." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: You don't think that Jews can be racist, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="181"> 4    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 5 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="183">Oh yeah, oh yeah, Jewish people can be very, very racist. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I saw this on many different occasion. </sentence><sentence id="185">But it's not the same kind of racism they have. </sentence><sentence id="186">It's a... I don't know any Jew belonging to the KKK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: They wouldn't probably accept them. [ </sentence><sentence id="193">Laughing] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Absolutely, so I don't think... but it's, it make a... Man is man, woman is woman, people are people. </sentence><sentence id="197">And you can find people, different idea of people, different approach of life and so I think, yes, it can be a lot of, some Jewish people can be racist. </sentence><sentence id="198">It doesn't make a... but before we have to define: what do they mean by being racist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: What do you think that means? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Well, racism is something, it's hate with no reason. </sentence><sentence id="205">You like some people, you like some people living in this country. </sentence><sentence id="206">You like some people living in another country. </sentence><sentence id="207">You don't like people the way they live, this can be racism. </sentence><sentence id="208">But basically, it's not racism, it's something, because you don't like their way of laughing. </sentence><sentence id="209">Black people are very exuberant and maybe some American don't like this and this can be a form of racism. </sentence><sentence id="210">And like I said before, Jewish people living in America are much more American than they are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="211">And because of this, they can be racist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: I don't understand that last. </sentence><sentence id="221">Because they're Jewish people living in America, they can be racist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Because they feel very safe in this country. </sentence><sentence id="225">And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish by tradition, but they belong to a minority. </sentence><sentence id="226">And if you are in France or in United State or any country in the world, you still are minority. </sentence><sentence id="227">But it is so comfortable in United State, then Jewish people forget the background and say, "But I'm an American." </sentence><sentence id="228">And I say, "No, first you are Jew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they're going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not because you're an American." </sentence><sentence id="229">And this is the big problem and they lose the identity of being Jewish, just because they feel so comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="230">They feel, /t's my country. </sentence><sentence id="231">Yes it is, in one way. </sentence><sentence id="232">But until, and you can see this on TV, this young man, who been speaking about racism against black, Jew, all the Jew have the power in the bank. </sentence><sentence id="233">It's not true, but in his mind it is. </sentence><sentence id="234">And he killed people and he killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="235">You saw this on TV two or three days ago. </sentence><sentence id="236">This is the big problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Let's go back a little bit to, you were just telling me before about your experience as a child in Paris and the anti-Semitism that you experienced. </sentence><sentence id="251">Did you have, were all of your friends Jewish at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: At the time I didn't have a lot of friends, because I was, I did a big selection. </sentence><sentence id="255">I'm not the kind of man who have a lot of friends. </sentence><sentence id="256">And yes, at the time all my friends, at the time were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="257">The reason is, I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="258">And again, I don't speak about religion. </sentence><sentence id="259">I speak about tradition. </sentence><sentence id="260">Going to a Jewish restaurant once in a while, it's fun and it remind me memory. </sentence><sentence id="261">Watching a movie with Jewish song, it's fun. </sentence><sentence id="262">I've been married twice with non-Jewish woman and I was missing this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or word. </sentence><sentence id="263">Even in New York, when I go to New York, people speak a lot of Jewish word and it's always funny. </sentence><sentence id="264">And I always say, "Are you Jewish?" " </sentence><sentence id="265">No, but we use a lot of Jewish word here 5   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 6 in New York," but they are not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="266">But it's funny, I like it, because it's something... So when I was in France, I didn't want to have non-Jewish friend because I would never know if the same guy is not going to give me a knife when the time comes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: You really felt that at a very early age? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Oh yes, oh yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Did you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Well, my brother came back from the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="288">The only reason I left France to come in the United State, I decided to come here in 1983, is because I didn't feel comfortable in France. </sentence><sentence id="289">Because up to this date, you have this anti-Semitism in France. </sentence><sentence id="290">My brother, who is seventy-six or seventy-eight, doesn't feel it. </sentence><sentence id="291">He said, "No, this is in your mind." </sentence><sentence id="292">And he is married with a non-Jew woman. </sentence><sentence id="293">She is wonderful woman, but I don't feel comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="294">I...France is a beautiful country. </sentence><sentence id="295">I like to go on vacation, but I couldn't live there anymore, because of all this background. </sentence><sentence id="296">I've never been comfortable in France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Did your family speak Yiddish at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Yes, all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Do you still speak Yiddish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Yes, uh huh. </sentence><sentence id="315">I don't find a lot of people I can speak Yiddish with, because most of the Jewish people here, don't speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="316">But my grandson, which is the son of my daughter, and my daughter doesn't follow the religion. </sentence><sentence id="317">But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the difference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said, "But sometime they are racist between..." And I said, "Yes, I know." </sentence><sentence id="318">I think if you put two men with no religion on an island, there's going to be racism, because man is stupid. </sentence><sentence id="319">They want to fight. </sentence><sentence id="320">They want to fight for a reason. </sentence><sentence id="321">The reason is religion. </sentence><sentence id="322">And they are going to fight about God, it's my God, it's not your God. </sentence><sentence id="323">God is God. </sentence><sentence id="324">Your God is my God. </sentence><sentence id="325">There is only one God. </sentence><sentence id="326">But we don't want this, this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="437">Q: Did you and your family have any contact with your brothers while they were in Drancy? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2532">A: Not specifically, because I think I knew my mother since a long time, since I was very little, I mean when I was eight, nine years old, we did have very serious question to ask to each other. </sentence><sentence id="2533">And I think basically we didn't, I didn't have, she didn't have any secret from me, so I was not surprised and not shocked to see what she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="2534">And she was doing this very naturally. </sentence><sentence id="2535">I mean, she didn't show off. </sentence><sentence id="2536">It was what she was doing and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2537">But it was not something...a big surprise for me. </sentence><sentence id="2538">I never been afraid of gun. </sentence><sentence id="2539">I never been excited over gun, but I understood. </sentence><sentence id="2540">The question... it was no question in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2541">It was a normal way of life, knowing what she was doing before. </sentence><sentence id="2542">And it was, to me, a normal situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2555">Q: Knowing what she was doing before, meaning that...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2557">A: Before she used to go, at the time when she was in Grenoble, in south of France, she used to go and bring food, letter, visit French Resistance in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2558">And those people were guarded by German. </sentence><sentence id="2559">And she always found a way to go in, bring what she did have to bring. </sentence><sentence id="2560">She did a lot of risky things, but the natural way. </sentence><sentence id="2561">So, knowing this, after this, knowing she was carrying a gun, didn't surprise me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2567">Q: The reason that I noticed it and that I asked you about it, one reason was that the gun, the issue of your experiences with a gun came up a couple of times during the interview yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="2568">You talked about the one time that, or not yesterday but earlier, you talked about the one time Pastor Lederman got angry at you was when he saw you playing with his gun. </sentence><sentence id="2569">And then you talked about that other incident with your mother. </sentence><sentence id="2570">And then you mentioned also that you feel safer if you have a gun now. </sentence><sentence id="2571">And that was something you didn't talk about on tape. </sentence><sentence id="2572">And I was wondering if you would talk about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2675">A: Well, everything changed when I saw they arrest everybody, young, old people. </sentence><sentence id="2676">And they arrest them just because they were Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2677">And to me it didn't make any sense. </sentence><sentence id="2678">This is when I start to realize, I'm not French, I'm not American, I'm not Russian, I'm Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2679">This is the only reason.30  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 31 I'm born Jew, so they want to kill me, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2680">Like I told you before, look up to this day, what happened last week. </sentence><sentence id="2681">This guy, who did go in California and kill Jew just because he doesn't like Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2682">And this is when I said to the American Jew, maybe you are an American, but before everything you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2683">And they are going to kill you, not because you are an American, because you are Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
