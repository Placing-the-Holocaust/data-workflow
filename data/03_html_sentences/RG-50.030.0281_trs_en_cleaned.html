<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me when you were born, and then tell me a little bit about what your childhood was like before the war came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in August of 1922. </sentence><sentence id="14">I was the only child. </sentence><sentence id="15">My family was very close, well educated. </sentence><sentence id="16">I had a very happy childhood. </sentence><sentence id="17">I attended a private school, and I had a lady at home who took care of me. </sentence><sentence id="18">I had several cousins because my dad had several brothers and three sisters, and my mother had two brothers and a sister. </sentence><sentence id="19">And each one of them had one or two children. </sentence><sentence id="20">So we were a very close family, very devoted. </sentence><sentence id="21">Something that I treasure. </sentence><sentence id="22">My childhood gave me a very good background, strength, and love. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: What did your parents do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: My father was -- he actually had two faculties. </sentence><sentence id="36">He was an architect and an engineer. </sentence><sentence id="37">He studied outside of Poland because Poland had very strict admission for Jews in their universities, so my grandparents sent him to Czechoslovakia and then to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="38">And he was mainly an engineer in his last years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: So around about -- well, tell me what you remember of the middle 1930s. </sentence><sentence id="44">Do you remember changes happening and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="48">Well, in the middle 1930s, I -- in the beginning of the 30s, I attended the German gymnasium, which was the best in the city. </sentence><sentence id="49">But with the change in the political situation, my parents switched me to a Polish gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="50">And, unfortunately, I was sort of isolated. </sentence><sentence id="51">I didn't feel any pressure, any political pressure. </sentence><sentence id="52">Anything that was coming, I was unaware of it. </sentence><sentence id="53">We had a group of friends. </sentence><sentence id="54">In the summer, we were going away, and we had a small place in the country. </sentence><sentence id="55">And it was quite a satisfactory life. </sentence><sentence id="56">However, in 1938 and "39, the changes started to occur. </sentence><sentence id="57">We read about the rise of Nazis in Germany, which was neighboring Poland. </sentence><sentence id="58">We were aware of the speeches; however, we still felt pretty safe and secure. </sentence><sentence id="59">My uncle, who was a physician, had many patients </sentence></p><p><sentence id="60"> 01:04 who were of German origin, so-called Volksdeutsche then living in our city. </sentence><sentence id="61">And when he visited them, because at that time, a doctor visited patients in their home, they were wearing signs. </sentence><sentence id="62">They were wearing swastikas in the houses. </sentence><sentence id="63">There were pictures of Adolph Hitler. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="64">And we still didn't take this too seriously. </sentence><sentence id="65">Seriously enough of thinking of leaving. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: And then tell me what happened when the war started and how you remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: I remember distinctly September "39. </sentence><sentence id="68">The Ist of September was the first day of war, and I remember there are certain moments that are crystallized in your memory. </sentence><sentence id="69">They're etched so deeply, and I remember exactly the moment. </sentence><sentence id="70">I was sitting on a balcony, reading a book. </sentence><sentence id="71">And all of sudden, I heard a thud, a tremendous thud sound, and I saw planes circling above the city. </sentence><sentence id="72">I wasn't even afraid; I didn't know with what to associate this, that this was the day that the war started, and the planes came over Poland. </sentence><sentence id="73">I did not know that they crossed the border at that moment, but I remember the planes and the thud. </sentence><sentence id="74">And it startled me, and I got up and went to the room. </sentence><sentence id="75">This is something that is etched in my memory. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Did your parents talk? </sentence><sentence id="86">Did you hear your parents talking? </sentence><sentence id="87">Did they know what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="88">Were they afraid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: My father died a year before the war. </sentence><sentence id="94">Two years before the war, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="95">Two years before the war. </sentence><sentence id="96">He suffered from uremia, and at that time, there was no cure for it then. </sentence><sentence id="97">There were no dialysis known to medicine. </sentence><sentence id="98">And I was with my mother, and my mother was being courted at the time by a friend, a physician. </sentence><sentence id="99">So they were rather happy. </sentence><sentence id="100">The clouds of the war were sort of coming, but yet we did not realize to the fullest the seriousness of the situation of -- in school in lyceum, which was equal to junior college here, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="101">And the radio started to play national Polish hymns and the patriotic speeches, and we were listening to people telling us that we were invincible, which was very laughable because Poland did not have the technology that Germany possessed. </sentence><sentence id="102">In a few days, the Germans went in our city, which was not that far from the border. </sentence><sentence id="103">And while Germans were coming with their tanks, the Poles were fighting on their beautiful horses with lances, dressed beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="104">Being patriotic and brought up in the spirit, everything was beautiful to me, but the reality of what was happening was ugly. </sentence><sentence id="105">Very soon after that, the Germans started to issue laws. </sentence><sentence id="106">Curfew was one of the first. </sentence><sentence id="107">We were not permitted on the streets past, I believe, 5 o'clock, I'm not too sure about that hour. </sentence><sentence id="108">We were required to wear yellow stars with the sign Jude identifying us as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="109">The money was frozen in the bank, and we started to be very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="110">One particular time, I was walking on a street not too far from my home, and I was called by a German officer. </sentence><sentence id="111">He called me, motioning with his hand to come over. </sentence><sentence id="112">My heart was beating wildly. </sentence><sentence id="113">I crossed the street. </sentence><sentence id="114">He asked me to go upstairs to his apartment, and being a young girl, I was just petrified. </sentence><sentence id="115">He asked me to clean the place. </sentence><sentence id="116">He took his gun off, put it on a table, and was sitting on a chair next to it watching me. </sentence><sentence id="117">Well, I didn't know too much about cleaning, but I cleaned very fast, and I did what he asked me to do. </sentence><sentence id="118">And he looked at me, and he said in German "It is a shame that you are a Jew," and he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="119">This is another of the moments that I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="120">After that, I wasn't going out too much. </sentence><sentence id="121">My mother and my grandmother tried to shield me. </sentence><sentence id="122">Since the apartment that we were  living in belonged to -- this was a large building which belonged to us, we knew many German people in the city, Polish people of German origin. </sentence><sentence id="123">And my grandmother, who is very wise, asked one of them to come and be sort of a supervisor of the building, so she made an office in our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was a large apartment, and we did not have to display anything on the door identifying us as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="125">So for a little while, we were spared. </sentence><sentence id="126">However, pretty soon the Germans caught on. </sentence><sentence id="127">One day -- this is another of these moments -- one day there was a ring. </sentence><sentence id="128">An officer with an aide came to the door. </sentence><sentence id="129">The officer had a scar on his face identifying him as a student who had dueled probably in Heidelberg, Germany University. </sentence><sentence id="130">He also had a black skull on his head, a skull which identified him, I think, as a member of SS, and we knew what that was, Gestapo SS. </sentence><sentence id="131">He walked into the place. </sentence><sentence id="132">My grandmother, who was very fluent in German and knew that he represented danger, asked him if she could contribute to the German Red Cross, money. </sentence><sentence id="133">She thought that she would mollify him and that he will leave. </sentence><sentence id="134">At which point, he hit her. </sentence><sentence id="135">He had suede gloves, and he hit her with a gloved hand across the face. </sentence><sentence id="136">He proceeded from room to room with a man and was pointing to things which struck his fancy, and the young man started to pack them. </sentence><sentence id="137">At the end of one of our rooms was a small alcove filled with fern greens, and there was a cage with a canary hanging there. </sentence><sentence id="138">Once he saw the canary, his whole appearance changed. </sentence><sentence id="139">He became enchanted with the bird, and he asked us "Is this a male or a female canary? </sentence><sentence id="140">How lovely does he sing." </sentence><sentence id="141">He was a changed man. </sentence><sentence id="142">At that moment, I realized that a canary was more important, had more meaning to him than all of us human beings. </sentence><sentence id="143">This is one of the moments that I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="144">The man was an educated man; I knew that. </sentence><sentence id="145">And we were nothing, but the canary represented something wonderful to him. </sentence><sentence id="146">He was mesmerized by the canary, and he beat my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="147">Well we were staying in our apartment for some time until the Germans started to throw people out to ghetto -- I need to explain the term of "ghetto" to many people and children who are listening to me. </sentence><sentence id="148">A ghetto is an isolated part of our city situated in what used to be a very poor neighborhood and consisted of several blocks of buildings and small houses. </sentence><sentence id="149">And we knew that we are going to be thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="150">And since we knew somebody that was an engineer who was well acquainted with my family who lived at the outskirts of the city, and he asked us, since he was being evacuated, if we could live in his little house and take care of it, which we agreed to greedily because it was clean. </sentence><sentence id="151">It had three rooms and a kitchen, and had a garden. </sentence><sentence id="152">And a garden was very important because there was some food growing there and we moved there. </sentence><sentence id="153">After a while, they started to send Czechish refugees, Jews from Czechoslovakia, and they were being assigned spaces in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="154">The ghetto was small; there was not much space. </sentence><sentence id="155">Well, we received a couple, a husband and wife -- a charming, lovely couple whose children were being kept by some Czechish neighbors, Christian people who helped to save the children. </sentence><sentence id="156">And the couple stayed with us for a while. </sentence><sentence id="157">But we were being already used to the rations, and we were deteriorating at a slower rate than they. </sentence><sentence id="158">They were thrown in directly from the good life to the very, very bad, and they both died fairly soon. </sentence><sentence id="159">We were all being starved, and my grandmother had an  idea. </sentence><sentence id="160">The so-called "Aelteste der Juden", you wouldn't know which one. </sentence><sentence id="161">The man who was in charge of Lodz Ghetto was named Chaim Rumkowski. </sentence><sentence id="162">Before the war, he was an agent for an orphanage and collected money for the orphans. </sentence><sentence id="163">Since my family was involved in charitable work and donated money to the orphanage, my grandmother decided that I should go to see him and ask him for some help because there was some sort of help. </sentence><sentence id="164">There were so- called talons (ph), small pieces of paper for some food distribution, and I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="165">It's another moment in my memory. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was a long room with a long table. </sentence><sentence id="167">He was at the end of the table, and I was at the other one, at the other end. </sentence><sentence id="168">I was led in the room, and I said to him in Polish " Panye President," which means Mr. President. </sentence><sentence id="169">And at that moment, he picked up a cane and wanted to hit me because he resented the fact that I didn't speak Jewish to him, which I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="170">So I quickly told him "I am from this-and-this family." </sentence><sentence id="171">And at that, he stopped and said, "Where do you live?" </sentence><sentence id="172">Then I gave him the address and I left. </sentence><sentence id="173">He sent next day somebody with few of the pieces of papers for some sugar and for me to work in a bakery for three months. </sentence><sentence id="174">And that was a life-saving because I could eat some bread in the bakery, and I could take some small pieces home, and my ration card was being used by my family. </sentence><sentence id="175">This lasted three months. </sentence><sentence id="176">Three months later because they were changing -- three months later, he remembered me. </sentence><sentence id="177">He had fantastic memory. </sentence><sentence id="178">He switched me to a place which was called kitchen -- some sort of kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="179">They were feeding for two weeks soup to workers who were essential to their production in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="180">You see, ghetto had several establishments working for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="181">In order to stay alive we were obligated to produce some work. </sentence><sentence id="182">In that kitchen, I worked as a waitress. </sentence><sentence id="183">And one day about a week later, this Mr.Rumkowski's sister-in-law came to the room, and she saw me and she said, "Cut your hair," and I didn't understand why. </sentence><sentence id="184">And said, "Out," and she threw me out of the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="185">Well, that was a tragedy because that's where the food was. </sentence><sentence id="186">I spoke to the aide to Mr. Rumkowski, who was afraid of her because she thought that she was a princess in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="187">People had very wrong ideas about themselves. </sentence><sentence id="188">He was instrumental in assigning me to the kitchen where they were peeling potatoes, and I was very happy about that. </sentence><sentence id="189">I was peeling potatoes all day long, and trying to steal some of the peels to take home, because peels meant food. </sentence><sentence id="190">All this ended soon after. </sentence><sentence id="191">The ghetto was being systematically emptied. </sentence><sentence id="192">There were transports; people were being sent away. </sentence><sentence id="193">At that time, even Rumkowski couldn't help. </sentence><sentence id="194">He had several people whom he knew from before the war from helping the orphanage or whatever, and he sent -- I don't remember the number -- maybe there were 40 or 50 of us young women to a place at the outskirts called Marianske in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="195">And we were there, working there in some meaningless work we performed. </sentence><sentence id="196">We were supposed to build cement blocks for the houses that were being ruined in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="197">They were trying to have cement blocks to build some sort of shelter. </sentence><sentence id="198">We were there for a while, and the ghetto was being systemically emptied, one transport after another. </sentence><sentence id="199">And Rumkowski amongst them. </sentence><sentence id="200">The transports were going then from August 1944, and after a while the ghetto was almost empty. </sentence><sentence id="201">My mother and I and some of my friends were still fortunate enough from that place  to go to a hospital, which contained 500 people. </sentence><sentence id="202">There were two groups left in the entire ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="203">One was ours from Marianske, and one was hidden on a street called Jakuba. </sentence><sentence id="204">I only know about it because I had a friend who was hidden there. </sentence><sentence id="205">At that time, I was not aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="206">The 500 of us were in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="207">The hospital had a couple of physicians with their families. </sentence><sentence id="208">There were children. </sentence><sentence id="209">We slept, my mother and I, in a very large room with about 20 other people. </sentence><sentence id="210">I think we had -- I don't remember if there were mattresses, but we slept on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="211">We would lie down in rows. </sentence><sentence id="212">For a small infraction, a couple of people were being taken away and sent away. </sentence><sentence id="213">The German who was in charge of this place was called Hans Bebolt (ph), typical, extremely good-looking man. </sentence><sentence id="214">Blonde, typical Aryan appearance; he was brutal. </sentence><sentence id="215">He selected one of the girls and then he shot her. </sentence><sentence id="216">This was the story of ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="217">There was one incident in ghetto which I forgot about. </sentence><sentence id="218">If I may, I'll go back to this. </sentence><sentence id="219">When we were still living in that house of this gentleman who gave it to us and we were so very hungry, we decided that I will try to go to city to people that we knew from before the war who lived in our building. </sentence><sentence id="220">They were of German origin, but Polish. </sentence><sentence id="221">Their name was Mensel family. </sentence><sentence id="222">I took my star off, the Jewish star, and I smuggled myself through the wires, and I walked through the city. </sentence><sentence id="223">with the fear in my heart looking at people, looking at little dogs which reminded me of my dog that I had to leave at home, everything seemed very normal to me. </sentence><sentence id="224">But I knew that I didn't belong there. </sentence><sentence id="225">Finally, I reached the building that we left, and I walked up a very broad staircase, my heart was beating wildly because I didn't know how they will react to me. </sentence><sentence id="226">Will they let me in? </sentence><sentence id="227">Maybe they moved. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was a long time, and the door opened and it was opened by young Nina, who was the daughter of the family. </sentence><sentence id="229">As she looked at me, I saw the terror in her eyes. </sentence><sentence id="230">She was stricken with terror looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="231">And I was taken aback, but after a minute, she composed herself and put a finger to her lips indicating that I shouldn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="232">I found out that there were some German people invited to dinner. </sentence><sentence id="233">They were some sort of relation of Mr. Mensel, and she brought me to the room, and Mr. and Mrs. Mensel saw me and hugged me and gave me dinner. </sentence><sentence id="234">I ate with them dinner. </sentence><sentence id="235">I was sitting at that table looking at the tablecloth, looking at the proper appointment on the table. </sentence><sentence id="236">And J ate like a normal human being, and I started to resent the fact that I had to go back to ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="237">I almost forgot about everybody else that I left. </sentence><sentence id="238">But, of course, the situation changed in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="239">After some small talk, the man was -- the German was in life, he was a professor. </sentence><sentence id="240">He had a great deal of knowledge, and the conversation was so welcome to me, so normal, and I was not used to it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="241">And young Nina helped me, she said to explain to them that I came for some books. </sentence><sentence id="242">And the books, of course, was food. </sentence><sentence id="243">And she and her mother prepared some food, and I was already getting nervous because the curfew hour was coming. </sentence><sentence id="244">And they gave me some parcels and said that I'll be back. </sentence><sentence id="245">The young soldier wanted to see me next week, and all my friends said that they will let him know if I'll be in the city. </sentence><sentence id="246">And I took the parcel, and I started to walk towards the wires, towards the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="247">Again, my heart was beating wildly. </sentence><sentence id="248">I was so, so very frightened because there were German patrols going on both sides of the wires. </sentence><sentence id="249">And I had to time myself to a split second when they turned around and won't be there. </sentence><sentence id="250">And when I saw that he turned around, I ran to the wire, so I spread them through the parcels, and I caught  part of my dress on it. </sentence><sentence id="251">And I saw it, so I retrieved a little piece, grabbed the parcels, and ran towards the house. </sentence><sentence id="252">The house was not too far from the wires. </sentence><sentence id="253">And when I reached my home, the stress of the entire day gave up to tremendous, tremendous sobbing. </sentence><sentence id="254">I just couldn't believe what I did. </sentence><sentence id="255">I knew that with my family I had to move from this place after certain couple of months because the Germans were making the ghetto much smaller. </sentence><sentence id="256">And we moved to a house on Zierske (ph) Street. </sentence><sentence id="257">This was a main street in that part of the city, and there was a streetcar passing by. </sentence><sentence id="258">Since we were -- and the streetcar belonged to the population -- since we were not supposed to cross the street, it was cutting ghetto in half. </sentence><sentence id="259">They built a wooden bridge over the street. </sentence><sentence id="260">When we lived, for instance, on one side of the wire, and we worked on the other, we had to cross the wooden bridge. </sentence><sentence id="261">And the apartment assigned to us was right next to the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="262">That was before I went to Marianske where Rumkowski sent me to the girls and then back, I went back to the hospital, which was my last stay in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="263">There was a German -- I cannot recall his name -- I tried so hard the last few days to recall his name because I was looking forward to this interview. </sentence><sentence id="264">He promised to take this group to his place of work and spare us Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="265">He was to take this group to his place of work and spare us Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="266">I knew about a terrible place that they were gassing people because there was a hidden radio in the hospital, and once even I listened to this radio. </sentence><sentence id="267">This German reassured us that when you will be taken away, we won't go to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="268">When we walked through the ghetto to work after the entire ghetto was empty, it was a very weird feeling and the streets, open windows, flowing curtains blowing with the wind. </sentence><sentence id="269">No people. </sentence><sentence id="270">Once we thought that we saw a glimmer of somebody in the window, or a candle or something, and, of course, we averted our eyes not to give away to the German escorts that somebody was there. </sentence><sentence id="271">In November of 1944 came our time we had to be taken out. </sentence><sentence id="272">The entire population of our hospital was walked to the place where the cattle cars were, and we were loaded. </sentence><sentence id="273">It was a horrible thing because people had to stand. </sentence><sentence id="274">There was no place to sit or squat. </sentence><sentence id="275">If somebody was sick or even dying, he died on his feet standing up. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was just unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="277">Water was the worst, lack of water, the thirst was the worst. </sentence><sentence id="278">I tried very hard to suppress some of the moments because the life is beckoning, life is normal. </sentence><sentence id="279">I want to live a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="280">I want to be part of my family, which is very wonderful to me, but from time to time, these things keep on coming back and they haunt me. </sentence><sentence id="281">And I'm particularly happy that I am able to speak of it and to leave something behind me for mostly the young people, the people who never will, never heard, or heard a little bit about it, what it is about man's inhumanity to man. </sentence><sentence id="282">This train took us to first camp, which was called Ravensbriick. </sentence><sentence id="283">Ravensbriick was mainly a women's camp. </sentence><sentence id="284">It was large, we never knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="285">We didn't go to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="286">We were the only transport from Lodz Ghetto that did not go to Auschwitz; he kept his word about that. </sentence><sentence id="287">Ravensbriick, though, was a hell. </sentence><sentence id="288">We were stripped of our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="289">We went through a medical examination, which was -- I cannot even say the word "embarrassing" because the people who conducted it were less than human. </sentence><sentence id="290">They were less than animal. </sentence><sentence id="291">We were many young girls who never undergone gynecological examinations, and they were looking for, God knows, diamonds or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="292">We were subjected to that. </sentence><sentence id="293">I had never seen chairs like  that before in my life. </sentence><sentence id="294">We were humiliated at every moment. </sentence><sentence id="295">Our clothes was taken away from us, and we were directed to a heap of clothes which probably was left from the group that was killed previously. </sentence><sentence id="296">I received some sort of a dress. </sentence><sentence id="297">I tried hard to remember, but I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="298">But there was some sort of a dress that was a little warmer. </sentence><sentence id="299">My mother, on the other hand, was given a long, silk dress, and it was November and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="300">I don't know what kind. </sentence><sentence id="301">The food we were given was, of course, of no nutritional value, no value whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="302">It was watery soup, one slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="303">We had no possessions. </sentence><sentence id="304">All of us stopped menstruating because we had no nutrition in our bodies. </sentence><sentence id="305">We started to resemble skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="306">I developed on my right arm large pus deposits that would swell to the size of egg, which I covered under the sleeve because there is still a will to live and to survive no matter how horrible the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="307">Our family, when we were still together, promised each other that if one of us would survive, we should try -- at least one -- to shout to all the world, to all the nations, to all the people and to bear witness to what we were going through. </sentence><sentence id="308">To what people were capable of doing. </sentence><sentence id="309">In this camp, we had to get up at dawn -- it was dark -- to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="310">These were so-called appells, an Appell Platz. </sentence><sentence id="311">We were standing in rows, long rows of miserable looking human wretches, and we were being counted. </sentence><sentence id="312">They were twice a day, the Appells. </sentence><sentence id="313">One day I was fainting because between the hunger and malnutrition, I was just fainting. </sentence><sentence id="314">And the Germans had dogs with them, large German Shepherds, who were being trained to attack people. </sentence><sentence id="315">And they let one go as I was lying down, and the dog came to me and licked my face. </sentence><sentence id="316">That's another moment. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I came to. </sentence><sentence id="318">I adore dogs and animals, and I don't know if it's true if the dog sensed it or not, but that's the truth. </sentence><sentence id="319">The dog did not touch me, he licked my face. </sentence><sentence id="320">And my friends picked me up, and I was again standing there as a number. </sentence><sentence id="321">That was Ravensbriick. </sentence><sentence id="322">Ravensbriick had many women prisoners from different nations. </sentence><sentence id="323">We did not see them because the block -- there were blocks. </sentence><sentence id="324">The block that we were in was so temporary, we were coming and going, all being killed or sent somewhere to work. </sentence><sentence id="325">They were mixed bunch of women. </sentence><sentence id="326">The wooden bunks were about two or three tiers high, and I was with my mother on one middle one and across from us were German prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="327">The German prisoners that were across from us were prisoners from before the war. </sentence><sentence id="328">The were murderers; they were all kinds of outcasts of the society. </sentence><sentence id="329">However, they were superior to us because they had the German blood. </sentence><sentence id="330">We were only Jews. </sentence><sentence id="331">The two German women who were across from us were two women; one of them was called Peter and she was the man. </sentence><sentence id="332">I was 16, 17, 18, 19 years old, I don't remember, and this was the first time that I was exposed to something like that, and she could hit us. </sentence><sentence id="333">We had no right to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="334">She was German. </sentence><sentence id="335">In that camp we were issued triangles of different colors. </sentence><sentence id="336">The black triangles, which the murderers wore, were given to the murderers and to the prisoners of crimes. </sentence><sentence id="337">The green ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses -- no. </sentence><sentence id="338">The green ones, excuse me, the green ones were given to the thieves, common thieves. </sentence><sentence id="339">The purple ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses, who were wonderful people. </sentence><sentence id="340">These were Germans who did not believe in violence, and they were thrown with us and shared our lot. </sentence><sentence id="341">I promised myself that if I survived the war, I'll help them -- let me compose myself. </sentence><sentence id="342">I kept my word. </sentence><sentence id="343">I never sent the Jehovah Witnesses from my door, never excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="344">May I have a tissue? </sentence><sentence id="345">This was first time that I saw some sparkle of humanity in this Gehenna, in this hell that we were going through. </sentence><sentence id="346">They were gentle and they told us to hold on because the war will end and the good will come back. </sentence><sentence id="347">Going back to the triangles. </sentence><sentence id="348">Pink were given to homosexuals, which Hitler didn't consider as pure German. </sentence><sentence id="349"> One of his balonies there. </sentence><sentence id="350">And we, the Jews, had red one with a yellow. </sentence><sentence id="351">Pure red one was political prisoner, but with yellow was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="352">We were on the lowest rank of this diabolical system. </sentence><sentence id="353">We were nothing. </sentence><sentence id="354">In this camp there was niece of and Audette (ph), a French  dinner, and they never even gave a thought to what they did as what they considered work. </sentence><sentence id="355">The work became to them a hobby. </sentence><sentence id="356">They were being conditioned to like their work. </sentence><sentence id="357">They did not consider us as somebody who has brain equal or better than theirs. </sentence><sentence id="358">Who can think, who can feel, who can love, who can teach, who give and share good things with other people. </sentence><sentence id="359">The man who was in charge of our camp lived right across from the camp, the camp was surrounded by barbed wires and had high towers with machine guns manned by the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="360">When he left the camp at sa certain hour, he had his God that he loved. </sentence><sentence id="361">He had children running around the place. </sentence><sentence id="362">I could never reconcile the fact that he was called a man, and I couldn't say that he was an animal because I like animals. </sentence><sentence id="363">Well, we marched through the city to our place of work. </sentence><sentence id="364">We were supposed to work for 12 hours straight. </sentence><sentence id="365">The work was divided into two 12-hour shifts: day shift manned by us, and night shift which was manned by the Russian prisoners of war who were kept somewhere there. </sentence><sentence id="366">I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="367">We were assigned to different parts of the factory. </sentence><sentence id="368">They were called Halle A, B, C, D and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="369">My misfortune was to be assigned to Halle Ha, which is H. There were only a few of us that were assigned there. </sentence><sentence id="370">My supervisor was an elderly German man, so-called Meister, who knew that the war was being lost. </sentence><sentence id="371">It was 1945 already. </sentence><sentence id="372">He took his revenge on me. </sentence><sentence id="373">He beat me, stomped on me mercilessly. </sentence><sentence id="374">One day , the work in that particular place of work to which I was assigned was to rivet parts of the plane, the wings. </sentence><sentence id="375">I had a riveting gun, which was made of steel and was very heavy, and rivets. </sentence><sentence id="376">I had to put the rivets through two holes to join the places, and they were spaced every so often. </sentence><sentence id="377">The work was very hard because it was freezing cold. </sentence><sentence id="378">You can imagine how tremendous the place was for the planes being assembled. </sentence><sentence id="379">Huge, and it was very, very cold. </sentence><sentence id="380">And the steel gun froze to the flesh of my hand when I was riveting. </sentence><sentence id="381">There were four of us that I knew that were in this place, H. One day I noticed a very tiny script on part of the wing in a different script that I knew. </sentence><sentence id="382">It was a Russian script. </sentence><sentence id="383">And one person knew how to decipher this, and it was written there "Try if you can to skip every so often when you rivet and leave a little bit of opening." </sentence><sentence id="384">Now, we realized that if we would do that, we risked death, but this was a lifesaver for us. </sentence><sentence id="385">We can do something positive because logically if the plane's in the air, the force of wind may force this rivet out because it's not completely sealed. </sentence><sentence id="386">And if enough of them would be blown out, the part would disintegrate. </sentence><sentence id="387">And we were delighted, and we started to do it. </sentence><sentence id="388">I did this for a little while, and one day I infected my finger with part of steel. </sentence><sentence id="389">And I knew that the infection was bad because I had a red stripe going up my arm and swollen glands underneath my armpit, so I knew that's bad. </sentence><sentence id="390">And here it was already March "45, going towards April. </sentence><sentence id="391">April, it was April. </sentence><sentence id="392">I don't recall the dates exactly, and my friend said, "You must survive." </sentence><sentence id="393">We could hear the sounds of war. </sentence><sentence id="394">We knew that the armies are coming closer and closer and closer because we were being sent more and more towards middle of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="395">And I developed high fever, so we had so-called Krankenrevier, which is place the sick people were taken. </sentence><sentence id="396">Prior to this, they were taken away and shipped somewhere in Kiev. </sentence><sentence id="397">But since this was already so late, they took me there and two of the prisoners amongst us, the Jewish group, were doctors. </sentence><sentence id="398">Two young lady doctors, and one of them Dr. Levine, who I don't know if she's still alive, pulled my nail without any anesthesia, without anything -- she had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="399">Pulled the nail off me and squeezed the pus. </sentence><sentence id="400">Normally, if this would happen here, if you don't have penicillin or streptomycin or antimycin, you probably die. </sentence><sentence id="401">I didn't die of it. </sentence><sentence id="402">It some sort of healed over. </sentence><sentence id="403">I had no nail. </sentence><sentence id="404">I had some straps all around it, I think, from the dress. </sentence><sentence id="405">I don't  0 remember what she wrapped around it. </sentence><sentence id="406">I was in pain. </sentence><sentence id="407">They permitted me to stay in this place for sick, and I was sitting in the corner. </sentence><sentence id="408">All the windows were blackened because there were air raids already coming. </sentence><sentence id="409">And one day an SS woman came and she asked, "Who can knit?" </sentence><sentence id="410">And I said to myself I knew how to knit. </sentence><sentence id="411">I knew that properly brought girls were supposed to play piano, speak French and German, knit, and cook, besides the schoolwork. </sentence><sentence id="412">I knew how to knit, so I raised my hand. </sentence><sentence id="413">And she said, "I have to have a sweater within few days." </sentence><sentence id="414">And she brought me knitting needles and wool, and I was knitting without this finger, constantly. </sentence><sentence id="415">But she brought me soup and piece of bread for it. </sentence><sentence id="416">As I was knitting for few days, one day they came to the barrack; they boarded the windows. </sentence><sentence id="417">They didn't let anybody out. </sentence><sentence id="418">The Russians were already at the doors of the city, and the fighting was going on and we heard the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="419">We didn't know who was coming, but we knew whoever it is, it's the liberators. </sentence><sentence id="420">So to us, it didn't mean much. </sentence><sentence id="421">So we all stayed in the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="422">The plan was to destroy us, but they didn't have enough time. </sentence><sentence id="423">End of Tape #1  1 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="761">Q: Just a minute. </sentence><sentence id="762">But what I think we should do is why don't you back up to the SS woman coming in saying, "Can anybody knit?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="767">Q: Go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="769">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="770">The SS woman, a heavy, big woman, came to the place where we were, the few sick people, and asked if anybody can knit, and I thought that maybe this will help me to survive since I'm the one -- I'm still here. </sentence><sentence id="771">I said, "I can knit." </sentence><sentence id="772">I raised my hand and she brought knitting needles and wool and asked me to make her a sweater as fast as possible. </sentence><sentence id="773">Evidently, they wanted to shed their uniforms, which we found later on spread around there, and have civilian clothes on. </sentence><sentence id="774">They were big, heavy people; they had sticks with them to hit. </sentence><sentence id="775">And I started to knit in spite of my broken ribs and finger which was bandaged superficially and pain. </sentence><sentence id="776">I knitted and knitted. </sentence><sentence id="777">And she brought me some soup, some cold soup, and so- called bread, which was made with some sort of sawdust, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="778">And | ate very greedily, and I knitted the sweater until few days later, I found out that nobody could leave the barrack because the doors were boarded and so were the windows. </sentence><sentence id="779">And we didn't see through the cracks, we didn't see anybody manning the towers. </sentence><sentence id="780">The German soldiers were gone, so we realized that we are sentenced to be disposed of. </sentence><sentence id="781">It was almost a tonic. </sentence><sentence id="782">We heard the sounds of fight -- guns, couldn't identify what it was. </sentence><sentence id="783">The sky was turning almost crimson red, and we were huddled. </sentence><sentence id="784">Then one of the girls who was very enterprising, she said, "Nobody's here. </sentence><sentence id="785">Let's break the door and go to the kitchen." </sentence><sentence id="786">Food was on everybody's mind. </sentence><sentence id="787">Food, food was life. </sentence><sentence id="788">They broke the door. </sentence><sentence id="789">Now, I couldn't; I was lying down. </sentence><sentence id="790">They broke the door from the main place, from the main barrack and from the sick place, and they ran to the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="791">What they found in the kitchen were bars of margarine bars, and raw potatoes and couple of eggs. </sentence><sentence id="792">They scooped the margarine with their hands, and they brought two eggs and some potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="793">And since the door was broken down, we decided to leave the place. </sentence><sentence id="794">My people took me by my arms and grabbed me, and we crossed the street to where the commandant's house was. </sentence><sentence id="795">Well, his house was empty; he ran away with his family. </sentence><sentence id="796">So we went inside. </sentence><sentence id="797">There were six or seven of us -- seven, I think. </sentence><sentence id="798">How to cook the two eggs and divide, and the raw potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="799">While they were busy cooking and as they were cooking, the commandant came back with a cocked gun facing us, the seven of us. </sentence><sentence id="800">There was group of subhumans watching this man, this well-fed, big man with the gun, and he was afraid of us. </sentence><sentence id="801">It was -- if it wouldn't be so tragic, it would be comical. </sentence><sentence id="802">He backed out with the gun and he disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="803">We decided it's not safe to stay there, so we started to run towards the fire because where the fire was coming from, whoever tried to liberate, was there fighting. </sentence><sentence id="804">As we were running, we encountered two young men. </sentence><sentence id="805">They happened to be Polish, and they were there not as prisoners, but they were taken from Poland to work in the fields because their young people and old people and whoever was capable was fighting. </sentence><sentence id="806">They needed people to work the fields, and the two Polish people joined our group. </sentence><sentence id="807">One of the girls was killed by a piece of shrapnel in the very last moment before liberation. </sentence><sentence id="808">And the rest of us started to run toward  2 the fire. </sentence><sentence id="809">They were holding me all the way, and we reached a place -- it's another moment -- where a dirty, strange-looking man in filthy uniform with Asiatic-looking face, very tiny eyes, with a little cappy sort of a hat and big boots, and we realized that this is not a German at that time. </sentence><sentence id="810">We were ready to kiss his boots as filthy as he was, but he told us dawai, "In the back, in the back." </sentence><sentence id="811">We were so called liberated, we didn't know what was ahead of us yet. </sentence><sentence id="812">We went behind -- this is still the war line. </sentence><sentence id="813">They are fighting -- go. </sentence><sentence id="814">Food, they had a bottle of herring. </sentence><sentence id="815">We started to eat this herring, one after another. </sentence><sentence id="816">And we were tremendously thirsty, and there was no water because the pipes froze. </sentence><sentence id="817">We all got sick, very sick from it. </sentence><sentence id="818">See, the Russians are, I must say, very sturdy people. </sentence><sentence id="819">They were fighting eating the herring. </sentence><sentence id="820">It was incomprehensible to us, but that's the fact. </sentence><sentence id="821">And they told us to get away from there, so we started to go away. </sentence><sentence id="822">This was a village. </sentence><sentence id="823">The village was not touched. </sentence><sentence id="824">The little houses, neat houses, lovely gardens, and sounds of starving animals because the Germans ran away and left the poor beasts unfed. </sentence><sentence id="825">They were running for life, so there were cows, there were pigs howling. </sentence><sentence id="826">We got to one of the houses, and since the firing was going on both ways, we went to the basement. </sentence><sentence id="827">There were the two Polish guys and man and five girls, five women. </sentence><sentence id="828">We went to the basement which was very well appointed. </sentence><sentence id="829">They had sleeping accommodation. </sentence><sentence id="830">They had shelves stocked with jars with conserves, with meat, with whatever. </sentence><sentence id="831">And they had a barrel of water. </sentence><sentence id="832">They were very well prepared. </sentence><sentence id="833">We ate and we lie down. </sentence><sentence id="834">The basement was approachable by some sort of a door which swings out and up and down, and in the middle of the night two Russians came and opened the door and came down. </sentence><sentence id="835">And they wanted women. </sentence><sentence id="836">I became hysterical because if I survived to this point, I don't want to live anymore. </sentence><sentence id="837">And I told one of the Polish men that if he would save me, I would do anything possible because my family's very influential. </sentence><sentence id="838">I thought they were alive. </sentence><sentence id="839">And he put me down on one of these wooden benches, which was prepared for sleeping and covered me and sat down on me. </sentence><sentence id="840">The other girls did the same. </sentence><sentence id="841">The third girl hid in a corner, and two girls were raped. </sentence><sentence id="842">One of them is still alive that's in Israel, but I understand that she's in a mental institution. </sentence><sentence id="843">Once -- the demeanor of the Russian soldier is very difficult to describe now because we see them now after all these years of changes, these were people who were fighting the war. </sentence><sentence id="844">The closest I can identify them, they were grunzens (ph) or kalmucks??. </sentence><sentence id="845">They couldn't understand the difference, what's the difference? </sentence><sentence id="846">A woman's a woman; I mean, a woman. </sentence><sentence id="847">What's wrong? </sentence><sentence id="848">They were childlike. </sentence><sentence id="849">Here they were fighting, and here this is quite all right, everything. </sentence><sentence id="850">They drank whatever was there, and then one of them took a gun and started to shoot the jars with the fruit. </sentence><sentence id="851">And the pieces of glass and the red fluid from them started to seep all over, and I had glass embedded in my left leg throughout the winter because I wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="852">I reached that point. </sentence><sentence id="853">I was going to tell the world. </sentence><sentence id="854">I remembered my promise, so I had the glass in my leg and the red fluid all over me. </sentence><sentence id="855">And I was -- and the Polish young man was sitting on top of me, and that was till the morning. </sentence><sentence id="856">When the morning finally arrived, we decided to leave the place, and we walked, walked, walked to the next village. </sentence><sentence id="857">Next village, there were beautiful homes all beautifully prepared. </sentence><sentence id="858">Food, chickens, china. </sentence><sentence id="859">We went to the house and we scouted it. </sentence><sentence id="860">We saw that there was an attic there. </sentence><sentence id="861">So we ate. </sentence><sentence id="862">I remember the two young Polish guys were running up to the chickens with a stick to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="863">We cooked the chickens. </sentence><sentence id="864">We ate. </sentence><sentence id="865">We took the china with the tablecloth, threw out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="866">We weren't going to save anything there. </sentence><sentence id="867">This was our little revenge. </sentence><sentence id="868">Silly as it might sound now. </sentence><sentence id="869">We decided we would sleep in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="870">We took the ladder. </sentence><sentence id="871">We  3 climbed the ladder and slept quietly in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="872">One of the girls was a little bit different. </sentence><sentence id="873">She decided she liked one of the Russian officers, so she stayed downstairs, and she went with him wherever she wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="874">In the middle of the night, we went to -- we were alone on the top in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="875">The two Polish younb men are sleeping in one of the rooms downstairs, and we hear German voices. </sentence><sentence id="876">It seems the houses were facing a young forest, and there were Germans hiding in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="877">They were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="878">They wanted to get some food. </sentence><sentence id="879">They got to our house to the kitchen, and they were eating food in our kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="880">So we were very frightened, even though we were in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="881">We went underneath the bed. </sentence><sentence id="882">They had a bed there upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="883">We went underneath the bed. </sentence><sentence id="884">One of the girls could not hold her bladder from fear, and that's how we were lying in it. </sentence><sentence id="885">And two Polish young men jumped out of the window because there was low part there, and they went to the Russians wherever they were. </sentence><sentence id="886">They had already so-called stabilized the place, and they told them that there were Germans in the house. </sentence><sentence id="887">So the Russians came over, and we hear them outside. " </sentence><sentence id="888">Let's throw grenades," or whatever the name is of it. </sentence><sentence id="889">They were going to kill the Germans or dynamite the house. </sentence><sentence id="890">They didn't care about property either. </sentence><sentence id="891">But here we are, four of us, under the bed. </sentence><sentence id="892">So we started to scream, "No, no. </sentence><sentence id="893">There are Polish people here. </sentence><sentence id="894">There are Polish people here." </sentence><sentence id="895">The two Germans opened the kitchen door and started to run to the garden, and they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="896">They were lying there for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="897">Each one of us took something from the German body.[had a pair of scissors, little scissors that he had on his body. </sentence><sentence id="898">I still have them. </sentence><sentence id="899">The next day there were French prisoners, ex-prisoners of war, who lived in another house there. </sentence><sentence id="900">Now, I could communicate with them, and I told them that I'm scared to death. </sentence><sentence id="901">The other girls decided they want to go back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="902">I was afraid to make one step outside. </sentence><sentence id="903">So the French people invited me to stay with them, and that's how I parted company with the Polish girls. </sentence><sentence id="904">And I went to the French house, and they said they would protect me; they did it. </sentence><sentence id="905">Each one is a separate story, and there are numbers of them. </sentence><sentence id="906">Numbers. </sentence><sentence id="907">Because the brain is supposed to be a storage of all these things, but yet it's almost impossible. </sentence><sentence id="908">There are things that I omitted. </sentence><sentence id="909">There are things that are coming back now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1052">Q: Can I ask you a couple of questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1054">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1056">Q: I'm not going to go in chronological order, necessarily. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Your mother was with you when you were deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1060">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1062">Q: And your mother was with you for how long, and what happened to your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1064">A: My mother was with me until we worked in that -- until Wittenberg, and then she was taken somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1065">My mother was taken away from me in Wittenberg, and I didn't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="1066">I found her after the war in Oranienburg Sachsenhausen, which was another camp, and she was already mortally ill and she passed away. </sentence><sentence id="1067">If somebody was not capable of carrying the work, they were useless to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1068">And even though she was quite young,  4 she was 42 years old, but she had swollen legs. </sentence><sentence id="1069">She was skeleton-like. </sentence><sentence id="1070">She deteriorated very badly. </sentence><sentence id="1071">She was useless. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1080">Q: But she carried stones with you at Ravensbriick? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1082">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1084">Q: And when she was taken away, do you remember how that happened? </sentence><sentence id="1085">I mean, were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1088">A: I wasn't even there when she was taken. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I was in the -- I was sick with my finger, so I don't know the real details. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1092">Q: In the camp, tell me what you used as a support system. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Did you use your imagination? </sentence><sentence id="1094">Tell me about what -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

then they went to the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2119">To survive in camps for that many years, you have to do things, all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="2120">You have to be brutal. </sentence><sentence id="2121">You have to have some sort of position there. </sentence><sentence id="2122">You have to bribe. </sentence><sentence id="2123">In that way we were very innocent. </sentence><sentence id="2124">We were completely unaware of anything when we first came there. </sentence><sentence id="2125">Our experience with the selection, we had to stand naked in front of the -- I don't know -- doctor or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2126">You couldn't have a pimple on your body. </sentence><sentence id="2127">You had to be perfect for work, and then looking for the jewels, the vaginal experiments that -- it was -- the hell started right there. </sentence><sentence id="2128">We were stripped of every, every human trace of behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2129">The brutality, the killing, the siccing the dogs -- the dogs were sicced at the people. </sentence><sentence id="2130">They were ripping the people apart with the exception of me, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And they had pleasure, the people liked to look at it. </sentence><sentence id="2132">The same people who lived a normal life outside of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2133">They had two kinds of life, and they completely reconciled with it. </sentence><sentence id="2134">It was their work, and as they cleaned up in the war, they were assigned to it. </sentence><sentence id="2135">But they embellished their love of it. </sentence><sentence id="2136">They did it with pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="2137">They didn't have to sometimes to do things that they did, but it became a badge of honor. </sentence><sentence id="2138">Human beings reduced to beasts, unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="2139">To preserve sanity, to function after  8 surviving this war, I don't think that we are 100 percent, but we try to pull on our reserves from our background, from our civilized way of living, from our teachings, our parents, and our teachers. </sentence><sentence id="2140">We try to create environment for us, ourselves, for our children, and we try to share our knowledge and forewarn future generations of the horror of what human beings are capable of. </sentence><sentence id="2141">That we must be on guard. </sentence><sentence id="2142">We must protect. </sentence><sentence id="2143">We must speak up. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Like Pastor Niemoeller said in his very famous speech, which I don't remember verbatim, but he said, "First, they came for the cripples, and I said nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Then, they came for the Communists, and I said nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2146">Then, they came for the Catholics, I said" -- I don't remember completely. </sentence><sentence id="2147">"Then, they came for the Jews, and I said nothing because I was not one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2148">Then, they came for me, and there was nobody to speak up for me." </sentence><sentence id="2149">That's why we must have the red flag. </sentence><sentence id="2150">We must teach, we must educate, we must do the very least we can and we are capable of. </sentence><sentence id="2151">This is one of the reasons why I wanted so badly to come here and to speak up in my own little way to contribute from my past, from my knowledge, from my experience, from my broken down body. </sentence><sentence id="2152">To tell the people the horror, the tragedy, the Gehenna that we went through must never happen again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2214">Q: I think that I have covered everything that I had. </sentence><sentence id="2215">Do you have anything else that you want to talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2218">A: Well, I do hope that my message -- I don't know if it's going to be in the Archives, in Oral History Department or whatever, that it could be shared with people. </sentence><sentence id="2219">That I'm sure that many people before me said the same things, that they are being widely distributed. </sentence><sentence id="2220">I hope that in my own way I was able to impart and bare my soul and expose the horror that I was witness to and forewarn people and beg people to think and to pool their own resources. </sentence><sentence id="2221">To read, to see if there a movie of it. </sentence><sentence id="2222">Not be protected of themselves, like some people say, "I've seen enough of it. </sentence><sentence id="2223">I can't take it anymore." </sentence><sentence id="2224">I don't think it's right because once you see it, you're alerted. </sentence><sentence id="2225">It reinforces you. </sentence><sentence id="2226">It helps you. </sentence><sentence id="2227">That's why I feel that if one person can do something, it's important. </sentence><sentence id="2228">That's why Schindler was important because he was one. </sentence><sentence id="2229">His ideas maybe were different in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2230">Maybe he did this for personal gain, that's how he started. </sentence><sentence id="2231">But, eventually, he was the savior. </sentence><sentence id="2232">No matter what his motives were, he did save a group of people. </sentence><sentence id="2233">And these people multiplied, and they have future generations. </sentence><sentence id="2234">And they're grateful to him and his memory. </sentence><sentence id="2235">That's why individual counts. </sentence><sentence id="2236">That's my message. </sentence></p></dialogue>
