<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3942">A: My aunt. </sentence><sentence id="3943">My uncle was there, but he couldn't wait for three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3944">He -- they couldn't take three weeks off from work, so he had to go back to work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3948">Q: So she waited for three weeks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3950">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3952">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3954">A: Because that ship was supposed to come at a certain date, and it didn't, and she stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3956">Q: Hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3958">A: We stayed in a hotel after that, but she had friends in -- in New York, and I suppose she stayed with them before we came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3960">Q: But when you came she went to a hotel with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3962">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3964">Q: Did you then take a bath? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3982">Q: But now you were supposed to use it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3984">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3985">And she told us about putting hand lotion on after you -- after you wash your hands, so your skin doesn't get rough. </sentence><sentence id="3986">And I think she told us, never go barefoot on the floor, because you get athlete's foot. </sentence><sentence id="3987">We never heard of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3992">Q: So is this all before you get to Rochester? </sentence></p></dialogue>
