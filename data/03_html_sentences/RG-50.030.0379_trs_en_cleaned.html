<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Hello Maria, welcome to Washington. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Thank you, Joan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Could you tell me the name that you were born with and when and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="8">I was born December 26, 1918, which in Poland is Christmas, so I'm a Christmas child. </sentence><sentence id="9">And I was born in the city of Kolomyja, which at the time I was born was Poland, it was newly created Poland. </sentence><sentence id="10">Before then, it was Hapsberg, Austria. </sentence><sentence id="11">Therefore, my parents spoke German and I was brought up in the German language. </sentence><sentence id="12">My parents eventually learned some Polish but they didn't like the language, so at home the language was German. </sentence><sentence id="13">When I came to school I naturally had to learn Polish so at the age of five-and-a-half I entered a Polish school in Kolo-mier (ph) and I said something in Polish which didn't sound right because it was not my initial language. </sentence><sentence id="14">So the children, including the teacher, started laughing, making fun of me. </sentence><sentence id="15">Naturally, it was quite traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="16">I ran home crying, crying I'Il never go to school again. </sentence><sentence id="17">Well, I did go back. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I've been a student for many, many years later. </sentence><sentence id="19">Interesting enough, when I thought about this experience many years ago, I think it played an important role in my later life choice of Polish as the aid of concentrations university, strange as it may sound. </sentence><sentence id="20">But there are some dynamics that turned it upright anyway so this was my experience. </sentence><sentence id="21">Actually, I was writing still, I still am, and German and Polish are pretty much my languages even though, although they have both deteriorated. </sentence><sentence id="22">Well, the way I remember Kolomyja, it was a small town, although it wasn't small to the eyes of a child. </sentence><sentence id="23">And later when I visited the smaller towns, the villages around, it seemed that Kolomyja was big. </sentence><sentence id="24">It's an interesting thing about Kolomyja that, as I write about it just years later, many years later, that Ta- pan-gee (ph) was an important city during the earlier centuries. </sentence><sentence id="25">It's very old. </sentence><sentence id="26">They just celebrated seven hundred and fifty years of the birth of the town and they say it goes back even further. </sentence><sentence id="27">It was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="28">It is not

collection ransacked, it was demolished, it was burned all the way, many times, first by the Tartars, then by the Mongols, or vise-versa, then by the Cossacks. </sentence><sentence id="30">There were endless destruction's and occupations of Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="31">I do not know how far my father's family goes back. </sentence><sentence id="32">The name was Hiersch (ph) and I was born as Matylda Hirsch. </sentence><sentence id="33">My parents wanted to Polonaise my name because that was important for them, I assume, as many parents do, but at home I was called Mattie because my parents spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="34">My father spoke Yiddish with many of his helpers in the store and business with some of the people in the community, but my mother was very snobbish about it. </sentence><sentence id="35">She came from another city called Chad- no-vich (ph). </sentence><sentence id="36">Czernowitz was a bigger city, it was a very snobbish city, it was, they called themselves small Paris, little Paris. </sentence><sentence id="37">Her parents lived there. </sentence><sentence id="38">Actually, I knew only her father because her mother died just before I was born and I was named after her mother. </sentence><sentence id="39">So she had that air of Czernowitz about her and she despised Kolomyja and she despised Ukrainian town and she despised the Polish people and she didn't want to hear any of the Yiddish language. </sentence><sentence id="40">So, sadly enough, I was brought up in the German language and German was the language, but certainly I spoke Polish later and, with my girlfriends it was always Polish. </sentence><sentence id="41">There was a city itself, I saw it only forty years ago for the first time I went back. </sentence><sentence id="42">It's a handsome city now and as I read some of it's history, it had a rich history, over the centuries it was a town in which a lot of trade was going on. </sentence><sentence id="43">It was on the tracks between Poland and Austria and Romania, so apparently business and trade was very important. </sentence><sentence id="44">My own father came from a whole generation of people who owned the same store, the same business. </sentence><sentence id="45">This was porcelain and enamel and glass. </sentence><sentence id="46">So we always had the very beautiful table settings because of their availability. </sentence><sentence id="47">I remember that when my older sister got married, and her husband didn't have a profession, so my father took him into the business. </sentence><sentence id="48">But smartly gave him a special division of it, so he became the importer of chandeliers. </sentence><sentence id="49">It all sounds very, very strange but this was back in our time. </sentence><sentence id="50">My father was Orthodox, my mother came also This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="51">It is not the primary

a religious family, but not as Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="53">So there was a little bit cheating, I suppose, but she wore a wig because it was important in our home town. </sentence><sentence id="54">My father was a follower of Rabbi, he was a Hasidic, a follower of a Rabbi called Wishnitz, he came from the city of Vinnitsa. </sentence><sentence id="55">Apparently he was important in the Rabbinical dynasty and as a child I remember the Wishnitz (ph) Rabbi coming and staying in our home and I didn't like it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: What's the difference in age between you and your sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Five years each, five years each. </sentence><sentence id="153">My older sister was Cyla, C-Y-L-A if you want it, and there was a difference of twenty years between us all. </sentence><sentence id="154">I'm not sure, but something like it. </sentence><sentence id="155">She married Jacob Goldstein, a man from Lvov who didn't have money and didn't have much of a profession, but he was the son of a Talmudist and to my father, that was important. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, there was a tremendous wedding, all my sisters had tremendous weddings except me, and their only son, Menek, survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="157">I don't know whether I should go into, she was killed in the last days of the ghetto and her husband was transported to the Belzec Extermination Camp in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="158">Anyway, that was my sister, Cyla, and she lived a pretty middle-class, it was pretty prosperous. </sentence><sentence id="159">Her hobby was to do petite work, petite point, and I remember her beautiful pictures on the walls, all her own work. </sentence><sentence id="160">This was her hobby. </sentence><sentence id="161">She was well known in town, she had girlfriends and when their son was born, it was a great thing because he was the only boy in the family, until then we had nothing but girls. </sentence><sentence id="162">Now the next sister was Frieda, her name, my sister Cyla, was Cyla Goldstein, that was her name and her son is Menek Goldstein, and he survived. </sentence><sentence id="163">My next sister was Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="164">She was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="165">Frieda married a man who was a cousin, a second cousin. </sentence><sentence id="166">He came from Cal-es-sa-bot (ph), from a resort town, very well known spot in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="167">His father was a brother of my father, but that was of a different mother so they were step-brothers. </sentence><sentence id="168">And therefore, it was permitted for them to marry, even so, they worried that they're offspring may suffer from it and be mentally retarded, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="169">She ain't, she's a doctor of eye diseases. </sentence><sentence id="170">She turned out to be okay. </sentence><sentence id="171">But this wedding, I remember vaguely. </sentence><sentence id="172">I only remember my dress, I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was the most beautiful dress I've ever had. </sentence><sentence id="174">And their wedding was held in Stanislawow, a city a little bit bigger than Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="175">This is somehow, I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="176">No, she lived in Karlsbad (ph) which means she lived in a privileged place because Karlsbad (ph) was a beautiful international spot and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection he was making a good living, he had many patients so it was sort of high life. </sentence><sentence id="179">Anyway, in 1938 Hitler occupied . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Wait, you've missed a sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Oh, you want to go this way, sure. </sentence><sentence id="212">Then the younger sister, also five years younger, is Frania. </sentence><sentence id="213">Frania survived. </sentence><sentence id="214">By the way, my sister Frieda survived and in Czechoslovakia they got out of Dorosig into Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="215">She's still alive, she's unfortunately in a nursing home now and her husband died a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="216">Then, there's my sister, Frania. </sentence><sentence id="217">She's alive, she lives in my neighborhood, her husband was killed, and they're child, Laszek, Alex, was about three years old in the ghetto and miraculously he survived and he lives in New York City. </sentence><sentence id="218">Though she later re-married and her second husband adopted him so his name is Alex Gitterman. </sentence><sentence id="219">And then comes me. </sentence><sentence id="220">I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="221">No, my sisters still had a background of Hapsberg, Austria, although Frania was very young then. </sentence><sentence id="222">In 1916 I believe, my parents ran from Kolomyja because of the war. </sentence><sentence id="223">And they came to, they ran to a place which is near Sigit, Marmorosk I think, which is where Wiesel comes from, which was a border of Romania and Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="224">There were large Jewish communities there. </sentence><sentence id="225">My father went into hiding there because the Austrian army was busy trying to find men to fight their war, they needed my father naturally, so they lived a very, very difficult kind of life. </sentence><sentence id="226">I think they lived in Mon-room-a-vot (ph). </sentence><sentence id="227">And at that time I still had another sister, whom I never met, she died right there. </sentence><sentence id="228">She was between Cyla and Frieda and I think she was fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to get to the hospital, she died right in my father's arms, I understand. </sentence><sentence id="229">Some things that I heard about years later, my parents didn't talk about it, but it was always in the air and I suspected that something happened there, but I say, I was born after, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="230">Only about ten years ago, walking in the beautiful woods of Switzerland, my mother's younger brother told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="231">They talked about her in some ways, her name was Yetta, but it was hushed-hushed and it was never quite This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="232">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="233"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection there. </sentence><sentence id="234">I'm sure that my childhood was spent in a family which suffered from depression, yet it was not, it was covered over. </sentence><sentence id="235">Probably because my father was a Hasidic and in the Hasidic tradition, joy and pain are mixed. </sentence><sentence id="236">So, I think so, in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex because it was a Hasidic family and my mother was, had that air of a bigger city with more civilization and the country in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic, so I would think I have the strength of all of that in some way in my own personality. </sentence><sentence id="237">But, I remember there were times of when my mother would cry and this was the anniversary, not only of the deaths of my sister and her daughter, but the death of her mother. </sentence><sentence id="238">They all lived in that hiding place near Sigit there and my grandmother, her mother, died of a heart attack, apparently still a young woman, so for my mother it must have been a horrible loss. </sentence><sentence id="239">She would go to visit her father later, she once took me to Czernowitz and this I remember. </sentence><sentence id="240">These things are very vague in my memory because they were not talked about, but it was there in the air and from time to time I would overhear something. </sentence><sentence id="241">There's a good possibility I tried to protect myself from the pain too. </sentence><sentence id="242">So I grew up in this family in which I was extremely important because only years back later, I could understand the importance of me. </sentence><sentence id="243">Because I had to replace all these losses, I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="244">So, I was an extremely overprotected child to the extent that I hated it, | was embarrassed by it. </sentence><sentence id="245">When I sneezed, there was immediately a doctor around me. </sentence><sentence id="246">When I went to school, and I forgot my breakfast, somebody from the store would knock at the door of my class and bring me the breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="247">My mother was extremely anxious about me and my parents over-protected me in a way which probably helped them some way but also did not. </sentence><sentence id="248">So my sister Frania, I think, was a little bit jealous, I never knew about it because no matter what I did was fine. </sentence><sentence id="249">Which means I wasn't prepared for the hardships of life that later came my way. </sentence><sentence id="250">I was a child who could never do wrong. </sentence><sentence id="251">And they thought I was bright and I did extremely well in school. </sentence><sentence id="252">To the end of my sister because she didn't do so well, she was pretty and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="253">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="254"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection she liked to go with boys and she wasn't so interested in studies. </sentence><sentence id="255">I was, all of my, the grades were always above "A", you know? </sentence><sentence id="256">Once I brought a "B", I cried for weeks! </sentence><sentence id="257">I got a "B" in mathematics which was unbelievable because it was always "A's in other subjects and my preferred subject was Polish literature, romantic Polish literature.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="311">I was a child who was smart. </sentence><sentence id="312">I don't think I was pretty, my sisters were pretty, my two sisters, Frania and Frieda were very pretty, but I never experienced a sense that I wasn't okay. </sentence><sentence id="313">Looks didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="314">I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="315">I say I was, scholastically, I did so extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="316">My sister, Frania, still remembers with pain that when my mother would go to the teachers for the periodic visitations, they would say, how come your daughter, Frania, cannot do that well?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2886">A: Extremely important to have another body. </sentence><sentence id="2887">Not to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="2888">Being alone, being isolated was one of the great dangers. </sentence><sentence id="2889">You just couldn't hardly survive without having someone with you. </sentence><sentence id="2890">I remember days when I was very much isolated whenever things happened. </sentence><sentence id="2891">Blancka had to run, I had to run you know? </sentence><sentence id="2892">It was, it felt, you really couldn't live through it.

was always some hope that perhaps I'll find myself there, although I didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="2895">She encouraged me to go but how could I go? </sentence><sentence id="2896">For me the greatest danger was to go to the official employment bureau to ask for a job because to go to Germany you had to apply for a job there. </sentence><sentence id="2897">There had to be proof for a job there. </sentence><sentence id="2898">For me just to show myself, show my face in these offices was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="2899">So we maintained our contact mainly through correspondence at that point, but until then, we were extremely inter-dependent. </sentence><sentence id="2900">Her looks were helpful, I had more sense of danger I think, of reality, I was quick this way for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="2901">I think we complemented each other very well this way, but we were very close to each other and as I say, we were intimate in our relationship and I knew of the losses she suffered. </sentence><sentence id="2902">She knew very much of my family life. </sentence><sentence id="2903">She tried to steal some oranges in the hospital to bring to Lash-ick (ph) so we were very intertwined, extremely so. </sentence><sentence id="2904">And her absence left a tremendous void in my life, but more than that, a sense of danger too, that I'm all alone here. </sentence><sentence id="2905">I had no idea the war was coming to an end. </sentence><sentence id="2906">Coming back to it, I remember Bowl-ick (ph) and Helene Ko-vet-all-lich-al (ph) and

id="2914">On the British radio, on that radio we heard it later in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2915">So we celebrated each time, quietly. </sentence><sentence id="2916">We had such a double life, an official life and a life between each other. </sentence><sentence id="2917">We were extremely close, I would say, in a very intimate kind of relationship. </sentence><sentence id="2918">We maintained it later for many decades too. </sentence><sentence id="2919">But when she left, it was pretty, I did have some correspondence, I heard a little of it, that she was working in a household there. </sentence><sentence id="2920">She didn't seem to be in danger of any kind, danger of detection. </sentence><sentence id="2921">It was very soon afterwards we heard rumors that the Soviets are approaching, they are taking over large parts of Poland, the eastern part. </sentence><sentence id="2922">And one day, I remember, the German family for whom I worked just took off to their town in Germany and they didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="2923">And within a few days, the office workers also left. </sentence><sentence id="2924">And then I was all alone when I heard that the Soviets are approaching Warsaw, they're in Prague, in the suburb of Prague. </sentence><sentence id="2925">Being all alone, the telephone stopped working, I would have like to call Lodz, I would like to call Helena but I couldn't, but I was all alone, I figured, well, in a few hours or so the Soviets are going to be here, so walk out of the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2926">This was a German section, the Germans were not there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2927">There were Poles, and I knew the Soviets are coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2928">I didn't really think about my sister, Frania, she was involved with the child, I didn't know about Menek, although we did have some intermittent communication. </sentence><sentence id="2929">At one point, pretty much everything

</sentence><sentence id="2936">Well, before I knew, the Germans were coming back and the Poles seemed to be fighting both the Germans and the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="2937">I walked out in the street to see what's happening, I was terribly isolated by then. </sentence><sentence id="2938">I saw people running. </sentence><sentence id="2939">All the Polish people from the neighborhoods

moving, we fall asleep all of us. </sentence><sentence id="3060">Sometime in the middle of the night, or it was very early morning, one of the fighters wakes up and he starts talking to the other one, the Jews brought all the tragedy and the Jews will take over Poland because of the Soviets and they got us into all that trouble. </sentence><sentence id="3061">And one of these guys looks at the other and says, you know what, these two girls across from us, they look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3062">You better tell. </sentence><sentence id="3063">By then it was about four in the morning or so and it was just light, it was just coming, and then they fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="3064">And without saying another word to Hel-linka (ph), we motioned to each other that we're going to jump from the train. </sentence><sentence id="3065">I'm sure that the motivation was not to escape from that, the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3066">It is

that the train was being shipped out to Stutthof, which was a detention camp where Polish people were shipped in order to work for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3070">And we knew the beginning of the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when the Germans arrived to take us out. </sentence><sentence id="3071">So without saying a word to each other, the window was open, the train was moving very slowly, I can't remember who jumped first. </sentence><sentence id="3072">And I can't remember anything else except that I wake up in the home of a Polish woman in a town called Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3073">I never heard of the town, it's south of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3074">These women had attended me, given me a clean bed, attended to my wounds, told me the story of what happened after I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="3075">I don't know, it was a few days that I was pretty unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="3076">She said that when we jumped out a priest thought we were dead. </sentence><sentence id="3077">He was going to the cemetery to bury some body, he saw these two girls from the Warsaw uprising, so he figured he's going to bury us, with a decent Catholic burial. </sentence><sentence id="3078">When he noted that we were breathing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3079">So first he buried these people who he meant to bury, then he brought us to this Polish woman on the outskirts of Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3080">Poor woman but a very decent soul. </sentence><sentence id="3081">She was very happy to be able to be of service to these Polish revolutionaries, the Poles who fought, the Polish fighters who fought for independence of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3082">So she treated us beautifully, I could see how poor she was but she treated us extremely well, and one day a neighbor comes in and she opens the door to our room and she wants to tell him, these are two girls who were in the Polish resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="3083">He takes a look at us and he says, she look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3084">That night, Hel-linka (ph) was sick of me because she looked Polish, she said good-bye to me and I haven't seen her until years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3085">I saw her again about two years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3086">Hel-linka (ph) had blue eyes and she was blonde and she wanted out. </sentence><sentence id="3087">I stayed on, I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3088">The Polish woman was absolutely an angel, she said you have to go, you can't be here. </sentence><sentence id="3089">She wrapped up for me half her bread in a kerchief and two apples and early morning I leave. </sentence><sentence id="3090">I didn't know where I was going but, it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="3091">At that time, nothing mattered anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3092">I knew I wasn't afraid at all because I wasn't Jewish anymore, nobody would think of me as Jewish at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3093">Poland was falling apart.

out, I knew I was bandaged. </sentence><sentence id="3109">I didn't have lice. </sentence><sentence id="3110">I figured should I go back there, it's really not the place for me to go back, I'm afraid. </sentence><sentence id="3111">By then it was very late evening, I was extremely tired. </sentence><sentence id="3112">I was still so very sick. </sentence><sentence id="3113">I ate those apples and the rest of the bread and I stretched out on a bench. </sentence><sentence id="3114">It was a cold night, it was by then I think the end of September, beginning of October. </sentence><sentence id="3115">It was raining, drizzling, and I fell asleep and nothing matters. </sentence><sentence id="3116">Sometime in the middle of the night, somebody pushes me. </sentence><sentence id="3117">I open my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3118">A German soldier, a German policeman. </sentence><sentence id="3119">Come, he says to me. </sentence><sentence id="3120">I wasn't afraid. </sentence><sentence id="3121">He didn't know in the middle of the night that I was Jewish or anything, he was collecting all these homeless people to ship them out to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3122">So he brings me again to a place for cleaning, de-lousing, clean, I walk out clean. </sentence><sentence id="3123">I think they gave me something fresh to wear, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3124">And he brings me to an assembly hall where there are lots of Polish women. </sentence><sentence id="3125">All these women, collected from the street, are being shipped to Germany to work. </sentence><sentence id="3126">By then the Germans were loosing the war, their men where coming home on crutches. </sentence><sentence id="3127">Their women were sent to the front to work. </sentence><sentence id="3128">They didn't have enough workers so they were collecting Polish people all over. </sentence><sentence id="3129">I'm among Poles, therefore nobody knows I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3130">But, we get on a train, and then the man who is a greeter tells us we are going to go to Germany to work but before we do we are going to stop in Pat-o-vich-a (ph), which is a border town which by then was Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3131">And he takes us out and he says, I want you to sit in this corner, we were a few hundred people by then, to sit in this comer and to wait for the evening. </sentence><sentence id="3132">We are going to take an evening train and I'll come back in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="3133">We know you'll sit and rest here, will being some food. </sentence><sentence id="3134">I took a look at the group and I didn't know whether I looked at them or they looked at me but it didn't look to me kosher that I could survive with these Polish groups. </sentence><sentence id="3135">So I said, if I have to be back and see if I could walk away a little bit, so 1 walked away. </sentence><sentence id="3136">And here I could see Germany falling apart. </sentence><sentence id="3137">Many Polish people of German extraction, falk-stoich-er (ph), are coming into the station. </sentence><sentence id="3138">They are running from the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="3139">And at the station there are many soup kitchens supervised by German nurses, like the German Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="3140">So I

them that "m running from the Soviets so they give me one cup of soup and another cup of soup and a third cup of soup. </sentence><sentence id="3145">I remember milk so distinctly, finally I am full, I've eaten good food. </sentence><sentence id="3146">And this is a Sunday afternoon I believe and I walk out of the station. </sentence><sentence id="3147">Pat-o-vich-a (ph) is not touched, it is a German city, it's an industrial city, it was the biggest textile city after Manchester, I knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="3148">And I see the stores full of fabrics, I couldn't believe what's going on here. </sentence><sentence id="3149">I came from the ashes, literally from the ashes of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="3150">And I walk and I don't know where to walk, I figure I have to walk away from that Polish group. </sentence><sentence id="3151">Let's see if I can get to Heidleburg because I'm wanted in Germany, and since everybody's running. </sentence><sentence id="3152">I'm not Jewish, everybody's running, the German, the falk-stoich-er (ph) are running, the Poles are running. </sentence><sentence id="3153">The Poles couldn't run they are too but the Germans were running from their home. </sentence><sentence id="3154">So I see a Hitler parade, and believe it or not, this is the funniest thing in my life! </sentence><sentence id="3155">I joined the Hitler parade and I go like this, Heil Hitler! </sentence><sentence id="3156">Heil Hitler! . </sentence><sentence id="3157">First they had soldiers in brown shoes, but then people talked, it was Sunday

only woman. </sentence><sentence id="3158">I say, oh, that's very dangerous, so | hide in the restroom. </sentence><sentence id="3159">In an hour or so, they need the restroom and start yelling to get out, I get out, they look at me, and by sheer luck because I have to think it was luck you know, the train stops. </sentence><sentence id="3160">It was the city of Dresden. </sentence><sentence id="3161">So I walk out at the station and the train goes away, it goes wherever they went. </sentence><sentence id="3162">I walk, it was very quiet I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3163">It was by then, was morning, early morning hours. </sentence><sentence id="3164">I walk into town and I sit down in a cafe, I didn't have money but I figure I would sit down, rest stop. </sentence><sentence id="3165">And so the new bombs came. </sentence><sentence id="3166">This was the great bombing of Dresden, it was an earlier bombing. </sentence><sentence id="3167">You see R-A-F, this was the British Air Force. </sentence><sentence id="3168">The best feeling in this world, that I'm going to die of a bomb, what can be better? </sentence><sentence id="3169">I remember even bombs in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3170">At one point, the British were bombing Warsaw and I stayed in a household there, not with the Germans, it was in a Polish place, I had a furnished room, and people were running to shelter. </sentence><sentence id="3171">So these people called me, come! </sentence><sentence id="3172">Come with us to the shelter! </sentence><sentence id="3173">And I did everything possible not to go to the shelter, I wanted to be killed by a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="3174">Couldn't be a better death. </sentence><sentence id="3175">And I recall doing this, putting my feet up and my head into my legs, hoping that when a bomb kills me that it will kill all of me rather than just some legs or the head separates. </sentence><sentence id="3176">This was my dream, to be killed that way. </sentence><sentence id="3177">I really didn't want to live, so when people say they tried to survive, they wanted to live, I really didn't want to live but I didn't want to die detected by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3178">I was afraid of that death. </sentence><sentence id="3179">But I've seen before how people were killed and their leg was hung there and I was there and this to me was a horror, so I remember that night of bombing. </sentence><sentence id="3180">I didn't go to the shelter but I waited for the bomb, the bomb didn't come to me. </sentence><sentence id="3181">So this is Desden, and I sit in a cafe and the second floor of that cafe is coming down and I'm sitting there literally, seeing the bombs, and things happen, it's like an earth-sukkotke, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3182">It sounds like an earth- sukkotke. </sentence><sentence id="3183">And I see many people are dead in the street and here I walk out alive. </sentence><sentence id="3184">I was meant to live and that's all they can say, why I wasn't killed I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3185">So hours later, I walked down to the railway station. </sentence><sentence id="3186">I still have in mind if I'm alive I want to go to Heidleburg, so I get a train. </sentence><sentence id="3187">It was some sort of a civilian train. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="3192">But mainly from the eastern part of Germany, which was originally Poland. </sentence><sentence id="3193">Finally I see this train stops at Frankfurt and before I get out bombs come over Frankfurt, this was a little bit too much, unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="3194">But this was the time of the greatest bombing of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3195">So the railway station is all in fire again and many passengers walk out alive and many passengers are killed right there. </sentence><sentence id="3196">And I'm alive. </sentence><sentence id="3197">It's fantastic! </sentence><sentence id="3198">So I figured, now I have to go from Frankfurt to Heidleburg, certainly no trains anymore, the railway station is all in flames. </sentence><sentence id="3199">I see people walking, I follow them, they are walking to the highway to hitchhike. </sentence><sentence id="3200">So I hitchhike too, I'm a German you know! </sentence><sentence id="3201">I'm a falk- stoich-er (ph), poor, dear soul. </sentence><sentence id="3202">I'm better qualified to be falk-stoich-er (ph) than anybody else here because those who live for generations in Poland is falk-stoich-er (ph), that and German, they didn't speak German they didn't know a thing. </sentence><sentence id="3203">I'm certainly much more , So I go with them. </sentence><sentence id="3204">And they start hitchhiking, so I get on a truck, I remember the truck goes only a little place, he leaves me there, I had to hitchhike again. </sentence><sentence id="3205">Must have been six modes of transportation, finally a train goes somewhere between Mannheim and Heidleburg. </sentence><sentence id="3206">I arrive at Heidleburg, I arrive intact in Heidleburg. </sentence><sentence

the children to school, each child leaving for school with the, Heil Hitler, Maria! </sentence><sentence id="3233">This was the greeting, the morning greeting. </sentence><sentence id="3234">The lady

worked in her household and I worked in mine. </sentence><sentence id="3273">For me the work was unbelievably heavy, I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="3274">I just didn't have the strength of rolling out these very heavy rugs, carpets. </sentence><sentence id="3275">Putting them on the snow and beating them on the snow because most Europeans believed that when you beat these heavy carpets

made it and we send it to him. </sentence><sentence id="3903">This began his healing process. </sentence><sentence id="3904">The Joint had ideas that you have to train these young people for jobs that are available so according to them, this was the time that they needed book binders. </sentence><sentence id="3905">So he went to them to become a book binder. </sentence><sentence id="3906">Since then, P've always been telling my students that you have to do rehabilitation towards not what is available but as part of the value system and his value system, a book binder was not for him.

all of it, he was apparently brilliant, we didn't know it because he was not a great student in gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="3926">The motivation was how he did so very well.

leaving. </sentence><sentence id="3953">This stays with me, this moment, these moments of separation stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="3954">These are still the most difficult moments in the

id="4171">Very dull work, terribly dull work. </sentence><sentence id="4172">But I remember the day when a telegram was sent to every employee, that they reached their quota of $250 million dollars, in 1947, signed by Morgan-tow (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4173">Henry Morgan-tow (ph) was the chief of the UJA then. </sentence><sentence id="4174">And here it said that the executive director was Henry Montor (ph), I don't know if you know the name, it was a big name in those days. </sentence><sentence id="4175">You deal with forty, sixty bro-ter (ph), Henry Montor(ph) was in charge of the

</sentence><sentence id="4185">It was a good time until one day I had, I lived already in the city by there, until one day I get this call from the United Service for New Americans, which is known NYANA, New York Association for New Americans. </sentence><sentence id="4186">They've always been in the business of helping refugees. </sentence><sentence id="4187">And they say, when I first came to America I had one visit with them, asking for work, and they said, what I want to do? </sentence><sentence id="4188">So I said, what I want to do was what I did for the Joint in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4189">They say, oh no, this is social work, for this you need a degree. </sentence><sentence id="4190">They were stupid because I had languages and all these displaced persons

social work. </sentence><sentence id="4202">And he interviewed me, he wanted to know my childhood and everything. </sentence><sentence id="4203">Just to put it on record. </sentence><sentence id="4204">They were so limited, they never asked me about my Holocaust experience. </sentence><sentence id="4205">My childhood, my relation with my mother, my relation with my father, my relation with my siblings. </sentence><sentence id="4206">This took hours and hours, everyday an interview. </sentence><sentence id="4207">The final one with Dr. Serrett (ph) and he apparently approved so I got in. </sentence><sentence id="4208">But to the sukkotme of the psychiatry profession, that nobody asked about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="4209">It was a non-subject in those days. </sentence><sentence id="4210">This was 1949, 1950. </sentence><sentence id="4211">Well, for some reason he chose me and I got in and I was very unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="4212">I didn't understand what this study was all about. </sentence><sentence id="4213">He usually came from the study of sociology, psychology, I was student of Polish literature. </sentence><sentence id="4214">They talked language which I didn't understand and I figured, how can I withdraw, how will I get my old job back? </sentence><sentence id="4215">It was very painful to me until the second semester, things began to go extremely well, let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="4216">Nothing helps like a little success and a teacher just read my paper, which I thought was nothing, they all thought was excellent. </sentence><sentence id="4217">Anyway, it was great and I was graded very well. </sentence><sentence id="4218">So this is how I got into the profession. </sentence><sentence id="4219">I had no money. </sentence><sentence id="4220">I lived in a, it was amazing, with a Jewish family in, near Columbia University. </sentence><sentence id="4221">Six dollars a week, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="4222">I didn't have enough money to live. </sentence><sentence id="4223">My scholarship was paid by the University but there was a foundation for Jewish girls and they were giving me $25 a week, which would have lasted except that my field work in social work, three days a week you have to be in the field. </sentence><sentence id="4224">And this idiot arranged my field work to be New Jersey. </sentence><sentence id="4225">So I had a lot of expenses and the school was in Adel-fy (ph) so $20 or whatever, $18 of that money went for travel. </sentence><sentence id="4226">When I was finally selected by the committee to enter the school, the dean congratulated me and he asked me whether I want to study case work, and I didn't know what case work was, so I say, what does social work have to do with cheese? </sentence><sentence id="4227">Because case in German means cheese! </sentence><sentence id="4228">He started laughing and was still laughing when I left, this was my preparation for social work, but I made it. </sentence><sentence id="4229">And I did well. </sentence><sentence id="4230">My second placement, they helped me, also in New Jersey. </sentence><sentence id="4231">They couldn't find a place for me in New York, they were very stupid about it. </sentence><sentence id="4232">It was in a State Psychiatric Hospital.

</sentence><sentence id="4238">It was very hard on me but it was the second year and I hadn't done very well, so I graduated anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4239">Since then I've had good jobs and been a social worker since then. </sentence><sentence id="4240">I retired. </sentence><sentence id="4241">I actually worked for Washington, for the Federal Government, I worked for nine years for the National Institute of Mental Health. </sentence><sentence id="4242">These were special projects and drug addition. </sentence><sentence id="4243">And I was a supervisor in a big agency then and I use to commute and come to Washington and they were very large with money. </sentence><sentence id="4244">This was the end of 1950's, early 1960's. </sentence><sentence id="4245">Johnson's programs spent a lot of money for rehabilitation, for human services. </sentence><sentence id="4246">They insisted I should travel first class because I had a high rank, GS-12 in those days were the high rank. </sentence><sentence id="4247">It was not becoming for a person with this GS grade to, not to go in important ways. </sentence><sentence id="4248">Anyway, there was a lot of stupid money spending. </sentence><sentence id="4249">We didn't rehabilitate too many people I can tell you, but it was an easy job and prestigious job. </sentence><sentence id="4250">They sent me to be trained at Lexington, Kentucky where they had the United States Public Health Hospital for tubercular diseases later on. </sentence><sentence id="4251">Our job was to visit every agency and hospital in New York City, open up the doors for drug addicts. </sentence><sentence id="4252">We did it, it was a whole new thing. </sentence><sentence id="4253">A new ball game for me totally, but we accomplished a lot in this respect, not that drug addicts were not rehabilitated easily but I have been involved in it for many years. </sentence><sentence id="4254">And then one day, again, I was re-married in 1962 and my husband was a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="4255">He had long vacations, he wanted his wife to go on vacations but I only had four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4256">One day we came back from a summer vacation, there's a letter from the then Dean of the School of Social Work at Tall-a-dot (ph) who remembered me because he was my research professor at Adel-fy (ph).It was a new school
