<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Hello Maria, welcome to Washington. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Thank you, Joan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Could you tell me the name that you were born with and when and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was born December 26, 1918, which in Poland is Christmas, so I'm a Christmas child. </sentence><sentence id="11">And I was born in the city of Kolomyja, which at the time I was born was Poland, it was newly created Poland. </sentence><sentence id="12">Before then, it was Hapsberg, Austria. </sentence><sentence id="13">Therefore, my parents spoke German and I was brought up in the German language. </sentence><sentence id="14">My parents eventually learned some Polish but they didn't like the language, so at home the language was German. </sentence><sentence id="15">When I came to school I naturally had to learn Polish so at the age of five-and-a-half I entered a Polish school in Kolo-mier (ph) and I said something in Polish which didn't sound right because it was not my initial language. </sentence><sentence id="16">So the children, including the teacher, started laughing, making fun of me. </sentence><sentence id="17">Naturally, it was quite traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="18">I ran home crying, crying I'Il never go to school again. </sentence><sentence id="19">Well, I did go back. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I've been a student for many, many years later. </sentence><sentence id="21">Interesting enough, when I thought about this experience many years ago, I think it played an important role in my later life choice of Polish as the aid of concentrations university, strange as it may sound. </sentence><sentence id="22">But there are some dynamics that turned it upright anyway so this was my experience. </sentence><sentence id="23">Actually, I was writing still, I still am, and German and Polish are pretty much my languages even though, although they have both deteriorated. </sentence><sentence id="24">Well, the way I remember Kolomyja, it was a small town, although it wasn't small to the eyes of a child. </sentence><sentence id="25">And later when I visited the smaller towns, the villages around, it seemed that Kolomyja was big. </sentence><sentence id="26">It's an interesting thing about Kolomyja that, as I write about it just years later, many years later, that Ta- pan-gee (ph) was an important city during the earlier centuries. </sentence><sentence id="27">It's very old. </sentence><sentence id="28">They just celebrated seven hundred and fifty years of the birth of the town and they say it goes back even further. </sentence><sentence id="29">It was    ransacked, it was demolished, it was burned all the way, many times, first by the Tartars, then by the Mongols, or vise-versa, then by the Cossacks. </sentence><sentence id="30">There were endless destruction's and occupations of Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="31">I do not know how far my father's family goes back. </sentence><sentence id="32">The name was Hiersch (ph) and I was born as Matylda Hirsch. </sentence><sentence id="33">My parents wanted to Polonaise my name because that was important for them, I assume, as many parents do, but at home I was called Mattie because my parents spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="34">My father spoke Yiddish with many of his helpers in the store and business with some of the people in the community, but my mother was very snobbish about it. </sentence><sentence id="35">She came from another city called Chad- no-vich (ph). </sentence><sentence id="36">Czernowitz was a bigger city, it was a very snobbish city, it was, they called themselves small Paris, little Paris. </sentence><sentence id="37">Her parents lived there. </sentence><sentence id="38">Actually, I knew only her father because her mother died just before I was born and I was named after her mother. </sentence><sentence id="39">So she had that air of Czernowitz about her and she despised Kolomyja and she despised Ukrainian town and she despised the Polish people and she didn't want to hear any of the Yiddish language. </sentence><sentence id="40">So, sadly enough, I was brought up in the German language and German was the language, but certainly I spoke Polish later and, with my girlfriends it was always Polish. </sentence><sentence id="41">There was a city itself, I saw it only forty years ago for the first time I went back. </sentence><sentence id="42">It's a handsome city now and as I read some of it's history, it had a rich history, over the centuries it was a town in which a lot of trade was going on. </sentence><sentence id="43">It was on the tracks between Poland and Austria and Romania, so apparently business and trade was very important. </sentence><sentence id="44">My own father came from a whole generation of people who owned the same store, the same business. </sentence><sentence id="45">This was porcelain and enamel and glass. </sentence><sentence id="46">So we always had the very beautiful table settings because of their availability. </sentence><sentence id="47">I remember that when my older sister got married, and her husband didn't have a profession, so my father took him into the business. </sentence><sentence id="48">But smartly gave him a special division of it, so he became the importer of chandeliers. </sentence><sentence id="49">It all sounds very, very strange but this was back in our time. </sentence><sentence id="50">My father was Orthodox, my mother came also from a religious family, but not as Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="51">So there was a little bit cheating, I suppose, but she wore a wig because it was important in our home town. </sentence><sentence id="52">My father was a follower of Rabbi, he was a Hasidic, a follower of a Rabbi called Wishnitz, he came from the city of Vinnitsa. </sentence><sentence id="53">Apparently he was important in the Rabbinical dynasty and as a child I remember the Wishnitz (ph) Rabbi coming and staying in our home and I didn't like it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: I was crushed by the, by the tone of all these people. </sentence><sentence id="104">He would come, I was very young then, he would come Thursday night for Sukkotbat. </sentence><sentence id="105">So on Thursday night, from the railway station, he would come escorted by about 200 hus-a-dem (ph), some from his own entourage" and some from our home town, and because it was dark, it was evening, they would come with, the German name comes back, "Falken", these lightings, strobes carried in the street, torches, right? </sentence><sentence id="106">Now it comes back. </sentence><sentence id="107">I sometimes think in German from my childhood years. </sentence><sentence id="108">So they were full of torches and to the dark night of my home town, which was very Anti-Semitic, although I wasn't exposed to it, I sensed it, and the women would stand on the balcony and greet them, saw them coming in. </sentence><sentence id="109">Since I was so young, to me this was an overwhelming picture and I said I didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="110">They all came into our house, which was big and he would give him the biggest room. </sentence><sentence id="111">In front of his room was a Gabbai, a Gabbai was the assistant of the man who collected the quitels, and quitels is something that a Jew would write out on a paper asking the Rabbi for advice. </sentence><sentence id="112">So together with the paper I assume that the Rabbi got the money too. </sentence><sentence id="113">I suspect it so. </sentence><sentence id="114">But anyway, the Gabbai stood in front of our living room where the Rabbi held court and he would see people. </sentence><sentence id="115">Hundreds of people would walk through our home. </sentence><sentence id="116">And to me this was overwhelming, very unhappy kind of experience. </sentence><sentence id="117">I was the youngest and I think on me it worked more than on my sisters because I was already born into Poland, it made a difference. </sentence><sentence id="118">Since I'm the youngest, my experience of learning school and otherwise was different than that of my older sisters. </sentence><sentence id="119">It shows you the meaning of history. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: What's the difference in age between you and your sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Five years each, five years each. </sentence><sentence id="140">My older sister was Cyla, C-Y-L-A if you want it, and there was a difference of twenty years between us all. </sentence><sentence id="141">I'm not sure, but something like it. </sentence><sentence id="142">She married Jacob Goldstein, a man from Lvov who didn't have money and didn't have much of a profession, but he was the son of a Talmudist and to my father, that was important. </sentence><sentence id="143">So, there was a tremendous wedding, all my sisters had tremendous weddings except me, and their only son, Menek, survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="144">I don't know whether I should go into, she was killed in the last days of the ghetto and her husband was transported to the Belzec Extermination Camp in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="145">Anyway, that was my sister, Cyla, and she lived a pretty middle-class, it was pretty prosperous. </sentence><sentence id="146">Her hobby was to do petite work, petite point, and I remember her beautiful pictures on the walls, all her own work. </sentence><sentence id="147">This was her hobby. </sentence><sentence id="148">She was well known in town, she had girlfriends and when their son was born, it was a great thing because he was the only boy in the family, until then we had nothing but girls. </sentence><sentence id="149">Now the next sister was Frieda, her name, my sister Cyla, was Cyla Goldstein, that was her name and her son is Menek Goldstein, and he survived. </sentence><sentence id="150">My next sister was Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="151">She was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="152">Frieda married a man who was a cousin, a second cousin. </sentence><sentence id="153">He came from Cal-es-sa-bot (ph), from a resort town, very well known spot in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="154">His father was a brother of my father, but that was of a different mother so they were step-brothers. </sentence><sentence id="155">And therefore, it was permitted for them to marry, even so, they worried that they're offspring may suffer from it and be mentally retarded, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="156">She ain't, she's a doctor of eye diseases. </sentence><sentence id="157">She turned out to be okay. </sentence><sentence id="158">But this wedding, I remember vaguely. </sentence><sentence id="159">I only remember my dress, I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="160">It was the most beautiful dress I've ever had. </sentence><sentence id="161">And their wedding was held in Stanislawow, a city a little bit bigger than Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="162">This is somehow, I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="163">No, she lived in Karlsbad (ph) which means she lived in a privileged place because Karlsbad (ph) was a beautiful international spot and    he was making a good living, he had many patients so it was sort of high life. </sentence><sentence id="164">Anyway, in 1938 Hitler occupied . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Wait, you've missed a sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Oh, you want to go this way, sure. </sentence><sentence id="195">Then the younger sister, also five years younger, is Frania. </sentence><sentence id="196">Frania survived. </sentence><sentence id="197">By the way, my sister Frieda survived and in Czechoslovakia they got out of Dorosig into Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="198">She's still alive, she's unfortunately in a nursing home now and her husband died a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="199">Then, there's my sister, Frania. </sentence><sentence id="200">She's alive, she lives in my neighborhood, her husband was killed, and they're child, Laszek, Alex, was about three years old in the ghetto and miraculously he survived and he lives in New York City. </sentence><sentence id="201">Though she later re-married and her second husband adopted him so his name is Alex Gitterman. </sentence><sentence id="202">And then comes me. </sentence><sentence id="203">I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="204">No, my sisters still had a background of Hapsberg, Austria, although Frania was very young then. </sentence><sentence id="205">In 1916 I believe, my parents ran from Kolomyja because of the war. </sentence><sentence id="206">And they came to, they ran to a place which is near Sigit, Marmorosk I think, which is where Wiesel comes from, which was a border of Romania and Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="207">There were large Jewish communities there. </sentence><sentence id="208">My father went into hiding there because the Austrian army was busy trying to find men to fight their war, they needed my father naturally, so they lived a very, very difficult kind of life. </sentence><sentence id="209">I think they lived in Mon-room-a-vot (ph). </sentence><sentence id="210">And at that time I still had another sister, whom I never met, she died right there. </sentence><sentence id="211">She was between Cyla and Frieda and I think she was fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to get to the hospital, she died right in my father's arms, I understand. </sentence><sentence id="212">Some things that I heard about years later, my parents didn't talk about it, but it was always in the air and I suspected that something happened there, but I say, I was born after, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="213">Only about ten years ago, walking in the beautiful woods of Switzerland, my mother's younger brother told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="214">They talked about her in some ways, her name was Yetta, but it was hushed-hushed and it was never quite    there. </sentence><sentence id="215">I'm sure that my childhood was spent in a family which suffered from depression, yet it was not, it was covered over. </sentence><sentence id="216">Probably because my father was a Hasidic and in the Hasidic tradition, joy and pain are mixed. </sentence><sentence id="217">So, I think so, in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex because it was a Hasidic family and my mother was, had that air of a bigger city with more civilization and the country in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic, so I would think I have the strength of all of that in some way in my own personality. </sentence><sentence id="218">But, I remember there were times of when my mother would cry and this was the anniversary, not only of the deaths of my sister and her daughter, but the death of her mother. </sentence><sentence id="219">They all lived in that hiding place near Sigit there and my grandmother, her mother, died of a heart attack, apparently still a young woman, so for my mother it must have been a horrible loss. </sentence><sentence id="220">She would go to visit her father later, she once took me to Czernowitz and this I remember. </sentence><sentence id="221">These things are very vague in my memory because they were not talked about, but it was there in the air and from time to time I would overhear something. </sentence><sentence id="222">There's a good possibility I tried to protect myself from the pain too. </sentence><sentence id="223">So I grew up in this family in which I was extremely important because only years back later, I could understand the importance of me. </sentence><sentence id="224">Because I had to replace all these losses, I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="225">So, I was an extremely overprotected child to the extent that I hated it, | was embarrassed by it. </sentence><sentence id="226">When I sneezed, there was immediately a doctor around me. </sentence><sentence id="227">When I went to school, and I forgot my breakfast, somebody from the store would knock at the door of my class and bring me the breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="228">My mother was extremely anxious about me and my parents over-protected me in a way which probably helped them some way but also did not. </sentence><sentence id="229">So my sister Frania, I think, was a little bit jealous, I never knew about it because no matter what I did was fine. </sentence><sentence id="230">Which means I wasn't prepared for the hardships of life that later came my way. </sentence><sentence id="231">I was a child who could never do wrong. </sentence><sentence id="232">And they thought I was bright and I did extremely well in school. </sentence><sentence id="233">To the end of my sister because she didn't do so well, she was pretty and she liked to go with boys and she wasn't so interested in studies. </sentence><sentence id="234">I was, all of my, the grades were always above "A", you know? </sentence><sentence id="235">Once I brought a "B", I cried for weeks! </sentence><sentence id="236">I got a "B" in mathematics which was unbelievable because it was always "A's in other subjects and my preferred subject was Polish literature, romantic Polish literature. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Did this create a problem between you and your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="285">I was a child who was smart. </sentence><sentence id="286">I don't think I was pretty, my sisters were pretty, my two sisters, Frania and Frieda were very pretty, but I never experienced a sense that I wasn't okay. </sentence><sentence id="287">Looks didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="289">I say I was, scholastically, I did so extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="290">My sister, Frania, still remembers with pain that when my mother would go to the teachers for the periodic visitations, they would say, how come your daughter, Frania, cannot do that well? [ </sentence><sentence id="291">I'm sure it didn't do her any good, but that's what she remembers. </sentence><sentence id="292">But she was very pretty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Tell me a little bit about your violin playing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: Oh, how do you know this? </sentence><sentence id="305">As, I must have been six years old, eight years old, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="306">My parents hired a violin teacher for Frania and myself. </sentence><sentence id="307">And we didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="308">But anyway, I mastered in playing the Hatikva so every Saturday night, many guests, our house was full of guests always. </sentence><sentence id="309">I think I still carry this tradition to some extent. </sentence><sentence id="310">We had to play, the ha-tic-fa (ph) had to play, a few other things. </sentence><sentence id="311">It was not something that I really liked very much. </sentence><sentence id="312">Probably I couldn't identify with the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="313">We also had a teacher of Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="314">Darlis Bate (ph). </sentence><sentence id="315">And him we hated! </sentence><sentence id="316">He was a poor, old Jew who didn't know to teach. </sentence><sentence id="317">My sister and I use to bribe him, give him a zloty and he would go, he would leave earlier. </sentence><sentence id="318">Unfortunately, we didn't learn much so until these days, I cannot read any of the Hebrew text and I'm sorry about it, I wish I could. </sentence><sentence id="319">But this was my mother, my mother looked away because it wasn't as important to her and as girls, we were not suppose to learn much of the Hebrew text. </sentence><sentence id="320">We never was suppose to go to synagogue until you're married so I never    went to synagogue because when I married, the war was on and I've never gone to a synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="321">I remember, right after the war, there was some gathering of the American soldiers and I was included and it was in a synagogue in Heidelberg, I'm not even sure, but occasionally I go now to religious service but a synagogue is not part of my life and this is because of my background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Were your friends primarily, if not all together, Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: All were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="344">Well, in primary school, what you call, elementary school, there were non- Jewish students too. </sentence><sentence id="345">I do not recall contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="346">I had two close friends, both were neighbors on both sides of our house. </sentence><sentence id="347">We use to visit with each other. </sentence><sentence id="348">My main preoccupation was with reading. </sentence><sentence id="349">When my girlfriends would come and to ask where I was, my mother or whoever was around would say, you'll find her in a book! </sentence><sentence id="350">This was my childhood, I was an avid reader. </sentence><sentence id="351">But I liked to play with them and both of them were killed, but we use to go away a lot. </sentence><sentence id="352">I think this too established my pattern of traveling later in life. </sentence><sentence id="353">For ten weeks, every year, my parents would remove me from school a little earlier. </sentence><sentence id="354">It had to start the 15th of June and I wouldn't come back until sometime in September. </sentence><sentence id="355">Every year we would go to the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="356">My mother believed that we didn't look well enough, that we needed all the fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="357">She believed in these things. </sentence><sentence id="358">So we went to the Carpatian Mountains because my home town is surrounded by the Carpatian Mountains, Kolomyja is the entry to the Carpatian Mountains. </sentence><sentence id="359">We would go to different places, the names may mean nothing, but from time to time they crop up. </sentence><sentence id="360">Losuv, Garemeze, Delatyn, these were the places. </sentence><sentence id="361">The way we would go, it was so funny, my father would stay behind and he would come one week. </sentence><sentence id="362">But we would go for the ten weeks and we took everything along because these were pretty primitive villas. </sentence><sentence id="363">My mother insisted on a villa which was inside and which was always surrounded by trees; apple trees, pear trees and plumb trees. </sentence><sentence id="364">Poland has a lot of very delicious fruit so there had to be trees, that was the requirements of hiring a villa. </sentence><sentence id="365">And it had to be close to the street but not too close, close to the street so we could    look and see some traffic but not too close so nobody would come close to us. </sentence><sentence id="366">And it had to be ona little river. </sentence><sentence id="367">On a little stream. </sentence><sentence id="368">And we would go swimming there, not swimming really, sitting under the stones. </sentence><sentence id="369">My sister, Cyla, made it into her real hobby. </sentence><sentence id="370">She would go every morning, sit under these stones in which you had a, what do you call it, little water fall and she would sit there for hours hoping she would loose weight this way. </sentence><sentence id="371">She was overweight and she wanted to loose weight, this was her idea. </sentence><sentence id="372">One day, she decided she really wants to do it more professionally so there was a man from Warsaw, a Polish man, who ran a special spa for the loosing weight. </sentence><sentence id="373">He was Anti-Semitic to the core. </sentence><sentence id="374">His name was Dr. Tarnovsky, but Jewish middle-class women like all the others went there to loose weight. </sentence><sentence id="375">Well, she didn't like that too much so one day they had an afternoon off and she went to the village and she moved into Konditorai, a cafe. </sentence><sentence id="376">Konitorai I knew was a very special institution. </sentence><sentence id="377">It's coffee and hot chocolate and there was beautiful pastries. </sentence><sentence id="378">So, she eats here pastry and drinks the chocolate and here walks in Dr. Tarnovsky and he sees that thing, he walks over to her and he slaps her, right across her face. </sentence><sentence id="379">Well, this was an awakening for her. </sentence><sentence id="380">She never went back to that spa anymore. </sentence><sentence id="381">But this was the situation. </sentence><sentence id="382">Part of it was, anti-Semitism in Poland just had its full way, in different ways, but I personally did not experience it in elementary school, perhaps not in elementary school but in High School. </sentence><sentence id="383">Until I come to that, I remember these different locations of our traveling to for this summer, and it was a whole trip. </sentence><sentence id="384">In front of us was always a carriage with horses which would carry our beddings, our dishes, our household kosher which meant you needed double dishes, and some furnishings. </sentence><sentence id="385">This was in front and in the back was Fiakev, a drosh-ka (ph), with my mother, my father if it was for the week-end and all children. </sentence><sentence id="386">There was a maid, a woman to clean and it had to be a Jewish maid to cook because we were Kosher. </sentence><sentence id="387">So coming to these places, my mother believed in good air, fresh air and food. </sentence><sentence id="388">So she wanted us to drink milk from the cow. </sentence><sentence id="389">And she would bribe us. </sentence><sentence id="390">So food was always something which they had to beg us to eat. </sentence><sentence id="391">I would get either a zloty or a big piece of chocolate to drink that milk and I always managed to avoid drinking that milk. </sentence><sentence id="392">It was a game going on, I still hate milk for this reason. </sentence><sentence id="393">I was so ostioperosis probably because I didn't drink enough milk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="447">Q: This time away from, did this make all of you much closer than you would have been? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="449">A: We were a very close family, always a very close family. </sentence><sentence id="450">Close in the family was a prescription I'm sure of my family, probably because it's a Jewish tradition but probably because they had suffered losses. </sentence><sentence id="451">So, to my parents, the business was important to my father and he was a very good businessman, family was all that mattered, always. </sentence><sentence id="452">And to us it still does. </sentence><sentence id="453">Now we have fragments of the family but family is still very important to us, to all of us. </sentence><sentence id="454">So I was brought up with this, I was suffocated by it, I really didn't like that much closeness. </sentence><sentence id="455">And with my colleagues who had more space, and I always wanted more space. </sentence><sentence id="456">My whole traveling in my life was always getting more space. </sentence><sentence id="457">These were the consequences of that emotional overcrowding, extremely so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: Were there political discussions that you remember as you grew up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: By the way, yes. </sentence><sentence id="470">I wasn't involved politically until sometime later in my gymnasium years. </sentence><sentence id="471">Yes, the Kolomyja, like most towns in Poland, had a lot of political divisions among the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="472">There was the Main Zionist, and there were Left Zionist, the Communist, the Socialist, the Liberals, the Divisionists, you name it. </sentence><sentence id="473">Amazing, a small city like Kolomyja which only had 40,000 people, half of them were Jewish, they had about a few Jewish newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="474">It was a highly literate city. </sentence><sentence id="475">I wasn't among them because my parents protection some how or other excluded me. </sentence><sentence id="476">My parents protection and my need for the Polish patriotism somehow excluded me much from it, as strange as it is. </sentence><sentence id="477">But I had liberal ideas. </sentence><sentence id="478">My parents, my father worried about it, that I was going very liberal at one point. </sentence><sentence id="479">But I didn't join a particular group. </sentence><sentence id="480">However, there were many, many groups. </sentence><sentence id="481">Most of the Jewish people in Kolomyja as in most of Poland were poor. </sentence><sentence id="482">There were people    who were really poor and then there was the middle class, upper middle class, and a very few who were really extremely rich. </sentence><sentence id="483">There must have been, but in my home town the middle class and upper middle class were the rich people. </sentence><sentence id="484">I remember, I still have a great pain when I think about the poverty in my home town. </sentence><sentence id="485">My first memory is of the water carriers. </sentence><sentence id="486">We lived in a house in which the apartment was on top of the business and there were wide staircases. </sentence><sentence id="487">And the water carriers, all whom were Jewish, they were carrying up the water, big cans, because there was no other way of getting water. </sentence><sentence id="488">The water came from a main fountain in the city, on Mokra Street. </sentence><sentence id="489">Mokra Street is well known because there are survivors like Dov Noi, who's well know, he comes from MokraStreet. </sentence><sentence id="490">Many people lived on MokraStreet. </sentence><sentence id="491">It was the poorest neighborhood and there was a big fountain and the water carriers possibly were on the lowest rank of the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="492">And they carried that water upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="493">I remember once, on a very cold day, and Kolomyja being in the Ukraine, a cold, cold climate. </sentence><sentence id="494">I asked my mother, how come this man has ice on his hands?Doesn't he like to wear gloves? </sentence><sentence id="495">This was my awakening, that some people didn't have money for gloves. </sentence><sentence id="496">The poverty was everywhere and when I think of that poverty, I think of them like of the closest family because there was no right for them to suffer such an end as these people did. </sentence><sentence id="497">They really never had any life. </sentence><sentence id="498">There was a lot of stigma about being poor and there was a lot of sukkotme. </sentence><sentence id="499">In my High School, which was a Jewish Gymnasium, it was one of the sets of gymnasiums, it was a chain of, called Zyowskie Towarzystowo szkoty Ludoweii Sreduig, it was a chain of Jewish Gymnasiums established in Poland, which was run by the Jewish parents, who established it. </sentence><sentence id="500">They paid for it, it was extremely expensive. </sentence><sentence id="501">Somehow or other, because there was no gymnasium for Jewish girls after elementary school, ten parents got together and established it. </sentence><sentence id="502">My parents and nine others. </sentence><sentence id="503">And they took in one parent who didn't have money. </sentence><sentence id="504">Their name was Neiman and she was Sophia Neiman. </sentence><sentence id="505">I still remember the pain and the stigma and the sense of sukkotme. </sentence><sentence id="506">She wore clothes which came from America, which means she had a coat which was red. </sentence><sentence id="507">Only American children wore red coat, we never wore red coat. </sentence><sentence id="508">In High School you wore navy. </sentence><sentence id="509">And this was such a stigmatic thing. </sentence><sentence id="510">And another thing I remember is that outside was a school building, was an old Jew who was selling some food, potatonik, and you could buy it with butter or with margarine. </sentence><sentence id="511">Margarine was half price of butter, and she would buy the margarine potato. </sentence><sentence id="512">All these things stay with me because it was so unjust. </sentence><sentence id="513">Well, of the ten students, we were ten students and ten teachers. </sentence><sentence id="514">All teachers were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="515">They came from Warsaw, from the big cities. </sentence><sentence id="516">We had to be more pious than the Pope in achieving our accreditation because the commission would come down from Warsaw and we had to be good. </sentence><sentence id="517">So we had ten teachers to ten students. </sentence><sentence id="518">And of the ten students, miraculously, unbelievably, all survived! </sentence><sentence id="519">All the teachers were killed. </sentence><sentence id="520">I wanted to bring you pictures, some how I couldn't get it down from my wall, it was heavy. </sentence><sentence id="521">But I be jumping a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="522">This was the gymnasium years and it was all Jewish students, all Jewish teachers. </sentence><sentence id="523">It was considered a high level gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="524">It is described in the book about Poland by Dr. Sylvia Helliard, you may know about it, called "An Air of Destruction". </sentence><sentence id="525">She has quite a bit about these schools. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="586">Q: Were you all close, all the students, including the one who was somewhat stigmatized or what about that one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="588">A: Well, she was not stigmatized by us, we just felt the stigma. </sentence><sentence id="589">I felt the stigma. </sentence><sentence id="590">For reason, I don't know why, I still don't know why I identified with the underdog. </sentence><sentence id="591">Some way or other I assume it eventually led me to social work, but I didn't know the origins of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="596">Q: But you, of course, were living in very privileged ways? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: I lived by comparison, I'm sure here in America it now would not be because of it, but by comparison with the others, and I had a lot of pain about it. </sentence><sentence id="599">Probably was a part of my rebelling against my parents, whatever it was that came into it, that I became very liberal. </sentence><sentence id="600">The pain about witnessing so much poverty still stays with me whenever I think about what happened. </sentence><sentence id="601">But anyway.. So, this was the gymnasium years, we had to study a lot. </sentence><sentence id="602">We had to study Latin, eight years of Latin, that's a lot of Latin. </sentence><sentence id="603">We had to study, the only thing we didn't like is religion. </sentence><sentence id="604">Of course because the teacher wasn't great. </sentence><sentence id="605">I had marvelous teachers of Polish literature, one of them    became my role model. </sentence><sentence id="606">I think she played an important part in my choice of this profession later. </sentence><sentence id="607">We had a teacher of German literature, we had mathematics, which was not my subject somehow or other. </sentence><sentence id="608">But I couldn't afford to have a "B" ever so my parents hired a tutor. </sentence><sentence id="609">I fell in love with the tutor, my first adolescent crush, and a learned it and I passed exams very well. </sentence><sentence id="610">Then we had a lot of gym. </sentence><sentence id="611">I wasn't great in gym, just passing. </sentence><sentence id="612">What else did we have? </sentence><sentence id="613">Certainly geography and history, history was always my great interest and remained so. </sentence><sentence id="614">Geography and history. </sentence><sentence id="615">In the University, I had to decide, study was history. </sentence><sentence id="616">I believe that you don't understand people without history. </sentence><sentence id="617">In those days, I didn't understand it but now I teach my students that you do not understand people without knowing history of their people. </sentence><sentence id="618">Well, we'll come to it later, but anyway, I consider it as part of the web of the personality, historic events. </sentence><sentence id="619">Those days I did not understand it this way, just liked history. </sentence><sentence id="620">Every single strut in the roadway, you know, I had to memorize. </sentence><sentence id="621">We had to, we had to decide a in High School and I was very good at it because I memorized Mickiewicz, Schen- kavitch (ph), Krasinski, these were the very famous, and later came the positivists and I was really, this was my life! </sentence><sentence id="622">It still is, reading, I'm still an addict in reading. </sentence><sentence id="623">I don't remember now because my mind doesn't work well but in those days I absorbed it all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="651">Q: What attracted you to the positivists? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="653">A: It was lit, oh sure, it was after the romantics who needed a pause! </sentence><sentence id="654">Orzeszkowa, Aun-jus-kov-a (ph). </sentence><sentence id="655">The other day, they had a few months ago, they had a film festival of Polish movies and there was a marvelous, marvelous movie of Orzeszkowa, I forgot what it was, it was fantastically well done, but the positivists. </sentence><sentence id="656">And then when I came to the, this was all in High School. </sentence><sentence id="657">It's amazing, I didn't have any conflict with Poles at that point. </sentence><sentence id="658">I studied so many years in high school, we were totally isolated. </sentence><sentence id="659">We didn't experience it. </sentence><sentence id="660">I didn't know, my father had some customers who were Polish, but I didn't have any contact. </sentence><sentence id="661">So, anti-Semitism was nothing that was experienced personally except that it wasn't it, but you knew it was there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="671">Q: Did your parents talk about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="674">I knew that my father would bribe the tax accountants, when they came, the tax man. </sentence><sentence id="675">He would send them fantastic sets of porcelain for Christmas, as I remember, because of our discussion what to choose for these people, so they were bribed. </sentence><sentence id="676">He would give some of them discounts, I know, that later saved my life in strange ways. </sentence><sentence id="677">The Ukrainians were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="678">This was a Polish regime and Ukrainians were both illiterate and poor. </sentence><sentence id="679">They were peasants, they would come into store barefoot, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="680">And they would always buy dishes which were considered very inferior, fiance (ph), ceramic. </sentence><sentence id="681">They were painted. </sentence><sentence id="682">They would buy big dishes, painted, big dishes for soup, or whatever else. </sentence><sentence id="683">But the fine porcelain was always for the Polish and for some of the Jewish families too. </sentence><sentence id="684">But my father did more than this, handling the people from the city, but from all over they came. </sentence><sentence id="685">It was an established business for the Province. </sentence><sentence id="686">And the provincial peasants were very, very many. </sentence><sentence id="687">So we got both the Ukrainian peasants would come in and the Polish people were the aristocracy, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="688">And then there were Jewish people with money. </sentence><sentence id="689">This was the clientele and there were many helpers in the store and that's where I picked up Yiddish because they spoke Yiddish to a very large extent. </sentence><sentence id="690">We had a bookkeeper who survived the war, we had my brother-in-law, my older sister's, her husband later joined and he had the presentation of chandeliers and enamel bath tubs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: Enamel what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: Bath tubs. </sentence><sentence id="712">Tubs for the bath. </sentence><sentence id="713">This was all new because there was no way of having any, water didn't come into the apartment so you had to pour it, so the bath tubs we had for that luxury of taking a bath. </sentence><sentence id="714">And he was doing very well this way but it was part of the business. </sentence><sentence id="715">So that's where, Yiddish you could hear in the store, they spoke Yiddish, these boys. </sentence><sentence id="716">One of them survived, I met him after the war, I couldn't believe it, but, the rest were all killed. </sentence><sentence id="717">I remember seeing them over the, over in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="718">But, I, so I was sort of isolated or protected from actual confrontation with anti-Semitism, but as I said, it was always in the air. </sentence><sentence id="719">For instance, on Yom Kipper my parents would go to synagogue, naturally, we girls stayed home. </sentence><sentence id="720">And we always barricaded ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="721">We were afraid always to stand in the window or on the balcony, the balcony was a big part of our life. </sentence><sentence id="722">We lived on the main street called Kol-soy-oi (ph), you could see people walk back and forth and my mother was very orientated towards clothes, she was critical of this, this dress is too long and this is too short and this is too bright and so on, but on Yom Kipper night, some of these nights it was forbidden for us to show our faces, this I remembered. </sentence><sentence id="723">We worried, although we never experienced it, that some of the Polish or Ukrainian goons will come and knock out windows so there was this sense of panic all the time. </sentence><sentence id="724">In our town there were so many Jews, half of the population was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="725">You could see the difference. </sentence><sentence id="726">Suddenly it was very dark, it was very quiet, all the stores were closed, most stores belonged to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="727">No body moved, nothing moved. </sentence><sentence id="728">And then you always thought, somebody will come, knock at the door, knock out the window, it happened occasionally but I myself did not experience this. </sentence><sentence id="729">But I do recall the feeling of some anxiety, perhaps even panic, that it might happen. </sentence><sentence id="730">So I say, I knew about it, but not in a personal way. </sentence><sentence id="731">Yom Kipper was very difficult, we all passed it, I didn't after a certain age, but Yom Kipper I remember as it was dark in the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="732">There was a very severe fast. </sentence><sentence id="733">The breaking of the fast, people were very tired or slowly coming out of synagogues, they were praying all day there. </sentence><sentence id="734">This I remember with a great deal of pain. </sentence><sentence id="735">The Klezmar would come, to pray for us, a happy, ah, these people were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="736">These are older Jews. </sentence><sentence id="737">Very poor, and they would go from house to house. </sentence><sentence id="738">It was my job, because I was the youngest at home, I didn't go to synagogue and because I was there while my parents had to come from the synagogue, to give them some food to break the fast. </sentence><sentence id="739">I remember as a child carrying that tray of honey cake. </sentence><sentence id="740">And they would pray, they would pray and then they would go, sometimes they came back later at dinner time. </sentence><sentence id="741">I still mourn these Klezmar because they were so poor. </sentence><sentence id="742">It was so wrong that a night like that, after fast, they had to go and pray. </sentence><sentence id="743">The Klas-mas(ph) music has not survived, the type of pain when I hear, it's not good, it's not authentic enough for me. </sentence><sentence id="744">I must be honest, there's very few people who remember how it was. </sentence><sentence id="745">They played in short sleeved outfits, I can't even, Perlman plays. </sentence><sentence id="746">He's doing it well I suppose but he's not good enough for me because I remember the authentic players. </sentence><sentence id="747">Who could teach these young people here, they all went to the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="748">This is the story of the Klezmar in our home town, they always played at weddings, the weddings for my family were very big, and none of them survived from what I know. </sentence><sentence id="749">Anyway, it was not right that people who have suffered so much poverty and so much indignity should ever have to end up this way. </sentence><sentence id="750">It wasn't fair. </sentence><sentence id="751">But in our home town, this was the story, this was true for many of the other little towns too, all over Poland, particularly in these places. </sentence><sentence id="752">So, this was Yom Kipper, my parents would come home, always with headaches, tired, but breaking the fast was unlike here where you often have loks or these things, or there has to be hot chicken soup and the Klezmar would come back to play and then they ate with us a little, but it was a difficult, a very difficult holiday for us. </sentence><sentence id="753">There was no joy at all. </sentence><sentence id="754">Then came Sukkot and Sukkot I remember very vividly because the Sukkot(ph) in our home was big. </sentence><sentence id="755">The entry to the apartment was a very big hallway and it didn't have windows but it had ceiling window, there was a name for it? </sentence><sentence id="756">When there's a windows in the ceiling, you know what I mean?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="806">A: Sky light. </sentence><sentence id="807">There was a very big room with a sky light and actually two of the other rooms, one was a children's room, also had a sky light. </sentence><sentence id="808">Anyway, the sky light in the foyer, the very big foyer was removed for Sukkot and branches of trees, it was covered with tree branches because Sukkot is a special holiday. </sentence><sentence id="809">My father would being in many people from the synagogue and they danced, everybody! </sentence><sentence id="810">By the way, every Sukkotbot, I had to bring an Oye Nak-a-dom (ph) home and Oye (ph) was a guest from the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="811">There wasn't a time that there wouldn't come an Oye (ph),    my father had to bring an Oye (ph). </sentence><sentence id="812">Somebody who was poor, who was stranded in the city and needed a meal. </sentence><sentence id="813">A shabbat meal. </sentence><sentence id="814">Once my father came without an Oye (ph) and I remember how upset my mother was and he had, poor man, he had to go back to the synagogue and find an Oye (ph). </sentence><sentence id="815">There were always some poor people stranded. </sentence><sentence id="816">One Oye (ph) I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="817">It must have been 1938 by then because he told us that he came from Zbaszyn. </sentence><sentence id="818">Zbaszyn was a place, you know about it, to which the Polish Jews were thrown by the Germans and he somehow or other, he wandered and wandered around, he came to Kolomyja, a long way from Zbonsheen, which was on the Zbaszyn border and he began to tell us a little bit about what happened. </sentence><sentence id="819">But I think it was hushed over in some way, at least I don't remember details. </sentence><sentence id="820">I remember that Oye (ph). </sentence><sentence id="821">Another steady one, every Sukkot-bot (ph) was the matchmaker in town. </sentence><sentence id="822">My sisters got married by matchmaker, through a matchmaker. </sentence><sentence id="823">The matchmaker, he was treated very well, but he always said, he's not going to eat, he just came for Kiddish. </sentence><sentence id="824">But, to eat you had to wash your hands so he refused to wash his hands because he only came for Kiddish. </sentence><sentence id="825">So the Kiddish was a lot of appetizers, three or four appetizers, and a lot of sweets and he was not eating, but he came, every Sukkot-bot (ph) he came because my father had daughters to marry off. </sentence><sentence id="826">And he knew there would be money there so all my sisters married and when it came to me, he looked me over. </sentence><sentence id="827">The coming of age, he noticed my body, that it was getting ready for marriage. </sentence><sentence id="828">He started looking at me more seriously, but I escaped him. </sentence><sentence id="829">So I never married through a matchmaker, I married my husband, very independent wife. </sentence><sentence id="830">But the matchmaker was at our shabbat table every Saturday without eating. </sentence><sentence id="831">I always laughed because he ate about three appetizers you know. </sentence><sentence id="832">The Jewish food was gefilte fish and it was pitche and it was something else, chopped liver, three, four appetizers and he ate all of them without washing his hands, which means he didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="833">We all laugh about it, we still remember the shabbat and they all went into the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="834">But, this was part of my childhood which I resisted to a large extent because I wanted to be very Polish to him. </sentence><sentence id="835">Without being with Poles. </sentence><sentence id="836">Had a very mixed up mixture, but go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="892">A: No, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="893">Very few, there was no gymnasium for Jewish women, there was only the gymnasium with the nuns, the Ursulanki nuns ran a Catholic, high school for Catholic girls and all Polish girls were Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="894">So there was nothing for me but that when my parents together with nine others created the gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="895">I came to the University, I certainly wanted to go to University and I wanted to study Polish literature, there was no question about what I wanted to study. </sentence><sentence id="896">I was the youngest at home, the only one at home. </sentence><sentence id="897">My sisters were married by then. </sentence><sentence id="898">And lived away. </sentence><sentence id="899">So for them, the lose of their mezunka, the youngest is the mezunka, usually the favorite child in many Jewish families, but with me it was doubly so. </sentence><sentence id="900">They were extremely unhappy about it, they wouldn't hear about it. </sentence><sentence id="901">Well, how could I make my parents hear me this way? </sentence><sentence id="902">I went on a hunger strike. </sentence><sentence id="903">For my parents, a child wouldn't eat, was the greatest tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="904">They could not stand my, they couldn't stand the separation from me, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="905">They worried about a girl going away to a big city, what will    happen to her? </sentence><sentence id="906">They worried about kashrut, where will I eat there? </sentence><sentence id="907">And they worried about themselves, I'm sorry, I'm sure they couldn't face each other all alone. </sentence><sentence id="908">All the sisters were gone and they were still young people but they felt as if they felt old. </sentence><sentence id="909">So my father made a decision to go to his Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="910">At that time the Rabbi didn't come to us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="911">He was old and he didn't travel, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="912">He lived some where near Sigit, somewhere very far, it was Romania at that point. </sentence><sentence id="913">And to go to Romania from Poland you needed passports by then, you needed visas, you needed foreign currency, it was both the Polish government and the Romanian government made it very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="914">But my father found a way and he went to the Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="915">To consult with him, what to do about this stubborn, little daughter. </sentence><sentence id="916">So the Rabbi, in his wisdom, I doubt if his experience was questioned, he said, if she is as smart as a boy, you treat her as if she were a boy, send her to study. </sentence><sentence id="917">Father came back and I went to study. </sentence><sentence id="918">And that is the story on how I went to study. </sentence><sentence id="919">My parents outfitted me and I was always outfitted for every occasion, and I went to live off and they made arrangements with a distant relative to house me. </sentence><sentence id="920">She was in Boughf, Lemberg. </sentence><sentence id="921">She was married to a man who didn't make a living, the name was Fisch, so there was hidden poverty, a little hidden poverty. </sentence><sentence id="922">I had a small room there, kept extremely well for me. </sentence><sentence id="923">The woman worked very hard, again, I had a lot of pain because she treated me exceptionally. </sentence><sentence id="924">I had to have the best meat and the best food and they skimped and it was very painful for me to look at all these things. </sentence><sentence id="925">But that's how it was and she was getting 100 zlotys a month, which in those days was much money, and the whole family lived off it. </sentence><sentence id="926">There was one daughter, a little younger than I.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="969">A: Seventeen and a half. </sentence><sentence id="970">Close to eighteen, in fact, when the Rabbi, when he married me later he wondered whether my father was telling my age, I looked so young. </sentence><sentence id="971">But, I come to the University,    it looked so big. </sentence><sentence id="972">It looked so tremendous and here in front of the big door stand two Polish goons and Endeki, Polish Fascists. </sentence><sentence id="973">And there are big posters in front of the door saying, this is a week without Jews. </sentence><sentence id="974">This, as I remember, is October, 1936. </sentence><sentence id="975">A week without Jews, I don't understand what they're talking about, so I'm trying to get through and I see they're hostile faces. </sentence><sentence id="976">Anyway, I came to my classroom and I recall they wanted me to sit down on the left benches. </sentence><sentence id="977">The classrooms were very big, at least to the eyes of the young girl from a small town, and they arranged that all Polish students were to sit on the right side and the Jewish students were to take the ghetto benches, the left side. </sentence><sentence id="978">Before I went to them, I already had some information from the Jewish-Polish society of students, and they told me about it, and they told me Jewish students will not take the left benches, the ghetto benches, but we will stand. </sentence><sentence id="979">So I looked for the Jewish students, there was no body else, I was the only Jewish student. </sentence><sentence id="980">And to the right side were about, 200 perhaps, Polish students and I'm the little thing standing at the door. </sentence><sentence id="981">To cut it short, for the next three years, I stood at that door. </sentence><sentence id="982">I took all my University classes in the standing position. </sentence><sentence id="983">I never sat down. </sentence><sentence id="984">It was getting worse every day. </sentence><sentence id="985">There were weeks without Jews, there were special treatment of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="986">The professors were unbelievably anti-semetic. </sentence><sentence id="987">The professors stood and they could see around, they were a little high on the podium, and it was a requirement of each student to hand over the indexes, it was a little book in which you would put a signature that you had attended classes, we had to have that to attend every class in Polish literature. </sentence><sentence id="988">And as I put, and he would pause at the end of the session, he would put his signature. </sentence><sentence id="989">One of them, Professor Tasycki, he was the expert in the Polish language, not literature, but language for say, phonics. </sentence><sentence id="990">He saw my name, Matylda Hirsch, he took a look, he threw it at the floor. </sentence><sentence id="991">And the students applauded. </sentence><sentence id="992">I don't know what made me go back. </sentence><sentence id="993">I just don't know. </sentence><sentence id="994">It was sheer anger, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="995">Or sheer sukkotme of going home without finishing it. </sentence><sentence id="996">I was so defenseless. </sentence><sentence id="997">I was in such a fright. </sentence><sentence id="998">Everyday, I would literally vomit with anxiety, of entering that University. </sentence><sentence id="999">At one point, they pushed me and they pushed me down and something I held on that I didn't break my body. </sentence><sentence id="1000">One point I remember, a highlight in my University studies. </sentence><sentence id="1001">Professor Julius Kleiner, may his memory be blessed. </sentence><sentence id="1002">The saying was that he was half Jewish, a quarter Jewish, one-eighth Jewish, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="1003">He was a very famous professor, an expert on the famous poet, Julius Slowacki. </sentence><sentence id="1004">His name was Julius Kleiner, and it was the same, Julius and Julius. </sentence><sentence id="1005">He introduced us to some understanding of the influence of Freud on literature. </sentence><sentence id="1006">To me, it was all very new. </sentence><sentence id="1007">But he was extremely prestigious lecturer of Polish literature, particularly about Slowacki. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And he saw me, every time, standing at the doorway, all alone, as I was very insignificant little looking, very small. </sentence><sentence id="1009">One day, he moves from his katedra, all the way down to the doorway, I thought he was walking out, he takes me under his arm, he brings me up to the podium and he asked me to take the chair. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Well! </sentence><sentence id="1011">I refused to take the chair. </sentence><sentence id="1012">I just stood, he finished his lecture, as he walked down, the students threw eggs at him. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Lucky they didn't throw stones. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Many times, they carried stones. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Most of the time, by the way, he was later killed, I believe, but I have lost contact. </sentence><sentence id="1016">The Endecki would take, would carry sticks, what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="1017">Sticks? </sentence><sentence id="1018">With a Gillette at the bottom of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1125">A: I did not throw up everyday but I felt nauseous and I threw up occasionally, but the nausea was part of the anxiety. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I felt some sense of resistance, that I cannot leave. </sentence><sentence id="1127">The Jewish organization helped us to a large extent because I knew this was happening to other students too. </sentence><sentence id="1128">The thing that mobilized my anger rather than my anxiety was a funeral of a student in the medical studies. </sentence><sentence id="1129">He was literally killed in the classroom. </sentence><sentence id="1130">His name just escapes me, I wish I could remember, but he was a close friend of a man who later became my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1131">This was a tremendous funeral, somewhere or other, I felt this solidarity of people and I wasn't alone. </sentence><sentence id="1132">It was very unfortunate that in the study of Polish literature I was the only Jew and that feeling of isolation was the worst part of all of it. </sentence><sentence id="1133">But then, I suddenly found myself in that procession of hundreds of students and I got this sense of strength from the numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1134">But it was extremely difficult and I always prayed that the class be over and vacation come, each time there was a holiday, naturally I would go home. </sentence><sentence id="1135">My    parents were overjoyed in seeing me, I never told them the story of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1136">I recall, they would bring back the big, big pots and pans when I came because for themselves, they were on diets, and the cooking was very limited, so when I came there were again celebrations. </sentence><sentence id="1137">There was some joy in the house again. </sentence><sentence id="1138">I think it was in my, let me see, it was in my third year of studies, second or third, I can't remember, that I went to the library to pick up a Polish book and the librarian told me that the book was just checked out. </sentence><sentence id="1139">I said, who took it? </sentence><sentence id="1140">She said, this man, this young student. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I walk over to the student and I say, I need this book. </sentence><sentence id="1142">He says, he wants to read it too. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And I said, are you a student of Polish literature? </sentence><sentence id="1144">He say, no, he studies pharmacology, the medical school. </sentence><sentence id="1145">So I said, but I'm a student of Polish literature and I need the book for an exam. </sentence><sentence id="1146">He says, well, you're quite stubborn about it. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I say, yes, please help me with it. </sentence><sentence id="1148">We started talking. </sentence><sentence id="1149">He was from my home town, I never knew him, but I knew of his parents because people knew of the businesses. </sentence><sentence id="1150">His parents had a apotheketer (ph), pharmacy and everybody knew the pharmacy and I did. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So he was one of their sons, the youngest son. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Well, arguing over the book, we became lovers. </sentence><sentence id="1153">And this changed my life immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I wasn't alone. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Nunek and I were going home, at least for vacations, my father was very unhappy when I declared I wanted to marry him. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Because his family, unlike my own, was extremely assimilated to the extent that I think they would eat on Yom Kippur, which was unusual. </sentence><sentence id="1157">They carried it to an extreme. </sentence><sentence id="1158">His father was for generations, they had that pharmacy. </sentence><sentence id="1159">They prided themselves in being extremely assimilated Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Well again, in my usual stubbornness, my parents had to give in, so my father remembered that as a very young child, he went to the chedet together with this man who had a few classes there, so they patched it up in some way and they came and there was an engagement. </sentence><sentence id="1161">It was 1938 or 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1162">We became engaged and my life naturally changed because I wasn't alone, he was just about to finish his study, I had another two years to go. </sentence><sentence id="1163">That summer.. </sentence></p></dialogue>

We would go home for vacations and there were always celebrations about it. </sentence><sentence id="1232">One day, for a long vacation one summer we decided to go into the wild mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1233">I was very much into hiking. </sentence><sentence id="1234">Until a few years ago I was into it. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And he too. </sentence><sentence id="1236">This was the major sport for many young, Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1237">He didn't belong to an organization, he was the assimilated sort of category of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1238">But when he saw what was happening in the University, he became extremely angry at those Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1239">But one day we decided to go to a new, brand new hostel on one of the highest mountains on the Carpatian Mountains, this was called the Chomiak. </sentence><sentence id="1240">It was just discovered recently and they built a hostel there. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Hard to get there, after a point we were able to go by a car, later had the march and was very far away. </sentence><sentence id="1242">It was brand new, it smelled delicious I remember, there    was one more couple from Warsaw, Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And I recall the distance we had from them and, we were the only four people, very far away. </sentence><sentence id="1244">No body could get there. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I do recall that they had a sort of sense of superiority over us. </sentence><sentence id="1246">They knew immediately that we were Jewish, although I looked Jewish, my husband never did and he spoke Polish beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="1247">He came from a family of long, of long history of assimilated Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1248">But somehow or the other, they sensed it. </sentence><sentence id="1249">So although we ate together, there was a sense of distance and there was our sense of looking up at them. </sentence><sentence id="1250">This I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Well, it was a great experience, to be all alone in this stunning part of the mountains, this is above Bor-auk-na (ph), Bor-auk-na (ph) was a village and from there we went to the Chomiak. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Later on, Chomiak became a popular place. </sentence><sentence id="1253">When the vacation was over, it was the Ist of September, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1254">Vacation was over, we went back to the village to take the train to Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="1255">It was a Sunday afternoon, we saw many, no, don't remember why I think it was a Sunday, I thought it was Sunday because many Ukrainian peasants were trying to read posters. </sentence><sentence id="1256">When we came to the posters, it was a Declaration of War. </sentence><sentence id="1257">That Germany has just declared war on Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1258">It was September Ist, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1259">Shows you how totally unprepared we were for it. </sentence><sentence id="1260">People lived in Warsaw, not the cities, knew much more. </sentence><sentence id="1261">We seemed to have been totally isolated from it, particularly when we were up in the mountains there for many weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1301">Q: Were you aware of what was going on in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1303">A: We knew a little, what was going on in Germany, it was Nazi Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We didn't know how much impact they had on our, on Polish students. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Actually, when I later studied it, the tactics of the Polish students were cut out of text books from the Nazi literature. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We didn't know enough. </sentence><sentence id="1307">When you lived in the western part of Poland you certainly knew more about it. </sentence><sentence id="1308">You didn't, I didn't, and my husband didn't know either. </sentence><sentence id="1309">But I recall that day, later in the afternoon, I don't know why I think it was Sunday, the only reason that I think so is that when peasants just be all together in the center of the square. </sentence><sentence id="1310">We read this, we didn't    really realize the importance of it. </sentence><sentence id="1311">We were Polish patriots, strangely enough. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Both of us had military preparation, I had it in my high school days. </sentence><sentence id="1313">All boys and all girls had to have military preparation. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Which meant we were taught how to wear uniforms, how to march. </sentence><sentence id="1315">He had to be taught, I'm sure, how to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1316">I wasn't, but to march in parades and to march in case of a war. </sentence><sentence id="1317">We knew all these things, there was, forgot the name, Polskin, gosh how could I remember, forget these names, anyway it was war preparation, that every high school student had to participate in. </sentence><sentence id="1318">We took the train and we thought perhaps we'll go into the war, perhaps we'll march, we just didn't understand any of it. </sentence><sentence id="1319">When I came home I saw the gloom on my parents face, they knew more. </sentence><sentence id="1320">They had participated in World War I and they knew that war is not only songs and marches. </sentence><sentence id="1321">This was September Ist, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1322">Within weeks, the Russian army moved in. </sentence><sentence id="1323">I didn't know then, but there was a pact between Ribintrope (ph) and Molotov (ph) and they declared that Poland should be divided. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Our part of Poland fell to the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="1325">This was within two or three weeks that the Soviet army marched in. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I remember the night when they marched in. </sentence><sentence id="1327">It was very, what was the word for it? </sentence><sentence id="1328">The song sounded very attractive, it was mesmerizing. </sentence><sentence id="1329">They were marching and their songs were beautiful, I still remember their songs. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And I was very much pulled somewhat or other, I always was liberal, I was always poor. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Many of their ideas, it seemed that, they were bring some employment and dignity to the poor people. </sentence><sentence id="1332">But, on the other hand, I could see from my parents expression that they were worried and we didn't know what the future would be, so it was strong. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I remember distinctly that night when they marched in and I recall the song, they sang these songs, for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Well, we went back to Lvov to study. </sentence><sentence id="1335">My husband was just finished then, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1370">Q: Can you sing one of the songs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1372">A: Gosh, [singing], oh, I can't remember anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1373">If tomorrow is war, we will defend Stalin and everywhere we will be the victors. </sentence><sentence id="1374">So, it had a mesmerizing quality for some reason because I was in conflict. </sentence><sentence id="1375">But I did go back to finish my studies. </sentence><sentence id="1376">The University was totally different by then. </sentence><sentence id="1377">By the way, I was married by, this was 1940, I was just married by then. </sentence><sentence id="1378">Well, come back to my wedding for a minute, it was already a very quiet wedding. </sentence><sentence id="1379">I never wanted a wedding in a white gown, I was a very feminist kind of a woman, liberal kind of a women. </sentence><sentence id="1380">I was not interested in all these trappings of the bourgeoisie, which was very much the bad and good part of my background, mainly through my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1381">So I always dreamed that I'll just escape with my husband or I'll have a very small wedding, but anyway when the time came it was, the Soviets had just come in at that point and I was married, I can't remember the month which is insane, but I know it was 1940. </sentence><sentence id="1382">It was the year when I was just about to graduate. </sentence><sentence id="1383">The Rabbi of our town was a close friend of my father, Rabbi Lowe (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1384">His nephew is the chief Rabbi of Israel now. </sentence><sentence id="1385">The other nephew was chief counsel of Israel for New York, the United States, I knew both of them, I met them later. </sentence><sentence id="1386">But that Rabbi questioned my father, he said, you say she's of age to marry? </sentence><sentence id="1387">She looks like a child. </sentence><sentence id="1388">I just happened to look very young. </sentence><sentence id="1389">So the outfit for my wedding was a nice little navy suit and flat-heel shoes and a little veil, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1390">The wedding was in our own apartment in our parents home. </sentence><sentence id="1391">There were hardly any guests, the Soviets had just come in and the business was already taken over by the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="1392">My father kept saying that he cannot give me much a dowry because of the war, because the Soviets have taken over everything, but after the war he will reimburse me for it, P'll get more dowry than any of the other girls, and all the girls got good dowries. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And I didn't think of a dowry at all, to me this was all very uninteresting. </sentence><sentence id="1394">All I remember that, the day of the wedding, later we took the train and went back to study and, in Re-volf (ph), and sitting on the train I wore that wedding band and he did too and a Polish woman sits there across from us, she says, these days children have such a way of lying. </sentence><sentence id="1395">You wear wedding bands, you're both children! </sentence><sentence id="1396">He looked very young too, strange as it all sounds now. </sentence><sentence id="1397">But we finished our studies and the University was a totally different institutions. </sentence><sentence id="1398">The Soviets have changed it totally. </sentence><sentence id="1399">While anti-Semitism was somewhat there, it certainly was there, it was not official but there are no more Jewish students in my department. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I mean, there was no question in what I mixed with others. </sentence><sentence id="1401">What I recall was extremely cold winter of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="1402">The Soviets suddenly did not have any steam anymore, everything was just taken away, including the steam, how they managed that I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1403">But whatever they could put their eyes on was taken back to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1404">I recall going to the opera house, we were involved in opera, and seeing the Russian ladies in nightgowns because they thought these were evening gowns, and I recall in our, when they took our store they removed everything so my father still removed some dishes for bartering later which helped us for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1405">The Soviets nationalized the store, actually local people who became communist, who were communist, but now became very important officials, they came to help the Soviet soldiers to nationalize the store. </sentence><sentence id="1406">For my father it was a terrible tragedy because to him the business was his life to a very large extent and suddenly he was without anything. </sentence><sentence id="1407">The same happened to my father-in-law, his was also nationalized by the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="1408">To these people, they suddenly became old, and they were really not older at that point but everything was taken away from them, they felt. </sentence><sentence id="1409">So, the study was very different. </sentence><sentence id="1410">I had my final exams, they had to be in the Russian language. </sentence><sentence id="1411">We all had to study from the green book, I remember under my arm, and every student had it under their arm, every University student has this green book. </sentence><sentence id="1412">Very cheap paper in green cover, it was called the korr-up-tik qual for Bolshovitski Party (ph), which means The Short Course of the Bolshevik Party and was full of propaganda which I didn't realize at that time that it was propaganda, but it was about Stalin and it was about the Revolution. </sentence><sentence id="1413">One chapter I liked very much was the Marxist dialectic philosophy, it was very well written. </sentence><sentence id="1414">It seemed to have some, no, actually the Hagalien (ph) dialectic philosophy, it made sense. </sentence><sentence id="1415">It had some large expressions to be a lot of propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="1416">But we had to study every page and every word of it and the final exam, when they examined me in Polish literature, I had to talk in Russian. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I mastered the language very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1418">I forgot it very quickly too, you know I hardly know any. </sentence><sentence id="1419">But this was a    year in Re-volf (ph), the final year. </sentence><sentence id="1420">I was a newly wedded woman, my parents were depressed over what happened, what was going on, they were forever feared that they may be deported, that the Russians would deport them. </sentence><sentence id="1421">At one point, they actually would go home from time to time, at one point they came to take my parents away. </sentence><sentence id="1422">They always did it in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="1423">They were classified as bourgeois and this was a very bad certification and, in the middle of the night they came always with their rifles, rifling at the door. </sentence><sentence id="1424">We always were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And they took them to the railway station to take them to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="1426">I recall 1 was home at that point and my sisters was home at that point, and we ran to the railway station. </sentence><sentence id="1427">It was a lot of bribes to get them back home. </sentence><sentence id="1428">I wish we didn't, but that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1429">The bribes were always vodka and chof-socks (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1430">Chof-socks (ph) were watches, they loved watches. </sentence><sentence id="1431">The Soviets had absolutely nothing, it's unbelievable, how they took everything, taken back to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1432">For the first time they saw goods, which they haven't seen. </sentence><sentence id="1433">We didn't realize how the revolution had changed life there in those politics in poverty, unless among the highest officials, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="1434">So, they always ordered leather coats and when they ordered leather coats, they had to be to the floor because they figured when they go back and the winter is cold, they will cut and make a pair of boots, this was . </sentence><sentence id="1435">So, chof-socks (ph) and leather coats and our fine porcelain, all of it went somewhere with the Russian families eventually back to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1436">This was the Soviets, but I finished school and then they didn't permit me to live in Re-volf (ph), didn't permit me or my husband, because we were categorize as bourgeois. </sentence><sentence id="1437">And the Soviet law was that if you were in this category, you weren't quite an animal in Socialism but you were somewhere not to be trusted so you had to live fifty miles away from a large city. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Everybody wanted to live in a large city, so they punished us. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Instead of taking us to Siberia like they wanted to take my parents, who were considered useless, they figured two young people, these professionals, will be useful. </sentence><sentence id="1440">So the law was that you had to move fifty miles away from Re- volf (ph) and there were these centers. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They had a very bright idea, good idea, is to open up hospitals and pharmacies in the villages of the Polish Ukraine, which had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1442">There was never a school there, never a hospital, never a pharmacy, and the Soviets had a network of these things, very smart, the Poles never give them any credit for it. </sentence><sentence id="1443">But they did, so they opened up a hospital in    a place called Glen-na-novaria (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1444">You never heard of it, I never heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="1445">It was a real loss, it was a village in where there was no sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="1446">When a train, your shoe got stuck right in the mud. </sentence><sentence id="1447">It had a name, mud was a part of the name, so this is where they sent us to work. </sentence><sentence id="1448">My husband, they wanted to open a pharmacy, how did they open a pharmacy? </sentence><sentence id="1449">They took from the Russian church, from the parochial house, they took the house and they opened a pharmacy. </sentence><sentence id="1450">My husband opened the pharmacy and me, they wanted to teach in school and, because I wasn't prepared to teach young children, I was prepared to teach at gymnasium, I had a Masters Degree by then, my gis-trof-o- sovisia (ph) which was a high Degree. </sentence><sentence id="1451">So I was not versed in high school or anything, so they said I could be an assistant to my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1452">I learned how to make ca-go-cheekie (ph), was a little medication against headaches. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And I would wrap it. </sentence><sentence id="1454">Very often at night we heard them, heard the Soviet soldiers knock at the door with the rifle. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Each time we were prepared they would take us to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="1456">What they wanted were condoms. </sentence><sentence id="1457">In the middle of the night, they would rifle at the door for condoms. </sentence><sentence id="1458">This was 1940. </sentence><sentence id="1459">I thought we were lucky to have jobs, we had enough food. </sentence><sentence id="1460">There were three Jewish families, us, a Jewish doctor from Germany who was somehow or other came there and opened a hospital, it was all public works, and a Jewish teacher from Ha-riza (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1461">That's where all your Ukrainian peasants, everybody was illiterate there, absolutely illiterate. </sentence><sentence id="1462">So the three of us, sometimes they played cards, I was reading books always, but anyway, one day we went to vacation and my father, you know, was so desperate about once more to stand behind a pharmacy counter. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Once more to be an upper taker. </sentence><sentence id="1464">So with a great deal of difficulty, we arranged for him to come to our place in Glen-na-novaria (ph) for two weeks vacation and we would go to their home in Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="1465">It took us a lot of work to arrange that exchange. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Well, it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1467">We went there, home, we stayed in their home for two weeks and my father and mother-in-law went to our little place and took over the pharmacy to the greatest joy for this old man. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And we were suppose to, after two weeks vacations we were suppose to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And it was the 21st of June, 1941, and you know the rest of the story. </sentence><sentence id="1470">We didn't expect any of it. </sentence><sentence id="1471">We said good-bye to my parents, we had railway tickets to go the next day back to Re-volf (ph) and from there by horse and carriage to go to Glen-na-novaria (ph) and, in the middle of the night, I hear a lot of noise. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I look out of the window,    it was one in the morning, I see Soviet women and children being put on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1473">I woke my husband, I say, they must be going to summer camps. </sentence><sentence id="1474">But it seemed to be so noisy and so many trucks, middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="1475">I opened the radio and here Hitler's voice comes across. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Today I declared war on Bolshevism and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1477">And I knew things were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1478">The first thing in the morning, we ran to the railway station to get to that place. </sentence><sentence id="1479">The trains did not run anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1480">Nothing for civilians. </sentence><sentence id="1481">We were stuck in Kolomyja, his parents were stuck in that little hole. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Two weeks later we got a card, they were both shot. </sentence><sentence id="1483">The Germans walked into the pharmacy, they were renounced as Jews and they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="1484">This was the end of my husband's parents. </sentence><sentence id="1485">We were stuck in Kolomyja and first the Hungarians came to cover our city. </sentence><sentence id="1486">I remember them wearing these very high hats with feathers. </sentence><sentence id="1487">They didn't do much harm at that point yet. </sentence><sentence id="1488">Somehow or other I recall a truck of children, a truck with children. </sentence><sentence id="1489">I had no idea who these children were, but the children, the truck was covered but you could hear cries. </sentence><sentence id="1490">We were living then at the home of my parents and I remember my father said to me and my sister, my sister had run away from Nova-som (ph), from the western part where the Germans had been already for two years, she came to our home town. </sentence><sentence id="1491">And the Russians first were looking for her to send her to Siberia but anyway she got out of it and the Hungarians were there and my father said, bring the children a little hot water, it was a cold day. </sentence><sentence id="1492">So we run with a china of hot water and we hear the whimper of the children and suddenly shots come. </sentence><sentence id="1493">They were directed at us, at my sister and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1494">I remember we threw this hot water, the china, on the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="1495">This was my first confrontation with real terror. </sentence><sentence id="1496">But the Hungarians by and way were pretty innocent at the beginning, a least we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1497">Within a few weeks, the Germans marched in. </sentence><sentence id="1498">And now I know from history but those days I didn't know that right in the back of the soldiers came the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1499">They always were out and we didn't know the difference between an SS and a soldier and everything has been blamed on the SS but I now know that the soldiers were indistinguisukkotble from the SS because they participated as much. </sentence><sentence id="1500">But anyway, everyday there was a new directive, a new poster. </sentence><sentence id="1501">Today the Jews have to register and tonight the Jews have to observe curfew, and then Jews had to deliver all the gold and silver and then Jews have to deliver all the fur coats. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And I remember standing in a long, long line on a very cold day, shivering and    delivering fur coats. </sentence><sentence id="1503">When I got married my parents bartered some of their porcelain things with a furrier who made two fur coats for me, not one but two, during the last year of my studies. </sentence><sentence id="1504">It helped immensely because the University was so cold and I recall taking classes everyday bundled up in that fur coat. </sentence><sentence id="1505">Anyway, with these two fur coats I stood in line, we all stood in line to deliver to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1506">And I recall coming to the window, the German official, and he would register my name and address and the fur coat, the length of the fur coat, what it was made of. </sentence><sentence id="1507">One was a tweed lined with beaver, the other was a sealskin coat, and he gave me a receipt of it and I figured, well, if after the Winter passes I'll get it back, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1508">My ivory tables endless. </sentence><sentence id="1509">And then came the ax-e-on-a (ph), the activists. </sentence><sentence id="1510">All these names, we didn't know, we called them ax-e-on-a (ph) because the Germans called it ax-e-on-a (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1511">The raids. </sentence><sentence id="1512">There was not a ghetto yet. </sentence><sentence id="1513">I remember in the beginning, one of the raids was suddenly we saw people being dragged with ropes around their bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1514">This was the action against the intellectuals, the doctors. </sentence><sentence id="1515">We knew the Jewish doctor so well. </sentence><sentence id="1516">This was a diversion, when sometime in 1940 when the Soviets were there, I was an assured vacation, Passover vacation at home. </sentence><sentence id="1517">We were married then and my husband left at 6:00 in the morning I was suppose to take a later train, I do not remember why. </sentence><sentence id="1518">I leaned out of the window, this was 1940 in Kolomyja and it was a sukkotrp, cool morning and I felt a terrible pain in my breast, in my lungs, my chest. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And within a few hours, the doctors were there and they told me I have pneumonia, double pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="1520">In those days there was no treatment for pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="1521">My husband came back immediately, my father-in-law who still knew a lot about " anyway, they got together. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Sulfur was a way of treatment, but the medical knowledge at that point was if you lived seven days, I was pretty much unconscious with an extremely high fever, if you lived seven days, if you lived through the seven days you survive, otherwise you die at the seventh day. </sentence><sentence id="1523">So they put cups, what they called cups, glass cups on my chest, which I hated, but worse, they brought leeches. </sentence><sentence id="1524">And the leeches were always used medicinally by a barber, I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1525">The barber has a jar of leeches. </sentence><sentence id="1526">I can't remember, half conscious as I was, I kept sukkotking my head, I don't want leeches but he put leeches. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And whether the hot cups or the leeches or my father's prayers, whichever it was I woke up saying, I'm hungry, and this was the end of my    pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Almost the whole town was involved in my pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="1529">The three doctors were day and night and at my bed. </sentence><sentence id="1530">Their names I do remember, Dr. Tye-sukkot (ph), Dr. Fry-gar (ph) and Dr. Fleish (ph), all three of them. </sentence><sentence id="1531">When I got well, and I recovered pretty quickly I was young, and my mother took good care of me, I recovered, they insisted that the town should see me. </sentence><sentence id="1532">They took a fee-ak-a (ph), and-drosh-kind (ph) and a pair of horses and here were the three doctors with me and we traveled across the city so everybody knew I was truly alive. </sentence><sentence id="1533">In those days, you didn't pick up a phone [to call anyone]. </sentence><sentence id="1534">because I would like the names of these doctors to be remembered somehow or another, they were all killed. </sentence><sentence id="1535">Dr. Fleish's (ph) daughter went to school with me, gymnasium, is still alive in Stockholm. </sentence><sentence id="1536">So coming back to the German times, this I remember, famous doctors were in that aux-own-der (ph) being dragged. </sentence><sentence id="1537">We didn't know where people were being dragged, there were all kinds of rumors. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Later we found they went, dragged outside of town to a forest called Sukkotp-a-roth-sa (ph) and they were shot there. </sentence><sentence id="1539">They had machine guns there. </sentence><sentence id="1540">There were all kinds of rumors that they went somewhere but somewhere or other it began to bother us that perhaps really the rumors that they were killed were true. </sentence><sentence id="1541">We didn't quite want to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Every few weeks there was another action. </sentence><sentence id="1543">One a very sad one was a moc- row-seat (ph), a very poor neighborhood where they dragged out all the Jews and for some reason they focused on them and then there were, food was already beginning to be rationed, there was little food. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And in 1942, it was Passover, 1942, when the posters on the wall announced that all Jews have to go to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1724">Q: Can I ask you a little bit about part of this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1726">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1728">Q: First of all, you couldn't go back to where you were living. </sentence><sentence id="1729">Did you live with your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1732">A: I lived with, we stayed with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1733">We occasionally stayed with his parents when the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="1734">But we mainly stayed with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1735">My oldest sister, was also, she had her own apartment, she and her husband and Menek lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1736">We stayed with my parents at a big place. </sentence><sentence id="1737">Occasionally we stayed with the Knight-ess (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1738">This was the beginning when the Germans came and, go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1746">Q: Did you talk together about what happening or whether? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1748">A: Yes, we were very, very worried. </sentence><sentence id="1749">We could see what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1750">We began to, well, we never saw that all be killed, this was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1751">Some of us would disappear, we thought, the way they did. </sentence><sentence id="1752">People talked about the fact that these Jews were taken to the Ukraine, to the west-eastern part of the Ukraine to work on farms and we latched on to these stories, we really wanted to believe that. </sentence><sentence id="1753">Under no circumstances did we think that it would lead to gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1754">We had no idea, when you read the memos today and they said, we knew they were going to Treblinka, they knew they were going, we didn't know where they were going, it was a fact. </sentence><sentence id="1755">But there were massive raids on people. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And sometimes there was shooting right in front of us so we knew that things were terribly bad. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And there was beginning to be massive starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1758">People were going hungry, but there was always somebody who disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1759">You heard somebody, a cousin, an uncle, somebody just, just, he was taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1760">The word, the expression was taken away and many survivors still talk this way because we really didn't know the word, we don't know where they were killed, most of the time we don't know exactly when because taken away is the right expression for it because all we knew is we saw them disappear, being taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1761">The Ukrainians were extremely involved with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1762">Actually, they were shooting as much, they were rounding us up as much. </sentence><sentence id="1763">But the round ups, called ax-see-on (ph), were the most characteristic part of that period. </sentence><sentence id="1764">You were afraid of ax-see-on (ph) and you were beginning to think about hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="1765">It never occurred to us that we would disperse among the native population. </sentence><sentence id="1766">We just didn't think of it. </sentence><sentence id="1767">Everybody knew me, I'm Maria Heirsh from Kolomyja, where would I go? </sentence><sentence id="1768">Then came the arm bands, the white arm bands we had to wear. </sentence><sentence id="1769">The yellow stars we had to wear. </sentence><sentence id="1770">The names that we had to take, the identity cards that came, the cam-carda (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1771">Where with my name was Sarah, the man, I can't remember the name for the man, there was another Jewish name, biblical name for man, which means we were identified this way. </sentence><sentence id="1772">You couldn't move without a cam-carda (ph), you couldn't be out, you couldn't be in the street after 6:00, you couldn't walk on the sidewalks, everyday there were new restrictions of various serious natures. </sentence><sentence id="1773">There was a you-den-rot (ph) established, they asked my father to serve but he didn't want to serve, the chairman of the you-den-rot (ph) was a Mr. Horowitz. </sentence><sentence id="1774">A Jewish police was established, my husband's brother volunteered for it because you first thought you would save Jews, later he was involved in all kinds, I assume of horrible things, although he didn't witness them. </sentence><sentence id="1775">It was getting worse everyday. </sentence><sentence id="1776">We didn't know what a ghetto was. </sentence><sentence id="1777">By the way, when the Soviets withdrew and the Germans were just about to come in my father in strange ways looked forward to it. </sentence><sentence id="1778">He remembered the Austrians and he thought the Germans would be part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1779">With the Russians he couldn't communicate, they took away everything from him. </sentence><sentence id="1780">It was the Germans he favored since he speaks German and he remembers this. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Austria the whole while was for them the best part of their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1782">Hammsburg, Austria - the Kaiser was good to them. </sentence><sentence id="1783">I remember as a child when the picture of Kaiser Franz Joseph came down in our living room and they hung up the picture of Marsukkotll Pil-sook-ski (ph) and I was happy about it. </sentence><sentence id="1784">And they did it for their children, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1785">But they were very much attached to the German language, to the Austrians, so they didn't think that the Germans could be so bad because they really didn't know terribly much what was going on in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1786">And in Germany they didn't have extermination camps, people immigrated. </sentence><sentence id="1787">We knew someone from Bonn-sheen (ph) but our knowledge was limited. </sentence><sentence id="1788">The Soviets kept the knowledge away to a very large extent too. </sentence><sentence id="1789">They didn't tell us what was going on in western Poland because then they already had some camps. </sentence><sentence id="1790">They didn't tell, the Russians kept it very sealed, very tightly. </sentence><sentence id="1791">Any news from western Germany where many Jews lived. </sentence><sentence id="1792">Some of them escaped during the Soviet period like my sister did, my sister Frania. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1839">Q: When the Germans came in and started the ax-see-on (ph) and you saw things on the street, even though you didn't think it would be exterminations because who if any could have thought of that, did you see certain groups or certain people or were men more vulnerable than women did you think, or were they going to be the target? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1841">A: It was mixed, first were men which reinforced our false beliefs that they were taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="1842">Men, to a large extent. </sentence><sentence id="1843">But there was special categories taken. </sentence><sentence id="1844">At one point I saw the doctors, then came some of the lawyers, fathers of students with whom I went to school, one of them lives in California still, one is in Florida, they both were there. </sentence><sentence id="1845">Their fathers were lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Then it came for some workers, special workers, we were told the SS needs these workers. </sentence><sentence id="1847">But you could see sometimes shooting in the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1848">Oh, the children came much later and this was a real awakening at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1849">But, there were food limitations, severe food limitations. </sentence><sentence id="1850">We were beginning to be quite hungry, not starved yet, but hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1851">I remember the first day of Passover, this is in my mind very much, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1852">There was an announcement that we all had to go to the ghetto and they established three ghettos and they assigned to us the very poor part of the city. </sentence><sentence id="1853">We were permitted to take on carriages, I don't know why they permitted some of these carriages still, permitted to take whatever we could in carriages. </sentence><sentence id="1854">I remember I took a pillow, we took some dishes, a few potatoes, that's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="1855">And we settled in that one-room house at the end of the town, it seemed to me, a very extremely poor neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="1856">It was pretty dark, it was the first at night. </sentence><sentence id="1857">It must have been five o'clock in the afternoon, was still enough time to prepare something for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="1858">I recall peeling potatoes, the potatoes I saved. </sentence><sentence id="1859">And suddenly I felt smoke and I looked around and the ghetto was on fire. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And we began to run. </sentence><sentence id="1861">We saw people being shot, we saw houses on fire including our own. </sentence><sentence id="1862">We began to run, we didn't know where to run, people are running we are running with them. </sentence><sentence id="1863">They were running to the other part of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1864">In the other part of the ghetto lived my sister Frania and her husband and their child. </sentence><sentence id="1865">My husband stayed behind, he wanted to just catch something, still save something. </sentence><sentence id="1866">As we came there he arrived a few hours later, I remember, and his eyebrows were all burned and he came with a half-burned chicken. </sentence><sentence id="1867">He caught a chicken in order to feel us. </sentence><sentence id="1868">It was terribly bad but we left, we were alive. </sentence><sentence id="1869">And each time these things happen, we touched ourselves and touched each other. </sentence><sentence id="1870">We are alive. </sentence><sentence id="1871">This was Passover. </sentence><sentence id="1872">I went to my sister's place, she had a small place there. </sentence><sentence id="1873">We all crowded in there, whatever food they had we ate it together. </sentence><sentence id="1874">We later found that many people from that part, whom they caught, they took them away and that's all we knew, they took them away. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And most of the time they took them to sukkotp-a-rof-ska (ph) and sometimes in the distance you could hear this shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1876">Still, it would be somebody they perhaps shot, they obviously must have taken for work, by then they took all of the children and families, whole families. </sentence><sentence id="1877">This was the ax-see-on (ph) of Passover. </sentence><sentence id="1878">Later on, we found out, and dreaded holidays, we knew they were always were around holidays. </sentence><sentence id="1879">Was easy for them to drag all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1880">Finally we got a little apartment assigned to us in that other part of the    ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1881">One, your windows of that went to the air outside, but the inside of it was the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1882">Very small and my husband and I got an extremely small, it was a little porch and my parents got another one in that building. </sentence><sentence id="1883">Things were getting worse everyday. </sentence><sentence id="1884">I recall getting up in the morning and looking at the panorama of the ghetto, what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="1885">People were laying, some dead of typhoid fever or starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1886">An older Jew with a little carriage and a horse, which we later named the Messiah horse, would take these bodies on, put these dead bodies on that little carriage and drive them out of town for burial. </sentence><sentence id="1887">We called the horse the Messiah horse because it was the horse of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1888">By then we felt that dying, what you call of natural death, was a blessing. </sentence><sentence id="1889">Some of my uncles had this death. </sentence><sentence id="1890">I recall these bodies in the littered ghetto, they were littering the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I recall sometimes getting up the morning and seeing distorted faces hanging on the street lanterns. </sentence><sentence id="1892">And these distorted faces sometimes I saw the face of a teacher, of a relative, of a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="1893">This was the work of the SS or the common soldiers who knew where and what. </sentence><sentence id="1894">At night they would raid the ghetto, they would come in for a sport kind of thing, and would just find a few Jews and hang them on the street lanterns. </sentence><sentence id="1895">This I couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1896">This jolted me. </sentence><sentence id="1897">I could understand they would take away people because they need people to work in the factories, on the farms. </sentence><sentence id="1898">Why did they hang these teachers of mine? </sentence><sentence id="1899">By then I was pretty much fully aware of the tragedy, of the whole tragedy of it. </sentence><sentence id="1900">Then came a tremendous ax-see-on (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1901">This was in September, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1902">There were little ones in between. </sentence><sentence id="1903">There was an announcement that all men have to report to the auto- bites-on (ph), that they have to take along some food and then they will be sent to the Ukraine for work. </sentence><sentence id="1904">By then we were sophisticated enough not to trust them. </sentence><sentence id="1905">Only men, not women. </sentence><sentence id="1906">We figured still, if they want men only it must be for work, but on the other hand, everybody to register. </sentence><sentence id="1907">There were thousands of Jews in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1908">By the way, our ghetto became augmented because the Jews from the providence's like your friends Alice Shick-ee (ph), Kos-off (ph), Kou-tee (ph), Uram- sukkot (ph), all these places were bringing, the Jews were brought into my home town, in the ghetto, were all herded into the ghetto so the overcrowding was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1909">That all of them, all men had to register, we knew this much, every man in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1910">Well, I remember that dilemma that evening before. </sentence><sentence id="1911">Who should go? </sentence><sentence id="1912">The man in my family was my father, my husband, my two    brothers-in-law, Frania's husband and Cyla's husband. </sentence><sentence id="1913">Menek was too young to be, they unified in that Menek wouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1914">We decided our father shouldn't go because we were afraid that he wouldn't be taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="1915">I recall this very sad day, he came in and I couldn't recognize him. </sentence><sentence id="1916">He took off his beard, he sukkotved his beard to look younger and he looked horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1917">He was beyond recognition because my father, you see his photo, was a very handsome man and the beard was part of the handsomeness. </sentence><sentence id="1918">And he looked about 100 years older but he decided he wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="1919">My husband we thought would be safe because he was permitted while in the ghetto, he was permitted to work outside of the ghetto in his pharmacy. </sentence><sentence id="1920">They didn't know it to operate it so he had a Red Cross on part of his work clothes band, on part of his white band, he was permitted to go during the day so the Germans could have access to the pharmacy, but in the evening he had to come back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1921">Each evening, he was checked, he was trying to smuggle a little food for us, but each evening he was checked. </sentence><sentence id="1922">One day he was beaten up terribly because he tried to bring a few grains of rye, he had put them into his collar of his coat and they found it and they beat him up mercilessly. </sentence><sentence id="1923">But basically he was our contact with the outside world to some extent because he worked there and we decided to, he would be safe. </sentence><sentence id="1924">There was no question, they're not going to take him because him they needed. </sentence><sentence id="1925">The man decided to go, I don't know what made for the decision, probably there was still some sort of hope that they would go for work or something, and that, how could they hide?We had a hiding place in that place. </sentence><sentence id="1926">My husband really installed us there, before he went, he put my mother, my sister Cyla who then had typhoid fever, her son, Menek, my other sister on the other side, me and Blancka Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1927">He put us into that cellar downstairs and he covered the opening of the floor with a little rug, put a table on top of it and was sitting then that day. </sentence><sentence id="1928">I'll never forget that day, it was a horrible day. </sentence><sentence id="1929">The men were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1930">We hoped they would return, we worried about our father mainly because he was older and we worried about him more than the others. </sentence><sentence id="1931">We thought they would return or go to work somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1932">Sitting there waiting, there were a few other families there, and Blanca's child wasn't there anymore, I don't believe so, no. </sentence><sentence id="1933">She was alone. </sentence><sentence id="1934">And suddenly we hear some footsteps on top of that hiding place, with dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And boots, German boots. </sentence><sentence id="1936">And the dogs stopped and started smelling and we knew this was the end. </sentence><sentence id="1937">I still    don't know what happened that they walked away. </sentence><sentence id="1938">Something distracted them, perhaps they didn't trust the dogs enough. </sentence><sentence id="1939">I do recall that moment when everybody stopped breathing. </sentence><sentence id="1940">It must have been a second but it felt like eternity. </sentence><sentence id="1941">And how the mouths of these babies were covered with pillows and I was sure the babies would suffocate. </sentence><sentence id="1942">They didn't, it was a moment. </sentence><sentence id="1943">By then we knew that our days are counted, that they meant us too, not only the men. </sentence><sentence id="1944">We were sitting there for hours, I say it felt like eternity, and suddenly we felt smoke. </sentence><sentence id="1945">The house was burning, they set the house to fire. </sentence><sentence id="1946">We decided we have to go up. </sentence><sentence id="1947">We walked out, our house was not on fire for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="1948">The neighboring houses were made of wood, our house was not as made. </sentence><sentence id="1949">So, there was smoke all over. </sentence><sentence id="1950">The Germans seemed to have been at the end of their day. </sentence><sentence id="1951">There were dead bodies all over. </sentence><sentence id="1952">We could still hear some shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1953">The Ukrainians were walking into the apartments, taking out everything they could. </sentence><sentence id="1954">Polish guns, Ukrainian guns. </sentence><sentence id="1955">We were alive, our men were not there. </sentence><sentence id="1956">I remember the moment my sister, Frania with her baby, with her child, she had typhoid fever. </sentence><sentence id="1957">Somehow or other, late evening, the men come back. </sentence><sentence id="1958">Who came back? </sentence><sentence id="1959">Unbelievably, my father came back and my husband came back. </sentence><sentence id="1960">The husbands of my sisters did not come back. </sentence><sentence id="1961">We didn't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="1962">We comforted each other. </sentence><sentence id="1963">They were sending the Ukraine's to work. </sentence><sentence id="1964">The young men will be given food, they will be laborers. </sentence><sentence id="1965">We didn't quite believe it, a part of us believed, another part didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1966">We didn't know where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="1967">All the stories that survivors say they knew, we didn't know, nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="1968">We found out later through an escapee that they went to Belzec, the extermination camp at Belzec which was not far from Re-vof (ph) and which eventually swallowed so many of the Jews from our town and from the neighboring towns. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And I've read a passage about it in the book by Hillberk and I found a long chapter about it many years ago in the book of the American historian called Oln-ingst Pol-ece fie (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1970">What was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2106">Q: Browning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2108">A: Christopher Browning. </sentence><sentence id="2109">He has a whole chapter on that deportation day but I want to mix it in right now because I like to remember what I remember because this was all later. </sentence><sentence id="2110">We had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2111">For many of us after the war, we didn't know that they, where they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="2112">We found out this much, much later. </sentence><sentence id="2113">But there they were taken, that is where they were taken, they were taken to the extermination camp. </sentence><sentence id="2114">This was the first time that we knew, we didn't know exactly, but some witnesses came back. </sentence><sentence id="2115">Some people escaped from the train and they were telling us. </sentence><sentence id="2116">These were gas chambers, but he didn't know because he escaped. </sentence><sentence id="2117">This came, this was later and I'm trying very careful to disassociate these two sources of information, what we knew then and what we knew later. </sentence><sentence id="2118">But this is what swallowed my two brothers-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Menek's father and Alex's father, both young men, one was only 29, the other I believe was 32. </sentence><sentence id="2120">I always thought, how did they shove these young men into gas chambers, but they did. </sentence><sentence id="2121">We never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="2122">My sister Frania was then, was very high, typhoid fever, and she kept the baby next to her body and he was not infected, nobody understands how this happened. </sentence><sentence id="2123">We were all starved, we were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2124">After that ax-see-on (ph) the Germans arranged for us to have a soup kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="2125">It's reviewed in the Reich. </sentence><sentence id="2126">There were still thousands of Jews left, they were still being brought in from the provincial towns. </sentence><sentence id="2127">There seemed always to be more Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2128">Later I found out that on that day 8,000 Jews were removed but there were more. </sentence><sentence id="2129">I think they wanted to appease us, they wanted to appease us by making sure we will not hide, that there is still some life going on. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And actually after every ax-see-on (ph) which, after this extreme tension, this extreme pain, this extreme depression, a depression hung over the ghetto for hours. </sentence><sentence id="2131">After that you somehow recovered. </sentence><sentence id="2132">You got up in the morning and looked out, it was quiet, you went back to whatever you were trying to do, a little cooking, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2133">By then it was potato peels. </sentence><sentence id="2134">You went back to pray. </sentence><sentence id="2135">You went back to whatever work. </sentence><sentence id="2136">I worked in a factory where Blancka worked, in a tre-po-tosh (ph) factory, they were making uniforms for the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2137">Going out of the ghetto was permitted with a special permission. </sentence><sentence id="2138">Each evening we have to come back. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Jews were still permitted to go out to these work places, they always had to come back. </sentence><sentence id="2140">After each raid, after each ax-see-on (ph) there were days that you couldn't talk to each other. </sentence><sentence id="2141">You checked out who was still alive but then there was some normalcy. </sentence><sentence id="2142">Normalcy of life. </sentence><sentence id="2143">Amazing, but it was there. </sentence><sentence id="2144">People tried to go back. </sentence><sentence id="2145">I think the soup kitchen, which they introduced so late through the yood-en-rod (ph) was a way of appeasing us, of making sure we would not be afraid to leave our homes, which would make their work easier, but these are hindsight. </sentence><sentence id="2146">We didn't know    what happened then. </sentence><sentence id="2147">All we knew, the yood-en-rod (ph) asked my father, it was so important to make sure that everybody would get the right kind of portions, that soup, so they asked my father to supervise that soup kitchen, to stand to dish out that. </sentence><sentence id="2148">He was too weak by then, he just didn't want the job. </sentence><sentence id="2149">His legs were swollen. </sentence><sentence id="2150">He asked them whether they would permit his youngest daughter to do it and they did and so it was my job. </sentence><sentence id="2151">This I'll never forget again. </sentence><sentence id="2152">Originally to, they gave us some horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="2153">They made hamburgers of horse meat, they put in some horse meat in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2154">The women there were making this into hamburgers. </sentence><sentence id="2155">It took me a long time to get use to eating it. </sentence><sentence id="2156">But soup, and I remember the long, long lines of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2157">Sometimes I would recognize relatives, sometimes recognize the teachers, sometimes I recognize the father of another student. </sentence><sentence id="2158">They didn't look like human beings, the way they shuffled their feet, the way they asked and the pleading tone, ged-dak (ph), ged-dak (ph) means sick. </sentence><sentence id="2159">The soup was, had a little vegetables but it was watered, there was a little bit, a few beans, a few other vegetables and everybody wanted to ged-dak (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2160">It was my job to be fair about it and to make sure everybody would get their right amount of food. </sentence><sentence id="2161">This lasted perhaps two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2162">One day, it was close to this slaughter house in which was a Jewish slaughter house in which chicken were always killed. </sentence><sentence id="2163">There was a scream and I figured what are the Germans bring, chicken, they are killing the chicken? </sentence><sentence id="2164">A few hours later they found they slaughtered in this slaughter house, they slaughtered our children. </sentence><sentence id="2165">This was the end of the supplication, this was the end of me, this was just the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="2166">I ran home. </sentence><sentence id="2167">Couldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="2168">I couldn't tell anybody what I heard. </sentence><sentence id="2169">The rumor came later and everybody heard it. </sentence><sentence id="2170">This was the end of my soup kitchen standing, I think it was the end of the total soup kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="2171">The soup kitchen, the people stay with me, the people who looked like sukkotdows of their earlier selves. </sentence><sentence id="2172">These people who were begging, ged-dak (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2173">I wish they wouldn't be forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="2174">This was the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2175">I would like for a break, thank you. </sentence><sentence id="2176">End of Tape 1 Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2249">Q: Maria, when you came back from that horrendous experience, I mean, both the soup kitchen and then listening to the children, the people being slaughtered. </sentence><sentence id="2250">You said you came back and you didn't, to the house, and you didn't tell anyone. </sentence><sentence id="2251">How were you able to keep it inside and, or not show anything, or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2255">A: remember, I threw myself on the bed. </sentence><sentence id="2256">We had a very small place, one room. </sentence><sentence id="2257">I threw myself on the bed and I sobbed and sobbed for hours. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And then I went, and then my husband came in and I think we began to talk, and then the news was all over. </sentence><sentence id="2259">The city knew by then, the ghetto, but immediately I just couldn't put into words, I couldn't talk, I didn't, I didn't realize the extent of it. </sentence><sentence id="2260">I remember it was chronological I'm not sure that I remember exactly when it happened, but sometime in 1942, all of these things were towards the end of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="2261">A woman came to our apartment, to this small apartment that my husband and I stayed, and I recall she fell on her knees pleading with him to give her something. </sentence><sentence id="2262">I cannot remember whether he did or didn't, I didn't understand what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2263">I found out later that she pleaded with him to give her cyanide for the child. </sentence><sentence id="2264">She's alive, this woman is alive and I think the child is alive, somewhere in Australia. </sentence><sentence id="2265">This I heard many years later. </sentence><sentence id="2266">I'm trying to remember, she was from a in Kolomyja, Mrs. Hermann, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2267">Apparently the news came that the children would be taken away. </sentence><sentence id="2268">I think the full tragedy fell upon me at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2269">When I heard children, that they're planning to remove the children, then I knew that this was the end and there really is no way of escaping, there's no more talk about going to the Ukraine for work or anything. </sentence><sentence id="2270">That night, it was after that butchering, that night sort of brought the full awareness, the full confrontation with the truth as to what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2271">By then, I think Blancka who worked in that factory at was Lydia, the Polish woman who was the manager of the factory, it was about that time that she came home saying that Lydia is ready to give her papers to run away. </sentence><sentence id="2272">I still didn't understand the business of running away, I couldn't understand any of it. </sentence><sentence id="2273">A day later she brought papers and she showed me, she had a ken-card-da (ph), she had something which showed that she was, the name was Bruen-flower Per-nash-ik (ph) and we encouraged her to go away although I wasn't sure because at one point earlier one of my colleagues was trying to get through the ghetto wall and she was shot on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="2274">So there was a great deal of conflict that we were encouraging about, we already knew by then that things were going very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2275">She had lost all her family by then, so we thought, perhaps she should go. </sentence><sentence id="2276">She asked me that I should join, I wasn't ready to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2277">My husband started talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="2278">He was nearly everyday on the other side and somehow or other he began working toward my escape without my knowledge of it because I didn't want to hear about it. </sentence><sentence id="2279">This was towards the end of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="2280">By then, we began to talk about it, that you need some hiding places outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2281">The number of the people was narrowing down very much, there were just a few thousand people left. </sentence><sentence id="2282">At it's height, I think there were 30,000 Jews in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2283">So we knew that things are narrowing very much, but there was some peace. </sentence><sentence id="2284">They didn't do anything for a while. </sentence><sentence id="2285">Somehow or other we started talking about perhaps we could get some hiding places on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="2286">We had a friend and a woman who was a customer in our store, not quite a customer, she was a Polish woman, a very fine lady who was poor. </sentence><sentence id="2287">So, when she established a relation, my father who would give her some of the dishes whatever for, a little money, during the ghetto days she occasionally smuggled some food for us. </sentence><sentence id="2288">Her name was Wein-a- rof-ska (ph), and her place was across from the house in which originally my sister Cyla and her husband lived. </sentence><sentence id="2289">Somehow or other, he was in touch with her. </sentence><sentence id="2290">I found out these things much later. </sentence><sentence id="2291">But he was also in touch with another couple. </sentence><sentence id="2292">Well, I'm jumping a little bit ahead of time here, but actually came December of 1942 when we began to talk seriously about it. </sentence><sentence id="2293">That I should be the ice breaker in a way, I should be the first one in the family to get out, to join Blancka, and then my sister and her child will come.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2334">Q: How would you describe peoples relationships with each other as things are getting so terrible? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2336">And you describe this soup kitchen almost like they're ghosts walking towards you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2337">A: Families are different. </sentence><sentence id="2338">I've seen a lot of, it's painful to talk about it because I saw in families, how people were grabbing the portion of food. </sentence><sentence id="2339">These were families like my own where we always kept passing the food, I'm not hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Particularly my parents, we were this kind of family, close family, always passing the food to the next one, we're not hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2341">But in some families, they were fighting for the bite of food. </sentence><sentence id="2342">The people looked liked ghost, they were, all of us were in this, in this area there was no food left. </sentence><sentence id="2343">I remember when we started cooking the potato chips, potato peels. </sentence><sentence id="2344">My mother cooked it in water, she added a little salt to it. </sentence><sentence id="2345">This was the lunch. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Lydia Wen-a-rof- ska (ph), this is the Polish woman who sometimes smuggled in, in some way she smuggled in a little flour, so the flour had to be stretched. </sentence><sentence id="2347">It was mixed with, sometimes you had only potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="2348">But the starvation was everywhere, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="2349">I recall, somewhere or other I was younger and I think this helped because my parents legs were very swollen, particularly my father, he couldn't get into his shoes, he wore slippers my then. </sentence><sentence id="2350">I took a look at them at one point and I knew they could'nt't stretch it because of the starvation. </sentence><sentence id="2351">But more than that, I was just worried that they will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="2352">Sometimes I saw these weak people in the house, they didn't even bother to take them out, they shot them right there. </sentence><sentence id="2353">So it was at that time, but you want me to come back to Lydia, right? </sentence><sentence id="2354">To Lydia, I guess? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2374">Q: I want to ask you, was your father still praying, was he still religious in a certain way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2376">A: Yes, he was still praying. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Many of the orthodox Jews were still praying. </sentence><sentence id="2378">I hope he prayed when he was going to death, I hope so, because praying you know, somehow or other gets into another orbit. </sentence><sentence id="2379">I read about it later, that many of the Has-sid-ims (ph) they went into the fire while praying so they didn't feel what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2380">I suppose that some of these behaviors anesthetized them, I am not sure it happened to my father but, I wish it would. </sentence><sentence id="2381">They were, I'll tell you in a minute how they were killed, and that horrible death, but anyway, working in that part, in the ta-kosh (ph) factory we came home every day but then there were days that we were not permitted to leave the ghetto anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2382">And when Blancka left, she somehow or other, she put something into the mind of my husband in particular, that there is a way out. </sentence><sentence id="2383">But whether he'd thought about it earlier I'm not sure, he didn't sukkotre it with me. </sentence><sentence id="2384">By the way, he looked extremely non-Jewish while I looked Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2385">I didn't know I looked Jewish until I got to the other side, but he did and his Polish was perfect too, so he had some ideas at that point, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2386">He started talking about me and I didn't want to hear about it. </sentence><sentence id="2387">Finally, the arrangement was that I would be the first one to go to meet Blancka, then my sister and her baby would come, and then he would arrange for my oldest sister and her son and my parents, he will arrange a hiding place outside of town, through the help of this Lydia Wen-a-rof-ska (ph), and then he will come. </sentence><sentence id="2388">And he got himself papers too. </sentence><sentence id="2389">I can't remember the name, but he said he had papers. </sentence><sentence id="2390">He had, he brought in papers one day, sometime in December, he brought in papers with the name of Julianna Gol-ska (ph), he showed me, that's me. </sentence><sentence id="2391">He told me he obtained it through the help of some non-Jewish family and this was authentic. </sentence><sentence id="2392">Actually a girl who looked like me, who had died, and he purchased the papers, who he got them through I still don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2393">There was so little talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2394">Perhaps he talked more and the fright on my part really obstructed my thinking about it, or my memory about it. </sentence><sentence id="2395">I recall, the only way, I still don't know how I decided to go. </sentence><sentence id="2396">The only way, because he worked so skillfully on me, that he'll join me in two weeks, he'll come and meanwhile he had arranged all these things, and it seemed, he told me the idea thing, that I will be the path breaker, that P'll be the one to lead the way and they will all survive this way. </sentence><sentence id="2397">Whether I really believed it, I wanted to believe it, I still don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2398">It was a very hard decision but there was no time for decision. </sentence><sentence id="2399">Somehow or other they told me tomorrow, these people will pick you up in the morning at 6:00 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="2400">It was Christmas, 1942, the people I personally didn't know but my family did. </sentence><sentence id="2401">They were landowners, Polish landowners, sort of an aristocracy, who had business with my father. </sentence><sentence id="2402">My father use to give them these fine porcelain things and they remembered him and they wanted to do something for the family. </sentence><sentence id="2403">How we got hold of them, I still don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2404">Perhaps my father talked to him, some of these things I wish I knew but I do not. </sentence><sentence id="2405">It was Christmas morning, he brought in the night before a krosh-ock (ph), a krosh-ock (ph) is a Ukrainian fur coat, which is a peasant coat, which is skin on the outside and lambs wool inside. </sentence><sentence id="2406">Very, you have it on the photos you see of Kolomyja, peasant girls always wore these things, it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="2407">I remember he buttoned me up. </sentence><sentence id="2408">I remember he put into this sleeve, he put into five dollars into the sleeve of this krosh-ock (ph) we called it, the coat. </sentence><sentence id="2409">I said good-bye to my family the night before, at 6:00 in the morning, Christmas morning, 1942, these people were waiting outside in a pair of sleighs with horses. </sentence><sentence id="2410">I wish I could remember details, all I know is I went through the wall, which was not very far, the wall of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2411">I saw a policeman walking back and forth, he didn't see    me. </sentence><sentence id="2412">I recall removing the white arm band and all I know, I was in their carriage and they passed on the Aryan side and the windows of my parents room was through the Aryan side and I saw silhouettes of my parents in the window behind curtains. </sentence><sentence id="2413">And I had the strange sense that I'l] never see them again. </sentence><sentence id="2414">Despite the promises my husband made. </sentence><sentence id="2415">And I remember how I tried totally to deny that feeling, to stop that feeling, to stop thinking about it and to concentrate on the ride, and I was sure that somebody will identify me, after all, people knew me in the town, I supposed so. </sentence><sentence id="2416">But I was with these Polish people twice my age, they brought me to the railway station. </sentence><sentence id="2417">The man went out, he bought me a ticket to Re-volf (ph), I got on the train and I remember very little about the train ride except that I arrived in Re-volf (ph) in the home of their niece or cousin, it was a Christmas party. </sentence><sentence id="2418">Exactly what I needed at that point, but I came there, I was introduced as their friend from Kolomyja and it was a lot of festivity going on, there was food on the table. </sentence><sentence id="2419">I tried to join and then in the evening I left. </sentence><sentence id="2420">I was suppose to come back to their home. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And suddenly I saw a middle-aged man following me. </sentence><sentence id="2422">I remember he was dressed in a very warm way, there was a sort of kerchief on his head, and he said, Madame, he said in Polish to me, Mrs. Nei-dat (ph), you are the wife of the night of Kolomyja you look very cute, something of this sort, and I started running, and he ran after me. </sentence><sentence id="2423">It was a cold night of Christmas in Re-volf (ph) and I think my young, and I could hear his breath against me, and this must have been a scene of running, nobody else was in the streets, there was quite a bit of sleet, it was cold, Christmas night. </sentence><sentence id="2424">But I was young and I was a good runner and somehow or other, I still don't believe how this happened, he couldn't follow my steps. </sentence><sentence id="2425">And he stopped somewhere, I ran into a courtyard, then another courtyard, and I saw him again, and I could hear his breath and then everything stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2426">I never went back to these people. </sentence><sentence id="2427">But I had an address of, Blancka gave me some address on High-lit-ska (ph) Street and I went there and I made up a whole story and she wasn't there, I hoped to meet her, and without her and being all alone, it was the first experience, all I wanted the next day was to go home, to go back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2428">And I got in touch with that friend who helped her, Ad-ja (ph) was his name, a German Jew originally who had come from Kolomyja and he was very well entrenched as a Pole, he looked like Polish nobility, and I let him know I was here, he came to see me. </sentence><sentence id="2429">We locked the door, and I told    him, I don't want to hear about anything, all he can do for me was to go to the station and buy me a ticket, I was afraid to run around the station, and all I want is to go back to Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="2430">The man saved my life in strange ways by talking to six hours, he literally out-talked me. </sentence><sentence id="2431">By then, I was totally, totally passive and totally listless. </sentence><sentence id="2432">I pleaded, all I want is to die with my people in the ghetto and no argument really made sense to me, I wanted to get to Kolomyja and I wanted to die with my people, and he kept saying that I'll never get to my people, you will not be able to get into the ghetto, they will shoot me at the station, and nothing penetrated. </sentence><sentence id="2433">Perhaps it did and I didn't want to hear it. </sentence><sentence id="2434">I remember that after six hours, I couldn't hear anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And he didn't go to the railway station and I passed another day and he made up a whole story, he was my fiancee, he was somebody that was interested in me, and he will visit again. </sentence><sentence id="2436">And then later was very interested in him, he looked like Polish nobility, I was figuring there was some money too, I stayed another day and another day. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And I had a story, the story was that I came to study , | take a course. </sentence><sentence id="2438">So, the classes are not held every day and it's pretty flexible. </sentence><sentence id="2439">Anyway, with the Czech she looked away, she didn't know, I still don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2440">We don't know these things, but she kept me. </sentence><sentence id="2441">A few days later Blancka arrives. </sentence><sentence id="2442">Things fell through for her in Warsaw, she had only been to Warsaw, they caught into Warsaw, and there things broke. </sentence><sentence id="2443">So she came back here and we started a life together in that apartment, in that furnished room, and he would visit us and was, she always was a charismatic student and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2444">And one day, and this is after Christmas naturally, I had news from the ghetto, from Maria Roman-o-rof-ski (ph), through that woman who pushed food into the ghetto, and that everything was still the same, no change, they were still alive. </sentence><sentence id="2445">And one day, Blanca's looking for work, everybody said I shouldn't walk in the streets so easily, but then people were conscious I looked Jewish, I didn't know, but Blancka looked Polish, so she went for a newspaper very early in the morning to see what the , what or where were jobs, to look for a job. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And she hears somebody, calls her Blancka, and she got very frightened naturally because by then her name was Broom-ka Ba-nat-chek (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2447">She took a look in the doorway, sits my sister with the baby and her sister-in-law and they look like chimney sweeps, all covered with ashes from the ghetto, from running away from the fires in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2448">She brought them upstairs to her room and the story came out. </sentence><sentence id="2449">The story came out that on the 2nd of February, which I always remember for other reasons too, this was the time that Stalingrad was taken over by the Soviets, this was the first German defeat and was a change in the war, I didn't know then what, all I knew is that on the 2nd of February, the night of the 2nd of February, my parents and my older sister and Menek were sitting in another part of the ghetto by then, in their room, all dressed. </sentence><sentence id="2450">For days they expected, they expected the SS or the Germans to come and take them. </sentence><sentence id="2451">There was no way out by then, it was a very cold night. </sentence><sentence id="2452">And Menek told me years later that somebody came in from the neighbor's to tell about Stalingrad and that my father's spirit was lifted, and I'm so grateful for that moment, that his spirit was lifted. </sentence><sentence id="2453">But it was 2 o'clock in the morning or so, they came, and they took all out of them, they took them out. </sentence><sentence id="2454">I found out later that they women were separated, my mother and my sister, her daughter and her distant cousin, a young girl, , Tou- chie (ph) was her name, they were separated and the men, my father and his grandson, Menek, were taken separate. </sentence><sentence id="2455">And hungry they were, they were ill, they were not dressed well, it was terribly cold, sleet in the night, in the middle of the night, they dragged them through the streets of Kolomyja, they dragged them to Chap-a-rot-ska (ph) to be killed there. </sentence><sentence id="2456">Frania, who lived in another part of the ghetto, but then her husband had been taken away, she was with the child and she was with her sister and her husband's sister-in-law, this woman left her baby in the ghetto, she ran without the baby. </sentence><sentence id="2457">She and my sister and Alex Schlessing, Alex's name was Elee-ow (ph) then, they ran through the fire. </sentence><sentence id="2458">The ghetto was set on fire, they ran through the fire and half burned all, all covered with ashes, they found themselves at a neighboring railway station, they bought tickets and came to Re-volf (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2459">And they didn't know where to go, they didn't have an address or anything, so they saw one light, lit up, so they went into that building to find out about a hotel and the building was the criminal polizer, the police, the German police, nothing but. </sentence><sentence id="2460">Somebody prayed for them. </sentence><sentence id="2461">They said, there are no hotels, they walked out. </sentence><sentence id="2462">And they sat in a doorway and that is where Blancka met them and she found them. </sentence><sentence id="2463">My sister told us of the terrible details, that the parents were separated, and what happened to her and that they could hear the shots. </sentence><sentence id="2464">And she thinks, she thought perhaps Menek escaped, she wasn't sure. </sentence><sentence id="2465">Nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="2466">All I remember, this was late afternoon,    listening to the story, all I recall was that all I hoped for was that the floor would open up and I will disappear. </sentence><sentence id="2467">I didn't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="2468">She didn't know enough about my husband, he was separated from my father and Menek. </sentence><sentence id="2469">She thought she heard something, that he was taken to prison, that they were beating him, she wasn't sure, nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="2470">I still don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2471">Apparently, they either killed him in prison or took him to Chap-a-rof-sa (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2472">That was the night, the last night after that, no Jew was left in Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="2473">My nephew, Menek, wrote up about that night. </sentence><sentence id="2474">I recall that I couldn't stand just being alive. </sentence><sentence id="2475">I stretched on that floor, Frania too, and I wanted nothing but for the floor to open and the floor didn't open, that hard floor was there. </sentence><sentence id="2476">I couldn't even cry. </sentence><sentence id="2477">I couldn't take it in in any way. </sentence><sentence id="2478">Except Blancka woke me from that stupor I think sometime later saying that the landlady wants to bring us some tea. </sentence><sentence id="2479">And this meant we had to get up, wash up, and look pretty. </sentence><sentence id="2480">And I recall looking at the mirror and putting on lipstick and not believing it's me. </sentence><sentence id="2481">She brought in tea. </sentence><sentence id="2482">We had to make arrangements for my sister's place, they slept over that night, we made up a cock-eyed story and later we tried to find a place for them. </sentence><sentence id="2483">They found other people from my home town, other women, the men were all killed by then. </sentence><sentence id="2484">And the story of many came out much later. </sentence><sentence id="2485">What happened to him is a really fantastic story. </sentence><sentence id="2486">He was together with my father, being marched from that horrible night, and there was shooting and the dogs were barking and the dogs were biting some people. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And he was blaming my father in a way, saying, I told you we should have run away earlier, we should have gone to the place, whatever, and my father said to him, something from the Talmud, he said, the Talmud says if the sword is around your neck, a miracle may happen. </sentence><sentence id="2488">He was then 15 or 16 years old, he interpreted this as a sign from his grandfather he should run away, so he ran away. </sentence><sentence id="2489">For years he was trying to get hold of that quotation, found out about it rather recently, but he ran away and the people were being marched, they were marched to Sukkotp-a-rot-ska (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2490">By then it was early morning and the neighbors could look out and some saw the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2491">And he was wounded in his leg, a shot came to, a bullet got into his leg. </sentence><sentence id="2492">He fell on snow and ice. </sentence><sentence id="2493">A Ukrainian policeman stepped over him and said to the Germans very stoically, he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="2494">And as that colonnade of people marched and marched for hours, he was lying there, then he felt himself alive, just bleeding, so he crouched, he approached a house he knew in the ghetto where he had worked somewhere and    he saw a baby in the fireplace. </sentence><sentence id="2495">This is a story he told me about five years ago, he couldn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2496">And he didn't know whether the parents who ran, left the baby, hid the baby there because apparently there was no fire before, or whether the Ukrainians or Germans put the baby into the fireplace and set the fireplace afire. </sentence><sentence id="2497">This he kept secret. </sentence><sentence id="2498">Somehow or other, he jumped from that place because he heard the SS marching, and the Ukrainians, he jumped in the attic to another place. </sentence><sentence id="2499">He was jumping most of the time, he heard the shots and through in that snow he got outside of the ghetto to the house of the Polish woman, Bron-ra-off-ska (ph), who use to live across the street from their home and who use to take care of the plants of the flower plants of my sister-in-law when my sister went on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="2500">This Polish woman was poor and she supported herself by renting rooms to Ukrainian gymnasium students. </sentence><sentence id="2501">So she had a husband and she had two students who lived there because they went to the gymnasium and they paid her something, that's how she lived. </sentence><sentence id="2502">Very early morning, he appeared at the door of this woman. </sentence><sentence id="2503">I'm sure he looked more animal than human, and he heard the shots going on the Chap-a-rot-ska (ph), he knew this was his mother, he knew this was his grandparents, and he pleaded with the woman to let him in for the night, he was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="2504">And she said she can't, she's afraid because the Ukrainian students were there. </sentence><sentence id="2505">Somehow or other, I think, out of pity for this child-animal, she let him in for one night. </sentence><sentence id="2506">She put him in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="2507">Next morning she came to take him out and she was one who my father helped occasionally with some of the dishes to give her for a little money, I don't know what moved her, she didn't have the heart to take him out. </sentence><sentence id="2508">She left him, she covered him with straw and under straw he lived there for about six or seven months. </sentence><sentence id="2509">She kept him there. </sentence><sentence id="2510">She lived with great danger, her husband she apparently let on many months later. </sentence><sentence id="2511">The Ukrainian students never knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="2512">Every night she would smuggle a little food downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="2513">He was immobilized, he didn't move, it was then. </sentence><sentence id="2514">One day, he remembers, it was Spring by then. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Well, that night, he says, all he kept thinking, which of these bullets killed his mother and his grandfather and his grandmother because that's all he could hear, all night and all day the shooting was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2516">This was the last of the Kolomyja Jews and he remembers that all he was, felt guilty that he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="2517">But he was covered in snow, by straw. </sentence><sentence id="2518">And one day, toward the Spring in March, he saw the snow coming    down the windows so it was a little light. </sentence><sentence id="2519">Until then, he didn't see any daylight because snow and ice covered the windows. </sentence><sentence id="2520">And he looked around and he saw some books. </sentence><sentence id="2521">These Ukrainian students apparently when graduating they threw the books into the basement. </sentence><sentence id="2522">One of the books he took was a chemistry book. </sentence><sentence id="2523">He started reading. </sentence><sentence id="2524">That is why he's one of the foremost bio-chemist. </sentence><sentence id="2525">He's the one who is the developer of the ; ; Menek Goldstein. </sentence><sentence id="2526">This was the beginning of it, the chemistry book. </sentence><sentence id="2527">He lived hungry there because very little food she could afford to give him, she was afraid, every night would bring down a little bit, he was a growing boy. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And he lived in extreme terror of discovery, always afraid of the Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="2529">And one day, the woman comes in, she says, there is a denouncement, somebody denounced that she's harboring a Jew, he has to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="2530">That night, it was Spring of 1944, that he had to leave the basement, the shed. </sentence><sentence id="2531">And he remembered that Selik (ph), my husband's brother, had told him some time ago that he and some others would have a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="2532">In the middle of the night he ran to that hiding place, they didn't want to let him in. </sentence><sentence id="2533">They didn't want another person, they were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="2534">But my brother-in-law insisted, he had a gun with him because he was a policeman, so they let him in. </sentence><sentence id="2535">So he was liberated there by the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="2536">When the Soviets came he couldn't walk so they carried him. </sentence><sentence id="2537">The Soviet soldiers carried him on their arms to the , to the municipality to show what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2538">Later on, is a long story. </sentence><sentence id="2539">But, there's the story of Menek. </sentence><sentence id="2540">Later on still begins a long story, but that's one of, this is how Menek survived and how he depicted it in his statement about the last night in Kolomyja. </sentence><sentence id="2541">And us he told little details each time, each time we commemorate in a quiet way. </sentence><sentence id="2542">My sister, Menek and I, we commemorate February 2nd. </sentence><sentence id="2543">We don't have any celebration, we don't do anything much, but we don't go to cinemas and we don't do any entertainment, we have dinner together and we sit down and over the years always some detail comes out. </sentence><sentence id="2544">Some of these details just came out within a few years. </sentence><sentence id="2545">He couldn't talk about that baby, he couldn't talk about some of the things. </sentence><sentence id="2546">But that book of chemistry had such an influence. </sentence><sentence id="2547">It's a long story about Menek, another time perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="2548">So I worked because I wanted to make sure that the story of the last day in the ghetto, my parents horrible deaths, how they dragged them in that terrible, on ice, how they were falling around and I hoped they never reached that 9    that they died on the road, but I'll never know. </sentence><sentence id="2549">They were separated, men and women. </sentence><sentence id="2550">Can you imagine what happened to my father all alone. </sentence><sentence id="2551">Menek ran away, he didn't know Menek would survive to tell this story but he did. </sentence><sentence id="2552">So, this was the end of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2553">I knew these details from my sister in that house, that evening, and I said, we have to get up because this lady decided to give us tea, we have to make up and look human. </sentence><sentence id="2554">Then we found a place for her and then started all kinds of troubles because somebody told her that she is harboring Jews and had to run away from the place. </sentence><sentence id="2555">Anyway, it was, one day I walked with my sister and her child, and she was in grave danger because the boy was circumcised and with two of her friends, women friends from the ghetto, and their children. </sentence><sentence id="2556">And we were looking for the place for them to live because they were denounced by then. </sentence><sentence id="2557">My sister had some diamonds sewn into the buttons of her sweater, she never removed the sweater. </sentence><sentence id="2558">Each time things happened, she sold the diamonds somehow or other. </sentence><sentence id="2559">Kept all of us, Blancka and me alive too. </sentence><sentence id="2560">At one point, I needed new documents and the diamonds bought it. </sentence><sentence id="2561">We need an apartment and the diamonds bought it. </sentence><sentence id="2562">We were looking for something and I notice a girl who looks at me very much, it was a former student from my home, a Ukrainian girl. </sentence><sentence id="2563">And before I know, I notice that she is bringing over a Ukrainian policeman. </sentence><sentence id="2564">It was very dangerous and I motioned to Branch and to the other women, it's not good, we have to do something, we have to disappear, but how do we disappear? </sentence><sentence id="2565">He's looking at us. </sentence><sentence id="2566">So we decided to disappear in the next store, which was a millenary store, selling hats. </sentence><sentence id="2567">This is 6 o'clock in the evening and we try on every hat in the store hoping that this man will disappear. </sentence><sentence id="2568">Well, sitting there and trying on hats is exactly what we need at that point, he did not disappear. </sentence><sentence id="2569">The store closed, we had to move. </sentence><sentence id="2570">He did approach us, in very quiet words, voice, not to make any noise, he said, come with me, I know your Jewisses. </sentence><sentence id="2571">He started marching us out, what helped us most was it was dark. </sentence><sentence id="2572">The darkness helped all of us at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2573">And he took us somewhere in an isolated area, he had a revolver with him and he said, I'm going to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="2574">So we started pleading. </sentence><sentence id="2575">I started pleading with him that he shouldn't shoot my sister, if he has to shoot someone, me, because she had a baby, she had a child. </sentence><sentence id="2576">Anyway, he decided not to shoot but to take everything we had. </sentence><sentence id="2577">Rings, jewelry, whatever we had, there were five women of us. </sentence><sentence id="2578">He got everything. </sentence><sentence id="2579">He even took my coat. </sentence><sentence id="2580">We couldn't go back to    that place were we lived anymore, we had to find new places. </sentence><sentence id="2581">This was continuous when they caught us, we had to. </sentence><sentence id="2582">Finally we got a place, things quieted down a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2583">It was a better time. </sentence><sentence id="2584">Blancka and I got jobs in a German hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2585">This was a hospital for the treatment of returned soldiers from the front. </sentence><sentence id="2586">They had frost bite, they were sick, they had wounds, so Blancka became their scrub woman and I was assigned to the apothotacary (ph) which was very good for me because I knew something and I was handy about things, but I never disclosed that I knew German or anything so I was dumb. </sentence><sentence id="2587">It was quite a period in our lives except we sukkotred a room somewhere, a furnished room, and I developed a terrible pain in my feet. </sentence><sentence id="2588">I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk to the toilet. </sentence><sentence id="2589">And the question was, what do I do, how does one go to a doctor? </sentence><sentence id="2590">Finally things are so bad that they decided I have to go to a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2591">It was Polish doctor and he said, I have flat feet. </sentence><sentence id="2592">Which I got because I was so swollen, I ate only potatoes, breads, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And I swell up to such an extent, I weigh so much more . </sentence><sentence id="2594">Anyway, he put me into some shoes which I wore through the rest of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2595">It helped immensely. </sentence><sentence id="2596">And things were pretty smooth at one point. </sentence><sentence id="2597">Frania was also set up somewhere and one day, in that apothecary, the Ukrainian girl walks in. </sentence><sentence id="2598">She must have followed me or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2599">And she knew Stodge (ph), the chief of the Upper Taker (ph) German men in uniforms in the military hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2600">And she says, I know from that she's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2601">And he paled, I could see the blood was running down his face and immediately he reaches out for the telephone, I assume to call the military police, and I jumped through the window, it was a ground floor. </sentence><sentence id="2602">I don't know, I don't know how I did it, I did it! </sentence><sentence id="2603">How did I walk out of the ghetto, I jumped through, how did I did it, I don't know? </sentence><sentence id="2604">And I run into Blanca's other, to her and I say, let's escape, and we run away, told our story, couldn't get back anymore because we knew that we would be denounced. </sentence><sentence id="2605">We found out hours later, we find posters with our names and also in it they said Jewish Women and they masquerade for, they're trying to fool the German government, and so much money is offered for our capture and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2606">We sat in doorways, Ed-au (ph), somehow it involved Ed-au (ph), he was with us, he helped. </sentence><sentence id="2607">He got us tickets at night we went to the railway station, we got tickets to go to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2608">I never knew anything in Warsaw, I knew nobody. </sentence><sentence id="2609">Blancka had been at Warsaw, she knew the city. </sentence><sentence id="2610">On the train people were talking about soap being    made of Jews, we don't understand what they're talking about, we had no idea about these things. </sentence><sentence id="2611">I had a strange, weird feeling but I never understood what they talk was about. </sentence><sentence id="2612">Jewish muscles are being turned into soap. </sentence><sentence id="2613">Some primitive, very under-educated women sitting in the train with us. </sentence><sentence id="2614">We, our arrival, who I thought was a night train, the night train was the best things because it was dark, we arrive in Warsaw, and to just try to get through the railway station to a tram, and suddenly I feel two hands on my shoulders and I see two hands on Blanca's shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="2615">These are Polish Secret Agents, they introduce themselves, they're secret agents and in a very polite way, apol-solum pan-ya (ph) which means, would you kindly follow me. </sentence><sentence id="2616">We followed them right across the railway station, we see criminal polic-eye (ph), the police! </sentence><sentence id="2617">There were all kinds of polic-eye (ph), there was criminal police, there was shoo-pol (ph), there was Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2618">This is Good Friday, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2619">We come to that station, there's a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="2620">And they bring in men and we see the flames over the ghetto and to hear the ghetto is fighting. </sentence><sentence id="2621">The ghettos being burned, we don't hear about the fights, being burned and the Jews, they are escaping. </sentence><sentence id="2622">And we see men being brought in and separated from us immediately, brought to another room, we don't see them ever coming back. </sentence><sentence id="2623">Apparently because they are mounted to trucks or cars and ships and somebody immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2624">And they try to examine us. </sentence><sentence id="2625">They say we are Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2626">Blancka has a document, I have a document. </sentence><sentence id="2627">Where are you going? </sentence><sentence id="2628">Where are you from? </sentence><sentence id="2629">All kinds of lies, so they don't believe us, and I say, let call you'll find out about us. </sentence><sentence id="2630">But there were no telephone arranged to make these calls, or they couldn't get us, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="2631">A police comes in. </sentence><sentence id="2632">Blancka suddenly disappears. </sentence><sentence id="2633">I have no, where she goes. </sentence><sentence id="2634">I am alone. </sentence><sentence id="2635">A priest comes in and he starts examining me, in the catechism, it so happened that I studied it during those months. </sentence><sentence id="2636">And he says, I pass. </sentence><sentence id="2637">One question he asked, which I didn't know, I later asked many Poles about it, even after the war, very few of them knew. </sentence><sentence id="2638">I forgot the name of it, , if you give birth to a baby, viv-ia (ph) it's called, the priest, you're not quite clean. </sentence><sentence id="2639">The priest has to come out of the church and with his belt he has to bring you in. </sentence><sentence id="2640">So, very few Poles know it, very few good Catholics know it. </sentence><sentence id="2641">Anyway, he asked that question which I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2642">The rest, I knew everything very well, and I stuck to my guns. </sentence><sentence id="2643">My grandparents name is this and my parents name is that and I live on that street, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2644">I just told them believe me. </sentence><sentence id="2645">Blancka disappeared and I don't see her anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2646">The documents we had to leave right there, if you had documents they're not on the desk anymore, my documents are there. </sentence><sentence id="2647">My ken-carp (ph), my passport, my money is there. </sentence><sentence id="2648">Towards the evening, and I hear some noises and I see the flames of the ghetto, and they talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2649">Says the ghetto is being burned, flames over the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2650">Towards the evening, one of the Polish policeman, his name is Stau-ck (ph), and he interrogated me a lot, he says, come with me. </sentence><sentence id="2651">I'm going to mail a letter. </sentence><sentence id="2652">He takes me to the railway station, he mails a letter, no, he takes me to the post office right across the railway station and he disappears. </sentence><sentence id="2653">And here am I alone, in the street, probably the most dangerous place in the world for any person, right across the railway station. </sentence><sentence id="2654">With the ghetto flames coming right our way, there was a sewer next to me. </sentence><sentence id="2655">I see many Polish and Ukrainians, no, Polish and Germans, right there watching the sewers and the top of the sewer comes off and Jews from the ghetto trying to escape and they're being shot on the spot or taken away. </sentence><sentence id="2656">And my instinct is to run away but I don't have a document, I don't know the city, I don't have a penny and whether I felt I was at the end of the rope, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="2657">I am totally immobilized. </sentence><sentence id="2658">I wait for this man. </sentence><sentence id="2659">I didn't care, I knew escaping I would be caught immediately, I would be shot right because the people from the sewers were bring shot right there. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And I stand there in that place, which is so unbelievable for me, that I'm standing there and waiting for my death. </sentence><sentence id="2661">And he comes out, the policeman, Stau-ck (ph), and he says, come with me. </sentence><sentence id="2662">He takes me back to the police station and he says, you prove to me you're not Jewish, you would have run away. </sentence><sentence id="2663">He returns to me the documents and the money, what little money I had, and he says to me, come with me. </sentence><sentence id="2664">He puts me in the car, he goes with me, he says, you have no place to stay I will get you a place to stay overnight. </sentence><sentence id="2665">I figure he probably is putting me at a place where I'll be denounced or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2666">He brings me there, it is right at the border of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2667">He opens the door, the landlady opens the door and she opens another door, it was French doors I remember, and there sits Blancka. </sentence><sentence id="2668">He re-united us until today's day, we don't know who this man is. </sentence><sentence id="2669">He came back next day, he told Blancka that I look Jewish, no, he didn't say Jewish, he says, it's better if you try to get out, let her stay home and it will stop something, the message was that I looked Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2670">We later wondered, we still don't know, that perhaps he was    with the Polish underground, I wish I knew. </sentence><sentence id="2671">Certain things I so wish I knew. </sentence><sentence id="2672">I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="2673">The screams from the ghetto were coming out, all night. </sentence><sentence id="2674">The trucks were being loaded with people and there was shooting going right there and the flames were very close. </sentence><sentence id="2675">I don't know why he brought us there, perhaps he felt this was safe place, perhaps these were safe homes that they had for the underground, I say, this all comes from later reading. </sentence><sentence id="2676">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2677">He came back a few times, he told Blancka to go to the are-bites-aumph (ph) and look for a job and indeed, one day, she found a job through the are-bites-aumph (ph) and she became a maid, a cook in a German household. </sentence><sentence id="2678">The people's name was Kinsel (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2679">The man was the chief representative of taxation for all of the government. </sentence><sentence id="2680">There were twenty people working for him, they all were CPA's or accountants. </sentence><sentence id="2681">Blancka was cooking lunch for them and one day she tells me she needs help, she cannot do so much, so they say go and look for help, she says she has somebody she knows, she brings me and they have this scene in the book, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2682">I played the role beautifully of being a real maid from the worst parts of the city where I cannot speak any German, my mother is a laundress from that, I'm use to violence, I'm use to, I look a little bit like a whore, they said, when they interviewed me. </sentence><sentence id="2683">I didn't understand what in German, I had to, ask Blancka put it, the translation. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And they look at me and they say, they're not sure I belong here, I look like a whore, I look like a thief. </sentence><sentence id="2685">And with this background , So Blancka says perhaps she'll try out for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="2686">Anyway, when I came back to the kitchen we started laughing in unbelievable ways. </sentence><sentence id="2687">And since then, I was there to clean the rooms and she was my supervisor, she had a better job, she was the hausfrau, you know, she was the cook and she was the house maid, . </sentence><sentence id="2688">The trouble was when they wanted to send me to buy something, I was afraid to walk in the street. </sentence><sentence id="2689">So, I would walk in the streets like this, with my nose up, because my nose was a give-away. </sentence><sentence id="2690">I had fantasies of getting plastic surgery on my nose but first I didn't have a penny to do it and then I was afraid of these doctors. </sentence><sentence id="2691">So I didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2692">But the nose was a give-away. </sentence><sentence id="2693">Polish girls in Warsaw look very different, broad cheeks, blonde, we may look different now but in those days, you could see a Slavonic face. </sentence><sentence id="2694">And besides, there were people just seeming to do nothing but looking at you to see whether they can catch a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2695">I remember a child once attacking me, saying I'm Jewish and I    opened my big mouth and I said, I'm going to call the police, you know, I threatened him. </sentence><sentence id="2696">This happened to me a few times, whenever I was accused of something, I would open a big mouth, but I was in danger all of the time. </sentence><sentence id="2697">We lived with these people in a very good neighborhood because the Germans occupied the best part of town. </sentence><sentence id="2698">We had a room to ourselves and they would travel very often to Germany, they had a baby. </sentence><sentence id="2699">And for us these were the best days, when they went away because we could invite some people, we found people like Lod-joy (ph) and High-lin-ka (ph) and Boil-it (ph), we found the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2700">I recall distinctly the day when I found out there was an underground. </sentence><sentence id="2701">This was one of the great days in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2702">My depression, my sense of extreme terror, lifted. </sentence><sentence id="2703">I knew if I'm going to die, I'm going to die in some way knowing that Germans are being killed. </sentence><sentence id="2704">There is a resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="2705">It was a fantastic experience. </sentence><sentence id="2706">Until then, I didn't know about any resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2707">They were the first ones to introduce me to it. </sentence><sentence id="2708">There's the Polish resistance and Jewish resistance fighters and they're actually attacking Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2709">To be connected with this was, lifted me up in ways that I didn't know until that was possible. </sentence><sentence id="2710">I wasn't afraid because I was not afraid of dying. </sentence><sentence id="2711">So many times that I wanted to die, I think that dying, it is the way to die, I was afraid of the way in which they'll kill me. </sentence><sentence id="2712">If ?"" </sentence><sentence id="2713">m detected as a Jew, there are particular kinds of brutalities against people who cheated the German government, these are the German SS. </sentence><sentence id="2714">So they had horrible ways of killing you and this is what I wanted to avoid. </sentence><sentence id="2715">But to be dead, it really did not matter. </sentence><sentence id="2716">At no time did I believe I would survive, at no time did I believe this was possible. </sentence><sentence id="2717">We didn't see the end of the war yet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3075">Q: Let me ask you a somewhat frivolous question perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="3076">Did you rehearse being this maid before you walked into the Kensel (ph) house? </sentence><sentence id="3077">Who was this character? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3081">A: I rehearsed to some extent, I can't remember that I rehearsed. </sentence><sentence id="3082">I was prepared in a way, that I'll wear a, what do you call it, a dish towel around my body. </sentence><sentence id="3083">That I'll speak that Polish slang. </sentence><sentence id="3084">I knew about enough Polish, although I didn't think they will know the difference, really, but that I will be looking down at them with some sort of suspicion. </sentence><sentence id="3085">That I will take the job that fits me or I will not be interested, the job may be too heavy, I'll see. </sentence><sentence id="3086">That I come from Mok-ul-tof (ph), Mok-ul-tof (ph) was a place, was a suburb which was working people with a lot of crime in it and prostitution and open bars and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3087">And that my mother is a washer woman there. </sentence><sentence id="3088">And this gave them, Blancka translated it all, and then they sent me out and then they called in Blancka saying that they're not sure that they, that I belong, really. </sentence><sentence id="3089">This is background, I look a little like a thief, that I may steal. </sentence><sentence id="3090">And there was a guest of theirs there, no, she looks more like a prostitute. </sentence><sentence id="3091">So Blancka says she didn't know, but she'll hire me for a few days, see what happens. </sentence><sentence id="3092">And then there were twenty people working for this company, some of them were Jewish we found out later. </sentence><sentence id="3093">They were the CPA's and the accountants. </sentence><sentence id="3094">And work, being sent on errands was a death sentence to me because I knew I'll never come back, but they sent me to buy this and buy that. </sentence><sentence id="3095">And these kids in the street, saying Jud-ifka (ph), looking at me saying Jud-ifka (ph), the Jewiss. </sentence><sentence id="3096">How these kids knew immediately, it is in the blood stream. </sentence><sentence id="3097">When people are trained for generations to identify enemy people they know. </sentence><sentence id="3098">Same, I am sure it was here, with whites and blacks for centuries. </sentence><sentence id="3099">So every kid in the street identified me that easily. </sentence><sentence id="3100">And whenever I came home safe, it was a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="3101">Our greatest enemies were the people who, nos-trouch (ph), trouch (ph) is like a door man, but actually like a concierge, but lesser in status. </sentence><sentence id="3102">They were saying we had to register and he was on the out look for Jews because finding these Jews, there was money. </sentence><sentence id="3103">So there were always some stories, that the Jew was caught and there were always posters in the streets, they will offer $50, $100, whatever it is, if they would find the Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3104">So there was a searching for Jews going on continually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3130">Q: There was a word that was used for these posters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3132">A: Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3133">Sch-mol (ph) means fat. </sentence><sentence id="3134">They assumed that people would live off the fat. </sentence><sentence id="3135">And they're job, and there were too many of them, terribly many, might have happened in other countries too but in Warsaw it was a gang of Sch-mol-siv-a-nik's (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3136">Some of them might have been rich, some poor, some just hated Jews, some just wanted the money, whatever it was, they're job was to find a Jew and to extort money from him. </sentence><sentence id="3137">Sometimes they delivered you later to the police station but sometimes they let you go. </sentence><sentence id="3138">Sometimes they took your documents in addition to the money. </sentence><sentence id="3139">But Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph) was a profession at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3140">They stood in the streets of Warsaw and they observed you and they approached you. </sentence><sentence id="3141">Once on a tram, I saw a man looking very suspiciously at me. </sentence><sentence id="3142">And I jumped and I broke my nose and I bled in the street and the tram went further. </sentence><sentence id="3143">And Blancka later came out on the stop and she found me lying in the street bleeding, went to a pharmacy, I broke my nose. </sentence><sentence id="3144">We couldn't go to a doctor, you were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="3145">You were afraid of those Polish doctors too, and rightly so. </sentence><sentence id="3146">I recovered, and then the same happened over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="3147">Stel-ma Hov-en-jev-ens (ph), the book about the story about Stel-ma Hovich (ph), his brother by the way just published a fantastic memoir on the Holocaust, not to be missed. </sentence><sentence id="3148">I'll give you later the full title of it, I spoke to him on the telephone. </sentence><sentence id="3149">Stel-ma Hovich (ph) survived to become a big shot in Soviet occupied Poland as a chief bookkeeper for the government. </sentence><sentence id="3150">He met my sister, he told her that I might be alive, he wasn't sure. </sentence><sentence id="3151">That from that house people were taken to Germany, he wasn't sure. </sentence><sentence id="3152">He later found his brother, the brother that has that fantastic story about he and his brother ran away from Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="3153">He later joined his brother in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="3154">A woman with whom he was involved rejected him, that was how the story goes, he came to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="3155">He was depressed, he committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="3156">That was Stel-ma Hovich (ph), you ought to read the book, it's a fantastic memoir. </sentence><sentence id="3157">But this was one later of how other people working in this place were Jewish, Blancka recognized someone from her home town. </sentence><sentence id="3158">They were all afraid of me because I masqueraded as a main of the worst background, worth Polish background, they were afraid of me. </sentence><sentence id="3159">But she told Stel-ma Hovich (ph) and a certain, years later, but anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3160">So to move from it, one day, a man that I had seen in Germany, and Blancka made very good strudels, oh, there is something? </sentence><sentence id="3161">To stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3193">Q: No, we have a few more minutes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3195">A: That's all we have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3197">Q: Five more minutes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3199">A: For the rest of my story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3201">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="3202">Just the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3205">A: Oh, good, fine. </sentence><sentence id="3206">This man like her strudel and he offered to take her to Heidelburg to be a maid for his family. </sentence><sentence id="3207">Blancka decided to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3211">Q: Let me go back to something and maybe we'll be able to stop the tape. </sentence><sentence id="3212">I want to ask you about how you met people in the resistance, how you met Voler (ph) and others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3215">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="3216">There was somebody in our house who was always under, always live under disguise. </sentence><sentence id="3217">I forgot her name now, but she introduced us to Hele-inka (ph) and Bowl-ick (ph) and they loved our place because it was a safe place in a German neighborhood, German people living in it, so occasionally they would come up. </sentence><sentence id="3218">Particularly when the people for whom we worked were in Germany and the place was closed. </sentence><sentence id="3219">On a Sunday, they would come up and they would teach us to sing partisan songs, from the Bont (ph), I couldn't believe it, the whole thing! </sentence><sentence id="3220">I say this was the happiest days in my life during the Holocaust because I felt, I didn't feel the fear, I didn't feel the fear at all, I just felt the sense of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="3221">And I think if I'm not mistaken, Blancka once brought some documents for children because it was such a safe place, so we had all of the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3229">Q: So this is Latka-mead (ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3231">A: Latka-mead (ph), I think she brought some documents for children into our old room but I'm not sure, at this point Bowl-ick (ph) and Hele-inka (ph) were very much a part of our lives and Henrich (ph), he died later. </sentence><sentence id="3232">There was another man who wrote the beautiful memoir of , Bear Witness, Bernard (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3233">He too was involved in some way. </sentence><sentence id="3234">So it was like I knew life, an unbelievable kind of new life where we felt even if we died there was a resistance. </sentence><sentence id="3235">The Germans are losing. </sentence><sentence id="3236">So Sunday afternoon, occasionally, these people were away, they would come and we would listen to the in British radio, which was certainly not permitted. </sentence><sentence id="3237">And we would sing these songs and one day, against our expectations, these people, the Germans, come back earlier from a weekend. </sentence><sentence id="3238">They use to go to Berlin, come back earlier for a weekend and here is this group, we are singing and they're listening to the British radio. </sentence><sentence id="3239">Well, that fright was unbelievable, but they walked in. </sentence><sentence id="3240">We hid these people under our beds, we finally got them out, it wasn't so simple. </sentence><sentence id="3241">We had many such occasions where we smuggled people in and then we had to offer them under the bed to a hiding place, and then to smuggle out through the door, all of these things were extremely anxiety provoking. </sentence><sentence id="3242">Scenarios, but they were a part of our life at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3243">Until the man came saying he was taking Blancka to Germany if she wants to go and she registered for a trip, the separation was very difficult for us. </sentence><sentence id="3244">I remember, we went to Bowl-ick's (ph) home for a sort of a party, a get away party, and when I walked out of the party I was drunk and I kept saying in the tram, I'm Jewish, that's all I needed to say. </sentence><sentence id="3245">And they following day she left and I was left alone, it was a terrible loss for me naturally, but she, we thought about the past, how to join her, everything was very uncertain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3262">Q: Maria, you talked about how difficult it was when Blancka was leaving for Hiedelburg. </sentence><sentence id="3263">Tell me something about your relationship and what it meant to be able to be together in a situation like this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3266">A: Extremely important to have another body. </sentence><sentence id="3267">Not to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="3268">Being alone, being isolated was one of the great dangers. </sentence><sentence id="3269">You just couldn't hardly survive without having someone with you. </sentence><sentence id="3270">I remember days when I was very much isolated whenever things happened. </sentence><sentence id="3271">Blancka had to run, I had to run you know? </sentence><sentence id="3272">It was, it felt, you really couldn't live through it. </sentence><sentence id="3273">But when Blancka left, it was a great loss to me. </sentence><sentence id="3274">We maintained correspondence in some way, she was able to write from Germany, and there was always some hope that perhaps I'll find myself there, although I didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="3275">She encouraged me to go but how could I go? </sentence><sentence id="3276">For me the greatest danger was to go to the official employment bureau to ask for a job because to go to Germany you had to apply for a job there. </sentence><sentence id="3277">There had to be proof for a job there. </sentence><sentence id="3278">For me just to show myself, show my face in these offices was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="3279">So we maintained our contact mainly through correspondence at that point, but until then, we were extremely inter-dependent. </sentence><sentence id="3280">Her looks were helpful, I had more sense of danger I think, of reality, I was quick this way for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="3281">I think we complemented each other very well this way, but we were very close to each other and as I say, we were intimate in our relationship and I knew of the losses she suffered. </sentence><sentence id="3282">She knew very much of my family life. </sentence><sentence id="3283">She tried to steal some oranges in the hospital to bring to Lash-ick (ph) so we were very intertwined, extremely so. </sentence><sentence id="3284">And her absence left a tremendous void in my life, but more than that, a sense of danger too, that I'm all alone here. </sentence><sentence id="3285">I had no idea the war was coming to an end. </sentence><sentence id="3286">Coming back to it, I remember Bowl-ick (ph) and Helene Ko-vet-all-lich-al (ph) and Lod-ja (ph), we had intermittent contact. </sentence><sentence id="3287">From the time she had left until I joined her wasn't that long. </sentence><sentence id="3288">I'm trying to remember, I can't remember exactly when she left but somehow within the next few months the Germans started running. </sentence><sentence id="3289">We heard about it, that the Soviets are approaching. </sentence><sentence id="3290">Even before that, Blancka and I celebrated each victory on the part of the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="3291">At one point, we heard that Kolomyja was liberated and this came through the radio, the British radio, no, another city, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="3292">On the British radio, on that radio we heard it later in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3293">So we celebrated each time, quietly. </sentence><sentence id="3294">We had such a double life, an official life and a life between each other. </sentence><sentence id="3295">We were extremely close, I would say, in a very intimate kind of relationship. </sentence><sentence id="3296">We maintained it later for many decades too. </sentence><sentence id="3297">But when she left, it was pretty, I did have some correspondence, I heard a little of it, that she was working in a household there. </sentence><sentence id="3298">She didn't seem to be in danger of any kind, danger of detection. </sentence><sentence id="3299">It was very soon afterwards we heard rumors that the Soviets are approaching, they are taking over large parts of Poland, the eastern part. </sentence><sentence id="3300">And one day, I remember, the German family for whom I worked just took off to their town in Germany and they didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="3301">And within a few days, the office workers also left. </sentence><sentence id="3302">And then I was all alone when I heard that the Soviets are approaching Warsaw, they're in Prague, in the suburb of Prague. </sentence><sentence id="3303">Being all alone, the telephone stopped working, I would have like to call Lodz, I would like to call Helena but I couldn't, but I was all alone, I figured, well, in a few hours or so the Soviets are going to be here, so walk out of the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="3304">This was a German section, the Germans were not there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3305">There were Poles, and I knew the Soviets are coming in. </sentence><sentence id="3306">I didn't really think about my sister, Frania, she was involved with the child, I didn't know about Menek, although we did have some intermittent communication. </sentence><sentence id="3307">At one point, pretty much everything stopped, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3308">But I knew that I'm going to be free in a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="3309">But the Soviets did not come in. </sentence><sentence id="3310">And I was all alone in that big apartment, not understanding why they take so much time. </sentence><sentence id="3311">The following morning, I began to hear some shooting. </sentence><sentence id="3312">I later found out there was an uprising, the Poles started an uprising against the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="3313">This was beyond my belief! </sentence><sentence id="3314">Well, before I knew, the Germans were coming back and the Poles seemed to be fighting both the Germans and the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="3315">I walked out in the street to see what's happening, I was terribly isolated by then. </sentence><sentence id="3316">I saw people running. </sentence><sentence id="3317">All the Polish people from the neighborhoods were running. </sentence><sentence id="3318">I joined them, I didn't know why people were running. </sentence><sentence id="3319">And so we kept running, we moved slowly into sewers. </sentence><sentence id="3320">Suddenly I'm in sewers. </sentence><sentence id="3321">And then the Polish people began to talk about what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3322">That there was an uprising, that the Soviets didn't come in, that the Germans are    back. </sentence><sentence id="3323">And that the city is being burned down. </sentence><sentence id="3324">Well, I didn't feel a minute anymore about being, the part about being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3325">This did not, somehow or other, I can't remember, that Helin-ka (ph) and Bowl-ick (ph) joined me. </sentence><sentence id="3326">I think we ran together but this is what I'd like know, to see Helin-ka (ph) to find out these details. </sentence><sentence id="3327">I don't remember whether we, how many days we were in the sewers, but it seemed like an eternity naturally. </sentence><sentence id="3328">And from time to time, the sewer door would open and you could see a street and you could hear some shooting and then it would close again and we were again in the sewers. </sentence><sentence id="3329">I don't remember how we were fed but somebody, there was some crumbs of food going around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3396">Q: Were you in the water? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3398">A: In the water, that high up. </sentence><sentence id="3399">And these were not the sewers of the ghetto, these were the sewers of the city of Warsaw, Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="3400">Some were in uniforms, some were civilians, all age groups. </sentence><sentence id="3401">I didn't know how far we were going, what it was I thought a day, but it was more than a day definitely. </sentence><sentence id="3402">It was a good many days, the idea was, I found out later, that we will be going up to the vestibular where we will get out and get a boat to go to the Soviets, to Prague. </sentence><sentence id="3403">Finally we arrived at the vestibular and Bowl-ick (ph) and Hel-inka (ph) and I, by the way, we wrapped around ourselves a blanket so we wouldn't be separated because there were lots of people there, we were afraid we would be torn apart. </sentence><sentence id="3404">And to come out in that bright sunshine, this was September of 1944, August, end of August, beginning of September, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3405">And we tried to get into a boat, there were many people coming out of the sewers, and we see the city is pretty much in flames, and we try to get ona boat. </sentence><sentence id="3406">We cannot get in, it's filled, Bowl-ick (ph) got on the boat, Hel-inka (ph) and I still waited for another boat to come. </sentence><sentence id="3407">The Soviets are right across the vestibular, some people were trying to swim it. </sentence><sentence id="3408">Suddenly from no where the Germans appeared, the vestibular is at the bottom of the city. </sentence><sentence id="3409">The important part of the hill, the old city. </sentence><sentence id="3410">Suddenly, there are Germans in the old city and from no where I feel a bullet in my back. </sentence><sentence id="3411">They shot me through my coat, I was in a coat, and I'm bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="3412">And the same bullet goes into the arm of Hel-inka (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3413">I fell to the ground, she didn't I think. </sentence><sentence id="3414">I was pretty unconscious, I was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="3415">And then they have us get up, I still don't understand how it was possible for me to be bleeding and get up, and we are being marched. </sentence><sentence id="3416">We were apparently, I found out later, the last group of the Polish uprisers. </sentence><sentence id="3417">And they are dragging us through the city of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3418">We see the city in flames, and they are dragging me, I can hardly drag. </sentence><sentence id="3419">And all of us have to put out a handkerchief or something to show to the Germans our surrender. </sentence><sentence id="3420">We had to show something white, flags we didn't have, so everybody raises a hand with a little shirt or something, we're surrendering. </sentence><sentence id="3421">I couldn't walk, people helped me or what, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3422">All I recall, at one point, I was extremely thirsty, probably from loss of blood, and I bent down to pick up an apple. </sentence><sentence id="3423">Poland is full of orchards, of apple orchards, it was the season for it. </sentence><sentence id="3424">I tried to get an apple into my mouth and a German soldier hits me right in my back, march! </sentence><sentence id="3425">He didn't know I was Jewish, but then I was totally unafraid of being detected as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3426">I was a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="3427">They marched us to a place outside of town called Poroskov. </sentence><sentence id="3428">In Poroskov they had a special detention camp for all the Poles who fought in the uprising and other Poles too. </sentence><sentence id="3429">Lodz eventually was in Poroskov too but I didn't know at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3430">I was so sick that I wish I knew these details because I didn't function mentally anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3431">But I recall waking up, there are somehow or other bodies on top of me. </sentence><sentence id="3432">It was so crowded there that they pushed people, we fell asleep and the bodies, somehow or other I sneaked out of it. </sentence><sentence id="3433">Before I know it, I was on some transport being marched again to a place to be, to a place to be, anti-loused, means cleaned of lice, a de-lousing station. </sentence><sentence id="3434">And then they put us on a train and I'm on a train with Hel-linka (ph) holding onto each other and with lots of other Poles. </sentence><sentence id="3435">Polish families, not children, Polish men. </sentence><sentence id="3436">On that train, and by then it is September I know, on the train were the only two women and the men are all in Polish uniforms, they were fighters. </sentence><sentence id="3437">The train was moving very slowly, I had no idea where we were moving, we fall asleep all of us. </sentence><sentence id="3438">Sometime in the middle of the night, or it was very early morning, one of the fighters wakes up and he starts talking to the other one, the Jews brought all the tragedy and the Jews will take over Poland because of the Soviets and they got us into all that trouble. </sentence><sentence id="3439">And one of these guys looks at the other and says, you know what, these two girls across from us, they look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3440">You better tell. </sentence><sentence id="3441">By then it was about four in the morning or so and it was just light, it was just coming, and then they fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="3442">And without saying another word to Hel-linka (ph), we motioned to each other that we're going to jump from the train. </sentence><sentence id="3443">I'm sure that the motivation was not to escape from that, the    motivation I believe, but I'm not sure, was to just die. </sentence><sentence id="3444">Before these Germans come to take us. </sentence><sentence id="3445">We understood by then that the train was being shipped out to Stutthof, which was a detention camp where Polish people were shipped in order to work for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3446">And we knew the beginning of the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when the Germans arrived to take us out. </sentence><sentence id="3447">So without saying a word to each other, the window was open, the train was moving very slowly, I can't remember who jumped first. </sentence><sentence id="3448">And I can't remember anything else except that I wake up in the home of a Polish woman in a town called Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3449">I never heard of the town, it's south of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3450">These women had attended me, given me a clean bed, attended to my wounds, told me the story of what happened after I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="3451">I don't know, it was a few days that I was pretty unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="3452">She said that when we jumped out a priest thought we were dead. </sentence><sentence id="3453">He was going to the cemetery to bury some body, he saw these two girls from the Warsaw uprising, so he figured he's going to bury us, with a decent Catholic burial. </sentence><sentence id="3454">When he noted that we were breathing. </sentence><sentence id="3455">So first he buried these people who he meant to bury, then he brought us to this Polish woman on the outskirts of Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3456">Poor woman but a very decent soul. </sentence><sentence id="3457">She was very happy to be able to be of service to these Polish revolutionaries, the Poles who fought, the Polish fighters who fought for independence of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3458">So she treated us beautifully, I could see how poor she was but she treated us extremely well, and one day a neighbor comes in and she opens the door to our room and she wants to tell him, these are two girls who were in the Polish resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="3459">He takes a look at us and he says, she look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3460">That night, Hel-linka (ph) was sick of me because she looked Polish, she said good-bye to me and I haven't seen her until years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3461">I saw her again about two years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3462">Hel-linka (ph) had blue eyes and she was blonde and she wanted out. </sentence><sentence id="3463">I stayed on, I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3464">The Polish woman was absolutely an angel, she said you have to go, you can't be here. </sentence><sentence id="3465">She wrapped up for me half her bread in a kerchief and two apples and early morning I leave. </sentence><sentence id="3466">I didn't know where I was going but, it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="3467">At that time, nothing mattered anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3468">I knew I wasn't afraid at all because I wasn't Jewish anymore, nobody would think of me as Jewish at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3469">Poland was falling apart. </sentence><sentence id="3470">I kept walking, so I walked into town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3546">Q: You just said that it didn't matter that you were Jewish because people were, but this man noticed and this woman? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3548">A: That man noticed, but on the whole people were already running and life didn't matter to me. </sentence><sentence id="3549">I was all alone, I was wounded, I had a pain in my back. </sentence><sentence id="3550">I had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3551">I didn't know where to go, I don't think I had documents at that point because I was running in the sewers, I don't remember what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3552">And I don't remember because I was on the high fever. </sentence><sentence id="3553">So I walk into that town, I see Thom-ma-sla-sov-en-sky (ph), I never heard of it before, there are two Thom-ma-slick's (ph), one is the other is the home of Rabbi Lowengers (ph) brother. </sentence><sentence id="3554">They preeminently gave testimony about their experiences as children in camps. </sentence><sentence id="3555">So I walk in, I hardly walk, but I walk with the apples and the bread. </sentence><sentence id="3556">I see an apothecary for pharmacy. </sentence><sentence id="3557">European pharmacies are very different than ours, they're very formal. </sentence><sentence id="3558">I had nothing to loose, I walk in, I say I am a, I ran away from the uprising, I fought in the uprising because this was my new identity. </sentence><sentence id="3559">The man, and I know a little bit about pharmacological work because my husband was a pharmacist, I use to help him, he is delighted to see me, he says. </sentence><sentence id="3560">Well, first I wanted to rest up, I wanted to meet my family, tomorrow you come to work. </sentence><sentence id="3561">You can do bottles, you can wash up, fine. </sentence><sentence id="3562">He sends me upstairs to his family, a nice home they made, his wife was charming to me, the maid makes a luxurious bed for me, I felt so guilty to get into that bed with beautifully clean linen. </sentence><sentence id="3563">I haven't seen that in a long time, starched linen I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3564">And they invite me for dinner and everything's fine. </sentence><sentence id="3565">And I sleep through the night and in the morning the maid comes in saying, she's very sorry but her landlady told her how sorry she was but I cannot stay here any longer. </sentence><sentence id="3566">I think, ah-oh, they discovered where I was. </sentence><sentence id="3567">So I say, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="3568">She says, in the morning when you got up I made the bed, I noticed there were lice in your bed. </sentence><sentence id="3569">And my landlady says you should go because you were wounded. </sentence><sentence id="3570">You should go to the clinic to clean out your wound. </sentence><sentence id="3571">Well, I still remember laughing to myself, lice! </sentence><sentence id="3572">Anything is better than being discovered as a Jew! </sentence><sentence id="3573">I dragged myself to that clinic and they started working on me and the doctor without any anesthesia they cleaned my wound, it was extremely painful I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3574">I screamed from pain. </sentence><sentence id="3575">And they took out the lice, they cleaned me out totally. </sentence><sentence id="3576">And I hear the nurse saying to the doctor, you know, she looks Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3577">Here I'm in the hospital, in the emergency room. </sentence><sentence id="3578">Nothing happened and nothing mattered at that point, I walked out, I knew I was bandaged. </sentence><sentence id="3579">I didn't have lice. </sentence><sentence id="3580">I figured should I go back there, it's really not the place for me to go back, I'm afraid. </sentence><sentence id="3581">By then it was very late evening, I was extremely tired. </sentence><sentence id="3582">I was still so very sick. </sentence><sentence id="3583">I ate those apples and the rest of the bread and I stretched out on a bench. </sentence><sentence id="3584">It was a cold night, it was by then I think the end of September, beginning of October. </sentence><sentence id="3585">It was raining, drizzling, and I fell asleep and nothing matters. </sentence><sentence id="3586">Sometime in the middle of the night, somebody pushes me. </sentence><sentence id="3587">I open my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3588">A German soldier, a German policeman. </sentence><sentence id="3589">Come, he says to me. </sentence><sentence id="3590">I wasn't afraid. </sentence><sentence id="3591">He didn't know in the middle of the night that I was Jewish or anything, he was collecting all these homeless people to ship them out to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3592">So he brings me again to a place for cleaning, de-lousing, clean, I walk out clean. </sentence><sentence id="3593">I think they gave me something fresh to wear, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3594">And he brings me to an assembly hall where there are lots of Polish women. </sentence><sentence id="3595">All these women, collected from the street, are being shipped to Germany to work. </sentence><sentence id="3596">By then the Germans were loosing the war, their men where coming home on crutches. </sentence><sentence id="3597">Their women were sent to the front to work. </sentence><sentence id="3598">They didn't have enough workers so they were collecting Polish people all over. </sentence><sentence id="3599">I'm among Poles, therefore nobody knows I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3600">But, we get on a train, and then the man who is a greeter tells us we are going to go to Germany to work but before we do we are going to stop in Pat-o-vich-a (ph), which is a border town which by then was Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3601">And he takes us out and he says, I want you to sit in this corner, we were a few hundred people by then, to sit in this comer and to wait for the evening. </sentence><sentence id="3602">We are going to take an evening train and I'll come back in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="3603">We know you'll sit and rest here, will being some food. </sentence><sentence id="3604">I took a look at the group and I didn't know whether I looked at them or they looked at me but it didn't look to me kosher that I could survive with these Polish groups. </sentence><sentence id="3605">So I said, if I have to be back and see if I could walk away a little bit, so 1 walked away. </sentence><sentence id="3606">And here I could see Germany falling apart. </sentence><sentence id="3607">Many Polish people of German extraction, falk-stoich-er (ph), are coming into the station. </sentence><sentence id="3608">They are running from the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="3609">And at the station there are many soup kitchens supervised by German nurses, like the German Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="3610">So I hear their story about how the Soviets are after them, how they ran away    from rape and all kinds of things, so I figured, I'm also falk-stoich-er (ph), why not? </sentence><sentence id="3611">I speak German better than they. </sentence><sentence id="3612">So I go over and I ask for soup and I tell them that "m running from the Soviets so they give me one cup of soup and another cup of soup and a third cup of soup. </sentence><sentence id="3613">I remember milk so distinctly, finally I am full, I've eaten good food. </sentence><sentence id="3614">And this is a Sunday afternoon I believe and I walk out of the station. </sentence><sentence id="3615">Pat-o-vich-a (ph) is not touched, it is a German city, it's an industrial city, it was the biggest textile city after Manchester, I knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="3616">And I see the stores full of fabrics, I couldn't believe what's going on here. </sentence><sentence id="3617">I came from the ashes, literally from the ashes of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="3618">And I walk and I don't know where to walk, I figure I have to walk away from that Polish group. </sentence><sentence id="3619">Let's see if I can get to Heidleburg because I'm wanted in Germany, and since everybody's running. </sentence><sentence id="3620">I'm not Jewish, everybody's running, the German, the falk-stoich-er (ph) are running, the Poles are running. </sentence><sentence id="3621">The Poles couldn't run they are too but the Germans were running from their home. </sentence><sentence id="3622">So I see a Hitler parade, and believe it or not, this is the funniest thing in my life! </sentence><sentence id="3623">I joined the Hitler parade and I go like this, Heil Hitler! </sentence><sentence id="3624">Heil Hitler! . </sentence><sentence id="3625">First they had soldiers in brown shoes, but then people talked, it was Sunday afternoon, I think it was for Hitler's birthday, I'm not sure, but it was a special occasion. </sentence><sentence id="3626">So I walked with them until the evening, then they disperse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3710">Q: What's your state of mind when you joined this parade? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3712">A: Oh, I was so exhilarated. </sentence><sentence id="3713">I was absolutely exhilarated. </sentence><sentence id="3714">Imagine me to join a Hitler parade! </sentence><sentence id="3715">I'm in Germany! </sentence><sentence id="3716">This still brings to me laughter whenever I think about that moment! </sentence><sentence id="3717">How did I do it, but what else could I do? </sentence><sentence id="3718">I was in the safest place to be for me. </sentence><sentence id="3719">In a Hitler parade! </sentence><sentence id="3720">I'm together with all these Germans saluting the flag and all the things, and there are speeches and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3721">Many hours pass and the evening comes and they begin to disperse, so I have no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="3722">I figured these Poles must have left, but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="3723">So I circle around the station. </sentence><sentence id="3724">I wasn't afraid because people were on the march by then you see. </sentence><sentence id="3725">They were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="3726">This was the best feeling for me. </sentence><sentence id="3727">I come back, indeed, the people are gone. </sentence><sentence id="3728">So I take a look, what am I going to do? </sentence><sentence id="3729">Now ["Il try to get on a train and find my way to Heidleburg, I knew Blancka was there. </sentence><sentence id="3730">I had some idea of where, the place where people from Bolm-sukkot (ph) worked. </sentence><sentence id="3731">I got to, it's late evening by then, I get ona train and I suddenly notice the military train from Russia, the Germans, all military, I'm the only woman. </sentence><sentence id="3732">I say, oh, that's very dangerous, so | hide in the restroom. </sentence><sentence id="3733">In an hour or so, they need the restroom and start yelling to get out, I get out, they look at me, and by sheer luck because I have to think it was luck you know, the train stops. </sentence><sentence id="3734">It was the city of Dresden. </sentence><sentence id="3735">So I walk out at the station and the train goes away, it goes wherever they went. </sentence><sentence id="3736">I walk, it was very quiet I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3737">It was by then, was morning, early morning hours. </sentence><sentence id="3738">I walk into town and I sit down in a cafe, I didn't have money but I figure I would sit down, rest stop. </sentence><sentence id="3739">And so the new bombs came. </sentence><sentence id="3740">This was the great bombing of Dresden, it was an earlier bombing. </sentence><sentence id="3741">You see R-A-F, this was the British Air Force. </sentence><sentence id="3742">The best feeling in this world, that I'm going to die of a bomb, what can be better? </sentence><sentence id="3743">I remember even bombs in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3744">At one point, the British were bombing Warsaw and I stayed in a household there, not with the Germans, it was in a Polish place, I had a furnished room, and people were running to shelter. </sentence><sentence id="3745">So these people called me, come! </sentence><sentence id="3746">Come with us to the shelter! </sentence><sentence id="3747">And I did everything possible not to go to the shelter, I wanted to be killed by a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="3748">Couldn't be a better death. </sentence><sentence id="3749">And I recall doing this, putting my feet up and my head into my legs, hoping that when a bomb kills me that it will kill all of me rather than just some legs or the head separates. </sentence><sentence id="3750">This was my dream, to be killed that way. </sentence><sentence id="3751">I really didn't want to live, so when people say they tried to survive, they wanted to live, I really didn't want to live but I didn't want to die detected by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3752">I was afraid of that death. </sentence><sentence id="3753">But I've seen before how people were killed and their leg was hung there and I was there and this to me was a horror, so I remember that night of bombing. </sentence><sentence id="3754">I didn't go to the shelter but I waited for the bomb, the bomb didn't come to me. </sentence><sentence id="3755">So this is Desden, and I sit in a cafe and the second floor of that cafe is coming down and I'm sitting there literally, seeing the bombs, and things happen, it's like an earth-sukkotke, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3756">It sounds like an earth- sukkotke. </sentence><sentence id="3757">And I see many people are dead in the street and here I walk out alive. </sentence><sentence id="3758">I was meant to live and that's all they can say, why I wasn't killed I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3759">So hours later, I walked down to the railway station. </sentence><sentence id="3760">I still have in mind if I'm alive I want to go to Heidleburg, so I get a train. </sentence><sentence id="3761">It was some sort of a civilian train. </sentence><sentence id="3762">Nobody looked at documents, nobody looked at tickets, it was so chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="3763">It was mainly refugees from the falk-stoic-er (ph), from everywhere, and Germans too    from the cities, there were bombs, they were moving west, that's how it was going. </sentence><sentence id="3764">But mainly from the eastern part of Germany, which was originally Poland. </sentence><sentence id="3765">Finally I see this train stops at Frankfurt and before I get out bombs come over Frankfurt, this was a little bit too much, unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="3766">But this was the time of the greatest bombing of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3767">So the railway station is all in fire again and many passengers walk out alive and many passengers are killed right there. </sentence><sentence id="3768">And I'm alive. </sentence><sentence id="3769">It's fantastic! </sentence><sentence id="3770">So I figured, now I have to go from Frankfurt to Heidleburg, certainly no trains anymore, the railway station is all in flames. </sentence><sentence id="3771">I see people walking, I follow them, they are walking to the highway to hitchhike. </sentence><sentence id="3772">So I hitchhike too, I'm a German you know! </sentence><sentence id="3773">I'm a falk- stoich-er (ph), poor, dear soul. </sentence><sentence id="3774">I'm better qualified to be falk-stoich-er (ph) than anybody else here because those who live for generations in Poland is falk-stoich-er (ph), that and German, they didn't speak German they didn't know a thing. </sentence><sentence id="3775">I'm certainly much more , So I go with them. </sentence><sentence id="3776">And they start hitchhiking, so I get on a truck, I remember the truck goes only a little place, he leaves me there, I had to hitchhike again. </sentence><sentence id="3777">Must have been six modes of transportation, finally a train goes somewhere between Mannheim and Heidleburg. </sentence><sentence id="3778">I arrive at Heidleburg, I arrive intact in Heidleburg. </sentence><sentence id="3779">I walk into the ladies room to wash up and I wash up and I look in the mirror and I see a chimney behind me, a chimney sweep, and I figure how does a man come into this? </sentence><sentence id="3780">I look around, he's gone. </sentence><sentence id="3781">So, I wash my hands again, I look again and I see the chimney sweep is back!And I look back, it's not a chimney sweep. </sentence><sentence id="3782">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="3783">I did this with my hands and I noticed it was me, not a chimney sweep!

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4087">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4088">It's one of the joys, memories. </sentence><sentence id="4089">I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="4090">He came back and within hours we heard some people were moving, rushing, we went down to the highway, we saw American tanks rolling. </sentence><sentence id="4091">You couldn't see anybody, you just saw the tanks, they were closed up. </sentence><sentence id="4092">Blancka and I stand next to the fields and suddenly one of the roofs of the tanks opens up and a young soldier, American soldier, in Yiddish which he thought was German, so he says, Fraulines! </sentence><sentence id="4093">Fraulines!Fraulines! </sentence><sentence id="4094">We had to make now, Munich, he wanted the road. </sentence><sentence id="4095">So we hear this German Jewish and to say, Yidden! </sentence><sentence id="4096">Yidden! </sentence><sentence id="4097">Yidden! </sentence><sentence id="4098">We're Jews! </sentence><sentence id="4099">Well he is, but he has to keep rolling, so he throws us two cartons of cigarettes, of the cigarettes the war was over, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4100">Well, I go back and I figure this the end of my working for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4101">Although the war was still going on, but "m not going back to work there. </sentence><sentence id="4102">I went back and I refused to work, but I still have my little room. </sentence><sentence id="4103">So, Herr Professor in his civilian outfit by then, it was like a diminished man, an unbelievable change, what happens to the uniform, the high ranking uniform when you have to leave it? </sentence><sentence id="4104">He comes up, the Herr Professor, this is his wife, he sends her up to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="4105">And he wants me, he's concerned that his wife said I'm not working. </sentence><sentence id="4106">And that he wants me to, he wants to know what my plans are. </sentence><sentence id="4107">I say, I don't know, I guess I'Il go back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4108">So he says, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="4109">It's not so good for you to go back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4110">After all you're an ethnic German, the Poles may not treat you so well. </sentence><sentence id="4111">I said, I'll take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="4112">He says, but I have a better plan for you. </sentence><sentence id="4113">Here in the village is a mort-k-eye (ph), a store of smoke products. </sentence><sentence id="4114">I have contacts there, they know me well, they will arrange for you to be a sales girl there. </sentence><sentence id="4115">You will have a . </sentence><sentence id="4116">And he notice along these lines and I figure I'm crossing inside and finally I say to him, Herr Professor, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="4117">I'm neither falk- stoich-er (ph), nor Polish, I'm a Jew! </sentence><sentence id="4118">And tall as the man is, he stretches out on the floor and fainted! </sentence><sentence id="4119">And my floor was smooth because it was a maid's room, an attic maid's room. </sentence><sentence id="4120">Well, he revived. </sentence><sentence id="4121">He went down, this was the end of my job. </sentence><sentence id="4122">No more talking about jobs or anything. </sentence><sentence id="4123">I don't know how they dealt with that news, I have no idea because I realized at that point the danger soon to be there. </sentence><sentence id="4124">Although the Germans occupied the city by then, I didn't know how much they occupied. </sentence><sentence id="4125">They were marching. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4166">Q: You mean the Americans were marching? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4168">A: The Americans, yes. </sentence><sentence id="4169">So I figured something may happen. </sentence><sentence id="4170">A night or two nights before, he wanted me to dig a hole in the garden where he put some guns. </sentence><sentence id="4171">He hid guns there. </sentence><sentence id="4172">And Blanca's people hid wine. </sentence><sentence id="4173">Bottles of wine. </sentence><sentence id="4174">They were prepared for the Americans, you know, so the Americans may want, he hid guns there. </sentence><sentence id="4175">And I figured it's not good for me to be there at this point. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4176">We didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="4177">I said to Blancka, I say, "m not working anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4178">She says, I'm not working either. </sentence><sentence id="4179">We go down to look at these tanks and the tanks keep rolling, but we have no money, there's no money, there's nothing to buy. </sentence><sentence id="4180">We went into town, everything is closed. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4181">Heidelburg is totally closed up, not one store is open. </sentence><sentence id="4182">And so we decided to live in these fields near the highway. </sentence><sentence id="4183">We slept there and we ate grass. </sentence><sentence id="4184">I'll never forget after the war, the first few days we ate grass. </sentence><sentence id="4185">It's hard to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="4186">We decided not to go back. </sentence><sentence id="4187">And there was nothing to do but on the third day I think we realized perhaps we could do something with these cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="4188">So we walked into town and indeed, we knocked at the doors and we told, cigarettes, cigarettes, trading something, and they gave us some food. </sentence><sentence id="4189">Finally we found our way to a place, an American Red Cross club. </sentence><sentence id="4190">That place was to serve donuts and coffee to American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="4191">It must have been within a week or two, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="4192">We told the guys that we were Jewish and that we were slave laborers here and could they do something for us, could they give us a job? </sentence><sentence id="4193">They agreed to have us serve the boys. </sentence><sentence id="4194">So if I speak English in a funny way, that's the place where I picked up my English. </sentence><sentence id="4195">I never went to school, this was my school. </sentence><sentence id="4196">I served coffee and donuts and Blancka too. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4197">Was a great life. </sentence><sentence id="4198">We got a furnished room because for the donuts we were able to trade. </sentence><sentence id="4199">We brought dozens of donuts to a place where they had a furnished room all ready. </sentence><sentence id="4200">Then we decided we need to learn English. </sentence><sentence id="4201">So we went to a German woman who was a teacher of English. </sentence><sentence id="4202">Gave her a dozen of donuts and she taught us English. </sentence><sentence id="4203">To the beauty parlor for donuts, everything was for donuts because there was no food and we had access to as many donuts as we wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="4204">So this put us on our feet. </sentence><sentence id="4205">One day, a man comes in, in an outfit from Auschwitz, I didn't know about Auschwitz, I had no idea where he was from, but he wore one of these pajamas and he told us he was in Auschwitz, told us his story. </sentence><sentence id="4206">And he says, he needs to talk to the military governor, he needs some document to go and find his wife, but he doesn't speak English. </sentence><sentence id="4207">So I said, I speak English, I'll    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4208"> take you there. </sentence><sentence id="4209">I come to the military governor and he has refugee assistant and I interpret for this man and the military governor turns to his assistant and says, what language does she speak? </sentence><sentence id="4210">That was my English. </sentence><sentence id="4211">I stopped going for English lessons to this woman, she taught me in a way that was no English! </sentence><sentence id="4212">I thought I spoke English. </sentence><sentence id="4213">Slowly I learned the language and slowly a man came in from underground, Mr. Volinger (ph), and he started helping us in whatever way. </sentence><sentence id="4214">Eventually, they organized, the American Red Cross organized a transport of trucks to go to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and to bring back the Jews from Heidleburg, from, and they were inthe _--_--.----Heidleburg, Frankfort, Manchester, some other towns, Offenbach. </sentence><sentence id="4215">And they ask if anybody speaks Russian, I volunteer to speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="4216">So they attach me, they put me in a uniform, some American soldiers uniform, and I go with them to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and I say, before you go we have to cross Russian borders. </sentence><sentence id="4217">We have to take cha-socks (ph), watches and a lot of Vodka. </sentence><sentence id="4218">They don't understand, I say, trust me. </sentence><sentence id="4219">That is what we will need. </sentence><sentence id="4220">Well, the minute we cross the border into Czechoslovakia, they immediately saw these soldiers and they don't let us through. </sentence><sentence id="4221">We need a stamp and that stamp, a round stamp, a green stamp. </sentence><sentence id="4222">I say, don't bother with them, just give them the cha-socks (ph), well, they salute us, we go further. </sentence><sentence id="4223">We get to Karlsbad, where my sister use to live. </sentence><sentence id="4224">We come there, they cannot let us through because we don't have the right kind of a stamp. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4225">We have a square stamp, they want a round stamp. </sentence><sentence id="4226">And I say, where is your supervisor? </sentence><sentence id="4227">Oh, he's taking a bath. </sentence><sentence id="4228">A bath? </sentence><sentence id="4229">We'll wait. </sentence><sentence id="4230">They say, oh no, he likes to be in the spa the whole day and the whole night. </sentence><sentence id="4231">So, I figure that's no way, this cost a lot of Vodka and cha-socks (ph), but we went further. </sentence><sentence id="4232">Finally, it was evening, we arrive in Tilsit-en-shot (ph), it's high up. </sentence><sentence id="4233">This scene I'll never forget again. </sentence><sentence id="4234">We come with a convoy of trucks, of busses actually. </sentence><sentence id="4235">And we had a list of people who were deported to Trencin-en-shot (ph), hundreds of thousands of names, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4236">They had, the Red Cross had collected it. </sentence><sentence id="4237">There's a big, big courtyard, it's towards the evening, and we see people sort of sukkotking. </sentence><sentence id="4238">These people were in a coma of dying. </sentence><sentence id="4239">The Soviets brought in food which they couldn't digest. </sentence><sentence id="4240">It was a terrible scene and I have that list and they cannot read the list, they don't know who's alive, who's not. </sentence><sentence id="4241">Before I know, a Soviet policeman, a soldier policeman, puts his hands on my shoulders, he says, please follow me. </sentence><sentence id="4242">He gets me into the big castle, an empty    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4243"> room, a tremendous room in the castle. </sentence><sentence id="4244">It's all dark. </sentence><sentence id="4245">He says, wait here, I should wait. </sentence><sentence id="4246">He locks the door on the outside and I'm all alone in that place. </sentence><sentence id="4247">It was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="4248">My only thought was, in the morning, the truck will pick me up and I'll go to Siberia because that was the Russian way. </sentence><sentence id="4249">I didn't want to lie down, I was standing because I was afraid of rats. </sentence><sentence id="4250">I was standing there the whole night, waiting for the morning to be taken out, no matter where. </sentence><sentence id="4251">He comes in the morning, he takes me out, he brings me back to the American Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="4252">Until today, I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="4253">I assume, because I spoke Russian and I wore an American uniform, that they took me for a spy. </sentence><sentence id="4254">Or perhaps these guys intervened for me, I still don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4255">We came back with a handful of people, the worst of people from Heidleburg from these places. </sentence><sentence id="4256">All I recall, when I crossed the border into German territory, I nearly kissed the land. </sentence><sentence id="4257">That was how you do with Soviet Russia. </sentence><sentence id="4258">There, I met two girls in Russian uniforms from my home town. </sentence><sentence id="4259">They were in the army, they work with the victorious armies, they were marching. </sentence><sentence id="4260">And they told me that they saw Blanca's husband in Krakow". </sentence><sentence id="4261">So, I told that he come back from Russia, so I went back to Heidleburg, I told Blancka about it, she could hardly wait. </sentence><sentence id="4262">She wanted to go to Krakow" to meet her husband, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="4263">So we both leave the job at the American Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="4264">There was a big repatriation movement then, they were patroiting all of these people to Poland and there was a truck load of Poles coming back from Germany as slave labors into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4265">And all that talk you hear is anti-Semitic talk in that truck. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4266">We were just about to cross the border into Czechoslovakia to go to Poland and I hear these comments and it was a stop for us. </sentence><sentence id="4267">I say to Blancka, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="4268">I'm not going back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4269">I couldn't go back to Poland, I couldn't hear that talk. </sentence><sentence id="4270">Here I was already in America, in a way, the American Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="4271">She was quite desperate about our separation, but she went, she wanted to find her husband. </sentence><sentence id="4272">She comes to herself later, she found her husband with another woman. </sentence><sentence id="4273">He married a woman in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="4274">Anyway, so I went back to Heidleburg. </sentence><sentence id="4275">I stayed a while. </sentence><sentence id="4276">Somehow or other, they had displaced persons camps, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4277">I was going from one into another. </sentence><sentence id="4278">One day, I work for Ohrdruf, from the Red Cross they sent me to Ohrdruf because I spoke languages. </sentence><sentence id="4279">I knew a little English by then, I knew Polish, I knew German, so I was useful in an office. </sentence><sentence id="4280">And somebody approaches me saying, is there a Maria Neider here? </sentence><sentence id="4281">Maria Neider! </sentence><sentence id="4282">Menek    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4283"> phoned. </sentence><sentence id="4284">He literally walked through Poland and Germany from, so this was, how do you know? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4285">It's Menek and he brought news that Frania is alive and he mentioned that they all came to Germany and I got them a house near Heidleburg because I had the rations, food, I had all that stuff. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4286">I'm in the uniform, you saw my years of . </sentence><sentence id="4287">And they sent me to A-rose-en (ph), after I worked in Frankfort first. </sentence><sentence id="4288">Frankfort on Hurst, that was the only building that was the G.I. farm and factory. </sentence><sentence id="4289">The only buildings the Americans left intact in Frankfort because they thought they'Il need it for their military government later, so it was. </sentence><sentence id="4290">So I worked there, Menek found me there. </sentence><sentence id="4291">And then they transported all of unknown people to A-rose-en (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4292">They had the Germans leave the city, this was a suburb of the city of Castle (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4293">There was big castles there, big village. </sentence><sentence id="4294">And Own- Rae (ph) took over the town. </sentence><sentence id="4295">And they sent me there and I had an apartment with another woman from America, she was of Polish origin, Maria Leiberskint. </sentence><sentence id="4296">We lived there and life was pretty good. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4297">And my sister lived in Heidleburg, I would commute and bring food, I would always bring all these things. </sentence><sentence id="4298">I had a very interesting job, it was in the tracing, we were tracing children who were dispersed into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4299">No Jewish children were in question. </sentence><sentence id="4300">But representatives of different governments, Polish, Yugoslavian, Hungarian, Croatian, you just name it, they came to our zone to claim the children. </sentence><sentence id="4301">They wanted to find their children. </sentence><sentence id="4302">And the job of the Onrah (ph) personnel which I supervised for no good reason but that I knew the languages and I had an education, all of this worked in my favor. </sentence><sentence id="4303">They were field workers to find children. </sentence><sentence id="4304">Many of these children didn't speak any of their native languages, you had to identify them by some symbols or whatever. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4305">Sometimes they uttered a word, sometimes they wore a cross which looked like a Slavonic thing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4306">Some of these things, we found many of them. </sentence><sentence id="4307">And we would always bring them to the attention of these liaisons from their countries and they were shipped immediately to their countries. </sentence><sentence id="4308">Today I am not sure I would do that as easily because you wanted to put children and were already observed by German families, what that separation meant, but those days there was no question that these children have to be removed from Germany, the belong to their families. </sentence><sentence id="4309">Sometimes the families were not available, but they belonged to their nations, to their countries. </sentence><sentence id="4310">So these things, my staff went to schools to find them, to churches, to orphanages, certainly it was most difficult with    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4311"> families because families didn't want to tell us and it was detective work to find, because these kids were so assimilated into Germany that they spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="4312">Depending on the age too, all the children we could find easily. </sentence><sentence id="4313">This was my job for a very, this was 1945, 1946, and there was plenty of food. </sentence><sentence id="4314">I had a uniform of an American, Under Second Class because the First Class was those who came from the States or from the other countries. </sentence><sentence id="4315">These were Second Class, locally hired people, but we had all the privileges. </sentence><sentence id="4316">And one day, a man comes and sits with me in that restaurant there where we had very good conditions, we had a PX, privileges, cigarettes, coffee and so on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4317">And everybody was exchanging them for all kinds of goods. </sentence><sentence id="4318">I started smoking, I became addicted then. </sentence><sentence id="4319">And the coffee I use to bring to my sister so she had something, anyway, I fed a whole family on this. </sentence><sentence id="4320">But, one day, a man in another type of uniform sits next to me and to begin talking. </sentence><sentence id="4321">He said he's a president from the Joint Distribution Committee, and he says, as I talk to you, you belong to the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="4322">This was the end of wandering for me, I go to Stuttgart to work with the Joint.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4329">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4331">Q: Tell me something, was JDC one of the places that, or group that were going into Poland to try and find Jewish children who were or had been in hiding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4333">A: Not at that point at all. </sentence><sentence id="4334">That's modern history. </sentence><sentence id="4335">Joint Distribution Committee was established as part of Onrah (ph), they were administered and dependent on Onrah (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4336">Their job was to identify, rehabilitate and help with the settlement of all the Jewish victims of Nazism. </sentence><sentence id="4337">People were coming out of concentration camps so they established, and from Poland some came, from other countries. </sentence><sentence id="4338">The large concentration of Jews who survived was in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4339">The others we didn't touch, that was Russia by then. </sentence><sentence id="4340">From all the concentration camps, from all the death camps in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4341">In Germany there were no death camps, but concentration camps, they all came to the bigger cities of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4342">Particularly they gravitated towards the American occupied zone, which was Frankfort and Heidleburg and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4343">Some went to the British zone, those who were liberated from Bergen- Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4344">Very few wanted to be in the Russian zone and very few wanted to be in the French zone even, but some did. </sentence><sentence id="4345">There were concentration camps in the French zone too. </sentence><sentence id="4346">Anyway, it was a job of the Joint to find these people, start feeding them, locating their relatives perhaps in other countries, help them with immigration, so they took out the Jewish displaced persons from the other camps because there was quite a bit of anti-Semitism in these camps. </sentence><sentence id="4347">And they brought them into their own camps, they established Joint camps. </sentence><sentence id="4348">You know, the anti-Semitism in these camps was an interesting phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="4349">And they hired me as a second status employee of the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="4350">I also had to wear a uniform. </sentence><sentence id="4351">I was extremely absorbed in this work. </sentence><sentence id="4352">It was to me one of the great experiences of my life, to be able to serve people who survived. </sentence><sentence id="4353">I knew little about the concentration camp experience, they didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="4354">My job was mainly to help them with immigration. </sentence><sentence id="4355">I was stationed in Stuttgart, they brought me to Stuffgart. </sentence><sentence id="4356">The Director of that office was a Flora Levine, an American woman and I was her assistant. </sentence><sentence id="4357">And I recall hundreds of young people standing in line    trying to get to me to get a referral to the visa department because I had to process them, help them. </sentence><sentence id="4358">I also helped with some of the counseling problems if they needed it. </sentence><sentence id="4359">I spoke German, I spoke Yiddish, I spoke Polish, I was ideal for this job in this respect. </sentence><sentence id="4360">It was a job of great satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="4361">I couldn't stop working, I worked literally day and night and everyday I would take these documents to the American Consulate in Stuttgart and he would put a stamp and here was a visa. </sentence><sentence id="4362">One of the jobs was also to help them reunite with families in America so they would get affidavits. </sentence><sentence id="4363">This is another long story. </sentence><sentence id="4364">We worked very closely with what was Ny-anni-no (ph) and then was called United Service for New Americans, and Patrick was director of it, a matter later in another capacity. </sentence><sentence id="4365">It was extremely committed and devoted work, I've never worked for an agency in which were such commitment. </sentence><sentence id="4366">I found a boyfriend there, we were suppose to be married, I later decided I didn't want him. </sentence><sentence id="4367">He followed me, I mean, he was an American social worker from Brooklyn, and we met later in the United States but by then I withdrew from the relationship. </sentence><sentence id="4368">It was a period of extreme investment and work and helping and I've never been in this situation before. </sentence><sentence id="4369">My was suppose to lead to teaching in the gymnasium level. </sentence><sentence id="4370">Somehow or other, this was social work. </sentence><sentence id="4371">I didn't know it was social work. </sentence><sentence id="4372">So I represented the Joint in different places. </sentence><sentence id="4373">One of the places was to go to the deport camp, sometimes for whatever problems. </sentence><sentence id="4374">I traveled around the displaced persons camps in all of the American zone. </sentence><sentence id="4375">I had to go to births, I had to go to a wedding in the camps because there was tremendous activity in terms of marriage, in terms of having children. </sentence><sentence id="4376">Nobody understood at all and years later I understood, it was part of the need for replenishment, for not being alone, for not facing the new world all alone, so that everyday there was a wedding, everyday there was a birth and I was a representative of the Joint, I was invited. </sentence><sentence id="4377">Once I went to a very meaningful, extremely sad occasion. </sentence><sentence id="4378">In Bergen-Belsen, I think a few months after liberation, perhaps a year after liberation, the Palestine Agency send a monument to be put on the grounds of Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4379">There was a reunion of all the inmates of Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4380">I went as a representative of the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="4381">This moment I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="4382">When the Rabbi said Ka-dish (ph), there came a moan from the people, nobody cried. </sentence><sentence id="4383">There was a moan, you could hear it on the steps of Russia. </sentence><sentence id="4384">This stays with me, that moan of people. </sentence><sentence id="4385">Nobody could talk, nobody could cry. </sentence><sentence id="4386">There was, it was all in    that moan of people. </sentence><sentence id="4387">Another time I remember that moan was, I just heard two years earlier, when in Bremen-hoffin (ph), when I was taking the boat to America, we stayed in Bremen-hoffin (ph) a few weeks, waiting for the boat. </sentence><sentence id="4388">The boat in which I came was the Ernie-pile (ph), that was then name, these are military boats, broken military boats. </sentence><sentence id="4389">And again, I was a representative of this, this Ill come to later because it was later. </sentence><sentence id="4390">But anyway, so this was the work in the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="4391">Extremely gratifying. </sentence><sentence id="4392">They treated me beautifully, they send me once to Paris for a week of vacation. </sentence><sentence id="4393">In those days, people didn't travel to Paris on vacation, I did. </sentence><sentence id="4394">They send me to Switzerland once, anyway, it was all part of the job. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4855">Q: Where, near the Bronx Zoo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4857">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4858">Right across, off Southern Blvd. </sentence><sentence id="4859">between 183rd Street. </sentence><sentence id="4860">I had the bare feet, I walk up, a horrible place, but anyway, all I wanted was to run back, but where do you go back, ever? </sentence><sentence id="4861">Well, eventually it worked out. </sentence><sentence id="4862">We were struggling financially, very much. </sentence><sentence id="4863">Sending half of our earnings, went to Menek later because for weeks he was hungry there. </sentence><sentence id="4864">It is unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="4865">The Swiss Jewish Community, I cannot forgive for it. </sentence><sentence id="4866">But then I got a job, I immediately got a job. </sentence><sentence id="4867">I don't know how immediately I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="4868">The Joint send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal. </sentence><sentence id="4869">By the way, later on I suddenly get a check of a lot of money, $1300, in 1947, $1300 was a fantastic amount of money in my book! </sentence><sentence id="4870">They paid me for the time I worked in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4871">They never told me they would pay me. </sentence><sentence id="4872">This happens to be their good personnel policies, this I found out later. </sentence><sentence id="4873">Loy-ja (ph) worked for them for years. </sentence><sentence id="4874">She still feels it, she has been treated extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="4875">They send me no job, they send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal as a clerk. </sentence><sentence id="4876">Very dull work, terribly dull work. </sentence><sentence id="4877">But I remember the day when a telegram was sent to every employee, that they reached their quota of $250 million dollars, in 1947, signed by Morgan-tow (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4878">Henry Morgan-tow (ph) was the chief of the UJA then. </sentence><sentence id="4879">And here it said that the executive director was Henry Montor (ph), I don't know if you know the name, it was a big name in those days. </sentence><sentence id="4880">You deal with forty, sixty bro-ter (ph), Henry Montor(ph) was in charge of the UJA. </sentence><sentence id="4881">One day, he has a fall out with his, with Morgan-tow (ph) so they had to separate. </sentence><sentence id="4882">So Morgan-tow (ph) remains as the director of the UJA and Montor (ph) goes to another organization called the Palestine Economic Operation. </sentence><sentence id="4883">They have been in business for a long time, about the waterways in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="4884">The Director of Personnel at the UJA, Montor (ph) took her with him, to the other organization. </sentence><sentence id="4885">And she took me. </sentence><sentence id="4886">So I ended up there. </sentence><sentence id="4887">It was ina hotel which doesn't exist anymore across the Waldolf Astoria, it was a fine job, the rooms were air conditioned. </sentence><sentence id="4888">They made me the archivist there. </sentence><sentence id="4889">For some reason I like it because I was very quick in getting the files they needed. </sentence><sentence id="4890">It was a good time until one day I had, I lived already in the city by there, until one day I get this call from the United Service for New Americans, which is known NYANA, New York Association for New Americans. </sentence><sentence id="4891">They've always been in the business of helping refugees. </sentence><sentence id="4892">And they say, when I first came to America I had one visit with them, asking for work, and they said, what I want to do? </sentence><sentence id="4893">So I said, what I want to do was what I did for the Joint in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4894">They say, oh no, this is social work, for this you need a degree. </sentence><sentence id="4895">They were stupid because I had languages and all these displaced persons they were serving they needed a person like me that spoke these languages, they didn't even stop. </sentence><sentence id="4896">So they say, a new school of social work is opening up in Adell-fy (ph) and the Dean was with honor in Austria and he wants to give a Jewish scholarship to a displaced person. </sentence><sentence id="4897">And we have many, many candidates who are more qualified than you are, but we will include you if you want to. </sentence><sentence id="4898">I thought about it, I didn't want to give up the job, I had a good paying job. </sentence><sentence id="4899">This was another experience, which doesn't exist anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4900">Since it was a new school, they had to be more pious than the Pope. </sentence><sentence id="4901">So they interviewed each candidate for    six days, for five days. </sentence><sentence id="4902">Every day another interview. </sentence><sentence id="4903">Until it came to Dr. Serrett (ph), who was a very famous psychiatrist for the National Schools of Social Work. </sentence><sentence id="4904">I didn't know a thing about social work. </sentence><sentence id="4905">And he interviewed me, he wanted to know my childhood and everything. </sentence><sentence id="4906">Just to put it on record. </sentence><sentence id="4907">They were so limited, they never asked me about my Holocaust experience. </sentence><sentence id="4908">My childhood, my relation with my mother, my relation with my father, my relation with my siblings. </sentence><sentence id="4909">This took hours and hours, everyday an interview. </sentence><sentence id="4910">The final one with Dr. Serrett (ph) and he apparently approved so I got in. </sentence><sentence id="4911">But to the sukkotme of the psychiatry profession, that nobody asked about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="4912">It was a non-subject in those days. </sentence><sentence id="4913">This was 1949, 1950. </sentence><sentence id="4914">Well, for some reason he chose me and I got in and I was very unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="4915">I didn't understand what this study was all about. </sentence><sentence id="4916">He usually came from the study of sociology, psychology, I was student of Polish literature. </sentence><sentence id="4917">They talked language which I didn't understand and I figured, how can I withdraw, how will I get my old job back? </sentence><sentence id="4918">It was very painful to me until the second semester, things began to go extremely well, let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="4919">Nothing helps like a little success and a teacher just read my paper, which I thought was nothing, they all thought was excellent. </sentence><sentence id="4920">Anyway, it was great and I was graded very well. </sentence><sentence id="4921">So this is how I got into the profession. </sentence><sentence id="4922">I had no money. </sentence><sentence id="4923">I lived in a, it was amazing, with a Jewish family in, near Columbia University. </sentence><sentence id="4924">Six dollars a week, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="4925">I didn't have enough money to live. </sentence><sentence id="4926">My scholarship was paid by the University but there was a foundation for Jewish girls and they were giving me $25 a week, which would have lasted except that my field work in social work, three days a week you have to be in the field. </sentence><sentence id="4927">And this idiot arranged my field work to be New Jersey. </sentence><sentence id="4928">So I had a lot of expenses and the school was in Adel-fy (ph) so $20 or whatever, $18 of that money went for travel. </sentence><sentence id="4929">When I was finally selected by the committee to enter the school, the dean congratulated me and he asked me whether I want to study case work, and I didn't know what case work was, so I say, what does social work have to do with cheese? </sentence><sentence id="4930">Because case in German means cheese! </sentence><sentence id="4931">He started laughing and was still laughing when I left, this was my preparation for social work, but I made it. </sentence><sentence id="4932">And I did well. </sentence><sentence id="4933">My second placement, they helped me, also in New Jersey. </sentence><sentence id="4934">They couldn't find a place for me in New York, they were very stupid about it. </sentence><sentence id="4935">It was in a State Psychiatric Hospital. </sentence><sentence id="4936">Which means that I had room and board    there. </sentence><sentence id="4937">I lived there, and every psychiatric condition I immediately absorbed as my own. </sentence><sentence id="4938">So one week I was schizophrenic, the next week I was manic depressive. </sentence><sentence id="4939">It was very hard on me but it was the second year and I hadn't done very well, so I graduated anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4940">Since then I've had good jobs and been a social worker since then. </sentence><sentence id="4941">I retired. </sentence><sentence id="4942">I actually worked for Washington, for the Federal Government, I worked for nine years for the National Institute of Mental Health. </sentence><sentence id="4943">These were special projects and drug addition. </sentence><sentence id="4944">And I was a supervisor in a big agency then and I use to commute and come to Washington and they were very large with money. </sentence><sentence id="4945">This was the end of 1950's, early 1960's. </sentence><sentence id="4946">Johnson's programs spent a lot of money for rehabilitation, for human services. </sentence><sentence id="4947">They insisted I should travel first class because I had a high rank, GS-12 in those days were the high rank. </sentence><sentence id="4948">It was not becoming for a person with this GS grade to, not to go in important ways. </sentence><sentence id="4949">Anyway, there was a lot of stupid money spending. </sentence><sentence id="4950">We didn't rehabilitate too many people I can tell you, but it was an easy job and prestigious job. </sentence><sentence id="4951">They sent me to be trained at Lexington, Kentucky where they had the United States Public Health Hospital for tubercular diseases later on. </sentence><sentence id="4952">Our job was to visit every agency and hospital in New York City, open up the doors for drug addicts. </sentence><sentence id="4953">We did it, it was a whole new thing. </sentence><sentence id="4954">A new ball game for me totally, but we accomplished a lot in this respect, not that drug addicts were not rehabilitated easily but I have been involved in it for many years. </sentence><sentence id="4955">And then one day, again, I was re-married in 1962 and my husband was a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="4956">He had long vacations, he wanted his wife to go on vacations but I only had four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4957">One day we came back from a summer vacation, there's a letter from the then Dean of the School of Social Work at Tall-a-dot (ph) who remembered me because he was my research professor at Adel-fy (ph).It was a new school then, he asked that I join the faculty it was that easy. </sentence><sentence id="4958">In these days, you would have to have all kinds of qualifications. </sentence><sentence id="4959">What happened, somewhere or other, for many years after I graduated, they used that paper for a record to teach from so they remembered me this way. </sentence><sentence id="4960">It was very hard at Hunter from the first. </sentence><sentence id="4961">I didn't want to give up my job as an AMH but they were very generous with me so they permitted me to work half time only for five years. </sentence><sentence id="4962">The first five years were full time, and then four years later, half time for Washington and half time for Hunter and then the Washim Project came to an end and they paid me, I still get a little pension from them, which is    nice. </sentence><sentence id="4963">I belong to the Federal Employees Retirement Section, or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="4964">So, I've connections to Washington no doubt! </sentence><sentence id="4965">I've been at Hunter from 1962, first five years were half time. </sentence><sentence id="4966">And I went there, I retired in 1970, my marriage dissolved in 1970, we separated for the new divorce and in 1974 he died. </sentence><sentence id="4967">He was younger than I, he got leukemia and he died. </sentence><sentence id="4968">And I retired from Hunter in 1989, but I still teach the Holocaust course so I remain very much in, connected to the Holocaust course. </sentence><sentence id="4969">I started it on my sabbatical year because I was emotionally more ready to confront that material. </sentence><sentence id="4970">Until then, it was always with me, but I couldn't quite read. </sentence><sentence id="4971">I started digging into it and since then I cannot leave it, now and forever involved in it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5092">Q: What year was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5094">A: This was, my sabbatical was 1978 and I started teaching in 1979 and I have been teaching it still since. </sentence><sentence id="5095">It's always been an important part of my life and since then I have been lecturing all over because it's the only school of social in the country which offers it, which is unusual. </sentence><sentence id="5096">Yes, which is very unique, so I'm still with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5100">Q: Were you unhappy to leave the case work that you were doing and go into teaching? </sentence><sentence id="5101">Did you do it because your husband wanted you to do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5104">A: By then I was not doing any, I didn't care, I was a supervisor. </sentence><sentence id="5105">I had a big job, I published, I wrote something on drug addition and I didn't want to leave because it was a very well paying job at that point and it was a prestigious job. </sentence><sentence id="5106">My husband wanted me to but this was not the major thing. </sentence><sentence id="5107">I was not a little woman ever in my life. </sentence><sentence id="5108">I think my parents sort of made me feel I'm okay and this really helped I think. </sentence><sentence id="5109">I've never succumbed this way, but my husband wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="5110">What was very nice was the prospect of long vacations. </sentence><sentence id="5111">We always traveled for ten years which was great. </sentence><sentence id="5112">But, no, there was always something in teaching that was prestigious. </sentence><sentence id="5113">I didn't think they would take me but they did and there were lots of times there too, all kinds of politics in the University so I don't need to tell you about it, very often they want me out. </sentence><sentence id="5114">Eventually I made my way in and eventually I did well, but I had rough years there too. </sentence><sentence id="5115">The work was overwhelmingly big, a lot of work. </sentence><sentence id="5116">And there's so much competition there. </sentence><sentence id="5117">If you were on good terms with one, the other one was angry to you. </sentence><sentence id="5118">Not because of me but because of perhaps they didn't like the other person because politics of    the University are something to write books about. </sentence><sentence id="5119">But basically, it's a decent school, it was a decent school and of all the jobs I had there admissions work, you know, you do everything. </sentence><sentence id="5120">I had faculty advisement. </sentence><sentence id="5121">The favorite thing for me was always teaching. </sentence><sentence id="5122">I liked accompanying the students and this saved me always, always. </sentence><sentence id="5123">There were rough years too. </sentence><sentence id="5124">When I retired they did something awfully nice for me. </sentence><sentence id="5125">They established a collection of Holocaust literature in my name. </sentence><sentence id="5126">And it's there which is, and I wanted it in the name, I had a conflict of which name it should go, I wanted my parents too and I wanted my husband too. </sentence><sentence id="5127">So first we had it Maria Herr Schneider Rosenbloom, they said, but what became Maria Herr Rosenbloom. </sentence><sentence id="5128">And occasionally I lectured from it, books I bought, that is continuous sort of input which is great, couldn't be better. </sentence><sentence id="5129">My parents will be remembered this way, my family will be remembered this way, it's marvelous I think. </sentence><sentence id="5130">But since then I've always been in private practice a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="5131">But always Holocaust related. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5161">Q: Private practice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5163">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="5164">Always Holocaust related, always. </sentence><sentence id="5165">The first time I work with Holocaust survivors was in a psychiatric, I was working in psychiatry because it was a natural thing for me. </sentence><sentence id="5166">I was trained in a way, so my first job was the psychiatric clinic of the Bathesda Hospital. </sentence><sentence id="5167">And there I was the only Yiddish speaking person, none of the psychiatrists spoke Yiddish, or wanted to speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="5168">So I was very much involved with every patient, nearly every patient. </sentence><sentence id="5169">Many of these people were considered refugees from Europe. </sentence><sentence id="5170">These were all concentration camp survivors. </sentence><sentence id="5171">Nobody knew the term. </sentence><sentence id="5172">I remember many, many fantastic situations from there. </sentence><sentence id="5173">One man refused shock treatment so they sent him to see me, see Miss Schneider. </sentence><sentence id="5174">Because I speak the same. </sentence><sentence id="5175">And in my stupidity I thought, why not?
