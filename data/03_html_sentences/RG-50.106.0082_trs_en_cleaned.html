<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2565">A: Well, we spend all the time going through documents, every now and then finding something of interest, identifying, writing abstracts, and sending them on to -- to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2566">The -- some of them were -- at that point in Nuremberg, the medical trial was going on, but subsequ -- they were looking for materials for subsequent trials, the Ministry of Justice, and various other ministries. </sentence><sentence id="2567">And you just sort of -- either you were told, or you were given advice where to look, or you sort of followed a hunch, or you followed something, so -- something followed a trail which suddenly This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2568">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2569"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerald Schwab a November 18, 1997 opened up. </sentence><sentence id="2570">By far and away the mo -- well, almost the most interesting or comprehensive trail led to the Reich's Chancellery, Hitler's office. </sentence><sentence id="2571">Because every time one minister wrote something to another minister, especially if they had a fight, they would send an -- a copy to Hitler's Secretary of the Chancellery. </sentence><sentence id="2572">So there you would have both the letter being sent, and the letter being coming back. </sentence><sentence id="2573">I mean, when a peop -- person like the Minister of Post got mad -- or the Minister of Agriculture got mad at the Minister of Post, and accused him -- accused him of having an illegitimate child, he would send a copy to the chancellery and then the Ministry of Posts would then re-reply to the Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty letter, and also send a copy to the chancellery. </sentence><sentence id="2574">So that -- there was a lot of information obtainable there. </sentence><sentence id="2575">But mainly, you would stumble across something. </sentence><sentence id="2576">Or, they would -- somebody would identify a certain event, and he -- you would dig into it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
