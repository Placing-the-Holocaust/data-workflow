<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Did you hear of Hitler pretty early on, any time 1933 or after? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: No, we did not hear. </sentence><sentence id="125">We were pretty ignorant. </sentence><sentence id="126">We never felt anything. </sentence><sentence id="127">When the Italians came, they sent two groups of officers -- Italian military -- at some point in time. </sentence><sentence id="128">But we never felt anything because the Italians always behaved very well toward us. </sentence><sentence id="129">I said before that we were not supposed to go to school when the racial laws started, but the Italians were very apologetic to us. </sentence><sentence id="130">They told us that those were the rules that they had received and unfortunately they had to apply them at some point in time. </sentence><sentence id="131">Not at the beginning, but at some point they were obliged to. </sentence><sentence id="132">And also some of the Jews belonged to clubs -- you know, an Italian circle of clubs, and we were excluded from them at that time also. </sentence><sentence id="133">But the Italians were again apologetic about that. </sentence><sentence id="134">They said they were obliged to do it because of some rules they had received from the mainland. </sentence><sentence id="135">Generally, we had normal life even after racial laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: What year did the racial laws go into effect in your area? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: At the beginning the racial laws were-- besides not going to school and the club -- being excluded from the club--- the attitude between the Italian officers and the Jewish population was the same, because the islands and the group was very small, so everybody knew everybody. </sentence><sentence id="151">And the Italian behavior stayed the same. </sentence><sentence id="152">It's only after the attempt on Hitler's life, that things got tougher because of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="153">That was on July 20, 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: I think I forgot my question. </sentence><sentence id="159">I think I understand that it wasn't a drastic change of lifestyle when the racial laws were implemented. </sentence><sentence id="160">However, I'm wondering if you and your family, or others in the Jewish community were talking about this and very concerned about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: We had news, in some of the Italian newspapers, but since it was so far away, we thought, you know, we were not concerned. </sentence><sentence id="165">We were very isolated in the islands and even the attitude of the Italian officers was very relaxed, so we wouldn't think that something was really happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="166">That's why we were not as concerned. </sentence><sentence id="167">The situation worsened when Badoglio, who was marshal in the Italian army, and the king, Vittorio Emmanuel the Third, when they asked for the armistice with the Allies. </sentence><sentence id="168">And at that time, things got a little tougher. </sentence><sentence id="169">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="171"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italians were asking for the armistice and they got it, they felt they were betrayed by the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="172">At that point in time, they sent some troops to the islands. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was only nine months before our eventual deportation that at some point in time the Germans, after seeing what the Italians did, sent more troops to the islands. </sentence><sentence id="174">But the local population was not aware of anything, and even the Germans that were on the island were acting very normal and polite with all the population. </sentence><sentence id="175">We did not know, but in the meantime, they had taken all the information on Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="176">They took all the addresses and knew who was living where and they already had all the information on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="177">They were not showing anything, but they had already started. </sentence><sentence id="178">German troops came to Rhodes on September 8, 1943.At some point, after the armistice, the Germans had their headquarters in Rhodes. </sentence><sentence id="179">And at that point, they called all the Italian officers and told them, "Your king and the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice, so what are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="180">And at that point, the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="181">But the officers stayed on the island. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were not supposed to leave the island, but they were not put as a military officer in prison, they were just free to stay on the island at that time. </sentence><sentence id="183">Therefore, the Jews were registered, but we knew nothing about what was going on in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="184">At the moment of the armistice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, they tried to land in Kos. </sentence><sentence id="185">But the Germans had sent some boats from Rhodes to bomb them. </sentence><sentence id="186">And then the British tried to land in Rhodes, but they couldn't succeed, so they had to retreat. </sentence><sentence id="187">And so we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="188">And the Jewish population and the rest of the population stayed in Kos. </sentence><sentence id="189">The Italians didn't say anything and maybe didn't know anything about the plans of the Germans, but at some point, the Germans that were on the islands of course, told the population of Kos that if they wanted to leave, they could leave. </sentence><sentence id="190">This was because we were going to run out of food because the island was kind of isolated. </sentence><sentence id="191">It was surrounded by the British submarines, and we had difficulty finding food. </sentence><sentence id="192">So they had asked the population of Kos if any of us wanted to leave the island and go to Turkey. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Did you or your family express interest in leaving? </sentence><sentence id="225">Did you know people personally -- people in the Jewish community -- who were leaving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: My father said leaving was not necessary. </sentence><sentence id="229">He thought the war would end soon. </sentence><sentence id="230">Maybe a couple of people left the island. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="231"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="232">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="233"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: At this point, before you were deported of course, is there any stage where you were really starting to feel fear? </sentence><sentence id="235">You or your family? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: We had no fear because we had, at some point... The British had bombed a few times, but we were not afraid because we were thinking that the war was about to end. </sentence><sentence id="237">So we said it's not the time to be afraid, and we are far away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Did you hear about the war in other places -- in Europe for instance? </sentence><sentence id="241">Did you even... When did you know that the war had started -- in September of 1939? </sentence><sentence id="242">When did you learn about those events? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: We were not aware, because in a certain way, we knew about the war, but we were not very concerned. </sentence><sentence id="247">And then, unfortunately, I feel bad about the ignorance, but we had no more radios, but more than that-- that was not an excuse, but more than that it's because we saw the Italians around us who were not concerned, so we didn't know why we would be concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: I wanted to ask a little bit more about the racial laws and to get a little more detail on what you recall you had to do differently because of the laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: The Italians never made us feel that there was a difference. </sentence><sentence id="253">We thought that we had to stop going to school because of the war and that's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="254">We thought we'd be able to go back after the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="255">Tape 1, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: We were last talking about the racial laws and I want to make sure we have the chronology of events correct. </sentence><sentence id="261">So I want to establish exactly when it was when you no longer could go to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: We could no longer go to school after 1938. </sentence><sentence id="265">I had done quite a bit of secondary school, so it was not hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="266">But small children had to go home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: What exactly did you do every day after you no longer were in school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: I was home with the family. </sentence><sentence id="273">I was still going to take piano lessons because I had started at the nun's school. </sentence><sentence id="274">I started when I was three years old and kept on taking piano lessons with the sister who was giving piano lessons. </sentence><sentence id="275">The sister wanted me also to help out with other small children and give them some lessons in piano. </sentence><sentence id="276">These were not Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="277">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="278">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="279"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: And then we were also talking about the possibility for people to leave the island of Kos and go to Turkey. </sentence><sentence id="289">Could we establish exactly when you learned about this in relationship to the racial laws and other events? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: We were not-- The Germans were not treating us the way they treated Jews in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="293">We didn't have to wear the star; we didn't have ghettos. </sentence><sentence id="294">And the Germans would come to my father's store, buy merchandise, pay and be well-behaved. </sentence><sentence id="295">They were not aggressive to us. </sentence><sentence id="296">At one point, one of my father's employees said, "Since we have this boat that we use to do commerce in the islands, why don't we put all our merchandise and things out of your house onto the boat and bring them to Turkey?" </sentence><sentence id="297">The employee had asked also that my only brother that remained in Rhodes -- not the ones who had left, but the only remaining brother, the youngest one -- he would go with this boat captain to Turkey and establish maybe a business on the other side, or start a life on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="298">This was winter 1943-44. </sentence><sentence id="299">Kos to Turkey was only 4 km. </sentence><sentence id="300">But my father said, "No, the war will end soon." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: At the time of this event of mentioning your brother and this German, was he actually a soldier? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="303">He was not a German; he was a Greek captain who was working for my father in February or March of 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: And how old were you about this time and how active are you in any of the decision making in your household? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: I was 22-23 years old. </sentence><sentence id="309">I had no special role in the family's decisions. </sentence><sentence id="310">My father decided. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Did the sisters talk to you about the problems? </sentence><sentence id="315">Did they give you advice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: The nuns did not know. </sentence><sentence id="319">The sisters of the school had no idea about what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="320">It was only at the moment of the deportation when the Germans arrested us, that one of the sisters in charge of the school, the Mother Superior, came and said to the Germans that my mother was sick and was not very well and if she could stay because she had to get treatment and then they would send her afterward. </sentence><sentence id="321">But she was thinking of sending my mother to Turkey instead. </sentence><sentence id="322">But my mother did not agree to stay behind...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Did they tell your father what to do? </sentence><sentence id="329">What role did your mother have in the school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Although she was Jewish, my mother worked with the Mother Superior sometimes, collecting money and doing charity work. </sentence><sentence id="333">And she went around with the Mother Superior since my mother spoke Greek and also spoke Italian, Spanish and Turkish. </sentence><sentence id="334">She was going around to collect funds for the children attending school -- they were basically Turkish and Greek poor children who This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="335">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="336"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection didn't have much and didn't have shoes sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="337">And so my mother was doing charity work for the school to that effect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: It sounded like there was a food shortage at some time. </sentence><sentence id="347">Can you explain more about that and when that took place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: The food shortage was worse at Rhodes, and moreso in Jewish neighborhoods. </sentence><sentence id="351">It was not so bad in Kos (1942-43), since it was a small community and we knew (and were friends with) farmers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Did you hear much about what was happening on the mainland of Greece? </sentence><sentence id="355">Specifically, I believe there were other deportations of Jews in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="356">Did you hear anything about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: No, I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="361">I only found out when I was in Auschwitz, where I met women from Salonika (Thessaloniki) -- where 50,000 Jews were exterminated in 1943 -- who told me what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: I want to go back just for a moment, because some of the reading I had done, I had seen something about actually this is not during the war but back to 1933, something about there being an earthquake on the island of Kos and actually the synagogue being destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="365">I was wondering if that affected you or your family of if you remember if this is right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: It was 1933 when the synagogue was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="369">The books and the Sefer Torah were transported to my house and that's because my house was still standing. </sentence><sentence id="370">That's where we usually had our prayers for Shabbat and all the other events were taking place. </sentence><sentence id="371">Many died in the earthquake. </sentence><sentence id="372">Other people stayed in the stadium. </sentence><sentence id="373">After this is when I went to Rhodes to continue my studies with the nuns. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: There had actually been a school at the synagogue -- at the Temple -- and that's why you left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: No Jewish school existed. </sentence><sentence id="383">The Jewish community was small and the existing schools were Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="384">I stayed five years in Rhodes; I lived at an aunt's home. </sentence><sentence id="385">There were many girls living there too -- cousins who emigrated to Rhodesia in 1938, which was when I returned to Kos. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How long was the trip from Kos to Rhodes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: In those years, there were small boats and it took five-six hours. </sentence><sentence id="393">Today, with modern boats, it is much faster. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="394"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="395">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="396"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="397"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: Before you were deported, the Germans, as I understand it, were in Kos from September of 1943 until you were deported. </sentence><sentence id="399">What kind of encounters did you have with the Germans in Kos? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: The relation with the Germans was very good, because, I mean-- normal. </sentence><sentence id="401">And there was nothing against us on behalf of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="402">And it was only after the Hitler coup (assassination attempt) that the Germans had to carry out some of the orders they received and round up the people. </sentence><sentence id="403">But until then, the relations were good, and I think that maybe we were among the last Jewish people that were free in the world at that point in time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: And so it sounds like you did not experience anti-Semitism from Germans who were in Kos at that time? </sentence><sentence id="409">Is that -- am I understanding correctly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: There was no contact with the Germans because the lifestyle of the people on the island was very different from on the mainland. </sentence><sentence id="413">So we had our way of doing things, and we were not having any life together with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="414">Plus, the Italians were still there. </sentence><sentence id="415">In Europe, it was different. </sentence><sentence id="416">The deportation for us was very hard because we had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="417">We had never felt anything before that day. </sentence><sentence id="418">And the difference in Europe, where they had to hide, where they were feeling things growing bit by bit... we had no feeling of that kind on the island, so it was even stronger for us -- the shock -- because suddenly everybody was rounded up and we had to be deported and we were wondering why and where-- where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="419">Because we had never felt anything of the war until then, except for the racial laws, but we had attributed that to the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="428">Q: Do you remember exactly when the Germans came in, in September? </sentence><sentence id="429">Do you actually remember any particular day or was it not very monumental? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: At some point in time the Germans arrived, but they were not in the city, so they were mainly staying in their headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="433">So we didn't really feel it. </sentence><sentence id="434">When the British left the area, then the Germans arrived mid-September. </sentence><sentence id="435">We didn't feel it much, but after the deportation, my mother found out from the Mother Superior knew that the Italians had been trying to defend the king's idea and kind of do a resistance against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="436">And at that point in time, the Germans took some of the Italians prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="437">But I only found out after the deportation (?), </sentence><sentence id="438">the Mother  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: All this time before being deported, and especially after the Germans arrived, was your father still able to do his work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: Yes, but less than before. </sentence><sentence id="449">In early afternoon he'd come back to the village where we were staying. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="452">Q: I think we've covered most of the time period up until September 1943, when the armistice was made official. </sentence><sentence id="453">So I'm curious to know what you noticed right away when the Germans were coming into your region? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1424">A: [had started the book when I went to Brazzaville at the beginning and then I continued it in Leopoldville and when I saw that I was telling some of the story and some people were hardly even listening, or believing in it, I decided I would continue writing because I would at least have it in written format. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And also when I had a daughter, I decided I would continue and write a bit for her, so it would remain for the next generation. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Then, I left the book there, half-finished. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And a year later, when I went to Brussels, I realized that some of the people in Europe were kind of talking about the concentration camps and the gas chambers...
