<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: Did you hear of Hitler pretty early on, any time 1933 or after? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: No, we did not hear. </sentence><sentence id="118">We were pretty ignorant. </sentence><sentence id="119">We never felt anything. </sentence><sentence id="120">When the Italians came, they sent two groups of officers -- Italian military -- at some point in time. </sentence><sentence id="121">But we never felt anything because the Italians always behaved very well toward us. </sentence><sentence id="122">I said before that we were not supposed to go to school when the racial laws started, but the Italians were very apologetic to us. </sentence><sentence id="123">They told us that those were the rules that they had received and unfortunately they had to apply them at some point in time. </sentence><sentence id="124">Not at the beginning, but at some point they were obliged to. </sentence><sentence id="125">And also some of the Jews belonged to clubs -- you know, an Italian circle of clubs, and we were excluded from them at that time also. </sentence><sentence id="126">But the Italians were again apologetic about that. </sentence><sentence id="127">They said they were obliged to do it because of some rules they had received from the mainland. </sentence><sentence id="128">Generally, we had normal life even after racial laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: What year did the racial laws go into effect in your area? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: At the beginning the racial laws were-- besides not going to school and the club -- being excluded from the club--- the attitude between the Italian officers and the Jewish population was the same, because the islands and the group was very small, so everybody knew everybody. </sentence><sentence id="144">And the Italian behavior stayed the same. </sentence><sentence id="145">It's only after the attempt on Hitler's life, that things got tougher because of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="146">That was on July 20, 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: I think I forgot my question. </sentence><sentence id="152">I think I understand that it wasn't a drastic change of lifestyle when the racial laws were implemented. </sentence><sentence id="153">However, I'm wondering if you and your family, or others in the Jewish community were talking about this and very concerned about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: We had news, in some of the Italian newspapers, but since it was so far away, we thought, you know, we were not concerned. </sentence><sentence id="158">We were very isolated in the islands and even the attitude of the Italian officers was very relaxed, so we wouldn't think that something was really happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="159">That's why we were not as concerned. </sentence><sentence id="160">The situation worsened when Badoglio, who was marshal in the Italian army, and the king, Vittorio Emmanuel the Third, when they asked for the armistice with the Allies. </sentence><sentence id="161">And at that time, things got a little tougher. </sentence><sentence id="162">At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italians were asking for the armistice and they got it, they felt they were betrayed by the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="163">At that point in time, they sent some troops to the islands. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was only nine months before our eventual deportation that at some point in time the Germans, after seeing what the Italians did, sent more troops to the islands. </sentence><sentence id="165">But the local population was not aware of anything, and even the Germans that were on the island were acting very normal and polite with all the population. </sentence><sentence id="166">We did not know, but in the meantime, they had taken all the information on Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="167">They took all the addresses and knew who was living where and they already had all the information on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="168">They were not showing anything, but they had already started. </sentence><sentence id="169">German troops came to Rhodes on September 8, 1943.At some point, after the armistice, the Germans had their headquarters in Rhodes. </sentence><sentence id="170">And at that point, they called all the Italian officers and told them, "Your king and the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice, so what are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="171">And at that point, the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="172">But the officers stayed on the island. </sentence><sentence id="173">They were not supposed to leave the island, but they were not put as a military officer in prison, they were just free to stay on the island at that time. </sentence><sentence id="174">Therefore, the Jews were registered, but we knew nothing about what was going on in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="175">At the moment of the armistice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, they tried to land in Kos. </sentence><sentence id="176">But the Germans had sent some boats from Rhodes to bomb them. </sentence><sentence id="177">And then the British tried to land in Rhodes, but they couldn't succeed, so they had to retreat. </sentence><sentence id="178">And so we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="179">And the Jewish population and the rest of the population stayed in Kos. </sentence><sentence id="180">The Italians didn't say anything and maybe didn't know anything about the plans of the Germans, but at some point, the Germans that were on the islands of course, told the population of Kos that if they wanted to leave, they could leave. </sentence><sentence id="181">This was because we were going to run out of food because the island was kind of isolated. </sentence><sentence id="182">It was surrounded by the British submarines, and we had difficulty finding food. </sentence><sentence id="183">So they had asked the population of Kos if any of us wanted to leave the island and go to Turkey. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Did you or your family express interest in leaving? </sentence><sentence id="213">Did you know people personally -- people in the Jewish community -- who were leaving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: My father said leaving was not necessary. </sentence><sentence id="217">He thought the war would end soon. </sentence><sentence id="218">Maybe a couple of people left the island. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: At this point, before you were deported of course, is there any stage where you were really starting to feel fear? </sentence><sentence id="220">You or your family? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: We had no fear because we had, at some point... The British had bombed a few times, but we were not afraid because we were thinking that the war was about to end. </sentence><sentence id="222">So we said it's not the time to be afraid, and we are far away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Did you hear about the war in other places -- in Europe for instance? </sentence><sentence id="226">Did you even... When did you know that the war had started -- in September of 1939? </sentence><sentence id="227">When did you learn about those events? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: We were not aware, because in a certain way, we knew about the war, but we were not very concerned. </sentence><sentence id="232">And then, unfortunately, I feel bad about the ignorance, but we had no more radios, but more than that-- that was not an excuse, but more than that it's because we saw the Italians around us who were not concerned, so we didn't know why we would be concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: I wanted to ask a little bit more about the racial laws and to get a little more detail on what you recall you had to do differently because of the laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: The Italians never made us feel that there was a difference. </sentence><sentence id="238">We thought that we had to stop going to school because of the war and that's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="239">We thought we'd be able to go back after the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="240">Tape 1, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: We were last talking about the racial laws and I want to make sure we have the chronology of events correct. </sentence><sentence id="246">So I want to establish exactly when it was when you no longer could go to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: We could no longer go to school after 1938. </sentence><sentence id="250">I had done quite a bit of secondary school, so it was not hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="251">But small children had to go home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: What exactly did you do every day after you no longer were in school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: I was home with the family. </sentence><sentence id="258">I was still going to take piano lessons because I had started at the nun's school. </sentence><sentence id="259">I started when I was three years old and kept on taking piano lessons with the sister who was giving piano lessons. </sentence><sentence id="260">The sister wanted me also to help out with other small children and give them some lessons in piano. </sentence><sentence id="261">These were not Jewish children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: And then we were also talking about the possibility for people to leave the island of Kos and go to Turkey. </sentence><sentence id="268">Could we establish exactly when you learned about this in relationship to the racial laws and other events? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: We were not-- The Germans were not treating us the way they treated Jews in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="272">We didn't have to wear the star; we didn't have ghettos. </sentence><sentence id="273">And the Germans would come to my father's store, buy merchandise, pay and be well-behaved. </sentence><sentence id="274">They were not aggressive to us. </sentence><sentence id="275">At one point, one of my father's employees said, "Since we have this boat that we use to do commerce in the islands, why don't we put all our merchandise and things out of your house onto the boat and bring them to Turkey?" </sentence><sentence id="276">The employee had asked also that my only brother that remained in Rhodes -- not the ones who had left, but the only remaining brother, the youngest one -- he would go with this boat captain to Turkey and establish maybe a business on the other side, or start a life on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="277">This was winter 1943-44. </sentence><sentence id="278">Kos to Turkey was only 4 km. </sentence><sentence id="279">But my father said, "No, the war will end soon." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: At the time of this event of mentioning your brother and this German, was he actually a soldier? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="282">He was not a German; he was a Greek captain who was working for my father in February or March of 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: And how old were you about this time and how active are you in any of the decision making in your household? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: I was 22-23 years old. </sentence><sentence id="288">I had no special role in the family's decisions. </sentence><sentence id="289">My father decided. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Did the sisters talk to you about the problems? </sentence><sentence id="294">Did they give you advice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: The nuns did not know. </sentence><sentence id="298">The sisters of the school had no idea about what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="299">It was only at the moment of the deportation when the Germans arrested us, that one of the sisters in charge of the school, the Mother Superior, came and said to the Germans that my mother was sick and was not very well and if she could stay because she had to get treatment and then they would send her afterward. </sentence><sentence id="300">But she was thinking of sending my mother to Turkey instead. </sentence><sentence id="301">But my mother did not agree to stay behind... The sisters did not know what was going on in Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Did they tell your father what to do? </sentence><sentence id="308">What role did your mother have in the school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: Although she was Jewish, my mother worked with the Mother Superior sometimes, collecting money and doing charity work. </sentence><sentence id="312">And she went around with the Mother Superior since my mother spoke Greek and also spoke Italian, Spanish and Turkish. </sentence><sentence id="313">She was going around to collect funds for the children attending school -- they were basically Turkish and Greek poor children who didn't have much and didn't have shoes sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="314">And so my mother was doing charity work for the school to that effect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: It sounded like there was a food shortage at some time. </sentence><sentence id="321">Can you explain more about that and when that took place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: The food shortage was worse at Rhodes, and moreso in Jewish neighborhoods. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was not so bad in Kos (1942-43), since it was a small community and we knew (and were friends with) farmers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Did you hear much about what was happening on the mainland of Greece? </sentence><sentence id="329">Specifically, I believe there were other deportations of Jews in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="330">Did you hear anything about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: No, I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="335">I only found out when I was in Auschwitz, where I met women from Salonika (Thessaloniki) -- where 50,000 Jews were exterminated in 1943 -- who told me what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: I want to go back just for a moment, because some of the reading I had done, I had seen something about actually this is not during the war but back to 1933, something about there being an earthquake on the island of Kos and actually the synagogue being destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="339">I was wondering if that affected you or your family of if you remember if this is right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: It was 1933 when the synagogue was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="343">The books and the Sefer Torah were transported to my house and that's because my house was still standing. </sentence><sentence id="344">That's where we usually had our prayers for Shabbat and all the other events were taking place. </sentence><sentence id="345">Many died in the earthquake. </sentence><sentence id="346">Other people stayed in the stadium. </sentence><sentence id="347">After this is when I went to Rhodes to continue my studies with the nuns. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: There had actually been a school at the synagogue -- at the Temple -- and that's why you left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: No Jewish school existed. </sentence><sentence id="357">The Jewish community was small and the existing schools were Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="358">I stayed five years in Rhodes; I lived at an aunt's home. </sentence><sentence id="359">There were many girls living there too -- cousins who emigrated to Rhodesia in 1938, which was when I returned to Kos. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: How long was the trip from Kos to Rhodes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: In those years, there were small boats and it took five-six hours. </sentence><sentence id="367">Today, with modern boats, it is much faster. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Before you were deported, the Germans, as I understand it, were in Kos from September of 1943 until you were deported. </sentence><sentence id="371">What kind of encounters did you have with the Germans in Kos? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: The relation with the Germans was very good, because, I mean-- normal. </sentence><sentence id="375">And there was nothing against us on behalf of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="376">And it was only after the Hitler coup (assassination attempt) that the Germans had to carry out some of the orders they received and round up the people. </sentence><sentence id="377">But until then, the relations were good, and I think that maybe we were among the last Jewish people that were free in the world at that point in time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: And so it sounds like you did not experience anti-Semitism from Germans who were in Kos at that time? </sentence><sentence id="383">Is that -- am I understanding correctly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: There was no contact with the Germans because the lifestyle of the people on the island was very different from on the mainland. </sentence><sentence id="387">So we had our way of doing things, and we were not having any life together with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="388">Plus, the Italians were still there. </sentence><sentence id="389">In Europe, it was different. </sentence><sentence id="390">The deportation for us was very hard because we had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="391">We had never felt anything before that day. </sentence><sentence id="392">And the difference in Europe, where they had to hide, where they were feeling things growing bit by bit... we had no feeling of that kind on the island, so it was even stronger for us -- the shock -- because suddenly everybody was rounded up and we had to be deported and we were wondering why and where-- where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="393">Because we had never felt anything of the war until then, except for the racial laws, but we had attributed that to the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: Do you remember exactly when the Germans came in, in September? </sentence><sentence id="403">Do you actually remember any particular day or was it not very monumental? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: At some point in time the Germans arrived, but they were not in the city, so they were mainly staying in their headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="407">So we didn't really feel it. </sentence><sentence id="408">When the British left the area, then the Germans arrived mid-September. </sentence><sentence id="409">We didn't feel it much, but after the deportation, my mother found out from the Mother Superior knew that the Italians had been trying to defend the king's idea and kind of do a resistance against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="410">And at that point in time, the Germans took some of the Italians prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="411">But I only found out after the deportation (2), the Mother Superior told me when I went back to the island, that the Germans had taken some Italian officers prisoner, and they had asked one officer to dig a kind of a hole in the ground, and they shot 300 of them. [ </sentence><sentence id="412">The number of officers executed was actually about 100.] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: That's on Kos, as well? </sentence><sentence id="414">Is that what you either refer to or "ve seen mentioned as a massacre on Kos? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: All this time before being deported, and especially after the Germans arrived, was your father still able to do his work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: Yes, but less than before. </sentence><sentence id="420">In early afternoon he'd come back to the village where we were staying. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: I think we've covered most of the time period up until September 1943, when the armistice was made official. </sentence><sentence id="424">So I'm curious to know what you noticed right away when the Germans were coming into your region? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: There were, at some point in time, a lot of bombs being dropped around the island by the Allies and what we did, we went with the family and other people to a village outside the city. </sentence><sentence id="428">And that's where the Germans came to arrest us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: That's all the way in July of 1944, is that correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: When they rounded us up on July 21, 1944, they lined us up in the courtyard of the governor's palace, and we stayed there for 24 hours without food or water. </sentence><sentence id="434">And we thought we were going to be kept somewhere on the island, as a kind of prisoner camp of some kind. </sentence><sentence id="435">We had no idea what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="436">It was a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="437">Germans came unexpectedly and circled our place, said all of us would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="438">We prepared our suitcases; the Germans told us to bring not too many things. </sentence><sentence id="439">We were about 500 people, about 30 families. </sentence><sentence id="440">It was at that point in time that the Mother Superior came with the music teacher and with some official paper from the German commandanture to have my mother exempted and stay on the island. </sentence><sentence id="441">But my mother decided that she wanted to go where her family was going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="451">Q: How would your mother have been able to be exempt? </sentence><sentence id="452">What was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: My mother would have been able to because -- the Mother Superior said that she was a sick person and she had to be treated before being sent away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: And that was actually fabricated by... or was that true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: It was not true. </sentence><sentence id="460">At that point, the Mother Superior realized that we were going to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="461">She didn't know where, but she realized what was happening, and she tried because my mother did a lot for them. </sentence><sentence id="462">She tried to at least save her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: Did you know of any resistance activities going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: No, not to our knowledge. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="470">Q: Now I think, if you're ready to discuss, maybe you can tell me some more details about the deportation, as much detail as possible. </sentence><sentence id="471">The very first that you heard of anything that was going to be happening? </sentence><sentence id="472">How many people from Kos and from Rhodes? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: From Rhodes, there were 2,000 people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: Maybe you've already said this, but was it done in different stages? </sentence><sentence id="476">So they gathered, I had read somewhere they gathered men first and then women and children, or was that in Rhodes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="479">Was it different in Kos? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: In Kos we were all gathered together. </sentence><sentence id="481">It was in Rhodes that they took men first and the next day women and children. </sentence><sentence id="482">We went on a bus to the city. </sentence><sentence id="483">Then we boarded a boat, one from Kos, two from Rhodes, to Piraeus (Peiraiefs), where we arrived nine days later on August 2, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="484">It was very hot. </sentence><sentence id="485">I was with my family on deck, which was much better than being in the ship's hold. </sentence><sentence id="486">Tape 2, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="494">Q: On the last tape, we were talking about the details and the specifics of the deportation and I would like to continue if we can. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: We left on the boat -- one boat from Kos and two boats from Rhodes -- and the two boats from Rhodes joined the one from Kos and we went. </sentence><sentence id="497">It took nine days to go to Piraeus. </sentence><sentence id="498">There were some Allied forces in the area. </sentence><sentence id="499">Also when we left Kos, the Germans had said that nobody could be in the streets, and everybody had to be inside because they didn't want the people to see the deportation happening. </sentence><sentence id="500">So when we left, the city was totally empty in the streets and we thought it looked like a desolated city. </sentence><sentence id="501">And when we arrived in Athens, the Germans had told the population the same thing, so everybody was inside, and nobody was supposed to be in the streets to see people arriving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="508">Q: What was it like on the boat where you were being transported? </sentence><sentence id="509">Explain maybe the situation and the environment, how many people there were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: It was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="513">It was a bad situation. </sentence><sentence id="514">We had already started in the boat. </sentence><sentence id="515">Some of the people were on the deck, but a lot of them were in the boat's hold and had no water or food. </sentence><sentence id="516">Even on deck, there was not much to eat, and it was also the month of July and it was pretty warm. </sentence><sentence id="517">So it was hard conditions. </sentence><sentence id="518">When we came out of the boat, the Germans had some vans to transport us, and they brought us a few kilometers away from the port to a military barrack that had been abandoned. </sentence><sentence id="519">It was in Chaidari and we stayed there for two days with no water. </sentence><sentence id="520">We felt as abandoned as beasts. </sentence><sentence id="521">The next day, the first day we were there, there was no water, so it was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="522">And then the next day they said we had to go out in the courtyard because they had to inspect us and our luggage. </sentence><sentence id="523">After we went in the courtyard, they looked through our luggage and our personal things, and they took whatever they wanted to take, and at that point in time we had to get on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="524">My mother and aunts were already on the truck, but my father and I were not. </sentence><sentence id="525">Then an SS German with his whip started to beat my father, but we didn't know what he wanted because none of us spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="526">That was very hard, having no knowledge of the German language. </sentence><sentence id="527">Basically, the German wanted my father's shoes and so finally we understood. </sentence><sentence id="528">He wanted to take the shoes and bring them somewhere else, but we didn't know where. </sentence><sentence id="529">And that's when my father started crying. </sentence><sentence id="530">I had never seen my father cry before all the harassment he went though. </sentence><sentence id="531">I stated in my book that "Olympian Nazis needed Jewish shoes for their Aryan feet." </sentence><sentence id="532">The trucks arrived at the station and the train made up of cattle wagons (cars) was there. </sentence><sentence id="533">They kept families together. </sentence><sentence id="534">Each wagon had about 60 people in it. </sentence><sentence id="535">We didn't know the train's destination. </sentence><sentence id="536">In this wagon, there was a barrel with water, five loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, and some raisins. </sentence><sentence id="537">But the water was put in a barrel that was used for pickles, so the barrel was very salty, and with the movement of the train, the water became completely salty, and it was even worse after that. </sentence><sentence id="538">We were very thirsty, and when the train would arrive to a station, I could hear the sound of water. </sentence><sentence id="539">I would try to look out through the small opening high up in the wagon and yell for water, but to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="540">The trip lasted around 15 days. </sentence><sentence id="541">The train went though Greece, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovokia, and finally Poland to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: During the train ride, what were you talking about, with either your family or other people on the train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: During the time we were in the train, we were not really feeling like talking much, because we were worried and we didn't know what was going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="575">And every two to three days, the Germans would stop the train and open the wagons and they would have people go out to-- to do their-- to go to the bathroom in front of them and they were standing there next to them. </sentence><sentence id="576">And also when they used to open the wagon and people were coming out, sometimes there were some dead people. </sentence><sentence id="577">They would just take them and throw them in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="578">Those older people that had not survived because of no food and no water and they couldn't hold on, they were just being thrown. </sentence><sentence id="579">And then they would close the wagon again and continue the journey. </sentence><sentence id="580">And also for the bodily needs we had, there was in my wagon, a lady with a kid, and she had a small night pot. </sentence><sentence id="581">So we all were using it and throwing out its contents through the little window on the top area of the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="582">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="583">We spent 15 days as beasts, not feeling like human beings. </sentence><sentence id="584">After 15 days we arrived at Auschwitz, an unknown name for us. </sentence><sentence id="585">When we came out of the train the Germans told us not to take our luggage, to leave everything in the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="586">But we thought we wanted to have something to change into, since we had been in the train for so long, so we started to put clothing, one piece over another. </sentence><sentence id="587">We piled them onto ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="588">When out of the wagon we saw a big line of German Officers, well dressed and clean, and we wondered, "Why are they there?" </sentence><sentence id="589">Then we started seeing a line, and that they were starting to split young people from old ones. </sentence><sentence id="590">I was with my mother and in order not to be separated, I put a scarf over my head and started walking like an older person, holding my mother. </sentence><sentence id="591">But one of the German officers saw this, and he lifted my head and saw that I was young. </sentence><sentence id="592">So I was separated from my parents. </sentence><sentence id="593">At that point my mother said, "If you have to split me from my children, you might as well kill me." </sentence><sentence id="594">My mother and father, other older people, and young children, were in another line and that same night they were gassed and died. </sentence><sentence id="595">I and the other young people were put in another room and for the first time we found water. </sentence><sentence id="596">It was a place to take a shower. </sentence><sentence id="597">They threw us packs of clothes that were not matched in any way. </sentence><sentence id="598">We were also totally shaved. </sentence><sentence id="599">But after so many days, we finally had water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="626">Q: I wanted to ask one more thing about the deportation itself and the transportation to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="627">I was wondering, did you know people who died along the way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="630">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="631">My uncle Yehuda Netrike (ph) and Mr. Michael Menashe. </sentence><sentence id="632">They were thrown out on the fields. </sentence><sentence id="633">So were many other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="638">Q: Also I was wondering, do you know, was it everyone from Kos -- every Jew from Kos -- who was taken in the transport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: Yes, yes, yes, all. </sentence><sentence id="641">All the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="642">Nobody was left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="646">Q: And was that one of the first realizations you had that as a Jew you were being singled out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="648">A: Maybe before I did not understand. </sentence><sentence id="649">But in Auschwitz, when we were all from Kos, together in the camp, yes, we knew. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="650">The language barrier was very hard, because even in the camp, when we received orders, we did not understand them, as we did not know any German. </sentence><sentence id="651">And that was a big tragedy for us, as we didn't want to do something against the rules. </sentence><sentence id="652">Sometimes we were doing the opposite because of what the guards wanted and that's why I think language... People should learn languages, as the world is very big. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="653">After the showers and clothing, we had to go to the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="654">There were 30 in six /agers (barracks). </sentence><sentence id="655">There were 300 people in the barrack and three levels of wooden shelves -- or beds -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="656"> the majority occupied, so we did not know where to go to spend the night. </sentence><sentence id="657">We did not understand what to do. </sentence><sentence id="658">But somehow, we found a few places. </sentence><sentence id="659">Lights off. </sentence><sentence id="660">It was night and cold, but we were very tired. </sentence><sentence id="661">We were woken at 5 a.m. for the appel, when everybody was counted. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="662">We stood in rows of five with few clothes. </sentence><sentence id="663">I was wearing a blue silk skirt and a man's pajama shirt, with no underwear. </sentence><sentence id="664">The shoes were wet after being immersed in disinfecting liquid. </sentence><sentence id="665">We had to stand for an hour until 6 a.m. Then we were given coffee, which was just water with color but warm, served in dirty tin cans. </sentence><sentence id="666">It was the same for the 12 noon soup -- warm with some potato peelings and some grains. </sentence><sentence id="667">These were served outside. </sentence><sentence id="668">Then we had nothing to do; we were free in the camp. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="669">The latrines were in a big barrack, with a long line of holes. </sentence><sentence id="670">Some women stayed in there for a long time, since it was warmer. </sentence><sentence id="671">But the guards with their long brooms would throw excrement on their heads so they would go out. </sentence><sentence id="672">There was a lot of misunderstanding because different people spoke different languages and came from varied cultures. </sentence><sentence id="673">We did not understand each other. </sentence><sentence id="674">To keep warm, women were asked to join others standing against a wall, maybe 20 together, to keep warm. </sentence><sentence id="675">We felt like dogs, staying on the floor having nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="676">The soup came for the evening. </sentence><sentence id="677">The new arrivals might not take it, but the ones who were there for some time would take it for themselves -- it was important to eat. </sentence><sentence id="678">Also, we saw piles of naked women cadavers being transported by women. </sentence><sentence id="679">In the afternoon, there was another appe/ and counting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="680">There was distribution to each of us of about 200 grams of black bread, 10 grams of margarine, and one slice of sausage. </sentence><sentence id="681">We put the margarine on the bread with our fingers. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="682">A deportee from Hungary, called Magda, who was 14 years old and had lost her whole family, was a kapo. </sentence><sentence id="683">On some evenings, she distributed jam. </sentence><sentence id="684">She picked it up with a spoon to throw on our bread, but many times it ended up on the ground and many took it from the floor. </sentence><sentence id="685">People were very upset with her and it seems that she was killed by prisoners at liberation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="686">After we ate, we entered the barracks to go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="687">In my mind, I had many questions. </sentence><sentence id="688">I was sad, but I knew I must sleep. </sentence><sentence id="689">One day, we were told to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="690">We left the camp in formations surrounded by old soldiers from the Wehrmacht and dogs. </sentence><sentence id="691">We walked. </sentence><sentence id="692">It was cold and foggy. </sentence><sentence id="693">The soldiers asked us to sing Italian songs -- one song composed by Beniamino Gigli: "Mamma." </sentence><sentence id="694">We sang and cried. </sentence><sentence id="695">We arrived at a camp and were told to pick up one brick, which we carried out to the camp, and the next day we returned it to the first place. </sentence><sentence id="696">It was demoralizing work -- no need to think, only to get tired. </sentence><sentence id="697">It was work similar to that of beasts. </sentence><sentence id="698">In the next camp, surrounded by electrified wires, we saw people from Rhodes, men and relatives. </sentence><sentence id="699">They looked bad -- shaved, and dressed terribly. </sentence><sentence id="700">We gave the same sad impression to them. </sentence><sentence id="701">They worked in mines, salt and coal, all day long. </sentence><sentence id="702">My brother Dave, 25 years old, was there, and a week later developed pneumonia and went to the infirmary. </sentence><sentence id="703">I went there and called him. </sentence><sentence id="704">He came out and said, "I'm sick." </sentence><sentence id="705">On Friday, we got a bowl of soup for three people with three potatoes, which I saved to take to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="706">I called and called, but he did not come. </sentence><sentence id="707">A nurse came out and told </sentence></p><p><sentence id="708">   me not to think about my brother anymore, and also said, "You should eat your potato." </sentence><sentence id="709">During the night, a truck had come to take the very sick ones who could not work anymore, and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="710">Years later, after liberation, when I was in Florence, I had a dream. </sentence><sentence id="711">I saw my brother with a long white shirt and he said, "You, you'll live!" </sentence><sentence id="712">And I never forgot this. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="713">The daily life in Auschwitz, I already mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="714">The stronger ones did not let us pass to get water to wash our faces. </sentence><sentence id="715">We were 2,000 individuals. </sentence><sentence id="716">You had to, in a way, fight for survival. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="717">Tape 2, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: I'd like to go back and just catch up with a few details about your arrival to Auschwitz, and I'm curious especially, from the things that I've read, about the dates that you were in transport to get there and what date you actually arrived. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="719">A: I left Kos on the 23" of July and arrived to Piraeus on August 2degC/. Two days later I went on another train that arrived in Auschwitz on August 16". </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="721">Q: I wanted to address the specific date because there are actually a few things that I've read, some people who I think were also from the same region, who said that they arrived on August 17", and I just wanted to make sure and maybe you have some reason for how that might have come about , this discrepancy. </sentence><sentence id="722">Why, it seems like I've seen some things that say August 16" and some that say August 17". </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="725">A: I'm sure it was the 16, But you know we had no calendar. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: And when were you assigned your prisoner number, especially, that is, receiving the tattoo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: We got the tattoo three days after we arrived and we were very surprised to have it. </sentence><sentence id="730">It was-- some of us tried to just take it away, but it was done with ink and with a little pen. </sentence><sentence id="731">And some of us tried to take it off, just a little bit, but it was still there, and we were surprised because they say, well this is only for prisoners, like in the French prison or penal colony of the French island that was overseas. </sentence><sentence id="732">And we were very surprised we were having this. </sentence><sentence id="733">We also said, in a certain way -- not that we are lucky, but at least they did it on the arm. </sentence><sentence id="734">They could have done it on the cheek or on the forehead, and nobody would have stopped them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: When did you actually realize that your other family members had been killed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: At the beginning, when we didn't really know -- at some point in time, the people that were in the camp, the (?) </sentence><sentence id="744">people, the ones that were directing the other prisoners, were telling us (2) these are flames, these are-- We kind of understood they were... At the beginning, we thought that the smell we were smelling was the Germans cooking food for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="745">It was like a meat smell... that there was food. </sentence><sentence id="746">And then we found out that it was not, but at no point in time did we want to either know or-- or-- or be sure that the parents, and the others who were not there, were actually being burned. </sentence><sentence id="747">And we sometimes had the feeling that maybe-- maybe they were in another camp. </sentence><sentence id="748">And there was a lady from Kos that had four children, between 4 and 10 years old. </sentence><sentence id="749">Four beautiful kids. </sentence><sentence id="750">And she had asked once, "Where do you think my children are? </sentence><sentence id="751">Are they somewhere else, or did they actually kill them?" </sentence><sentence id="752">And the answer was, "Oh no, I'm sure they are somewhere else." </sentence><sentence id="753">But actually, when we arrived at Auschwitz, the same night, those kids were with their grandmother -- I mean this woman's mother -- and they were together with the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="754">They took them, so we never really knew what happened to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: Were you actually in Birkenau? </sentence><sentence id="770">And what block number were you in, do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: It was Block 20. </sentence><sentence id="774">The first night, we were 300 young women from Rhodes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="777">Q: Were you also around other Jews and could you always communicate in a language with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: In Birkenau, we found some-- at some point we heard-- Some people heard us speaking in Italian, French, and Spanish, so they came over, and they asked, "Where are you from? </sentence><sentence id="780">We speak French; are you from France?" </sentence><sentence id="781">And then we said, "No, we come from Rhodes." </sentence><sentence id="782">And the other ones say, "We come from Salonique (Thessaloniki)." </sentence><sentence id="783">And there were people, like some women, who'd been there two years already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="789">Q: So out of the group that you came with during the deportation -- the larger group -- how many survived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="791">A: About 150, mainly women, some men. </sentence><sentence id="792">The majority are in Brussels, South Africa, and America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="795">Q: And out of the group of those you were with from Kos, specifically, how many survived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: Only myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: You don't know of anybody else from Kos who survived the deportation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: A cousin Lise, but she was born in Rhodes, and went back there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="803">Q: But from, originally from Kos, the only one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="805">A: There was a family from Kos who moved to Rhodes, but all died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="807">Q: So, did you mostly have contact with other Greek Jews in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="809">A: There were a small number of Greek Jews. </sentence><sentence id="810">Only three women who approached us in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="811">Some were in Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: Did you ever know of any resistance activities that Greek Jews specifically were involved with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="817">A: It is possible that there was, but I didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q: Did you then mostly have contact with other women prisoners, more than any men? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: We had no contact with men, we were always separated. </sentence><sentence id="822">Contact was prohibited. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="825">Q: Were you able to carry on any cultural or religious activities at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="827">A: We didn't do anything, but we were really amazed to see that there were some Ashkenazi women, who were there for maybe two or three years, and every Friday were taking a little bit of the margarine they were receiving, and they were melting it down and then tried to do a little candle, and light it, and they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="828">And every week, they were doing that and I was amazed that they were doing that. </sentence><sentence id="829">They were organized. </sentence><sentence id="830">And also in order to make some kind of a candle, they were ripping little threads from blankets and they were using that to do the candles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="835">Q: You never actually participated? </sentence><sentence id="836">You saw this but you weren't involved personally? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: Since the women had been in the camp for a long time, the women had the habit of doing that. </sentence><sentence id="840">But for us, we admired them that even in those kind of moments, they were doing this. </sentence><sentence id="841">But we were overwhelmed. </sentence><sentence id="842">But we had a kind of admiration for them. </sentence><sentence id="843">The difference was that since the Ashkenazi people were more religious, they had lived mainly in Jewish circles. </sentence><sentence id="844">And they were coming either from Poland or Russia or other countries, and they had been living more in isolation, so they were in a closer society and they were used to being among all Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="845">The difference with the Sephardic Jews was that we were more integrated into the rest of the culture and population and various religions. </sentence><sentence id="846">So yes, they were Jewish and they were doing the traditional Jewish observance. </sentence><sentence id="847">But we were not as close to the religion as were these people coming from smaller villages. </sentence><sentence id="848">And also because those Jewish people were put into ghettos and were obliged to be isolated and interact only with each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="859">Q: So I'm not sure how you might be able to answer this if you weren't really seeing other men prisoners, but I'm interested in the differences between how women and men were treated in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="860">I don't know if you have any perspective? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="869">Q: I think that I saw, or I think I remember in what you were saying before, something about contact you yourself had with SS or with kapos or, you know, other, and I was wondering if there is anything else you didn't' say about your personal interaction with those people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: An extraordinary thing happened to me when I was in Landsberg, Germany. </sentence><sentence id="872">I was working at the time in the washing rooms. </sentence><sentence id="873">There were four women in the washing rooms and we were washing blankets from dead people or sick people and all the dirty clothes that were from the people who had died, also from diseases, with lice and with-- We were obliged to wash about 60 blankets a day. </sentence><sentence id="874">I was washing then. </sentence><sentence id="875">And at some point in time, there was an officer that came in with other SS and they had their handkerchiefs on their noses because the smell was unbearable in there. </sentence><sentence id="876">They said, "Keep washing and working. </sentence><sentence id="877">We are doing an inspection." </sentence><sentence id="878">And this officer, at some point in time, looked at me and asked in French, "Where are you coming from?" </sentence><sentence id="879">So I said, "I'm coming from Kos and then from Auschwitz," because that's where I was coming from at the time. </sentence><sentence id="880">I was then in Landsberg. </sentence><sentence id="881">And the officer asked, "Where are your parents?" </sentence><sentence id="882">And then I said, "They stayed in... they stayed in Auschwitz." </sentence><sentence id="883">And then after that he asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="884">No, he asked first, "What were you doing before?" </sentence><sentence id="885">And then I said, "Certainly not that." </sentence><sentence id="886">Then he looked at me and he said, "I can see from your hands," because I still had good hands at the time. </sentence><sentence id="887">Then he asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="888">The kitchen was the best place to work, because there was food and it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="889">So I said, "Oh, yes." </sentence><sentence id="890">Then he left. </sentence><sentence id="891">And that evening he sent a prisoner, a guy from Vienna, who came over and gave me a pack with sugar and salami and some margarine and bread and he said, "Don't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="892">This is the officer sending you that." </sentence><sentence id="893">And for a few days, every day he sent that with the prisoner and then at some point in time, the kitchen chief (an older political prisoner interned in 1933) came and said, "You come here. </sentence><sentence id="894">I received orders that you are to work in the kitchen." </sentence><sentence id="895">And later on, I saw the officer. </sentence><sentence id="896">He was a doctor and he was working at the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="897">I tried to smile to him, but he put a finger on his mouth and he kind of made a sign not to say a word about it. </sentence><sentence id="898">And so I worked in the kitchen with my cousins Sara and Notrika and with another lady named Estela Levy. </sentence><sentence id="899">The kitchen was of course the best place to be, but also, a few days after I left the laundry to begin working in the kitchen, they closed the washing rooms because all the women working there died. </sentence><sentence id="900">Some became crazy and the others got typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="901">They all died. </sentence><sentence id="902">So I was really lucky to have survived because I was saved by this officer, which is for me an amazing story. </sentence><sentence id="903">And that was the only contact I had directly. </sentence><sentence id="904">At some point in time, they closed the kitchen because there were more and more bombings around the camps, because it was getting to the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="905">The Nazis were getting more and more scared, and there was hardly anything to eat because they couldn't get any food for the camps. </sentence><sentence id="906">And they were giving us a piece of bread for 18 people and the bread was usually half- molded because it was so old. </sentence><sentence id="907">And so one day they asked us to go out of the camp and to go pick up some potatoes in the fields because ... There was no more food. </sentence><sentence id="908">It was raining steadily. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="948">Q: When did you leave Auschwitz for Landsberg and how did that come about, going from one to the other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: At some point in time, they called us from the camp where we were and we had to go out and we had to be in line without clothes. </sentence><sentence id="951">And we had to pass in front of a medical team. </sentence><sentence id="952">Among them was Mengele. </sentence><sentence id="953">So we were very scared because there was another selection happening there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="954">And a woman that was in front of me, one girl that I knew, who had been burned when she was a little kid by oil in the kitchen and she had a scar around the neck. </sentence><sentence id="955">She was a beautiful woman, but she had just that one thing. </sentence><sentence id="956">And they didn't know -- the Germans -- if it was an infection or something, so they put her on the side where the people were to be killed, because they thought it was a disease. </sentence><sentence id="957">My cousins and I were still around the kitchen at the time and I had taken a beet and I had looked for them in the block, but in the bock there was nobody anymore. </sentence><sentence id="958">I got very scared, so I ran and I saw them in line and I said, "Put the beet on your cheek, so you will look good, because we are passing in front of the doctor." </sentence><sentence id="959">So that's what they did, and actually it was good for them because they looked so healthy, suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="960">After that, they threw us another pack of clothes, and with that we went to another train. </sentence><sentence id="961">That day of selection was October 26, 1944, and from there we went into a train and we traveled for two days. </sentence><sentence id="962">They most likely selected those who could still work in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="963">We arrived in Klaffering station and were divided into two groups: one to Bergen-Belsen and the other to Landsberg. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="964">At that point, they told us to pick up coats that had been thrown on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="965">They told us to put the coats on and then start walking. </sentence><sentence id="966">It was night, and it was cold, so we put the coats on and started walking for the whole night. </sentence><sentence id="967">And while we were walking, we were kind of feeling like there was sand on us, but we kept on. </sentence><sentence id="968">We saw the country, you know, with lights and people far away. </sentence><sentence id="969">We saw the dogs and things and we kept on walking all night, and we still had this sensation that we didn't understand, something that felt like sand on us. </sentence><sentence id="970">Then, when we arrived in Landsberg, all the lights were very bright in front of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="971">And then we saw the officers. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="972">They were healthy, and in their uniforms, and clean, and they were in a line waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="973">They asked us to throw the coats on the floor, and when we took the coats off, we realized they were full of lice. </sentence><sentence id="974">And our whole bodies were full of lice because basically what they wanted-- They had no way to transport these coats with lice, so they had us carry them over to Landsberg. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="975">   Tape 3, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="976">Q: Could you give me an idea about how it was that this group of prisoners you were part of was deported from Auschwitz to Landsberg? </sentence><sentence id="977">Why do you think it was at a particular time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: The camps were not too big, like Landsberg, so what they did in Auschwitz, they just chose, did a selection and picked some of the people to work in some of the camps, so some went to Landsberg, others went to others. </sentence><sentence id="979">That's why they did the selection and took randomly, people to go in one or the other. </sentence><sentence id="980">The Germans wanted to get the people out of the camp because the Russians were advancing, and the Nazis didn't want anyone to see what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="981">And then the plan was just to blow the place up and blow up the crematorium and the gas chambers, but they didn't have the time before the Russians arrived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="986">Q: Were conditions very bad at Landsberg? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="988">A: For me it was not difficult because at the beginning I was in the washing room, so I had a double amount of the regular food that they were giving to the others. </sentence><sentence id="989">And after that, I was lucky to be in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="990">But for the other ones, some of them that came with me, they were obliged to go, they cleaned the train station or went into the forest to cut wood. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1265">A: [had started the book when I went to Brazzaville at the beginning and then I continued it in Leopoldville and when I saw that I was telling some of the story and some people were hardly even listening, or believing in it, I decided I would continue writing because I would at least have it in written format. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And also when I had a daughter, I decided I would continue and write a bit for her, so it would remain for the next generation. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Then, I left the book there, half-finished. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And a year later, when I went to Brussels, I realized that some of the people in Europe were kind of talking about the concentration camps and the gas chambers... Some politicians in France were talking about it like a minor detail of history -- as if it was not that important. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And then some professors were even saying things like that in university in France, so I got very revolted about that. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And I decided somebody, like many others, should put it down on paper. </sentence><sentence id="1271">When the commemoration of the liberation of the 50 years of the deportation came, it was 1994. </sentence><sentence id="1272">In 1994, I said I would also finish my book -- as a memory -- to all the people that I knew that had died. </sentence><sentence id="1273">So I finished the book at that time and I added the beginning of the book about the comments of some people in Europe, about the gas chamber, et cetera. </sentence></p></dialogue>
