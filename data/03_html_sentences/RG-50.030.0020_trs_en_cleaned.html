<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: David, we are going to start. </sentence><sentence id="4">And I would like for you to give us your full name, where you were born and when you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: My name is David Bergman, spelled B-E-R-G-M-A-N. And I was born in a small town in the Carpathian Mountains called Bochov." </sentence><sentence id="8">It... at that time when I was born, it belonged to Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="9">Was a province of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="10">And I was born on May 3rd, 1931. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="16">Can you give us some of your recollections of your early childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Well, the early childhood was a very happy life for me and my family. </sentence><sentence id="20">I had a younger brother, older sister, mother, father, grandparents; and we were very close knit family. </sentence><sentence id="21">My father was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="22">And uh...he made suits for people coming from other countries. </sentence><sentence id="23">We had one of the biggest tailor shops in our town. </sentence><sentence id="24">And my mother, who was a seamstress, made the shirts. </sentence><sentence id="25">And I was just busy running around having a good time. </sentence><sentence id="26">And that we had uh what's considered here...it's a beautiful home. </sentence><sentence id="27">We had...uh we didn't, I should say, have the comforts like in America. </sentence><sentence id="28">We didn't have running water. </sentence><sentence id="29">We didn't have...uh central heating. </sentence><sentence id="30">We had stove from heating, for heating; and uh for the water, we had a well. </sentence><sentence id="31">And the outhouse was in the back of the house several hundred feet. </sentence><sentence id="32">So I...where I lived, I considered that normal.(Laughing) I didn't think that you're supposed to have these kind of conveniences. </sentence><sentence id="33">So we didn't uh...uh think that there should be any other way. </sentence><sentence id="34">And uh...my...uh I went both to cheder and public school. </sentence><sentence id="35">Now uh actually when I started school was really...is when the first uh--say in "39--the first sensing of the beginning of what anti-Semitism is really like. </sentence><sentence id="36">And I remember, it was on a Saturday once. </sentence><sentence id="37">And that's after the Hungarians marched in. </sentence><sentence id="38">The Hungarians, until 1939 that province was under Czechoslovakia rule. </sentence><sentence id="39">And we had a Czech officer. </sentence><sentence id="40">We had a two-family home; he lived on the lower flat. </sentence><sentence id="41">And all of a sudden, he disappeared just like that. </sentence><sentence id="42">Just like over night. </sentence><sentence id="43">And the Hungarians just marched in. </sentence><sentence id="44">And we were forced to...uh pledge allegiance to the new Hungarian regime. </sentence><sentence id="45">And as soon as they walked in, within a few days...I happened to be on a Saturday at my grandfather's place; and he had a eruv. </sentence><sentence id="46">I don't know if you know; a eruv is a guide wire that sets a perimeter as far as we can walk on the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="47">And the first thing they did is, they came with a truck and ripped off that wire. </sentence><sentence id="48">So that was the first harassment that I actually seen by the Hungarian Nazis--showing their muscles, really, what they can do. </sentence><sentence id="49">And then afterwards, we were told that we could no longer go into  cheder, legally. </sentence><sentence id="50">That was forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="51">So we had to go illegally. </sentence><sentence id="52">And then we would have a look out for the police. </sentence><sentence id="53">So we'd take turns. </sentence><sentence id="54">Whenever the police came, they always were in pair. </sentence><sentence id="55">They had their green hats and a little feather on their head like, so they were recognizable from a distance. </sentence><sentence id="56">So as soon as they...we saw them coming, we get a signal-- "Disperse!" </sentence><sentence id="57">And we would run; and "til it was all clear. </sentence><sentence id="58">And then we would resume again. </sentence><sentence id="59">And we sort of accepted that that's a way of life. </sentence><sentence id="60">We didn't question the parents who they were, why they're doing it. </sentence><sentence id="61">That's the way it is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: This was in 1939? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: And then what do you remember immediately after that? </sentence><sentence id="112">Let's say in the..."40, early "40s. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Well, then afterwards it started to...for...tightened, I guess use the word "tighten" the noose more. </sentence><sentence id="116">They next step they did is, they took the licenses away of people--professional--of practicing their business. </sentence><sentence id="117">Like I had a cousin who was a dentist, and he was not allowed to practice dentistry anymore. </sentence><sentence id="118">We were supposed... We were forced to go secretly. </sentence><sentence id="119">So that if I went to a dentist and I had work some done and my teeth were bleeding...gums were bleeding, then I had to wait--make sure that the bleeding stopped--before I would leave. </sentence><sentence id="120">Because if they would have caught me, seeing uh that I had dental care through a Jewish dentist, then they would have punished him and me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How big a Jewish community did you have there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: There were about 3,000 Jewish in that...and then about 7,000 Christians in that area there. </sentence><sentence id="130">My father was allowed to keep the store, because for some reason that I can't remember--I was about 10 or 11 at the time--is because we had Czech citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="131">So they allowed those with Czech citizenship to keep the businesses. </sentence><sentence id="132">But those of Hungarian, they took away. </sentence><sentence id="133">Why? </sentence><sentence id="134">L..I..[ wasn't old enough there to understand. </sentence><sentence id="135">In fact, we were really such...lived in such an isolated area that the news would come from a drummer. </sentence><sentence id="136">We have a drummer coming like old time and beating on the door; and we would all run out toward the square. </sentence><sentence id="137">And then he would take out a piece of paper, and that's how we got our news. </sentence><sentence id="138">So we never really realized that anything can happen. </sentence><sentence id="139">I heard things--events--happening, but I could not relate to what was going around the world at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="152">So then what happen subsequently? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, afterwards...then my father was drafted into the Hungarian Army. </sentence><sentence id="154">And this was a very, very dramatic experience for us, having him away, because we were so close knit. </sentence><sentence id="155">And then he was uh gone for a year. </sentence><sentence id="156">And then they gave him a furlough. </sentence><sentence id="157">And while he was gone, because I was the oldest in the family I was considered man of the house. </sentence><sentence id="158">Uh, This was about 11. </sentence><sentence id="159">I had to go on night guard with an older person. </sentence><sentence id="160">And they gave us a stick in the hand. </sentence><sentence id="161">I had no idea what this was all about, but we had to walk around the perimeter to looking in case some saboteurs would come. </sentence><sentence id="162">Uh, and uh I...I still wonder why should they take somebody my age. </sentence><sentence id="163">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="164">If somebody wanted to be a saboteur, do something, I'd run the other way. </sentence><sentence id="165">But you learned not to question. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was a sense...you sense that they have the power, and you have to obey and you have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="167">And then...uh later on, we continued...uh a life. </sentence><sentence id="168">We missed our father very much, and continued going secretly to cheder. </sentence><sentence id="169">And then we saw deportations begin. </sentence><sentence id="170">They...they uh ...took certain people--let's say the Hungarian nationality--first. </sentence><sentence id="171">And I had no idea what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="172">My parents never really talked to me about what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="173">And all I saw is people marching away towards the train station. </sentence><sentence id="174">And this was yet "42, in that time. </sentence><sentence id="175">And uh...some reason, I think people really didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was like a fear, or they didn't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="177">And I had no idea what was going on, and just accepted as it was. </sentence><sentence id="178">And then, they announced that our turn was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="179">And my father, being in the military, was given the choice. </sentence><sentence id="180">He could either stay in the army and save himself, or come home and be deported with us. </sentence><sentence id="181">So he chose to come home with us. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="183">How old were you at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Twelve years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So you were 12 years old. </sentence><sentence id="189">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="190">So your father came home then, and uh he decided he was going to go with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="195">I don't think he had any idea where we're being taken; because we were told that we are being taken to some city in Hungary, to...for him to work as a tailor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="199">And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Well, the first inkling of what happened is, I recall it was in a Passover in "44. </sentence><sentence id="203">And it was a Pesach night; and we ...all of a sudden, we heard the knock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="204">And we were all frightened who it is, because we had the shutters down. </sentence><sentence id="205">And here was somebody talking with a German accent. </sentence><sentence id="206">And it was the German soldiers knocking on the door. </sentence><sentence id="207">They were not the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="208">They were the German soldiers retreating. </sentence><sentence id="209">And the strange thing was...about the whole thing is, that they come in... They were very polite in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="210">They asked if they could stay, because our downstairs was vacant since the Czech officer had left. </sentence><sentence id="211">And  they even offered to pay. </sentence><sentence id="212">And they put on a picture that "Hey, we're not as bad." </sentence><sentence id="213">And now I see why. </sentence><sentence id="214">They wanted to have confidence. </sentence><sentence id="215">They even put on some acrobatic things for the people, to show that they have come within...for good will. </sentence><sentence id="216">But once they got the confidence of the people, then they showed their true color. </sentence><sentence id="217">They came with guns afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="235">David, was this in "43 or "44? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: "44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: This was in "44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: "44. </sentence><sentence id="243">And then, we...we were notified that we were going to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="244">And there was uh...Just been accepting for us; because we were very Orthodox, and this was the will of God. </sentence><sentence id="245">And uh...(Excuse me) God will protect us and God will shield us from them, and just put our faith in him. </sentence><sentence id="246">And uh...when it came to our turn, we were only allowed to carry in our possession with us what we could carry. </sentence><sentence id="247">And we got a...like a flat bed, a horse and buggy that we put our belongings, only what we could carry. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I can still remember that sight. </sentence><sentence id="249">This is in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="250">And after we loaded everything up and I looked at the house... And here, what the Hungarian Nazi's did, had the chutzpah to do on top of it--what they...what you call "insult to injury"--is that they gave my a father a signed document, right in front of him. </sentence><sentence id="251">They even put a seal on the door. </sentence><sentence id="252">Stating that when we come back the house will belong to us, that nobody else will take it over. </sentence><sentence id="253">And yet, when I look back, within me I had the feeling that it's never going to be the same again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: So you loaded your...your... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Personal belongings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: ...personal belongings on a cart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Cart. </sentence><sentence id="274">Yah, a wooden cart with a horse and buggy. </sentence><sentence id="275">It had a couple of wheels. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="280">And then what happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: After that, they uh marched us to a synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="284">And the synagogue was like an assembly point, where what they would do is they would bring enough people until there was enough for a train load. </sentence><sentence id="285">And, for us, this was like electric shock. </sentence><sentence id="286">Whenever we heard a train before, in...in 1942 and 1943, when they began... Uh, because we knew that the trains are coming to pick up more people, take them away. </sentence><sentence id="287">So we already knew that going to the trains. </sentence><sentence id="288">We didn't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="289">But soon as we got into the synagogue and we were there, it is  like being thrown into a cage. </sentence><sentence id="290">All of a sudden, they show their viciousness. </sentence><sentence id="291">Saw a couple of people passed out, and they beat them up; and we tried to help, and they wouldn't let and wouldn't offer any help. </sentence><sentence id="292">So we already sensed that something bad is going to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="304">So you were in the synagogue there. </sentence><sentence id="305">What happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Well, after that we stayed there a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="310">Then the train arrived; and then we were put onto a train. </sentence><sentence id="311">It was still a passenger train, instead of a cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="312">And uh...from there, I found they took us to a ghetto in Hungary called Mateszalka. </sentence><sentence id="313">Mateszalka was sort of a central point where they brought all the victims from all of the shtetlach around in that area. </sentence><sentence id="314">And it's...,just like they brought us to the train station from one shtetlach, that camp was sort of a shul for all of the surrounding areas. </sentence><sentence id="315">So when they had enough people in there for a large...or whenever a transport was available, then that's where uh was the assembling point. </sentence><sentence id="316">And that was...uh we lived in tents over there. </sentence><sentence id="317">And uh we...uh we didn't know what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="318">Nobody said anything to anybody: where we're going, what's going to happen, where are we heading. </sentence><sentence id="319">We knew we're waiting for something. </sentence><sentence id="320">For a train to take us someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="321">It was not the place where we knew that we were going to stay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="336">So then the train finally arrived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: The train arrived. </sentence><sentence id="340">It was several weeks. </sentence><sentence id="341">Four, five weeks. </sentence><sentence id="342">I can't recall the exact. </sentence><sentence id="343">And then, we still believed that we were being taken to a city in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="344">And this time, instead of a passenger train, there was a cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="345">And they put us in, packed us very tight. </sentence><sentence id="346">And there was hardly room to move. </sentence><sentence id="347">And the whole family there--my grandparents--they were still together. </sentence><sentence id="348">And when they locked the door, the click, and put the key on, I knew within me--I wouldn't share it--I knew we were in for something. </sentence><sentence id="349">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="350">And when we got on the train, we could hear the Hungarian guards talking. </sentence><sentence id="351">Even though it was totally locked, we could hear them talking. </sentence><sentence id="352">So we knew we were guarded on the train. </sentence><sentence id="353">And then the train kept travelling. </sentence><sentence id="354">It was maybe a couple of days or so. </sentence><sentence id="355">And then it came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="356">And we didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="357">Then we heard talking. </sentence><sentence id="358">All of a sudden we heard Hungarian, we heard German talking. </sentence><sentence id="359">And then the Hungarian voices disappeared; and then German guards had taken over. </sentence><sentence id="360">So that put fear in us, knowing that we're not going to Hungary anymore. </sentence><sentence id="361">That this was... And from there on in, it was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="362">I'd say the beginning of the end, for a lot of people. ( </sentence><sentence id="363">Pause) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: Now once the Germans took over, what happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Then, the train continued. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I think we traveled for another two or three days. </sentence><sentence id="393">I'm not sure the exact amount of time. </sentence><sentence id="394">And I still remember, I could look through the cracks in the train. </sentence><sentence id="395">And I didn't know where was heading...we're heading, or where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="396">And I saw  people working on damaged planes. </sentence><sentence id="397">Uh, there were airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="398">And later on, I found out that that's... Auschwitz was part of where they repaired--planes that were damaged during the war were stripped, used for spare parts. </sentence><sentence id="399">And also I remember seeing these uh...they're sort of balloons, so that planes cannot fly too low. </sentence><sentence id="400">And I had no idea what purpose they were; but there're to prevent planes from flying very far. </sentence><sentence id="401">And later... And I saw that sight. </sentence><sentence id="402">And...and when we arrived, it was like in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="403">It was a nice day. </sentence><sentence id="404">And we were all with anticipation. </sentence><sentence id="405">Where...where are we heading? </sentence><sentence id="406">And then the train kind of kept slowing down; and the train whistle blowing, slowing down. </sentence><sentence id="407">And then we see barbed wire compound there, and we see these things. </sentence><sentence id="408">And within me, wondering what is this. </sentence><sentence id="409">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="410">I never was in a camp before. </sentence><sentence id="411">And then, all of a sudden, the train came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="412">And they opened the doors. </sentence><sentence id="413">And that was... That's was when I saw Hell. ( </sentence><sentence id="414">Pause) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="439">Q: That was the first real Hell you saw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="441">A: That was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: What happened there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: Well, we were forced to get out. </sentence><sentence id="446">And all of a sudden, I...1 saw Nazis beating people. </sentence><sentence id="447">I've never seen in my life like that, actually. </sentence><sentence id="448">Physically beating, dragging children away from their parents. </sentence><sentence id="449">Because in... Parents trying to go after children; and you hear shooting and yelling and crying and children... It is a sight that--I could not tell you what I ate yesterday, but I could tell you 45 years ago what...the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="450">And all of a sudden, fear took over me. </sentence><sentence id="451">What is this all about? </sentence><sentence id="452">What's happening? </sentence><sentence id="453">What are we doing here? </sentence><sentence id="454">This is not a city in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="455">This is not what we had thought. </sentence><sentence id="456">And all a sudden--we heard orders, barking: "That line! </sentence><sentence id="457">That line! </sentence><sentence id="458">That line!" </sentence><sentence id="459">And...nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="460">It was just panic. </sentence><sentence id="461">Everybody ... And I found myself uh in a line with other youth. </sentence><sentence id="462">And I had no idea which line we were supposed to be, or what. </sentence><sentence id="463">And uh...I was looking for my father, you see; because there were all men on one side. </sentence><sentence id="464">And I ran out from the group of youth that I was in, and I ran towards the adults. </sentence><sentence id="465">And that's what actually saved my life in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="466">And then I saw, momentarily, my mother and my brother and sister going a different line. </sentence><sentence id="467">And I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to them; this all happened so fast. </sentence><sentence id="468">And I stood in line with my father. </sentence><sentence id="469">And uh...I had no idea what...what is this all about? </sentence><sentence id="470">What is this standing in line for? </sentence><sentence id="471">What is this here, and telling people to go one line, another line and this line? </sentence><sentence id="472">And then my turn came, with my father standing. </sentence><sentence id="473">It could have been Mengele. </sentence><sentence id="474">It could have been somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="475">I didn't even know who Mengele was, or anything. </sentence><sentence id="476">But it was a Nazi officer there. </sentence><sentence id="477">And uh...he uh...since I was with my father, he asked me how old I was. </sentence><sentence id="478">And my voice just froze. </sentence><sentence id="479">For some reason, something within side me said, "Don't say anything." </sentence><sentence id="480">And he kept saying, "How old are you?!"--"Wie alt bist du?!" </sentence><sentence id="481">And I just kept looking him, not saying anything. </sentence><sentence id="482">And my father didn't know, either, what was...why he asked age. </sentence><sentence id="483">And all of a sudden, he said  I'm 14. </sentence><sentence id="484">He sensed something, all of a sudden, then. </sentence><sentence id="485">And he [NB: the Nazi officer] looked at me kind of suspiciously... "14?" </sentence><sentence id="486">And in a split second said, "Okay, you can go with the work group." </sentence><sentence id="487">If I... I kept wanting to say the voice, "No. </sentence><sentence id="488">No, Dad. </sentence><sentence id="489">I'm only 12." </sentence><sentence id="490">And something held me back. </sentence><sentence id="491">If I would have said 12, that would have been it. </sentence><sentence id="492">What made me uh hold back my voice and not speaking, and what made him say... perhaps only God knows. </sentence><sentence id="493">Or somebody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="543">Q: So then you were put in with a work group, or separated from your... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="545">A: Family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="547">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="548">You... Okay. </sentence><sentence id="549">You are there. </sentence><sentence id="550">At this time, you had arrived... This was Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: Well, in Auschwitz...uh they put us in a separate compounds, and gave us those cotton uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="562">Uh, and we were just waiting there. </sentence><sentence id="563">We had no idea uh what was. </sentence><sentence id="564">And then when I...during the day, when I walked around with my father, I would ask him, "What is that terrible smell? </sentence><sentence id="565">What are all those chimneys, that smoke and everything?" </sentence><sentence id="566">Either he wouldn't know...he didn't know, or wouldn't tell me. </sentence><sentence id="567">He just didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="568">And that stench is just gruesome... awesome, from that smell constantly. </sentence><sentence id="569">And you see the smoke from the ovens day and night. </sentence><sentence id="570">And just to give you an example how we were duped into believing, to a point, that what they were doing was not happening, is a man came in all of a sudden in our barracks and he announced. </sentence><sentence id="571">He says, "I've got good news. </sentence><sentence id="572">I've just heard that in a couple of days we will be reunited with our families." </sentence><sentence id="573">And the families were dead already, and he still believed. </sentence><sentence id="574">Now can you imagine that? </sentence><sentence id="575">Still in Auschwitz itself already, and not being ab...not believing that this could be happening. </sentence><sentence id="576">So how can you convince anybody else to try to tell a story, when in Auschwitz itself the people wouldn't believe that this could be happening? </sentence><sentence id="577">So when... after about 5 or 6 days and they had arranged there, we told...we were told to march out and uh to get onto a cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="578">And we were in that group about um...13 people--13, 15. </sentence><sentence id="579">Or in that range. </sentence><sentence id="580">And we got on the train, uh my father said that today's my Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="581">And he had secretly hidden, risking his life, a little bottle of wine. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="582">And he took it out; and he passed it around to everybody, and everyone had a little sip and had a toast. </sentence><sentence id="583">And that's how I celebrated my Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="584">It was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="585">But there was no time to think then on this. </sentence><sentence id="586">The time then was survival. </sentence><sentence id="587">That was... It keep...it kept us going, to believe that we're going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="588">And, hopefully, that our families will survive, too. </sentence><sentence id="589">We did not know what happened to them, actually. </sentence><sentence id="590">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="592">So you were now back on a train. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="593">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="594">And the train took a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="595">And then we embarked in a place that I found later on was called Plasz6w." </sentence><sentence id="596">Plaszow was a combination of work camp and extermination camp. </sentence><sentence id="597">A lot of the Gypsies were brought in for extermination in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="598">And one of the things that I was told is survival means the ability to work. </sentence><sentence id="599">If you could work, there was hope for survival. </sentence><sentence id="600">If you couldn't work, you were done. </sentence><sentence id="601">So mentally I had to psyche myself out that I'm adult and I could do the work; and I wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="602">And so when we got there, I was still with my father. </sentence><sentence id="603">And one of the first thing they did, is they asked...they wanted to have people who had trades. </sentence><sentence id="604">First thing they selected first in work groups. </sentence><sentence id="605">And then they were...uh with all others, if they couldn't fit into work, then it was back to the extermination camp. </sentence><sentence id="606">So then my father was fall...fell out of the group as a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="607">And then they said, "Bricklayers. </sentence><sentence id="608">Who's a bricklayer?" </sentence><sentence id="609">I raised my hand. " </sentence><sentence id="610">I'm a bricklayer." </sentence><sentence id="611">I never laid a brick or a stone in my life. </sentence><sentence id="612">I never even touched one. </sentence><sentence id="613">But as I was in the camp, I saw how people laid the bricks and the stones, how they mixed the cement. </sentence><sentence id="614">And so I figured, "Well, I could do that." </sentence><sentence id="615">They said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="616">Fall in line." </sentence><sentence id="617">And they put me in the work group; and I...in their eyes, I was a professional bricklayer. ( </sentence><sentence id="618">Laughing) And I would mix cement and carrying the wheelbarrow. </sentence><sentence id="619">And we had to go to a mine where they mined stones, and then we had to carry each stone to a certain area and build a little wall underneath the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="620">It was useless work, for all practical purposes; but it kept us busy. </sentence><sentence id="621">In their eyes, we were doing something. </sentence><sentence id="622">So, at least I was able to be with my father together. </sentence><sentence id="623">And one of the things that stands out in that camp, that I remember, that I was working with a Polish. </sentence><sentence id="624">He was Christian, and he was there... was incarcerated because he committed a crime. </sentence><sentence id="625">So they also put him with us. </sentence><sentence id="626">And he got a certain... And when we worked together, we talked about things: life, and uh he was telling me why he was...what crime he committed. </sentence><sentence id="627">And next day, to flaunt [it] in my face, he waves goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="628">Because he was released, free to go. </sentence><sentence id="629">And here I thought, "I did not any crime or anything. </sentence><sentence id="630">And mine, there's no time limit for me. </sentence><sentence id="631">Only death would be the limit." </sentence><sentence id="632">It was uh very, very sad to see that-- knowing that here he could go free, and here I didn't do anything that I was virtually sentenced for life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="673">Q: How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="675">A: Well, in uh Plaszow, I was there about 6 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="676">All of a sudden, without any warning, they yanked me out from the work group. </sentence><sentence id="677">Nobody...there's no such thing as sitting down like you would say, "Well, tomorrow you're going to go someplace else, or do that." </sentence><sentence id="678">Just, "Come!" </sentence><sentence id="679">And they yanked me and said, "Tonight, uh you're going to a different camp." </sentence><sentence id="680">And fortunately, I looked all around and I was able to find my father. </sentence><sentence id="681">And we said goodbye  through the fence. </sentence><sentence id="682">And it was a very, very sad moment, too; knowing that I would never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="683">It...it just you had that feeling. </sentence><sentence id="684">I didn't give up hope, but it was very strange feeling. </sentence><sentence id="685">Then they put me on a train, and uh was like an overnight travel. </sentence><sentence id="686">And I found out after we arrived that it was a camp called Gross Rosen. </sentence><sentence id="687">Gross Rosen was...I found out was a combination. </sentence><sentence id="688">An extermination camp, and processing camp. </sentence><sentence id="689">So that when (excuse me) when the Russians were getting closer in Plaszew, they didn't want us to be free...they took us to Gross Rosen. </sentence><sentence id="690">And in Gross Rosen, they uh...we were waiting there and in process of being sent to another work camp. </sentence><sentence id="691">But before...uh we...they determined if we're going to be sent to a work camp or where, we were forced to strip naked in front of a...a doctor or somebody. </sentence><sentence id="692">And he looked us over like cattle. </sentence><sentence id="693">And he determined whether you were physically fit to do heavy physical work. </sentence><sentence id="694">Or if not, then there was..they had the extermination camp right there. </sentence><sentence id="695">And I...they did not tell you where you're going to be sent or what. </sentence><sentence id="696">And after about 6 weeks--it seems like an average cycle (laughing)--6 weeks, they put me in a train again. </sentence><sentence id="697">I'd become a professional (laughing) traveller at that time. </sentence><sentence id="698">And then I found out...at this time I was in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="699">Actually, the first concentration camp itself. </sentence><sentence id="700">And the concentration camp, meaning that in this camp it was primarily for work. </sentence><sentence id="701">And when they wanted to exterminate somebody or end his life, they took him to places like GroB Rosen or Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="702">They had their methods to their madness. </sentence><sentence id="703">So again, in Reichenbach," the same thing. " </sentence><sentence id="704">We need bricklayers." </sentence><sentence id="705">Now, since I was a professional bricklayer (laughing), I right away raised my hand. </sentence><sentence id="706">And I was put into a work group. </sentence><sentence id="707">And it was very, very, very difficult work. </sentence><sentence id="708">We had to march several miles to work. </sentence><sentence id="709">And I was already half dead when I already got to work. </sentence><sentence id="710">And then to work yet, uh it took all the strength just to make it through the marching. </sentence><sentence id="711">And then, when we marched back, if a person was not physically able to complete the march, they just shot him on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="712">There was no...there was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="713">So uh... So in Reichenbach, it was...uh this is where I spent the most time. </sentence><sentence id="714">I was there about 6 months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="755">Q: This is where you spent most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="756">Can you tell us something about what... What was your daily life like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="759">A: Well, we lived in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="760">It was like this for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="761">Ice cold; no heating at all. </sentence><sentence id="762">In the morning, we had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and take an ice cold shower in an ice cold barracks. </sentence><sentence id="763">After we took the shower, we had to go and stand outside in the bitter cold for roll call. </sentence><sentence id="764">And finally, after that, they would give us some coffee and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="765">That was our ration. </sentence><sentence id="766">And then...uh we would then be on standby for which work group we're going to go. </sentence><sentence id="767">Because every day they need work in different areas. </sentence><sentence id="768">So then they would select us to go to a certain...oftentimes, work in the city building air raid shelters. </sentence><sentence id="769">And when there would be a raid, we had to stay in the open. </sentence><sentence id="770">And they watched us from a distance. [ </sentence><sentence id="771">If] we  0 ran, we would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="772">So we were not afraid; because when we saw the airplanes, we knew when we heard the bombing that they're coming to liberate us. </sentence><sentence id="773">A uh very unique incident happened in Reichenbach that kind of stands out a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="774">Is when I was standing for roll call there; and as I'm standing, all of a sudden I hear a noise in the sky. </sentence><sentence id="775">And during roll call, it was a rule you were not supposed to make any movement. </sentence><sentence id="776">Not anything. </sentence><sentence id="777">And I was very curious. </sentence><sentence id="778">I looked up to see where that noise was coming from; and I saw it was American bombers flying over there on a mission to destroy Germany. </sentence><sentence id="779">And as I looked up with envy, wishing that I was one of those planes, thinking [of] being free, all of a sudden I hear a shrill right in front of me that could be heard in front of the whole camp. </sentence><sentence id="780">There was a Nazi Commandant saw me looking up. </sentence><sentence id="781">And: "Du! </sentence><sentence id="782">Schweinhund!" </sentence><sentence id="783">Why did I disobey his order? </sentence><sentence id="784">And he had a big stick in his hand. </sentence><sentence id="785">And his habit was, if somebody disobeyed one of his orders, he would ask him first, "Why did you do that," or "Why did you disobey?" </sentence><sentence id="786">And soon as the person answered, wham! </sentence><sentence id="787">He let him have it. </sentence><sentence id="788">And oftentimes that person would be beaten so badly that he could not go back to work, or [it] put him to death. </sentence><sentence id="789">Now here was my turn. " </sentence><sentence id="790">Why did you disobey?" </sentence><sentence id="791">And the little voice inside that told me in Auschwitz not to say anything, to keep quiet, was there the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="792">Saying, "Don't answer! </sentence><sentence id="793">Don't say anything!" </sentence><sentence id="794">And I was just looking straight in his eyes. </sentence><sentence id="795">And he was waiting for me to reply, and he was getting very impatient. </sentence><sentence id="796">In front of the whole camp there, here's a little Jew standing up there (laughing) that won't do what he says. </sentence><sentence id="797">And that little voice inside saying, "Don't answer. </sentence><sentence id="798">Don't say anything." </sentence><sentence id="799">He's getting...he says, "I know why you looked up." </sentence><sentence id="800">He says, "You wish you were on one of those planes, don't you? </sentence><sentence id="801">You wish you were free!," </sentence><sentence id="802">he says. </sentence><sentence id="803">And I just keep looking straight in the eye. </sentence><sentence id="804">He says, "Well, I got news for you!" </sentence><sentence id="805">He says, "You'll never be free again. </sentence><sentence id="806">You'll never make it out alive from here!" </sentence><sentence id="807">And I just looked him straight in the eye; and I said, "Someday..." He couldn't even see my lips move. " </sentence><sentence id="808">Someday, I will be free again. </sentence><sentence id="809">And some day I will see your country destroyed for what you have done." </sentence><sentence id="810">And this is what I was just thinking. </sentence><sentence id="811">And he's looking, and he's waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="812">Here it is. </sentence><sentence id="813">I'm almost bracing myself that he's going to do it; and I'm just holding there steady and not saying. </sentence><sentence id="814">And he's waiting and waiting. </sentence><sentence id="815">And somehow he sensed that I wasn't going to answer. </sentence><sentence id="816">And he was in no condition...condition to hit somebody who didn't answer, and just walked away in disgust. ( </sentence><sentence id="817">Laughing) Phew. </sentence><sentence id="818">And here it was, another day of survival. </sentence><sentence id="819">Now the interesting ending of this story is that during the Korean uh Conflict, I was drafted in the [US] military service. </sentence><sentence id="820">And afterwards I was sent overseas on a mission to keep the peace in Europe; and as I was flying over Europe and over Germany, I looked at the ground below. </sentence><sentence id="821">And I wondered if that Nazi Commandant was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="822">And if he was still alive, what would he have said if he knew that I was not only free, but also in one of those planes. </sentence><sentence id="823">For me, it was a moment to remember, that when... They say that justice triumphed over evil. </sentence><sentence id="824">That day that...  1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="891">Q: Let's come back to your typical day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="893">A: Yes. ( </sentence><sentence id="894">Drinking water) Excuse me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="897">Q: In this camp. </sentence><sentence id="898">You stood for roll call, and then you went to work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="901">A: Well, afterwards they uh...the Nazi Commandant sensed that there is still some youth left under 16 in the...in the work groups. </sentence><sentence id="902">And he didn't know how to... guess you use the words "flush them out." </sentence><sentence id="903">Because we all said we were older, and we were able to do the work. </sentence><sentence id="904">So then they couldn't say that we couldn't do the work; because if we couldn't have done the work, they wouldn't have kept us there in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="905">But he was very determined that he was not going to let any youth. </sentence><sentence id="906">And then he decided he's going to play one of his games different; that he is going to offer extra rations to anybody that can turn in a youth under 16.It's amazing what happens. </sentence><sentence id="907">There's only a few that knew about my age. </sentence><sentence id="908">Adults there. </sentence><sentence id="909">And before I knew it, all of a sudden I was yanked out from the work group and put with... We were about 13 in the camp who were still...uh managed to hide until now. </sentence><sentence id="910">And this time, they told us that we're being sent to an extermination camp because of...of our age. </sentence><sentence id="911">And I remember standing there with a group of others; and my thoughts were going through that this is the last day of life and that tomorrow will be end, and that I'll never return home again. </sentence><sentence id="912">And all of a sudden, I started concentrating mentally: that I want to return home, I want to be with my family, I want to be free again. </sentence><sentence id="913">And I started--without me even being aware of this coming--it's like the mind almost like going out of control, the concentration. </sentence><sentence id="914">All of a sudden, as I'm doing that, here's the Nazi Commandant front of me, standing there. </sentence><sentence id="915">And I thought... "Raus!," </sentence><sentence id="916">he says. </sentence><sentence id="917">And I thought I'm the first one that going to be shot or something. </sentence><sentence id="918">And all of a sudden, what happened that moment was that a group that was going out, a person had just passed out. </sentence><sentence id="919">And he [NB: the Commandant] went...passed through over a hundred people who were on standby--adults--and didn't ask them. </sentence><sentence id="920">And came to my group, and ordered me to go back into the work group. </sentence><sentence id="921">All the others were taken to extermination. </sentence><sentence id="922">And for me, it was like a rekindling. </sentence><sentence id="923">Here I was. </sentence><sentence id="924">As long as you were in a work group, there was still hope for survival. </sentence><sentence id="925">The interesting thing was...is that while I had hopes for survival being in the work group, I knew that now the Nazi Commandant knew about my age. </sentence><sentence id="926">He knew about me. </sentence><sentence id="927">And every day, I wondered, "How long am I going to remain in the work group?" </sentence><sentence id="928">I knew that he was very obsessed. </sentence><sentence id="929">Sure enough, after 6 weeks, I was yanked out of the work group and was taken into another compound. </sentence><sentence id="930">What they did is that they had a separate compound for those who are no longer considered physically fit to work. </sentence><sentence id="931">And they would take them over to the compound, and then a train would take them to a extermination camp. </sentence><sentence id="932">So this time, I pretty much resigned myself that no...no more concentration of being surviving, being able to make it; that this time I'm not going to make it, even though the will  2 and desire was still there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="966">Q: So you...you sort of somewhat gave up on it. </sentence><sentence id="967">But you...then what happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="970">A: Well, after about two weeks of uh...and being in that compound with the disabled and others... Uh, ironically, is during all this time--throughout the time there was now is about 9 months--throughout the ordeals, being exposed to all kinds of sicknesses and diseases-- typhus, cholera--I never even got sick once. </sentence><sentence id="971">Didn't even catch a cold. </sentence><sentence id="972">And because of my age...uh they found that I'm now...I was now with the disabled. </sentence><sentence id="973">And after about two weeks, they said, "Okay! </sentence><sentence id="974">Everybody up!" </sentence><sentence id="975">They didn't tell us what. </sentence><sentence id="976">And they took us into like half open cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="977">They gave us each a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="978">And to march in; and they packed us in in the train so tight. </sentence><sentence id="979">I mean, like standing up, there was no room to move. </sentence><sentence id="980">It was like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="981">So we knew that wherever we're heading, that this is going to be the final journey. </sentence><sentence id="982">This is not being taken to a work camp. </sentence><sentence id="983">And this was a journey that I will never forget for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="984">First, it...when we started that some people start getting weaker, and they could no longer stand anymore. </sentence><sentence id="985">Then they would fall down; and they'd be trampled on, because there was no room to move. </sentence><sentence id="986">And soon as they were trampled on, they died. </sentence><sentence id="987">They did not remove the dead after the train started. </sentence><sentence id="988">And this...as...this was a 7 day journey. </sentence><sentence id="989">And as the time went on, more people started passing out. </sentence><sentence id="990">And one time, | still recall this, one uh Nazi came. </sentence><sentence id="991">And then he...somebody spoke up or asked for some help, and he shot him right through the neck. </sentence><sentence id="992">And he just fell down. </sentence><sentence id="993">And it was an experience that I will never forget the rest of my life, is I fell down; and because there was now... About half of them were dead already; and you would sit and you talk to somebody just like a person like that like I'm talking to you, and all of a sudden he'd stop talking. </sentence><sentence id="994">Just like that. </sentence><sentence id="995">Just in the middle of the conversation, he died right there on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="996">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="997">This is the first time I was really confronted with death; because throughout when I lived in my hometown, not...not one member of my family ever died or even went to a funeral. </sentence><sentence id="998">And this was a strange experience. </sentence><sentence id="999">You just see him and all of a sudden stop talking, and he stays with the eyes open. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Then when I fell down, I uh...there was somebody fell on top of me. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And I felt like...I actually felt like I'm dying already. </sentence><sentence id="1002">I could feel like...there was a feeling like I wanted to go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1003">It was not a painful feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1004">Just going to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And there was inside...this is... We have some...such awesome power within us. </sentence><sentence id="1006">There was like...kept seeing, like an electric shock I kept getting. " </sentence><sentence id="1007">Don't fall asleep! </sentence><sentence id="1008">Don't fall asleep! </sentence><sentence id="1009">Wake up! </sentence><sentence id="1010">Wake up, because this is gonna be your last sleep!" </sentence><sentence id="1011">And I didn't know how to get the body off me, because I was so weak. </sentence><sentence id="1012">And yet I knew that if I don't push him off that it'll be the end. </sentence><sentence id="1013">So that little voice saying, "Come on! </sentence><sentence id="1014">Muster all your strength, and you got to push him off." </sentence><sentence id="1015">So all of a sudden then I just got on and the last strength. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And I pushed him off. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And then I fell on top of him. </sentence><sentence id="1018">And now he was trying to struggle to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And I just...I didn't even have the strength to move. </sentence><sentence id="1020">And he was trying to push me off, and he didn't have the strength. </sentence><sentence id="1021">And I didn't have the strength to move, and we... Neither of us wanted to hurt each other or anything, but the  3 bodies were all around. </sentence><sentence id="1022">There, nobody moved. </sentence><sentence id="1023">It was the most awesome, gruesome thing that ever human beings can do. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And we would travel by...I remember we would be...would be like a bridge overhead, where trains go by, and it stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And people would look down, and look at us like, "What's going on? </sentence><sentence id="1026">It's kinda strange." </sentence><sentence id="1027">And they had no idea what it was all about. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And then all of a sudden, when I finally did push him up out of the way and I...he fell down and I...I fell on top of him. </sentence><sentence id="1029">Now he was struggling to push me off. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And I was holding there; and all of a sudden, he got up and his final moment of breath and he bit my leg, right in here. </sentence><sentence id="1031">And then he fell back and died. </sentence><sentence id="1032">I had the most gruesome, gruesome nightmares for many years from this experience.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: Well, the journey...my thirst. </sentence><sentence id="1111">They didn't...they just gave us a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1112">We couldn't even eat, because we were very thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And the thirst pains were so bad that I even tried to use the urine from my body, just to wet my lips. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And I pretty much, as it went down uh...When we arrive, this was, I found out later, in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And when we arrived, I had already passed out, virtually. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Three out of 150 there survived. </sentence><sentence id="1117">They all...the rest of them just lay dead. </sentence><sentence id="1118">And what they did is, they pick me up from the...with the hands and somebody else with the legs. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And then they threw me in a stretcher...and they're getting ready to take me to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="1120">That's where they took...that's where their objective was. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And somehow, they...somebody who was carrying me noticed a hand moving, that I was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1122">So at a tisk to his life, he took me into a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1123">It was actually like a shower room. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And I was dazed at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Virtually, I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I thought... And when I came to [in] the bathroom there, it was... I woke up, and I...I thought I was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I felt like I was in another world. </sentence><sentence id="1128">"What are these people doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1129">Where am I?" </sentence><sentence id="1130">And I thought, I...L..I was totally dazed. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I couldn't figure out even where I am. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And then somebody came over and told me what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Explained to me that "You were just a few seconds away from being thrust into the crematorium, and they saw that you were still alive." </sentence><sentence id="1134">And they said, "You're the first youth that age who actually made it alive." </sentence><sentence id="1135">And then they took me and they hid me, you know, secretly in their barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1136">So I was not even supposed to have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And I became like, to them, like a hero. </sentence><sentence id="1138">That here are these fathers who said, well, if I made it then maybe their children would have made it through. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And they...since I didn't get any rations, because I was... The ration was there like a piece of bread--enough to keep them alive until they were actually being...were going to be taken to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And each one would take a piece of bread; and they would break off a piece and make up a slice for me, so that I could survive. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And they said, "David, you must survive and let the world know what  4 happened." </sentence><sentence id="1142">I had no idea what they meant, or what they said. </sentence><sentence id="1143">That basically was what had driven me to tell this story--not to make sure that it is not...make sure that it is not forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And so over there, after... In Dachau, I..uh started getting on my feet again; and found out I was in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And uh... Every night I heard the earth shaking from the bombardments. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And here, in my mind I was thinking, "It is now really a race against time." </sentence><sentence id="1147">We knew any day that this is going to end. </sentence><sentence id="1148">The question was if we're going to make it out alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1189">Q: So this gave you some more courage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1191">A: Hope. </sentence><sentence id="1192">To be able to go on, to...to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1193">What kept me is the belief that maybe my family is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And it was... in Dachau, it was uh really uh very traumatic experiences that you would talk to one person one night, and the next morning he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="1195">And then he would be taken like a piece of garbage and thrown on the stretcher. </sentence><sentence id="1196">You don't think...you're not a human being anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1197">You don't even know what you're thinking. </sentence><sentence id="1198">You're just a person dazed, traumatized. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And don't even know by what I'm hanging in. </sentence><sentence id="1200">But the will to live there was still strong. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1211">Q: What happened next after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1213">A: Well, I was there about 6 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1214">And all of a sudden, again, I was yanked out (laughing) without any warning and put on a train again. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Now this time I could consider myself really a professional! </sentence><sentence id="1216">It was a really a strange experience. </sentence><sentence id="1217">I actually walked out of Dachau on my own two feet--which a Nazi said...Commandant in Reichenbach said I would never do. </sentence><sentence id="1218">They took the few of us that could still walk, and they marched us out. </sentence><sentence id="1219">And we had no idea why they were marching us out. </sentence><sentence id="1220">This was about three days before the Americans came. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And they put us in a passenger train. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And I learned, years later, what actually their main purpose was. </sentence><sentence id="1223">But at that time, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And we travelled for about a couple of hours or so; and then they told us to get off the train. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And I found out that I was...it was a little town in Austria called Innsbruck. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And as we were walk...marching off from...getting off from the train station, I remember that I saw...I looked...a couple of women in a group there, looking...were staring at us. </sentence><sentence id="1227">That they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And within me, I sensed that something is going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1229">And after we marched out of the station into the forest, they started shooting at us. </sentence><sentence id="1230">They massacred many of them. </sentence><sentence id="1231">And we got to a street, uh...and it was, this was...this was in the mountains, in the forest...in the Tyrolian Mountains of Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And all of a sudden, they started...the machine guns started firing at us. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And many just panicked, run in every direction. </sentence><sentence id="1234">Something...I had something inside told me, "Look where that fire is coming from." </sentence><sentence id="1235">And as I saw it, and I dived into a hole in the side of the street and it just missed me. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And uh this was still in April of "45, now. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And I slept all night in that hole. </sentence><sentence id="1238">When I woke up in the morning, snow was all over me and I was virtually frozen. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I couldn't get up. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And I had to walk bent over. </sentence><sentence id="1241">I had no idea where I was, what in the Hell I'm doing here. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And I  5 started...I just started trying to straighten out a little bit; and then I started marching. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And all of a sudden, the Germans came and rounded us up again--those who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1244">And then... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Can you hold for a little while? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1281">A: Yah, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1283">Q: Because they're going to have to change and put in a new tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1285">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Good. </sentence><sentence id="1288"> 6 TAPE #2 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1289"> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1290">A: Well, after they rounded us up again...uh it was a strange phenomena that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1291">All of a sudden, there were soldiers, civilians, hunters with their rifles got together with us. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And no one talked to us. </sentence><sentence id="1293">No one said a word to us, or what's going, or where we're heading. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And just told [us] to march. </sentence><sentence id="1295">And...(excuse me)...and we had no idea where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="1296">All I knew is that I was marching towards the front lines. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And I saw the German soldiers retreating, going the other way. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And we kept going "til nightfall. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And all of a sudden, when we got through...nightfall came, they told us to march forward. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And then they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Everyone! </sentence><sentence id="1302">The hunters, the civilians, the soldiers... No one tells you, and you don't question. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And then, as a protection, a few of us, we went and started climbing the mountain there. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We figured we would be safer. </sentence><sentence id="1305">We didn't...the guards disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We were left on our own. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So then I marched to the highest mountain, with the strength that I had left; and I slept in a barn there overnight. </sentence><sentence id="1308">We found a barn on top of the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And when morning came, there were about 10 of us assembled there. </sentence><sentence id="1310">We could look from the top of the mountains, there were vehicles going there. </sentence><sentence id="1311">But we couldn't tell whether they were German vehicles or whether they were American. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And so somebody said... You know, I didn't have any food. </sentence><sentence id="1313">I was very starved. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And somebody had [food] there. </sentence><sentence id="1315">They said, "We'll give you some food if you'll go down and take a look." ( </sentence><sentence id="1316">Laughing) Well, I figured like this: "If they're Americans, I would be free. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And if...if not, either way, I'd end up being starved to death or be back in captivity." </sentence><sentence id="1318">So I said, "I'll go." </sentence><sentence id="1319">That was the most suspenseful walk down the mountain in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1320">I am walking slowly, slowly, slowly, to go down and see who are they. </sentence><sentence id="1321">Well, I could not tell what American vehicles look like; but I knew they were not German. </sentence><sentence id="1322">So I assumed it must be (laughing) the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And as I walked down and I saw that they were not German, I motioned for the others also to come down. </sentence><sentence id="1324">I never did get the food, (laughing) because I never went back up again for it. </sentence><sentence id="1325">And I saw military vehicles going by. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And for me, that was one of the most moving experiences in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Because I actually saw the mighty German Army surrender. </sentence><sentence id="1328">American soldiers holding guns behind. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And here are these same soldiers [who] were holding guns on my back, and now somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1330">This is...it's so difficult to explain...to...how life can be. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Here, one day here's a group of people that wanted to destroy you; and here's another group of people that want to save you. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And as I got down the mountain, I waved a vehicle to flag him down. </sentence><sentence id="1333">So [he] pulled over. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And it was one of those small trucks where soldiers were sitting in the back. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And I waved at him; and I couldn't speak a word of English. </sentence><sentence id="1336">So, the only thing [NB: way] I would tell him that I'm hungry, I just pointed my finger (laughing) at my mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1337">So they  7 gave me some crackers, and they just went on. </sentence><sentence id="1338">And I just started walking. </sentence><sentence id="1339">I don't know where I was walking. ( </sentence><sentence id="1340">Laughing) There wasn't anybody there uh picking me up, or asking. </sentence><sentence id="1341">They were just busy, the soldiers, going up to finishing up the final remnants of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1342">Um, I wanted to share something, to back track a little bit, on... When the Germans had retreated and the...we were walking towards the mountains, we were actually walking into a line of fire. </sentence><sentence id="1343">Because the American soldiers... That's what actually the Germans wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1344">They wanted us...hoping we would get killed by American firepower. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And we received a terrific pounding. </sentence><sentence id="1346">The earth was shaking and trembling from American guns. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Because they...we were right in no man's land, there in between. </sentence><sentence id="1348">So after having gone through that Hell--and I remember that night, saying, "If I'd only make it through that night," I said, "I would be free." </sentence><sentence id="1349">And I wrote... Later on, I wrote a poem about that...I'm not afraid... Entitled, "I'm not Afraid to March Forward, Because that's the Road to Freedom." </sentence><sentence id="1350">And that poem won a golden award for that. </sentence><sentence id="1351">So it made me feel pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="1352">It describes my feelings as I am marching toward the front lines--the thoughts, and the feeling that tomorrow I'll be free again. </sentence><sentence id="1353">And then I...[ have some music with it; and I used it as a teaching [tool]. </sentence><sentence id="1354">And when I speak to students, we sing it together. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And...and it's very inspirational for them. </sentence><sentence id="1356">And as I started going back, I started walking, a military vehicle stopped and picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="1357">And what they were doing, they were picking up survivors like me, stragglers who were lost. </sentence><sentence id="1358">And they carried me through...first to a German town, and uh...Gar...Garmisch. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Yah, Garmisch is there. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And we...it was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I saw most of the women were wearing white nurses" cap. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So I asked, "What is a white nursing... Why is everybody all of sudden a nurse?" </sentence><sentence id="1363">Well, what I was explained is that the Russians, when they invaded, they used to rape women. </sentence><sentence id="1364">And this way, they thought the Americans would do the same things. </sentence><sentence id="1365">So by being a nurse, they were hoping they wouldn't be. ( </sentence><sentence id="1366">Laughing) So they then took me to a sanatorium. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Not at first. </sentence><sentence id="1369">First they took me into a German home. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And they were giving everybody the C-ration food now. </sentence><sentence id="1371">And everybody was grabbing it, and taking... We were in that home... think we were about 10 or 15 people. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And I was the only one that turned them down, American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And they said, "Look here, everybody's eating the food. </sentence><sentence id="1374">How come you're not eating it?" </sentence><sentence id="1375">I said, "That food is going to make me sick." </sentence><sentence id="1376">I said, "I am not used to eating that good kind of food." </sentence><sentence id="1377">They said, "Well, what do you want?" </sentence><sentence id="1378">I said, "I'd like to have some fresh vegetables." " </sentence><sentence id="1379">Where are we going to get fresh vegetables? </sentence><sentence id="1380">There's a war going on! ( </sentence><sentence id="1381">Laughing) And you want fresh vegetables!" </sentence><sentence id="1382">Well, they saw the seriousness of me, that I really wasn't going to eat that food--even though I was nothing but skin and bones. </sentence><sentence id="1383">They went to German farmers and collected potatoes and carrots. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And they brought it to me; and I had a little pot, and I boiled it. </sentence><sentence id="1385">And that's the only food I ate for about 3 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And I didn't need any medication or anything to recover. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Many of those who ate that food became sick. </sentence><sentence id="1388">Some even died. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Mainly because their system just wasn't used to it. </sentence><sentence id="1390">That little voice, again, was there: "Don't eat that food." </sentence><sentence id="1391">Now after about 3 weeks, I was able to start eating regular food. </sentence><sentence id="1392">But until the body became acclimated, then I was just eating that. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And  8 they were just [so] amazed, that I was like this American soldiers" center of attention. </sentence><sentence id="1394">They look at me. </sentence><sentence id="1395">How can somebody who is skin and bones still be alive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1502">Q: And then you went from there... Let's see. </sentence><sentence id="1503">You were in that home. </sentence><sentence id="1504">Then where did you go from there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1508">A: Then they took me to...they called Garmisch-Partenkirchen. </sentence><sentence id="1509">This was a sanitarium used by the Austrians for rehabilitating people. </sentence><sentence id="1510">And they used that as a shelter. </sentence><sentence id="1511">So they took us to a central point there; then awaiting transportation to go back home. </sentence><sentence id="1512">So again, when I was over there, the American doctors wanted to give me medication and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1513">And I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="1514">I Just want to have the natural foods, and then I'll be all right." </sentence><sentence id="1515">And I didn't have to take any medication or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1516">And within three weeks, I was ready to travel. </sentence><sentence id="1517">Again! ( </sentence><sentence id="1518">Laughing) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1530">Q: So where did you travel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1532">A: Then from there, the American army took me uh to Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1533">It's called Plze_. </sentence><sentence id="1534">In Plze_, they...it was then that portion became...it was...it was divided in American and Russian zone. </sentence><sentence id="1535">So I remember an American officer was saying, "Are you sure you want to go back into the Russian zone? </sentence><sentence id="1536">Sure you don't want to stay in the American zone? </sentence><sentence id="1537">Come..." I wouldn't even think of it. </sentence><sentence id="1538">In fact, I remember when I was in uh...recuperating in Garmisch, there was somebody there from France. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And he had a son my age; and he wanted me to come to stay with him, to live. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And there's no way. </sentence><sentence id="1541">Uh, so once we got into the Russian zone, then it was entirely different. </sentence><sentence id="1542">We didn't get treat...any special treatment. </sentence><sentence id="1543">And as I was going to the train station to take another train, all of a sudden I saw people...people uh there. </sentence><sentence id="1544">Yelling, shouting, throwing stones; and here they caught a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And they're... Somebody said, "Well, why don't you stop. </sentence><sentence id="1546">And you can have revenge on them." " </sentence><sentence id="1547">No. </sentence><sentence id="1548">I want to go home." </sentence><sentence id="1549">And that was the first. </sentence><sentence id="1550">And I had run toward the train station; and I ran and ran, and I just missed the train. </sentence><sentence id="1551">It felt...1t was very depressing, because I was so anxious. </sentence><sentence id="1552">Then finally another train came and took me to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1553">And Hungary, when I walked in there...in that square, it was like a million people all had converged--they're coming home. </sentence><sentence id="1554">And it was ironic that after I arrived, they start asking question about your age. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And was the first time I could tell what my real age (laughing) was, without having to have fear that uh something would happen. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And then, they said that it would... they didn't know how long they could...would have to wait, because there were so many people who wanted to go home. </sentence><sentence id="1557">Those who had survived. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And that the only way to get home was to travel on top of the train, one of those cattle type trains. </sentence><sentence id="1559">Can you imagine the experience? </sentence><sentence id="1560">Travelling overnight when I had nothing to hold on to. </sentence><sentence id="1561">And just swinging there, going through tunnels. </sentence><sentence id="1562">I was so anxious to  9 get home. </sentence><sentence id="1563">And finally when I got into Sighet"... This was in Romania. </sentence><sentence id="1564">It was about 15 miles from where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And this was my next point before getting home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1601">Q: So then you... Eventually, you did get home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1603">A: In Sziget, the only way from there to get home was walk. </sentence><sentence id="1604">And this was at night. </sentence><sentence id="1605">And I finally got into the town. </sentence><sentence id="1606">It was about 2:00 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1607">I was scared. </sentence><sentence id="1608">There was the Russian soldiers there. </sentence><sentence id="1609">And I didn't know what they'd do; I thought they'd shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1610">So I just stood still in those bushes all night. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And I was so elated I was finally home. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And then the next morning, I went home and I found that there was a Russian family living there. </sentence><sentence id="1613">They wouldn't even let me in the house. </sentence><sentence id="1614">They said this is their house now. </sentence><sentence id="1615">It belongs to them. </sentence><sentence id="1616">And I said, "Can I just go in and just open the door?" </sentence><sentence id="1617">Because my survival was the ability that I saw myself opening the door to my home. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And I just wanted to have that. </sentence><sentence id="1619">I opened the door; and this was the most touching moment for me, that here is a vision that I carried with me and finally came through. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Then it entailed a scene what it's like living under the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1621">I would lose my freedom again. </sentence><sentence id="1622">I found a cousin that survived; and uh we both decided that we are going to leave from there forever, and not...not make it our home anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1643">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1644">So then where did you go from there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1647">A: From there, I went back to Sziget again, where I came. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And I didn't know where I was going to head. </sentence><sentence id="1649">I just knew that I wanted to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1650">And I heard...word was passed on that there is a uh organization to help people to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1651">And here I was on my own. </sentence><sentence id="1652">Nobody cared for us. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And the only way to get--we had to go to Hungary--was by train. </sentence><sentence id="1654">And this time, we had to have tickets for travelling. </sentence><sentence id="1655">I didn't have any tickets. </sentence><sentence id="1656">I didn't have any money. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And I went on a train; they didn't notice me. </sentence><sentence id="1658">And when I got to a city--it was probably Debrecen, or something--they started checking for tickets. </sentence><sentence id="1659">It was at night, and I didn't have one. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And I ran out of the station; and the ticket master yelled to the police, "After him! </sentence><sentence id="1661">After him!" </sentence><sentence id="1662">And I ran, and ran in a bombed out building. </sentence><sentence id="1663">And I was there by myself. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And I said, "My God, what in the heck am I doing? </sentence><sentence id="1665">Here I was supposed to be home free, reunited with my family. </sentence><sentence id="1666">Here I'm a fugitive, the police are after me!" </sentence><sentence id="1667">And I heard them talking: "Did you see anybody run in here? </sentence><sentence id="1668">Did you see anybody running there?" </sentence><sentence id="1669">They couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And then they finally left. </sentence><sentence id="1671">The next day, I didn't give up.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1705">A: It took me to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1706">In Budapest, I found out that there was a youth group. </sentence><sentence id="1707">Those that were...few that survived, and others that were hidden during the war, were now decided also to leave Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And we formed what we called a "kibbutz" to go to Palestine, it was called at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And after waiting for about six months over there, (excuse me) they told us that the only way we'd be able to get out from Budapest is to go on cattle train, like we went to Auschwitz; because the Russians were not allowing legally. </sentence><sentence id="1710">So they had to...whatever arrangements, whoever made it didn't explain anything to me other than get on the train. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And...and I remember we were travelling at night, and the train going through just like in Auschwitz--cling, cling, going; cling, cling, stopping. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And just wondering if we'll ever be discovered, because we went illegally. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Finally, morning came; and they told us that we were in Austria, in American zone. </sentence><sentence id="1714">So we knew we were finally free. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So when we got to Vienna and we stayed there about two or three days... Uh, I'm trying to think in which...there's a place that uh...very famous hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1716">I can't think of it right now; but we stayed there about three days. </sentence><sentence id="1717">And they said we will not be able to go directly to Palestine, because the British were blockading it. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Uh, that we'll have to go to Germany and wait. </sentence><sentence id="1719">Talk about depression (laughing) setting in! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1735">Q: So then you are now on the move again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1737">A: Back on the train again! ( </sentence><sentence id="1738">Laughing) This is why I had done this story before. </sentence><sentence id="1739">I called To Hell and Freedom; and this is a continuous story where I superimpose the sounds of the trains. </sentence><sentence id="1740">Because that's what this is all--the whole story of trains, trains, travelling. </sentence><sentence id="1741">Then, when we got to Germany, they put us into a former German military camp. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And uh it was called Leipheim. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And we were then there processed, preparing ourselves to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1744">One, we learned military drill; because they told us that as soon as we're going to get in there, we're going to be in the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1745">From one Hell to another Hell. </sentence><sentence id="1746">But we were not afraid, because we knew this time that we'll have to fight for our freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1747">It's not going to come easy. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And in between times--this is really ironic-- they arranged, whoever was in charge of the whole thing, for us to learn farming; trained by German farmers. </sentence><sentence id="1749">So we learned farming, learned how to plant seeds for farms; and learning how to prepare for war again. </sentence><sentence id="1750">And we found out that after...it's almost a year waiting, tha...uh the...they would not allow legally. </sentence><sentence id="1751">They would only allow one [person] a month from our group. </sentence><sentence id="1752">From the various groups, the British would only allow so many per month. </sentence><sentence id="1753">So what we would do in the kibbutz is we would put our name in our hat...in a hat. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And then the one that got pulled out, that [one] got [to go]. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I remember one, the first one that got [to go], when he arrived--he went to Israel...he went to Palestine, and told us how wonderful it is there. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And uh we were really eagerly looking forward to the day we would join him. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And then after about a year waiting-- frustrating, depressing, waiting--all of a sudden somebody from the office calls me in and that somebody wants to talk to me. " </sentence><sentence id="1758">What is it about?" " </sentence><sentence id="1759">Well, do you have any relatives in America?" </sentence><sentence id="1760">First thing, I said, "Well, I think I have an aunt. </sentence><sentence id="1761">But I don't know any of them. </sentence><sentence id="1762"> 1 Why?" " </sentence><sentence id="1763">Well, your relatives just found out about you." </sentence><sentence id="1764">I had about four aunts that I didn't know, my father's sisters. " </sentence><sentence id="1765">And they want you to go come to America." </sentence><sentence id="1766">I said, "Oh, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1767">Not me. </sentence><sentence id="1768">I'm... And America's not for me." </sentence><sentence id="1769">Okay, then they sent telegram back to America, saying, "He doesn't want to come." </sentence><sentence id="1770">Then they sent another telegram. </sentence><sentence id="1771">They said, "Well, if you really want to go to Israel, then it will be easier to go to Israel from America than from Germany." </sentence><sentence id="1772">And I just wanted to get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1773">I said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1774">I will accept their kind offer, and I'll come to America." </sentence><sentence id="1775">That's how I came to America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1815">Q: And where did you come to live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1817">A: I came to New York, and I stayed there for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1818">And I lived in a small shtetl; New York was just overwhelming for me. </sentence><sentence id="1819">So then they...L...they sent me to Cleveland when I arrived from New York. </sentence><sentence id="1820">And I stayed there with the family, for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1821">Then I started high school. </sentence><sentence id="1822">And that's when... I was one of the few, very few, of my age who made it; and when I started high school and I... was looked at like [I] came from another world. </sentence><sentence id="1823">Because uh I was their age, and uh they were all very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1824">But they didn't even know how to approach me or ask me any questions, because everything was so fresh. </sentence><sentence id="1825">In their minds, they had just seen in the movies the horrors and these things. </sentence><sentence id="1826">So I was looked at as uh somebody who had come from another world. </sentence><sentence id="1827">You know, it was a strange experience to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1828">And yet, it was a struggle; because the teachers had a struggle with what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1829">I was at an age, I was too old for junior high school and I missed all that background in junior high school to be in high school. </sentence><sentence id="1830">So what do they do? </sentence><sentence id="1831">They send me [to] both! ( </sentence><sentence id="1832">Laughing) To high school, and junior high school private tutoring. </sentence><sentence id="1833">From that, and... Talk about having a rough road! </sentence><sentence id="1834">But I managed to keep up with them; and...and I finished high school. </sentence><sentence id="1835">And I was just getting on my feet, starting... starting to college, when I get a "Dear John" letter from Uncle Sam. </sentence><sentence id="1836">That was when the Korean War was on. </sentence><sentence id="1837">That was just a joke. ( </sentence><sentence id="1838">Laughing) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1861">Q: How old were you then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1863">A: I was about 19. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1865">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="1866">So what happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1869">A: Well, they said, "There's a war on, and you're of military age. </sentence><sentence id="1870">And you're going to be drafted." </sentence><sentence id="1871">And then I tried to explain to him what I just went through, that Hell. </sentence><sentence id="1872">I told him that uh being in a camp would be very detrimental for me. </sentence><sentence id="1873">Well, they were...listened and said, "Yah. </sentence><sentence id="1874">We'll give you two choices. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Either go to the draft, or go to jail. </sentence><sentence id="1876">Which one do you want?" ( </sentence><sentence id="1877">Laughing) Very sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="1878">Naturally, uh...I didn't want to go to jail. </sentence><sentence id="1879">I took--I  2 may not say the better of the two, but I took one of the two. ( </sentence><sentence id="1880">Laughing) And when I arrived in that military training camp... That night, it was the most gruesome, the most horrible experience of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Because it brought back all of the traumatic experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1882">It was at night. </sentence><sentence id="1883">Flashlig...the lights were on the perimeter of the camp, the barbed wire of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And the shouting: "Get off! </sentence><sentence id="1885">Get off! </sentence><sentence id="1886">Get in there!" </sentence><sentence id="1887">You know, it was just like a repeat. </sentence><sentence id="1888">And get in there; and the first thing, that "You guys are the lowest scum on earth!" </sentence><sentence id="1889">And telling you, "We're going to make men out of you!" </sentence><sentence id="1890">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="1891">And I thought, "Here we go again." </sentence><sentence id="1892">And the next thing they do is that we're going to shave. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And I said, "Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="1894">They're not going to do that!" </sentence><sentence id="1895">But they did it. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And to do it, I had to numb myself like I did in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1897">All that healing that I was just going through, that they were just coming; with everything there, [it] was destroyed in that period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1927">Q: You're talking about shaving your head? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1929">A: Shaving my head, and cutting the hair. </sentence><sentence id="1930">And just being back in a camp again. </sentence><sentence id="1931">So I lived with the same survival instinct that I had to do in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1932">And it was very depressing. </sentence><sentence id="1933">It was very traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="1934">But there's no one to turn to that you can say how you really feel. </sentence><sentence id="1935">No one can really understand or relate. </sentence><sentence id="1936">They had no feeling to even think how I would feel. </sentence><sentence id="1937">And so I'm just like a machine, numb machine, going through the mechanical motions of something that I was forced into doing. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And I managed to keep up with the training, until one day they announced that part of the training exercise will be...is to go through a gas chamber of tear gas. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And that was like a bolt of lighting would have struck. </sentence><sentence id="1940">Suddenly, the next day L..I started limping a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1941">I just couldn't walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1942">And the limp got worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="1943">And it got so bad that I just could not walk anymore, and my whole body became totally paralyzed. </sentence><sentence id="1944">L...I was just like a piece of wood. </sentence><sentence id="1945">I'd pick up my hand and it'd fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1946">Well, they carried me in in the stretcher, just like the kind they carried me in--a little bit fancier, but it was like in Dachau, it reminded me. </sentence><sentence id="1947">And the doctors started asking questions, "What happened?" </sentence><sentence id="1948">Well, after they learned of what happened, they were so upset that how could they--the military authorities--not recognize some compassion of uh helping me stay out, or do something else. </sentence><sentence id="1949">So they said they are...that I have suffered enough in my life already. </sentence><sentence id="1950">That they are now willing to give me a medical discharge, and I can go back into civilian life again. </sentence><sentence id="1951">Well, there was that little voice again. ( </sentence><sentence id="1952">Laughing) For better or worse. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And uh...I told the doctor, I said, "One." </sentence><sentence id="1954">I said, "I want to stay in, because I want to complete my military obligation. </sentence><sentence id="1955">Because I want to pay...cepay my debt to America for liberating me. </sentence><sentence id="1956">And the other thing is," I told him, "the Nazis could not keep me down on my feet. </sentence><sentence id="1957">I walked out of Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1958">And I want to walk out with an honorable discharge, and not a medical discharge." </sentence><sentence id="1959">They were very surprised; because they said, "My God," they said, "they...there are some guys here, they'd give their right hand if they could get out. </sentence><sentence id="1960">Because you're going to be in the fighting right after you get  3 through." </sentence><sentence id="1961">But I was just numb. </sentence><sentence id="1962">I...I was just... I don't know what I was...whether it was really me saying; but I just said, "I'll make it." </sentence><sentence id="1963">And I went back in training again; and I asked them only one thing, before I went back, is to waive the requirement of having to go through that gas chamber exercise. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And they said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="1965">And I went back training again. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And it was just like in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Up in the 4:00 morning, standing roll call again.(Laughing) "You're the lowest scum on earth!" </sentence><sentence id="1968">Again, too. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Here we go again. </sentence><sentence id="1971">How much more can a person take something like that? </sentence><sentence id="1972">But you become numb, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1973">You...you're not really sensitive to feelings any more. </sentence><sentence id="1974">You just...you know that you have to do that to get over to get to the next step. </sentence><sentence id="1975">And I knew, just like in the camps, that they are rewards for hard work in there. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And I went and I really worked hard. </sentence><sentence id="1977">Not only in physical training in the military, but we had to do a lot of training we had to learn from books--tactics, manuevers. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And I made up my mind that I wanted to be on top. </sentence><sentence id="1979">And we finished...we were like a hundred and fifty of us; and I finished in the top three on the 150. </sentence><sentence id="1980">And then, because of that, they sent me for special military intelligence training school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2034">Q: What happened with the school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2036">A: Well, uh...when--ironic--when I finished and they sent me out to the school, they...uh they made me in charge of the group of the... They gave me in charge of the record. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And I had no idea why, really, I had all those problems from the...from what caused the paralysis. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And since I was in charge of the records, I looked up...I was able to look and see. </sentence><sentence id="2039">They wouldn't tell me why it was. </sentence><sentence id="2040">They just said... And then I learned that it was because of that. </sentence><sentence id="2041">Because I didn't understand yet all this what's going on inside the mind. </sentence><sentence id="2042">I knew it was from that, but I really did not know the details of it. </sentence><sentence id="2043">So this kind of helped me uh understand myself a little better. </sentence><sentence id="2044">So then, when we got into training and I finished, I was almost a year in communications intelligence; because what they trained us for is to be front line person for the war, to report what's going on for the airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="2045">It was in the Air Force. </sentence><sentence id="2046">And then after I finished training and they sent me to the South for more advanced training; and then they sort of divided up. </sentence><sentence id="2047">Half of us went to Europe, and the other half went to Korea. </sentence><sentence id="2048">Fortunately, my name--because it was alphabetical--they took the first half of the alphabet list, they sent to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2049">So it was a little bit of luck there, because if I had gotten into Korea I would have been sent... My function was the training to be a front line observer like. </sentence><sentence id="2050">So when they sent me to Europe--they didn't say where--when I got to Europe, they said I'm going to be sent to Germany. ( </sentence><sentence id="2051">Laughing) And ironically, when there I was...I was numbed again. </sentence><sentence id="2052">I said, "There is one thing that I'm gonna do...want to do. </sentence><sentence id="2053">Is I want to finish my military obligation, and I want to visit Palestine." </sentence><sentence id="2054">Because when I left that group in Germany in 1946, I made a commitment that someday I'll look them up. </sentence><sentence id="2055">And so I saved up all my military leave time, and uh used it up to go to Europe [NB: Israel]. </sentence><sentence id="2056">It was a...as I'm talking, there was a little incident that is ...happened in Germany that I thought it would be worthwhile sharing with you. </sentence><sentence id="2057">Is...uh part of my job was also delivering supplies to the area where we were  4 stand...where we stayed, in the mountains there. </sentence><sentence id="2058">And once when I was driving--this was a real big-semi truck that I was driving--and it was really rainy, very slippery. </sentence><sentence id="2059">As I was going up the mountain, I was going...and all of a sudden, as I was going downwards, I see a group of civilians right in the middle of the road. </sentence><sentence id="2060">I didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2061">I slam on the brakes and my whole truck went out of control. </sentence><sentence id="2062">And the civilians scattering all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="2063">And here I am fighting to bring the truck under control. </sentence><sentence id="2064">And all of a sudden, finally, I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2065">The truck went a little uphill climb, and it came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="2066">And all of a sudden, the German civilians were came and all around the truck. </sentence><sentence id="2067">So since I could speak German, I asked if I did any harm or any damage when this... Because I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2068">They said no. </sentence><sentence id="2069">Uh, then I said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2070">Why don't you just move out, and I want to keep going." " </sentence><sentence id="2071">No." </sentence><sentence id="2072">They took ... And they had a truck, a small truck; and they parked it right in front of mine. </sentence><sentence id="2073">They weren't going to let me go, and they wouldn't tell me what uh it's all about. </sentence><sentence id="2074">And I figured ... Well, I took the truck in gear and started pushing that other truck off the road. </sentence><sentence id="2075">And they were trying to prevent me from doing... And all of a sudden, I see a German comes up and with a gun. </sentence><sentence id="2076">Yells, "Halt!" </sentence><sentence id="2077">And that was... I had a gun, too. </sentence><sentence id="2078">We were given it to protect ourself. </sentence><sentence id="2079">All the fury that ever came out... Because I didn't want to, before, intermingle with anything; because I knew I'm there to do my job. </sentence><sentence id="2080">I yelled out...back at him, that he was so shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2081">Here a American soldier is yelling at him in German. </sentence><sentence id="2082">He didn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="2083">He said, "Raus!" </sentence><sentence id="2084">And I said, "I didn't do any harm. </sentence><sentence id="2085">I didn't do any damage to anything, and I'm not going to get out." </sentence><sentence id="2086">And he saw the seriousness on my face, and he saw... And he reminded me of that Nazi Commandant, and...that in Reichenbach. </sentence><sentence id="2087">I mean, here...in Reichenbach, being if it was like that, I wouldn't have said one word. </sentence><sentence id="2088">And here, there were all kinds of witnesses around. </sentence><sentence id="2089">There were two in the front. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And he saw that it was a good chance that he could have died, too, if he did something. </sentence><sentence id="2091">And I that felt...I said, "I'm not going to let go." </sentence><sentence id="2092">I felt, and a thought came to me, "Here I came as a...to keep the peace, and I could end up dying." </sentence><sentence id="2093">And he saw the seriousness there was. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And he was looking around and he was thinking (laughing) that maybe (laughing) it could happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="2095">And he put the gun back in his holster. </sentence><sentence id="2096">And I asked him, "What happened? </sentence><sentence id="2097">Why...why all this happened? </sentence><sentence id="2098">What's going on." </sentence><sentence id="2099">He said [that] ahead of me, there happened to be an American soldier was driving [who] inadvertently killed a German civilian. </sentence><sentence id="2100">So the civilians were harassing the American troops. </sentence><sentence id="2101">Or anybody that come down. </sentence><sentence id="2102">And be like in the middle of the road, and the person go out of control. </sentence><sentence id="2103">And then they'd run away. </sentence><sentence id="2104">And I just happen to be in the road again. ( </sentence><sentence id="2105">Laughing) And what did he do? </sentence><sentence id="2106">Three weeks later, I get called in by the commander from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2107">He says, "Dave, I just got a report that you killed a German civilian." </sentence><sentence id="2108">Of course, I had the witness and told the story. </sentence><sentence id="2109">He was so angry of what that German policeman did, trying... because of what I did [that] he wrote to the mayor of that town, telling that this is not Nazi Germany anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And so that's when that ended. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2186">Q: Okay, then, right after... Then, after you completed your service in Germany, you came back to the United States? </sentence><sentence id="2187"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2190">A: I went for that... I told you about that visit to Palestine--it was Israel, in 1956. </sentence><sentence id="2191">And after I got back, I went back to civilian life, and tried one more time. ( </sentence><sentence id="2192">Laughing) So then I went to school of engineering, since I was in communications engineering. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And I went and also got a job, working in the day and going to school at night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2198">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="2199">How did you end up in Detroit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2202">A: Well, this company I stayed in Cleveland that I worked for, uh transferred me from Cleveland to Detroit. </sentence><sentence id="2203">And that's... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2206">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2207">Thanks very much. </sentence><sentence id="2208">I think we went through the whole thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2212">A: Yah, it's... I think that uh we can all learn from what has happened, that... The things that I try to emphasize, as I teach it in the schools, is to...for the...those who are involved in teaching education to teach the youth that this is not a one-time happening. </sentence><sentence id="2213">That we must understand ourselves first. </sentence><sentence id="2214">That we have to understand that--and this is difficult to communicate--that every human being is capable of carrying out horrors and atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="2215">Because there were some uh victims in the camps, who became Kapos, that were more brutal than the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="2216">Because they wanted to have favors. </sentence><sentence id="2217">And then there were some guards, who did...all they did is guard. </sentence><sentence id="2218">They did not uh actually uh abuse people. </sentence><sentence id="2219">In fact, as I look back, there was one incident in Reichenbach that happened that I was working in a woman's compound. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And there were uh newly arrived women in that camp, who saw me uh working there. </sentence><sentence id="2221">And was...must have been a mother. </sentence><sentence id="2222">And she says, "Kinderle." ( </sentence><sentence id="2223">Beckoning with his arm) I turn around. " </sentence><sentence id="2224">You! </sentence><sentence id="2225">I got some food for you." </sentence><sentence id="2226">I said...
