</sentence><sentence id="2626">I finally met some people, quite by -- was just a freak, I took the Rapid to go downtown and this woman sat next to me and she had a little brochure, and I says, "Oh, I

women, we get -- they get together twice a month, at Beechwood Place, and from 10 to 12, and then on Friday they get together at somebody's home, and everybody brings something, just for the purpose of speaking French. </sentence><sentence id="2628">So I've gotten back into speaking French, and it's not a word of English, until you turn to somebody who just came back from France, who has close contact, and you say, "How do you say such and such in French?" </sentence><sentence id="2629">Nobody could remember how to say flush a toilet in French. </sentence><sentence id="2630">And I read

</sentence><sentence id="2633">I have -- going to go down next week, I think, because they built a new building, and they re-did the old building, which was closed, and I got to know -- they had a --

I do that, and I do have the opportunity of getting together with people to speak French. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And my granddaughters are taking Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="2639">But they're long distance, you know, so it doesn't make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="2640">As a matter of -- th -- Alicia called me, she said, "I have to take a language, I don't know what to take, maybe German." </sentence><sentence id="2641">And I didn't want to tell her don't. </sentence><sentence id="2642">I did say, "Oh, [indecipherable] you don't USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 83 want German." </sentence><sentence id="2643">I said, "[indecipherable] to take French," I said, "but take Spanish, it's much more useful, you know, in the States." </sentence><sentence id="2644">So I don't know what she's going -- she's going to do what she wants to do. </sentence><sentence id="2645">She said something about taking Japanese, but she's not going into something where it would be required, so I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2646">But I do speak French. </sentence><sentence id="2647">I have very little opportunity to speak Yiddish, and I trip on my words, bring in the English words, because the older generation is dying away, so the young people -- I'm sure my little sister probably didn't even speak Yiddish, probably understood it, but the young generations don't speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2648">We have a lot of Russian emigrants, but the Russians are like the Germans, they don't speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2649">Best of all, they couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2650">Every so often I find them, and I'll say, "Do you speak Yiddish?" </sentence><sentence id="2651">So I can communicate with them. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="2656">In my generation they always said, "A Jew can go anywhere, he's never lost, as long as he speaks Yiddish." </sentence><sentence id="2657">But it's not true any more. </sentence><sentence id="2658">In my generation, when I was young, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2659">It did come in handy. </sentence><sentence id="2660">I went to Israel twice, the first time on my

</sentence><sentence id="2667">And through the family I got her sister's address and they all invited me, which I didn't accept, but they grabbed me off, and I was taken to -- to visit Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2668">I took one tour, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2669">Everybody else took me around, and then I went on the kibbutz and lived on the kibbutz, and got a taste, if you can, on a couple days at the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="2670">Then I went back a number of years later -- oh, that time I traveled by bus everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2671">It was marvelous, because you meet more people, you learn more. </sentence><sentence id="2672">And I took a bus back from ji -- di -- from Jerusalem to the kibbutz, and they dropped me off into the kibbutz, and my uncle had shown -- my cousin had shown me, "See Frida, this is the street I live on." </sentence><sentence id="2673">And I said, "Sfee, you want me to remember? </sentence><sentence

was one of the Europeans from that generation, who had gone to Israel, and I was able to speak with him in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2676">So he took me to my cousin's house. </sentence><sentence id="2677">The second time I went, I went as a volunteer for the army. </sentence><sentence id="2678">I didn't like the experience, and the thing that saved me is every weekend we
