<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="158">We actually celebrated all the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="159">And my father was rather religious. </sentence><sentence id="160">He was -- at the same time, he spoke French and he spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="161">He was a wizard in mathematics. </sentence><sentence id="162">And, of course, we had a business. </sentence><sentence id="163">The business was on Ostrowska 10 and polizei station. </sentence><sentence id="164">And it was Golontaria Emenya Weingartenya (ph). </sentence><sentence id="165">And everybody in Lodz knew that place. </sentence><sentence id="166">And today, I sometimes meet people here even in Los Angeles who said, "Of course, we were going there." </sentence><sentence id="167">We had a very good name. </sentence><sentence id="168">Everybody was safe because in Lodz, at that time, you didn't have prices on any articles. </sentence><sentence id="169">But they knew you could send a check to that store and they would be treated fairly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: What kind of store was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Well, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="206">I was wondering if you had any Christian friends or if you really lived ina Jewish community. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: It's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="210">We lived in a Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="211">The manager of the apartment house was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="212">And in our summer house, the keeper of the grounds was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="213">And some of the housekeepers at my grandma's house were not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="214">But, in generally, we were actually -- we thought that everybody was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="215">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Large Jewish community? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: It was a very large Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="226">Lodz was -- I understand there were 250,000 Jews or more. </sentence><sentence id="227">It was a textile in the street there and it was called the Polish Mattress Stash. </sentence><sentence id="228">And so when some of this -- of the big industrialists in textile were going to our school. </sentence><sentence id="229">It was Vininsky (ph), Korn (ph), and others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Oh, we felt it. </sentence><sentence id="238">Somehow we did feel it. </sentence><sentence id="239">We knew that it exist. </sentence><sentence id="240">We felt it much more before -- after Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski. </sentence><sentence id="241">That really felt it and I remember one program. </sentence><sentence id="242">We went to the summer house all the father, I and Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the window because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there is a program and -- but we were able to somehow safely reach our house. </sentence><sentence id="243">And there was some times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it had much to do with anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="244">That .... did that answer your question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war? </sentence><sentence id="256">See, that  school I was going to was a private school and I started the school from the first grade and then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and they -- I had my papers graduation papers. </sentence><sentence id="257">I thought they were very important. </sentence><sentence id="258">Dave, my husband, saw them and when we went to Auschwitz I thought it would be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="259">I put it in my stocking. </sentence><sentence id="260">But of course, it wasn't helpful. </sentence><sentence id="261">I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to Warsaw, but it's not -- not really important right now. </sentence><sentence id="262">So it was -- it was actually a good life. </sentence><sentence id="263">It was a Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="264">We also had very high morals and ethics. </sentence><sentence id="265">And I remember that when the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was concerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more assimilated home and she didn't want to go out I said, "Genya, they're doing it to us. </sentence><sentence id="266">They are the perpetrators. </sentence><sentence id="267">Let them be ashamed. </sentence><sentence id="268">Why should we be ashamed to wear the star?" </sentence><sentence id="269">And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my house and we knew much about charity. </sentence><sentence id="270">My father used to always to say "It's not enough to give. </sentence><sentence id="271">It's important how you give." </sentence><sentence id="272">I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who needed help. </sentence><sentence id="273">There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father was bringing from the House Of Prayers a guest which is called the orrach, and he was sitting with us at the table and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to take with him and nobody asked him any questions. </sentence><sentence id="274">It was a charitable atmosphere in our family. </sentence><sentence id="275">For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her daughter says, "Don't let him in anymore." </sentence><sentence id="276">She says, "Look, if he wouldn't have needed the spoons, he wouldn't have taken them." </sentence><sentence id="277">So considering the high ethics and high morals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on are possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves anyhow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: One more question about before the war. </sentence><sentence id="303">Were you involved in any political or Zionist organizations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: I knew of their existence. </sentence><sentence id="307">I knew of their existence. </sentence><sentence id="308">However, in -- in retrospect I know that it was -- actually the right thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="309">Because if you have an idea, no matter how impossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it? </sentence><sentence id="310">Because the first there is an idea always and there are deeds following it. </sentence><sentence id="311">But because of the background and because of the school I was not involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="312">I remember a certain time somebody wanted to -- to -- me to join, but I didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: What do you remember about the day when the Germans came in to Lodz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing. </sentence><sentence id="323">They put up some -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: What was the, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="327">What was the date, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September. </sentence><sentence id="331">And some gallows were put on in Lodz and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as many as possible people would see it. </sentence><sentence id="332">When they entered Lodz they somehow wanted to harass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our house and they wanted my father. </sentence><sentence id="333">People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to  actual work. </sentence><sentence id="334">Some people were, for instance, bringing furniture up the set floor and the others were suppose to take it down and so on. </sentence><sentence id="335">It was just shear harassment. </sentence><sentence id="336">Shear torment. </sentence><sentence id="337">Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father was still going to the store and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was going with him and he called me his angel. </sentence><sentence id="338">I had long brown hair and somehow I was very often able to talk the German out of letting him go. </sentence><sentence id="339">I remember that one time we -- they brought us into a court yard and they left. </sentence><sentence id="340">And -- but it was a very frightening time because it was a very unsure time because -- and what was so tragic about it the Germans actually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children standing on the street and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that they were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it? </sentence><sentence id="341">You know, very often I'm thinking about it. </sentence><sentence id="342">Where does all this, I mean, it's -- it's based on -- on the teaching unfortunately of the church which I hope is being changed. </sentence><sentence id="343">But in Poland it will take a very, very long time until it would be changed. </sentence><sentence id="344">I heard somebody saying that he got this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother. </sentence><sentence id="345">Because -- and as I understand, that the church, the -- anyhow the Catholic Church since Pope the 23rd, is realizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of the church. </sentence><sentence id="346">Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and their changes are -- are going on. </sentence><sentence id="347">I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good heart and I'm glad that there is from the Vatican some directions now to change the liturgy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="368">We were talking about how the Polish people would -- would turn you in. </sentence><sentence id="369">What </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="373">  else was happening on the streets at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: It was especially -- for instance, it was so dangerous that my parents decided to send Lolick, my brother, to a smaller city where his closest friends were living. </sentence><sentence id="375">In the hope that he would be spared, but he came back after awhile because things were just as bad there. </sentence><sentence id="376">There was also much more difficult to get fuel. </sentence><sentence id="377">Much more difficult to get food, so we were living in one room in order to save fuel. </sentence><sentence id="378">We could sometimes -- of course we couldn't get the amount of food which we needed, but we still could get some food. </sentence><sentence id="379">It was dangerous to get out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="380">It was dangerous to be in the house because they were just coming in and pulling you out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: Were there any bombings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: The bombings were in the short period before the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="391">In fact, we went to a cellar. </sentence><sentence id="392">We -- you know, there were cellars where people were keeping the food to keep it cold and we were hiding there because there were some raids. </sentence><sentence id="393">That was in the period, the short period, before the German army actually entered Lodz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: So how long did -- how long did this last? </sentence><sentence id="399">The Germans were in the -- the Germans came in, they were around all the time harassing people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: Yes, they were harassing people and one day when I brought my father to the store some Germans approached him and told him they wanted the keys to the store. </sentence><sentence id="403">We just had to hand it over. </sentence><sentence id="404">Now, we probably were expecting it and were bringing certain materials from the store and hiding it under the hardwood floors and we hid there also some Torahs. </sentence><sentence id="405">Maybe I'll mention it later, but when we were in the ghetto the manager, we assume, or we actually know that the manager of that apartment house informed the German about it and my brother was taken to the Kripo and from the Kripo he had to go to our apartment house and to -- to show them where everything is and they removed everything. </sentence><sentence id="406">And it was -- you know, it was a very -- it was a very dangerous, dangerous time because there were shootings. </sentence><sentence id="407">There were shootings at that time and this -- this constant harassment, you don't know whether a person would go out on the street or even from his house and he would come back alive because the torture was quite perverse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: So, did you stay in most of the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: We must have stayed in, but they were also coming into the house. </sentence><sentence id="417">I remember one time when they came and we hid my father in the bathroom, but it didn't help. </sentence><sentence id="418">We had to show them where he is and they pulled him out. </sentence><sentence id="419">And he wasn't -- he was very spiritual and he was very learned, but he wasn't a strong man, a very strong man physically. </sentence><sentence id="420">But he actually survived at Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="426">Q: Did the Germans promelgate a bunch of decrees? </sentence><sentence id="427">Were there new laws, things you had to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="431">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="432">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: Like what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: First they liquidated all our stores. </sentence><sentence id="439">We couldn't own any stores. </sentence><sentence id="440">I'm sure there was a catch for us. </sentence><sentence id="441">The amount of food we could get was limited. </sentence><sentence id="442">Of course, I couldn't -- the schools were closed. </sentence><sentence id="443">Our schools were closed. </sentence><sentence id="444">We had -- we had -- actually, the minute they came in we were prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="445">We were prisoners and as an example of it they were putting up gallows and, you know, hanging people. </sentence><sentence id="446">And, our dignity was taken away -- I mean, it my -- the way I feel it, my dignity was never taken away. </sentence><sentence id="447">Not even in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="448">I never felt inferior to them. </sentence><sentence id="449">It could be with the teaching of -- the teaching atmosphere of my house I felt that the ones who do the wrong they should be ashamed of my -- of themselves and when I heard somebody say that he felt inferior during this time it struck me actually because I -- I never felt inferior. </sentence><sentence id="450">Never. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="464">Q: Did all these changes happen right away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="466">A: Right away. </sentence><sentence id="467">Right away, but the taking out of the -- I mean, the -- asking for the keys of the store because I remember I was still taking my father to the store for a short time and before he had to hand over the keys. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: There was no way. </sentence><sentence id="481">There was absolutely no way. </sentence><sentence id="482">You live a normal life and something which is beyond your many imagination happens you cannot prepare for it. </sentence><sentence id="483">There was no way to prepare there were some very very rich people who were somehow able to -- to reach a different country. </sentence><sentence id="484">However, even the people of Germany who would have left Germany couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="485">There was no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="486">Even -- even a ship was -- a ship was sent aware form the shores of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="487">The white paper was issued and there was no entrance to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="488">Otherwise, some people could have maybe reached Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="489">No other country would have opened the door, so, I mean, we were just boxed in. </sentence><sentence id="490">Completely boxed in. </sentence><sentence id="491">And, so some people did leave to Russia, for Russia. </sentence><sentence id="492">And a friend of my -- the closest friend of my brother left for Russia and survived, and he asked, he came to our house and asked my father's permission that Lolick should go too. </sentence><sentence id="493">And I do understand my father on -- on -- in a way because he said we all should stay together. </sentence><sentence id="494">Nobody could have predicted what would happen and he said no. </sentence><sentence id="495">And Lolick was an extremely -- first he was absolutely gorgeous. </sentence><sentence id="496">He was so handsome that when he was helping out sometimes in the store people would say "Go to that store just to take a look at that guy because he's so handsome." </sentence><sentence id="497">Then he was extremely talented. </sentence><sentence id="498">As a child he  was curious how the grandfather's clock is working. </sentence><sentence id="499">So he took it apart and when he couldn't put it together he used a string, but the clock was working. </sentence><sentence id="500">I mean, by losing him, of course I lost a brother, but the world lost something too. </sentence><sentence id="501">And when we considered all these people who were burned, gassed, tortured, murdered, the world lost something too because they were scientists and they were future doctors and they were future physicists and they were just people who learned from childhood, charity. </sentence><sentence id="502">And that you are not living only for yourself, but you're living only for others. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: Yes, and the amount of things we could take on this wagon was also very limited and, of course, we didn't have anybody ecspecially to help us, but anyhow I remember when the -- I remember that we had a bed. </sentence><sentence id="575">And I remember that we had one piece of furniture which must have come from our kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="576">We had also a table and we had chairs and the room wasn't very large and what -- when ever I think about that place on Fresetska eight, who wasn't -- which wasn't very big and was the kitchen and everything was in this one  room, I have to give an enormous credit to my wonderful mother because it was extremely clean. </sentence><sentence id="577">Always, extremely clean. </sentence><sentence id="578">We're cooking there and sometimes I think about it, how was she able to keep this place such meticulously clean. </sentence><sentence id="579">And later on after one deportation Ottos, our cousin, was adopted by us. </sentence><sentence id="580">I think it had to be done so that they have his name in the register so, that's why he was really adopted. </sentence><sentence id="581">And he came to us with a skin disease and my mother bathed him and cured him and my father got infected and she bathed my father, and she cured him. </sentence><sentence id="582">And my mother was absolutely a very remarkable women. </sentence><sentence id="583">She was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="584">She found a job for herself, by herself. </sentence><sentence id="585">She was doing some -- some working with a sewing machine. </sentence><sentence id="586">She cooked where ever there was some food to cook. </sentence><sentence id="587">She keeped everything clean and I know that at a certain time she was going to sick people and she was washing them. </sentence><sentence id="588">She was washing their bodies. </sentence><sentence id="589">And thats why the tragedy of -- when ever the tragedy was touching my mother she never complained, but it was very very painful to me and -- if I think about the time we were taken to the Kripo. </sentence><sentence id="590">Kripo was the Kriminal Polizei. </sentence><sentence id="591">They were actually having a building within the ghetto and since we were considered well to do in the ghetto, I mean, before -- they assumed that we had some valuables which they wanted to have. </sentence><sentence id="592">Now first it was only my father who was being taken to the Kripo. </sentence><sentence id="593">We were just petrified of the thoughts that they were going to take him and whether he would come back. </sentence><sentence id="594">Many people didn't come back from the Kripo. </sentence><sentence id="595">The Jewish authorities were notified to take the corpse away from Kripo. </sentence><sentence id="596">My father never disclosed anything and the strength his -- his spiritual and strength to be able to take the -- because they were actually whipping and hurting him and he came back and he didn't disclose anything. </sentence><sentence id="597">One time, they took my mother and I remember exactly. </sentence><sentence id="598">I was standing there when they took her and fortunately they came later on for me because I was very much afraid about her not that that I could do any help. </sentence><sentence id="599">I remember I walked into the Kripo, the cellars, in the cellars, there were  the torture chair -- there were the cells, where we were kept and in the back were the torture chambers. </sentence><sentence id="600">So when you were sitting in the cellar you could hear cries and screams. </sentence><sentence id="601">And -- but when I walked in there and this head of the Kripo, I think his name was Stutar (ph), was standing there and I laughed. </sentence><sentence id="602">I was laughing in his face and he says "Das Lachen wird dir hier vergehen," which means "The laughter will stop here. </sentence><sentence id="603">Your laughter will stop here." </sentence><sentence id="604">And I was also taken to the -- to the chambers and I was also tortured, but not to a degree that, you know, that I had to be hospitalized or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="605">And finally, I don't know how it happened that they were -- released us. </sentence><sentence id="606">It -- the whole time we were in the ghetto, there was always an enormous fear that we would go to the Kripo. </sentence><sentence id="607">And I remember when my father was in Kripo, when I was very concerned that he is not coming back, and he is not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="608">I went to his brother's house. </sentence><sentence id="609">The brother was already deported. </sentence><sentence id="610">But his two sons -- one son was there. </sentence><sentence id="611">And the son was very religious. </sentence><sentence id="612">He was the one who was playing the violin so beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="613">And he was a real genius. </sentence><sentence id="614">And he says he was very religious. </sentence><sentence id="615">He said to me, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="616">It's Friday night, and we didn't light the candles yet. </sentence><sentence id="617">So until we light the candles, he might still come back." </sentence><sentence id="618">I just remember what he was saying. </sentence><sentence id="619">Even in the ghetto, we tried to remember when it's Friday. </sentence><sentence id="620">And on certain holidays, we made some -- mother prepared something from the grass, or from the leaves, or something which was appropriate for that particular holiday. </sentence><sentence id="621">Now, you want to ask me something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="675">Now, the problems in the ghetto were hunger, lack of fuel. </sentence><sentence id="676">But the worse of the  worse was, the constant, deportations. </sentence><sentence id="677">And you could never be sure that, what is not being deported. </sentence><sentence id="678">And -- but there was one deportation, in particular, which was done by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="679">The other deportations -- when they hit somebody, of course, it was very tragic. </sentence><sentence id="680">So we really did not know for sure what was happening to us, and nobody thought that we were going to places that they would gas us in some wagons. </sentence><sentence id="681">In the beginning, they are telling us, they are taking people to work. </sentence><sentence id="682">And there was a small number of people who were deported from the ghetto for the purpose of working in Germany, or in the territories. </sentence><sentence id="683">In fact, one of my cousin, who was pretty husky, came back one time from a working camp. </sentence><sentence id="684">But they took him -- after a very short time, they took him again. </sentence><sentence id="685">I don't know whether to a working camp. </sentence><sentence id="686">Very likely, yes. </sentence><sentence id="687">But it was torturous work. </sentence><sentence id="688">So we did not know. </sentence><sentence id="689">We actually had no inkling that a deportation means being taken to death, or gassed, or murdered. </sentence><sentence id="690">And this Germans were master of deceit. </sentence><sentence id="691">Before they -- the deportation to Auschwitz, there were loudspeakers. </sentence><sentence id="692">And I don't know who, in particular, it was. </sentence><sentence id="693">But it was people. </sentence><sentence id="694">And they were assuring us that we should take everything we possibly can with us, because we are going to a better working camp. </sentence><sentence id="695">And I remember that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible. </sentence><sentence id="696">They say, "Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better place" -- and I was sick already at that time. </sentence><sentence id="697">So I was just watching them. </sentence><sentence id="698">But they were packing. </sentence><sentence id="699">Now, the deportation -- going back to the deportation. </sentence><sentence id="700">There were always deportations. </sentence><sentence id="701">There was a list made, which in view of what happened -- this was, I think, "42, September -- the alternative -- the other alternative was very -- was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="702">They just -- I am -- they just came into the ghetto with trucks and with wagons, they ordered a gehsperren, which means, you know, a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take all elderly people, they would take children, and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide in the apartment, they would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="703">What I did -- I knew -- my mother was actually in  her 40s. </sentence><sentence id="704">But she already had gray hair. </sentence><sentence id="705">And I was very much afraid for her, that they would take her. </sentence><sentence id="706">I don't know how I did it. </sentence><sentence id="707">But I took her to the part of the ghetto which they already were searching and taking people away, and I hid her there. </sentence><sentence id="708">But I had to run back because there had to be a certain amount of people present in the courtyard for them to do the selection. </sentence><sentence id="709">And then I went back and brought her home. </sentence><sentence id="710">Now, that was a terrifying time, because they were shooting anybody who, let's say, approached a wagon, or run to a place that they didn't want to, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="711">They were all shooting. </sentence><sentence id="712">They were just shooting. </sentence><sentence id="713">They were taking some people who were younger. </sentence><sentence id="714">They did not really select only the older, the elderly, ones. </sentence><sentence id="715">It was one of the most traumatic, terrifying deportation. </sentence><sentence id="716">So there's no excuse for anything. </sentence><sentence id="717">However, maybe because none of my family was deported -- so I'll tell you in a few minutes about my brother. </sentence><sentence id="718">In comparison with the alternative, the alternative would have been -- I'm talking about the list -- the alternative would have been that they would enter the ghetto and just shoot whomever they wanted and drag whomever, which was of course much more frightening to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="719">And we didn't know and no one knew that we are going, just like we didn't know about Auschwitz, which I am very surprised that the Poles or somebody from the outside would not somehow give us, because they knew. </sentence><sentence id="720">They knew where Auschwitz was, and they knew what was going on in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="721">Anyhow, one time, my brother was about to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="722">What happened -- my mother was at her sister's, and I was home, and that Sonderkommando came, and they looked for him that he was supposed to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="723">And he hid. </sentence><sentence id="724">But we had to, we had to, he had to come out of the hiding, and they took him. </sentence><sentence id="725">And I had only one solution. </sentence><sentence id="726">See, he was very sick in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="727">He was sick with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="728">And he was -- that was a very terrible experience, because he was very sick and his eyes were not completely closed, only partial. </sentence><sentence id="729">And finally, it was so hard on me to look at it that I was sleeping at a neighbor's and, in the morning, I was going to the  window -- we had the shutters closed -- and looking through the shutters whether he is still there. </sentence><sentence id="730">And my mother, did everything possible -- we got some food for him -- she washed him, she bathed him. </sentence><sentence id="731">And a neighbor told us of a doctor who was a heart specialist, Doctor Yorkiche (ph). </sentence><sentence id="732">And Doctor Yorkiche found that his myocardium, which is a sac around the heart, is infected. </sentence><sentence id="733">And everybody suspected its typhus also. </sentence><sentence id="734">But if it would be -- if they would have taken him to the hospital -- of contagious diseases -- you would have never come out. </sentence><sentence id="735">Nobody came out of there. </sentence><sentence id="736">And -- but -- so he was finally taken to the hospital, a regular hospital. </sentence><sentence id="737">And fortunately, this was not at the time. </sentence><sentence id="738">Because later on, the German took all the patients from all the hospitals, including the children's hospital, and deported them. </sentence><sentence id="739">But that was earlier. </sentence><sentence id="740">He reported that he was going to work. </sentence><sentence id="741">But I knew Doctor Yorkiche. </sentence><sentence id="742">And Doctor Yorkiche was supposed to be in the commission to select who is going and who is not -- no, I mean, -- so I ran to her, and I said, "Do you remember how sick he was? </sentence><sentence id="743">Do whatever you can do, and she must not have done it because they didn't take him." </sentence><sentence id="744">So we were together -- and maybe I should inject it now. </sentence><sentence id="745">When you philosophically think about life, it's true. </sentence><sentence id="746">They didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="747">I'm the only one who survived. </sentence><sentence id="748">But everyday -- I mean, the life is not forever anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="749">So that we were together and that we were together until Auschwitz has its great value. </sentence><sentence id="750">And when we talk about going to Auschwitz, I will mention to you that we had a day extra. </sentence><sentence id="751">But I think I should do it later. </sentence><sentence id="752">My father was also sick. </sentence><sentence id="753">But he also recovered. </sentence><sentence id="754">And he had a work, which was much too much for his physical strength. </sentence><sentence id="755">So -- but I was able to find him some other work. </sentence><sentence id="756">I felt always some responsibility for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="757">When my brother was  sick, I prayed that if somebody has to go, let it be me, but not him. </sentence><sentence id="758">And I always tried to get something. </sentence><sentence id="759">I was able to get some soup, I was able to pick up some leaves, I was able to go to the resort of -- I mean, the place where there were vegetables -- and get the potato, or get something. </sentence><sentence id="760">But finally, you know, there was a lot of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="761">And I, actually, was never used to -- wasn't a big eater. </sentence><sentence id="762">But I was the one who had swollen -- who had edema. </sentence><sentence id="763">And later on -- that was already "43. " </sentence><sentence id="764">43 -- I may be jumping around -- but in "43, many people had tuberculosis, many people had pleurisy, the worst diseases, which were the result of starvation, because there was very little food. </sentence><sentence id="765">It was an accumulated process. </sentence><sentence id="766">The body was being starved and being starved and being starved. </sentence><sentence id="767">In the beginning, you saw people in the ghetto who were much slimmer than they used to be. </sentence><sentence id="768">You could see it in their clothes. </sentence><sentence id="769">You could see, when you look at them, they had funny color of skin. </sentence><sentence id="770">But later on, there were people working with a lot of edema. </sentence><sentence id="771">It was from malnutrition. </sentence><sentence id="772">And there were many people dying of tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="773">Most of the pathological diseases somehow disappeared, like my father who used to have diabetes. </sentence><sentence id="774">He didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="775">My mother used to have a kidney stone. </sentence><sentence id="776">She didn't have the kidney stone. </sentence><sentence id="777">It was mostly the effect of malnutrition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="886">Q: Tell me a little bit about the food situation. </sentence><sentence id="887">How did you get food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="890">A: There were portioned. </sentence><sentence id="891">And they were -- see, depending what the German appropriated -- for the ghetto population. </sentence><sentence id="892">It was known in the administration of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="893">They were also very good at knowing where people lived, where people worked, how many people died, how many people -- most of the time, they even knew how many people are  deported. </sentence><sentence id="894">Only the time when the Germans deported people, probably, they were not able to have the real good statistics. </sentence><sentence id="895">So they were able to fix the rations for -- based on how much food it was. </sentence><sentence id="896">Now, there were sometimes starvation rations. </sentence><sentence id="897">Now, people who had worked were entitled to a soup. </sentence><sentence id="898">The soup was actually some vegetables and it wasn't much. </sentence><sentence id="899">But it was something. </sentence><sentence id="900">And we all were working. </sentence><sentence id="901">So we all had the soup. </sentence><sentence id="902">And the rations of food were sometimes very, very small. </sentence><sentence id="903">But it was, I was able sometimes to get an additional soup, or something additional. </sentence><sentence id="904">We somehow -- I mean, I was actually the smallest eater before the war. </sentence><sentence id="905">I had -- I had signs of starvations already. </sentence><sentence id="906">And so -- I sometimes think about it. </sentence><sentence id="907">How that everybody -- there was very little food. </sentence><sentence id="908">But it wasn't like -- you know, sometimes you stand in line, and you say, "No, we ran out of food." </sentence><sentence id="909">It didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="910">Everybody -- that's a little minimal, that very little was substandard. </sentence><sentence id="911">I mean, and it was not sufficient, it was a starvation diet. </sentence><sentence id="912">But everybody got it. </sentence><sentence id="913">And here, maybe -- maybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the ghetto has been formed and of their functioning, that they were able to provide everybody with what little it was. </sentence><sentence id="914">But everybody got it. </sentence><sentence id="915">It was never a situation that somebody was completely left out. </sentence><sentence id="916">And also, most of the time in the ghetto, maybe not at the very end, I don't recall any time where there was ever corpses on the street, or where there was -- we had to -- it had to be clean, because the Germans would not -- would have closed us up and finished the ghetto off. </sentence><sentence id="917">And also, there were in the beginning, and now later on too, but people were after -- they were afraid to go the hospital, because they were afraid they would be deported the way -- it was a big tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="918">Human life, as I see it, was very important to everybody in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="919">Because I recall that we -- there was a little bit of land at Fresetska eight. </sentence><sentence id="920">And it has been divided so that we can -- not at the very beginning, but later on -- it was divided so that we could grow some tomatoes, or onions, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="921">And I, we had also a piece of land. </sentence><sentence id="922">Now, I don't recall that anybody  stole anybody's vegetables, and really don't recall it. </sentence><sentence id="923">And I am very impressed -- I am very impressed with it. </sentence><sentence id="924">And as far as the neighbors, where my brother would sleep, they were very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="925">They disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="926">They must have been deported. </sentence><sentence id="927">The neighbor who came with us, who helped us with that wagon -- they were deported. </sentence><sentence id="928">And they had a little child. </sentence><sentence id="929">In "43, you didn't see any children. </sentence><sentence id="930">There were no children in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="931">In the very beginning, the administration in the ghetto tried to have schools. </sentence><sentence id="932">One time, there was even a graduation. </sentence><sentence id="933">And to keep up, you know, the intellectual part of life so that we can survive intellectually. </sentence><sentence id="934">Now, about the German Jews who came in, I remember them. </sentence><sentence id="935">They were so different. </sentence><sentence id="936">They were, like, normal people. </sentence><sentence id="937">Go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="988">Q: Well, before you tell me about them, when did they come in and how did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="990">A: Must have been -- wait for just a second. </sentence><sentence id="991">They might have come in in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="992">1942 was that big, big deportation. </sentence><sentence id="993">And they were deported before. </sentence><sentence id="994">So it must have been, like, 1941, or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="995">They came from the lawyers, Germans, Germans who have the iron crosses, I mean, some Mischlings, which means they were married to Jews, some whose ancestry was discovered that they were Jewish, some who were actually Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="996">But when they came in, they were normal people. </sentence><sentence id="997">We were not normal people anymore, not in our -- not in our looks, or not in our way of life. </sentence><sentence id="998">Maybe, some intellectually, actually were. </sentence><sentence id="999">And they also -- some of them brought farce (ph) with them, or different clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1000">But it was tragic, because it was a very short time they were so miserable. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They were so miserable. </sentence><sentence id="1002">But there were also many lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And some of the lawyers were, had positions later on as prosecutors and judges in the courts. </sentence><sentence id="1004">There were courts in the  ghetto, and there were judges in the ghetto, and there was a priest in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And so -- and then most of them, the majority of them -- there were some rumors that about 20,000 came in. </sentence><sentence id="1006">But many of them, afterwards, were deported. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And there were many musicians. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And at the end of the ghetto, all the instruments, musical instruments, had been requisitioned -- requisitioned. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I will just repeat that. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1033">Q: When the German transports came into the ghetto, did they mix with the -- with the rest of you, or did they keep to themselves? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1035">A: It probably varied. </sentence><sentence id="1036">For instance, it varied. </sentence><sentence id="1037">There was one big industrialist Hirsch (ph).And I know that my husband let him come to his office where he was and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1042">Q: Your present husband? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1044">A: My present. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1046">Q: Not your husband in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1048">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1049">That's my first husband. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And I was not married -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1054">Q: No, I know that. </sentence><sentence id="1055">But when you say, "my husband" you're talking about fifty years ago? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1058">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1059">Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1060">My present husband, right. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And he  was -- he was -- it was a Mr. Hirsch. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And he -- he was -- he kept exempt so that he could get us to -- so there was something. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Of course, I'm sure they -- when they looked at us, not properly dressed that there was malnutrition and we probably looked like heck. </sentence><sentence id="1064">So of course, I'm sure they felt superior. </sentence><sentence id="1065">So unfortunately, after a not very long time, they didn't look very much different than we did. </sentence><sentence id="1066">But many talented people were -- were incorporated in the administration of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1067">And the, the musicians were -- there were, sometimes, concerts. </sentence><sentence id="1068">So they were active there. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And the lawyers were -- were -- some of them were active as judges. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1083">Q: In order to bring in all these new people, did it just get more crowded, or had the ghetto been cleared of a lot of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1085">A: At this time, it had been cleared somewhat, but not completely, because there were people coming from other places, from ghettos which had been closed, like Pabanitzya (ph), Suskavolya (ph), and others. </sentence><sentence id="1086">It was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And that what -- in retrospect or maybe even then, this very well organized administration of the ghetto, with all its flaws and so on, was able to -- to somehow incorporate them, maybe first not in apartments. </sentence><sentence id="1088">But they were incorporated, and they were -- given food -- they were also buying food with their fares and with the fixed wage they brought. </sentence><sentence id="1089">But each time there was an influx, somehow -- somehow, the administration of the ghetto was doing something about incorporation. </sentence><sentence id="1090">But later on, there was so many deportations that the ghetto shrunk. </sentence><sentence id="1091">I mean, you could see when you walked that the ghetto's shrinking. </sentence><sentence id="1092">I don't know whether -- what, maybe, not even one third of the population was there when we were ready to go to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1101">Q: Was there -- you've mentioned a number of things like concerts, schools, all this. </sentence><sentence id="1102">So there was -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1105">A: In the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1106">It was in the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Because then, when the older kids and everybody has to work -- and I understand children who were very young had also to work, so that there was -- the schools were only in the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Later on, we could not have any schools. </sentence><sentence id="1109">They went to middling schools and if -- if a person wouldn't work, they could be deported. </sentence><sentence id="1110">They had to work. </sentence><sentence id="1111">And they took, in this awful deportation in 1942 -- children were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1112">And before we went to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1113">There were no children in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1114">I heard of a -- of a which, Dave my present husband witnessed and mother. </sentence><sentence id="1115">See, the Germans were masters of deceit. </sentence><sentence id="1116">So they were telling stories, like, they were going to take the children and they should be make to look pretty, by whichever means is possible, and that they would be going to better places. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And then, this mother had to put the child on a wagon and, right away, she'd become insane. </sentence><sentence id="1118">   Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1133">Q: You were talking about the ghetto and you had mentioned concerts. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Was there some attempt at a normal life there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1137">A: A person who has been in the ghetto has to answer that there was no normal. </sentence><sentence id="1138">It was absolutely not a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="1139">We were living in a constant fear. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And when we talk about concerts, very, very few people actually attended. </sentence><sentence id="1141">We knew that they were -- in the very beginning, more people could attend. </sentence><sentence id="1142">But it really is only like a token that something like that existed in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1143">But I'm sure that many people didn't even know about the exsistence of the concert, because very few people were able to reveal themselves to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1151">Q: Was there a synagogue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1153">A: Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="1154">In fact, there were -- in the beginning, there were some Rabbis. </sentence><sentence id="1155">But later on, they had to -- they cut their beards off, and they were not able to function. </sentence><sentence id="1156">In fact, see, they were -- there was a marriage, marriage ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="1157">At the very end, the only person who can conduct the ceremony was Rumchovsky (ph) -- the Rabbis had no rights to do anything of this kind. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Services -- there was no services. </sentence><sentence id="1159">They wouldn't allow that. </sentence><sentence id="1160">See, the ghetto was also changing, it wasn't always the same. </sentence><sentence id="1161">If we talk about schools, they were only at the very, very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Later on, the German wouldn't allow it, they would allow only work, and they demanded work of children who were very young. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I  think anything above 10 -- they had to work. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So schools were absolutely out of question. </sentence><sentence id="1165">The life was really, absolutely not normal. </sentence><sentence id="1166">So, let's say, our family -- we were extremely fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="1167">One -- one reason for our good fortune was a cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1168">In the other room, there was a cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1169">The cellar was very close to the back wall where our bed was standing. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And very frequently, when we knew there was a deportation, we went down to the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1171">It was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="1172">My brother -- there were two boards to cover that cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1173">He covered it, and he put the bed over it. </sentence><sentence id="1174">We would close the shutters. </sentence><sentence id="1175">So there were quite a few times that we escaped deportation this way. </sentence><sentence id="1176">That's why we were able to stay so long before we went to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1177">In the same way -- it was no normals, because it was terror, it was fear, there were -- I don't -- I didn't have any social life. </sentence><sentence id="1178">The life was work, and you came home, and there was also -- we were not able to use electricity very long. </sentence><sentence id="1179">So it was darkness. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And you know, in such a situation as it was in ghetto, you just want to survive, you are happy that you lived that day, and that your mother lived that day, that your brother is living the day, that your father is living the day. </sentence><sentence id="1181">That was -- that was all we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1182">And nobody even had -- had -- we, you know -- you have -- you accept it that you don't live, actually, for today. </sentence><sentence id="1183">You accept it that you just -- or you live for today, that you accept that a day passed by without any deportation, without any shooting, without any -- any decrees. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And it was in the time of the -- it was a time in the ghetto, at the very end, that they were cutting off parts of the ghetto, so people have to go, have to leave their apartments and go to others. </sentence><sentence id="1185">We were fortunate, quote in quote, that we stayed, you know, in this, one apartment, from the beginning, you know, to the end. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And when it was very cold -- there were times that it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1187">But I think that they even cleaned the streets during the winter, maybe not for us, maybe for the Germans, so that they -- nothing should happen to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And it was lie that we -- they were always some rumors. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And it was -- it wasn't really what you call a life. </sentence><sentence id="1190">It was a sub --  subliving, subliving. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And see, we -- we had something -- that the war is going well for the Allies. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And you know, we were hoping. </sentence><sentence id="1193">We were hoping. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And that this hope kept us alive. </sentence><sentence id="1195">But we were not even visiting family. </sentence><sentence id="1196">First, many of them have already been deported. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And in fact, my grandfather, my mother's father, and his daughter went to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1198">It was a time that, for one reason or another -- I don't know how it was arranged -- but it wasn't -- it wouldn't have -- it wouldn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Because when I told you about this Purim celebration, at this very crowded beautiful table, there is, there are only two people, me and my cousin, Renya (ph), who lives also in Los Angeles, who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1200">All of everybody there, all my -- Ciotka Dopcha (ph), Ciotka Hannah, Ciotka Sulcha (ph), Ciotka Peza (ph), and their husbands, and their children -- everybody was murdered. </sentence><sentence id="1201">On my mother's side, I had family in Tomachav (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1202">And I was able, while we were still in Lodz, to somehow go there, because I didn't look very typically like a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And we took some money, brought it to Tomachav in the hope that it would be easier to live there. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So she had two small children. </sentence><sentence id="1205">It was Paula Rosenblum and they perished, they perished. </sentence><sentence id="1206">From my mother's side, I had a picture of the Ciotka Rucha (ph), who perished in Warsaw, Ciotka Paula, who perished in Tomachav. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And there was, in fact, a brother of my mother who lived in Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="1208">And sure enough, he was taken to Auschwitz and murdered, with his wife -- and with his two small children. </sentence><sentence id="1209">Now, we were sure that he would be surviving. </sentence><sentence id="1210">But he didn't survive even in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1211">They -- so, you know, when you live in a place where there is death all around you when people are being deported, when you don't know what will be tomorrow, when everyday they can come and take you to Kripo and murder you there, when you are starving, when you are cold, when, when, when there is disease, because there was typhus quite a few times in the ghetto, you don't really think that there is something like a social life, you don't think that there is something which would entertain you, or -- we never went to anybody's  house. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And the neighbors somehow were disappearing too. </sentence><sentence id="1213">They were disappearing. </sentence><sentence id="1214">And so -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1280">Q: Do you remember what you talked about when you were at home with your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1282">A: I was thinking about it. </sentence><sentence id="1283">I was thinking about whether we talked. </sentence><sentence id="1284">But we must have talked, because my mother was -- one time, had a dream. </sentence><sentence id="1285">I do not believe in, you know -- I'm not superstitious at all. </sentence><sentence id="1286">But she had a dream that she went someplace, and that she met her brother, who was in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1287">I mean, he went to Auschwitz and she went to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I mean -- I mean, why she had this dream and how this dream came upon I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1289">And what did we talk about? </sentence><sentence id="1290">Now, when -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1300">Q: Maybe we should stop a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Is that music still here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1304">A: So the life was just -- it was to survive, to see that your family survived. </sentence><sentence id="1305">And I feel that considering that we had, you know, this little -- little places where we could grow vegetables -- and I do not recall anybody stealing. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And I remember kindness from the neighbor and, actually, kindness from the people I worked with. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So I don't think that I -- I -- that it is a picture -- a rosy picture is el (sic). ( </sentence><sentence id="1308">pause) The way I saw it -- and I do not think that it's something in my imagination -- but anyhow, from my experience -- and I did not have any special standing in the ghetto, or any special influence -- but I, myself, experienced a pretty high moral fiber. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And the ... that's what I experienced. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1316">Q: Let me ask you; what kind of work did you do in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1318">A: It was actually desk work. </sentence><sentence id="1319">There were -- we had to issue what was legitimaceje obiadove, which means -- there was a little booklet based on it. </sentence><sentence id="1320">You got a stamp that you got the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1321">It was actually a part of the administration of the ghetto, which I was working in. </sentence><sentence id="1322">And it was a job like a bookkeeper's job. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And we were issuing -- it was called legitimaceje obiadove, which means -- such a little booklet, where it was stamped whether -- when somebody got his or her soup. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And in order to be entitled to the soup, they had to have this booklet. </sentence><sentence id="1325">So that was my work in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1326">Before, I was working in the produce department doing similar work. </sentence><sentence id="1327">And then I was transferred to that department. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1338">Q: Is this where you met your future husband? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1340">A: Actually, he was the head of the office management in that department. </sentence><sentence id="1341">He was very strict. </sentence><sentence id="1342">He was the first to come -- and he was standing there -- and if somebody dared to come late -- he was just peering at that person, didn't say a word -- I don't think anybody came late anymore -- and was very much respected for -- for his, I would say, noble -- maybe yes, noble behavior and so on -- integrity -- for his integrity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1346">Q: Now, working in the food department, I would think, in a situation like the ghetto -- this is a pretty good job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1348">A: It did not entitle me to any additional food, maybe sometimes a soup. </sentence><sentence id="1349">But otherwise, I could not get anything. </sentence><sentence id="1350">In fact, I had diarrhea, and I needed some rice, and I approached my future husband, and he refused because he had his reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1351">I am not blaming him. </sentence><sentence id="1352">But it is very telling that I approached him, and he said, "No," he can not give it to me. </sentence><sentence id="1353">He had such -- such strong conviction of what he can and what he cannot do -- he wouldn't give it to me. </sentence><sentence id="1354">He wouldn't take it for himself either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1362">Q: So you had no opportunity to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1364">A: I had sometimes -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1366">Q: -- cheat a little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1368">A: I had sometimes an additional soup, which I brought and gave to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1369">But otherwise, I sometimes -- it was a time that I could -- when there were more potatoes in the ghetto, I could get a few more potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1370">Then we were actually -- the worst -- we found out that there was something growing -- I don't know exactly what it was -- it looked like spinach or something similar -- and we were gathering it, and we were cooking that. </sentence><sentence id="1371">So that was, of course -- every little bit was helpful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1376">Q: Did people come to you and try to get favors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1378">A: I was -- I wasn't the one who they knew. </sentence><sentence id="1379">So they couldn't come to me for favors, because I am not -- I don't have the means to give anybody favors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1382">Q: Were you aware of much corruption and bribery going on in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1384">A: I don't know whether I am an optimist, or I have a rosy outlook. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I knew that somebody who was working, let's say in the bakery, had more, could get some more bread. </sentence><sentence id="1386">But -- and somebody who worked in the police department could have some favors. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Somebody who worked in the Sonderkommando and had -- or helped -- was stationed in the Kriminal Polizei, in the Kripo, for sure was able to get some favors, some more nutrition, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1388">If you needed medication, you had to go to the people who were connected to the Polizei, who were either policemen, or something. </sentence><sentence id="1389">They were able to bring some, which I -- when my brother was so very sick, you know, I got some medication from them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1396">Q: How? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1398">A: I knew somebody who knows somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1399">And so, one time, I got some medication. </sentence><sentence id="1400">And that was in the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1401">In the very beginning, we had -- it was easier to get medication. </sentence><sentence id="1402">At the end, it was nearly impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And maybe, I felt that it is a matter of  fact that people who were associated with these places would have a little bit more nutrition. </sentence><sentence id="1404">But nobody lived in a beautiful apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1405">I don't think anybody -- maybe very few -- had a bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1406">They were mostly latrines. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1417">Q: There weren't -- you went outside? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1419">A: Yes, we went outside. </sentence><sentence id="1420">Most of the people were living in one room. </sentence><sentence id="1421">See, it was a part of town which was a part of town where very poor people used to live. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So you know, there were not -- I, you know -- so corruption. </sentence><sentence id="1423">By the nature -- let's say there was a Sonderkommando, who was very much in touch with the Germans -- I mean, not in touch because they were informers or something -- they were because they were supposed to be performing certain duties. </sentence><sentence id="1424">It was obvious that they had probably a little bit more food. </sentence><sentence id="1425">But all -- as I understood it, all was about food. </sentence><sentence id="1426">They couldn't have much better living conditions, because they were not available -- maybe some people did have running water and some people did not have running water. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Many people did not have running water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1437">Q: Now, you worked in the food administration. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Was this.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1441">A: A part of the food administration. </sentence><sentence id="1442">But it -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1445">Q: You worked on these coupon books for -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1447">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1449">Q: -- for people -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1451">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1453">Q: -- but your department also worked on distribution to food sitters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1455"> A No. </sentence><sentence id="1456">No, no, no, no, no, no, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1459">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1461">A: We had -- we never saw food. </sentence><sentence id="1462">We never saw food. </sentence><sentence id="1463">It was just a bookkeeping department. </sentence><sentence id="1464">I never -- no food went through -- we were a part of the so-called Aprovisation Department. </sentence><sentence id="1465">But we were the part, an administrating part, only of this -- of this coupons, coupon books, and we never saw food. </sentence><sentence id="1466">It never came to my office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1473">Q: Did everybody get coupons? </sentence><sentence id="1474">Did everybody get the same amount? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1477">A: Everybody who was working was getting a soup. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1479">Q: And people who were not working how did they get that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1481">A: There was -- see, what was happening -- there was a certain amount of food which we're getting besides the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1482">And the food, which they were getting besides the soup, they were getting. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And if they were working, they were also getting the soup. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1487">Q: How did they get this, were there soup kitchens? </sentence><sentence id="1488">I mean, how did the poor people -- people who were not working, how did they get food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1491">A: In the Distribution Centers. </sentence><sentence id="1492">They were -- everybody was entitled to a certain amount of food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1495">Q: They didn't -- they had coupons? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1497">A: It was called -- wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1498">They were called -- they were cards. </sentence><sentence id="1499">They were cards for food. </sentence><sentence id="1500">In fact, as I recall one instance after this deportation from -- when the Germans were -- came to the ghetto and took the people out -- some people who were not expecting to -- expected to be taken -- because they just were not so exact to what they were saying they were going to do -- some people took some of the bread, or whatever, cards with them, and it was a hardship for the others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1505">Q: Let me ask you a different question; do you think that women were treated differently in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1507">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1508">It happened what -- it happens even now. </sentence><sentence id="1509">The women were living longer. </sentence><sentence id="1510">I think that, physiologically, the women are equipped with -- because we are the child-bearing species -- that we have certain -- this -- what is chemistry, or there is the glands, or something -- that we can survive easier than the men, because there were more women afterwards in the ghettos than there were men. </sentence><sentence id="1511">But treatment -- I don't think that we were treated differently. </sentence><sentence id="1512">In fact, you know, in Europe, women were treated better, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1513">I mean, it depends from what point of view you are looking of course, because the man was the man of the house and the woman, you know, hair drop -- it was different. </sentence><sentence id="1514">So there were many women who were in professions. </sentence><sentence id="1515">There were women doctors. </sentence><sentence id="1516">There were women chemists. </sentence><sentence id="1517">I had a relative who was a chemist, a relative who was -- had a kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="1518">And there were many doctors. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And actually, I wanted to study biochemistry. </sentence><sentence id="1520">That was my chosen profession which, of course, never happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1535">Q: More than -- did you think that there were women who were able to use their appeal, to get favors in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1537">A: Not that I was aware of -- not that I was aware of. </sentence><sentence id="1538">If somebody, of course, worked close to the administration, there is a likelihood. </sentence><sentence id="1539">For instance, I know, when people got married, they could have asked Rumchovsky to give them -- to give them something. </sentence><sentence id="1540">But I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1541">I do not think so. </sentence><sentence id="1542">I might have not come across it. </sentence><sentence id="1543">But I don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1551">Q: So how long were you in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1553">A: Until the very, very end, until nearly the last day, because I -- I don't have a tattoo. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Because when we came, the last transports -- they were so crowded that they didn't tattoo us. </sentence><sentence id="1555">So it must have been very late in August already when we came. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And we had extra -- an extra day for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1557">What happened was that we were on the way which we didn't know is Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And we -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1565">Q: Well, how did -- but how did you even get rounded up; how did all of this happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1567">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1568">They were coming -- in the beginning, they thought we would go full of tyranny [terror]. </sentence><sentence id="1569">But people didn't go full of tyranny [terror]. </sentence><sentence id="1570">So the Germans started rounding people up. </sentence><sentence id="1571">They also came to our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1572">But we had the cellar, and we closed the shutters, and we went down there, we heard them. </sentence><sentence id="1573">They were banging with their rifles in many places. </sentence><sentence id="1574">But it was that we could pull the bed there -- and it was not usually -- I don't know whether they expected it -- but they banged it on the floor -- they did -- but they didn't bang where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1575">So we did it -- we did it whenever, which was probably very, very often -- you know, it was -- we were in the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1576">And in fact, what happened -- I have the picture of my cousin -- and his whole family was deported, and he came to us. </sentence><sentence id="1577">And unfortunately, I, my father, my brother, and Aros (ph) -- Aros must have been, maybe, seven years, or something like it -- and we don't have room for Fishek (ph) -- so -- but there was a shed. </sentence><sentence id="1578">So we said, "Fishek, we'll hide you there," and we hid Fishek there. </sentence><sentence id="1579">We got up in the morning, we looked in the shed, he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1580">So the  German took him out from there. </sentence><sentence id="1581">They were looking everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1582">They were looking everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1583">They were just -- just going through everywhere and herding people to go, herding people to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1602">Q: And this is in August, 1944? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1604">A: That was in August, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1605">And I -- this was -- like, I wish maybe -- I was thinking about hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="1606">But we didn't have any food, and we didn't know what will happen. </sentence><sentence id="1607">If we would have known where we were going, we would have probably stayed in that ca...., cellar, maybe suffocated. </sentence><sentence id="1608">But we would stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1609">Now, with the transport -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1616">Q: What happened, how did you get there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1618">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1619">So this extra day -- I have to tell you about it. </sentence><sentence id="1620">So we were on the way to this gathering place -- and August was just a beautiful month -- and we saw very close where we were supposed to be gathered. </sentence><sentence id="1621">We saw, like, a little house or something. </sentence><sentence id="1622">Anyhow, there was a guard, a German guard, in front of it. </sentence><sentence id="1623">But it wasn't a Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1624">So we said, "Can we stay there for a day?". </sentence><sentence id="1625">He said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1626">But no more." </sentence><sentence id="1627">So we took -- we took residence for a day in that room. </sentence><sentence id="1628">And I was so spoiled that, even in the ghetto, I had to have my spoon. </sentence><sentence id="1629">And we were there, and -- you know, in retrospect, you sometimes think only, "Did we survive? </sentence><sentence id="1630">We didn't survive, right? </sentence><sentence id="1631">We didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="1632">So what good was  everything?". </sentence><sentence id="1633">But no. </sentence><sentence id="1634">Maybe it's philosophical. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And since life is not forever, this one day was also important, because this was the last day that we were a family and that we were together. </sentence><sentence id="1636">Aros was with us too. </sentence><sentence id="1637">And that's why I think sometimes about this day. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And I don't want to say, "What good was it that they didn't survive?". </sentence><sentence id="1639">But they had to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And then we went. </sentence><sentence id="1641">It was the most strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="1642">I met my cousin and her mother on the ground where we were waiting to be taken away to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1643">And we stayed together, I and my cousin, until we were liberated, which was very lucky for both of us. </sentence><sentence id="1644">She claims that my spirit helped her to survive, because I was just -- when we were working in Sasel, one time, we passed by windows which were lit, and there was some kind of a holiday, and she mentions to me, "Look, we will never live like that." </sentence><sentence id="1645">I said, "What do you mean, Renya? </sentence><sentence id="1646">Why not? </sentence><sentence id="1647">Of course, we'll live like that." </sentence><sentence id="1648">And she always repeats it. </sentence><sentence id="1649">And I think that it was the defiance, the defiance. </sentence><sentence id="1650">I just wanted to defy the Germans, because I went to Auschwitz with pleurisy, which is water of the lungs. </sentence><sentence id="1651">I had a bladder infection. </sentence><sentence id="1652">I was very sick before we went to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And when I was lying down naked on the ground in Auschwitz -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1703">Q: I just want to backtrack a minute because -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1705">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1707">Q: -- I want you to tell me a little bit about how things were organized in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1709">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1710">Since I wasn't -- I was in a very, very small -- my job was administrative. </sentence><sentence id="1711">But I had nothing to do with food, I had nothing to do with distribution of food, or anything of this kind. </sentence><sentence id="1712">So I wasn't so close to the administration. </sentence><sentence id="1713">But as a person who lived in the ghetto from the very beginning to the very end, my assessment is that so it was hunger, so there was deportation, so there were tragedies -- but there was -- somehow, we knew what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1714">There were hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Nobody came back from a hospital with contagious diseases. </sentence><sentence id="1716">That's another story. </sentence><sentence id="1717">But there were hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="1718">There were hospitals also where children could go. </sentence><sentence id="1719">There were hospitals where people -- if some -- if there was a birth that they could go. </sentence><sentence id="1720">There was certain civil safety. </sentence><sentence id="1721">I mean, we were not afraid that somebody would come into our house and rob us. </sentence><sentence id="1722">There were very -- of course, some of the criminals were included in the early deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1723">That's true. </sentence><sentence id="1724">There were prisons. </sentence><sentence id="1725">There was a court. </sentence><sentence id="1726">There were judges. </sentence><sentence id="1727">There was a prosecutor. </sentence><sentence id="1728">They had names of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1729">They knew where everybody was living. </sentence><sentence id="1730">There was a Department of Statistics. </sentence><sentence id="1731">There was a Department of Distribution of Food. </sentence><sentence id="1732">And within this department was the Department of Produce. </sentence><sentence id="1733">It was a department where they distributed flowers. </sentence><sentence id="1734">There was a Department of Bakeries. </sentence><sentence id="1735">Now, there was milk and coffee. </sentence><sentence id="1736">I mean, they knew exactly about how many people we had. </sentence><sentence id="1737">I think that could have changed after one of the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1738">But they knew. </sentence><sentence id="1739">They knew about who has an apartment, or  whether there is an empty apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1740">They knew who had died. </sentence><sentence id="1741">So it was in this tragic conditions there was something that -- we, for instance, knew that there would be a deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1742">We, for instance -- besides, there were many rumors which, sometimes, were not true. </sentence><sentence id="1743">Very often, Rumchovsky had speeches and prepared us for certain things, certain changes, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1744">They were an instrument -- in the beginning, Rabbis were performing ceremonies, if somebody, you know, got married. </sentence><sentence id="1745">There were circumcisions performed. </sentence><sentence id="1746">Later on, when they -- when the Germans didn't allow it, Rumchovsky was the one who married people. </sentence><sentence id="1747">So for a very short time, there was even something, like -- on the marichian (ph) was something like a reserve for people who worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And one time, my brother had the privilege, and I took him there. </sentence><sentence id="1749">And that was in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1750">The ghetto became more and more less run by the Jewish administration, and the Germans had more of a part. </sentence><sentence id="1751">But this was at the time when Jews had more to say about administration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1796">Q: Was this -- do you think that this was positive that Rumchovsky and the Jewish Consul had so much control over your lives? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1798">A: Considering the alternative, because if they would not be an order, if there wouldn't be order, if there would be dead people lying all over, if there would be a lot of crime, I believe the German wouldn't go for it, they would just close the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1800">Q: So you thought he was a pretty good man? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1802">A: I -- besides that I saw him, I never met the man. </sentence><sentence id="1803">But I'm, what I'm thinking -- in this abnormal condition, with enormous pressure of the German from the outside, with the population probably being very often not very happy with whats going on, to have this kind of an administration -- so that since we're taken care of, no matter -- no matter what, I think that people who survive the ghetto, if not for this kind of an administration, would not survive it until August the 25, 1944, because the ghetto would have been closed. </sentence><sentence id="1804">And if this workshops, would not be administered, administrated the way they are, they were they were, the ghetto would have been closed also much sooner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1808">Q: What workshops are you talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1810">A: The workshops for the Germans, the workshops -- like, there was a leather workshop, and there was -- there were all kinds of workshops which -- for which, you know, they were paid, and they could use the money to buy the food, and so on and so on, and -- I mean, the administration -- the administration, not individuals -- everything, the administration. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1811">Now, you know, when you think today what's going on in certain countries, that, under this awful circumstances, they had an administration who had everything in check, they had powers -- of course, they had -- if they wouldn't have the powers, there would be wars there. </sentence><sentence id="1812">Because if somebody wouldn't get enough food or something, no matter whose fault, people would rebel. </sentence><sentence id="1813">But there were no rebellions. </sentence><sentence id="1814">Anyhow -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1815">  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1816"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1817">Q: Did you get paid for your work? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1818">A: Not -- no. </sentence><sentence id="1819">Whether I got -- okay. </sentence><sentence id="1820">But -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1821">Q: Allright. </sentence><sentence id="1822">Why don't we pick up again where you were at the train -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1823">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1859">A: -- and she would -- took care of me when I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1860">I took care of my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1861">And she never complained. </sentence><sentence id="1862">And we went into this cattle wagon with all these packages, which they deceitfully told us to pack, and she was sitting on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1863">I can sit on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1864">It doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="1865">But my mother sitting on this floor and being so unhappy -- it just broke my heart. </sentence><sentence id="1866">And aI said, she never complained. </sentence><sentence id="1867">And it was so embarrassing. </sentence><sentence id="1868">It was -- I mean -- and there was a little window in that cattle wagon, and people were trying to look whether we are going. </sentence><sentence id="1869">And, as | said before, the day was absolutely gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. </sentence><sentence id="1870">And here, she was, poor -- my poor mother was sitting on the floor and -- I'm not sure -- it must have been the air there -- and I don't know what happened to the excrements -- I think there was some kind of an opening or something. </sentence><sentence id="1871">Anyhow, then  they slid the door open from the wagon, and we came out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1886">Q: How long had you been riding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1888">A: I do not recall exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1889">I was just from Lodz to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1890">From far away, it looked like a place for the insane, because there was some wire around it and there were people running back and forth, back and forth, with shaven heads. </sentence><sentence id="1891">And here, we had to come out, leave everything in the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="1892">And then they told us to go to the left, to go to the right. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And there was one Oberscharffuhrer at the head, closer to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1894">And he said to my mother to go to the left, and I went to the right. </sentence><sentence id="1895">And not knowing, really, the depth of that tragedy, I still felt that it means that I'll go to work and she won't. </sentence><sentence id="1896">So I run up to the Oberscharffuhrer, and I said, " Meine Mutter kann arbeiten viel besser wie ich," which was true, that she can work much better than I can. </sentence><sentence id="1897">So he said," Du willst, sie schon sehen im abend, " that I would see her in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="1898">There were very deceitful, very -- I mean, that this deceit was the smallest deceit -- I mean, because the one which they did to get us out of the ghetto was a much greater deceit. </sentence><sentence id="1899">Now, I was with my cousin and her mother, Tess (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1900">She had lighter hair. </sentence><sentence id="1901">My mother was already, partially gray. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And we went in, and there was a second selection. </sentence><sentence id="1903">We were supposed to completely disrobe, which we did of course -- we didn't have any other choice -- and that we will go to the showers and -- there was something round -- and I was close to my cousin and her mother -- and all of a sudden, they took her mother out. </sentence><sentence id="1904">It was a second selection. </sentence><sentence id="1905">Of course, when she was undressed, they realized she is not in her 20s or 30s. </sentence><sentence id="1906">In fact, only one mother went with us, a Mrs. Kohn (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1907">And what she went through in the camps -- she was lashed and whipped so many times. </sentence><sentence id="1908">But that's another story. </sentence><sentence id="1909">Then we, from there, there was -- they shaved our hair -- and I had long brown hair -- and my  cousin, Renya, said, "You know, I couldn't recognize you" -- so I was calling, " Tusa, tusa " -- and so I came out and she saw me -- and they shaved our heads -- and we were naked -- and we were supposed to lie down someplace on the ground to sleep overnight, which we did. </sentence><sentence id="1910">Everything seemed completely insane. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And miraculously, I awoke, I didn't have my bladder infection. </sentence><sentence id="1912">Then we were given some shoes, and I was given some shoes which had my foot, and we were given some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And then I remember Auschwitz, I remember we were standing, one time, in line and I had some container with some -- what was supposed to be soup -- and it was all, like, in a maze, what was happening, what has happened, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="1914">And what I see someplace, a sign, " Arbeit Macht Frei." </sentence><sentence id="1915">That was the sign in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And fortunately, we were there only a few days. </sentence><sentence id="1917">And everything seems like a very, very bad dream. </sentence><sentence id="1918">And they were telling us that going out of Auschwitz to a working camp is a rather fortunate occurrence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1951">Q: Who was telling you that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1953">A: It must have been some other person -- people who were already -- have been there in Auschwitz longer. </sentence><sentence id="1954">Some of them were incarcerated people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1963">A: Who were there before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1965">Q: What else did you observe while you were there in those few days? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1967">A: The first impression was that it was some gathering of insane people. </sentence><sentence id="1968">They just didn't look normal. </sentence><sentence id="1969">They absolutely didn't look normal. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Their movement didn't -- wasn't normal. </sentence><sentence id="1971">That was my first impression when I went out of the wagon, and I looked to my left, to my left and -- because we went out of the wagon, and then we were standing facing this Oberscharffuhrer here. </sentence><sentence id="1972">So then I was on the left side -- I mean, I was on the -- my mother was on the left, and I was on the right. </sentence><sentence id="1973">So -- and then, as I said, it was like a -- like a bad, bad dream, the whole thing -- it was so unbelievable, the movement of the people, everything there. </sentence><sentence id="1974">When I think about Auschwitz, I just remember, like, fragments because it was such an enormous shock. </sentence><sentence id="1975">It was an enormous shock for, for me. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And they took my mother away, and my father, and my -- and Aros and Lolick were also taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1977">I didn't know where they will be going. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And I didn't realize what actually happened to my mother for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1979">Because, from there, we went to another camp. </sentence><sentence id="1980">My leg started swelling up. </sentence><sentence id="1981">And we went to a camp in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="1982">There, we were supposed to be laying railroad tracks. </sentence><sentence id="1983">And there were German woman, women who were our -- I don't know -- they were called Kapo. </sentence><sentence id="1984">And in the morning, very early in the morning, we have to stand in line. </sentence><sentence id="1985">And there was a German SS, and he was pointing out who's going and who's staying. </sentence><sentence id="1986">In the beginning, I went. </sentence><sentence id="1987">And in this camp, there was a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1988">In most camps, there was a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1989">They wanted to have us, on one hand, probably, fit, and on the other hand if not, eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="1990">So this -- this doctor -- I ask her whether I still have water on the lung. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And she said, "Yes, you have." </sentence><sentence id="1992">And I had a cut  on my leg. </sentence><sentence id="1993">So she put a very large bandage on my leg. </sentence><sentence id="1994">And it so happened that, after I had the bandage, in the morning, she, for a short time, pointed out for me to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1995">Now, you were asking whether I realized what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1996">So what actually -- when I started going to work, it was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1997">It was very hard, to me, to climb on the wagon because my legs were so swollen. </sentence><sentence id="1998">But since it was very early, there were stars in the heaven, and I prayed. </sentence><sentence id="1999">So I prayed for my parents, and for Lolick, and for myself. </sentence><sentence id="2000">But -- so at this time, I had no inkling what, actually, is happening to them, absolutely no inkling. </sentence><sentence id="2001">And then we were in Hamburg for quite a while. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2038">Q: What was the name of this camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2050">Q: How long were you there for? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2052">A: It wasn't a very long time. </sentence><sentence id="2053">But it was more than a month. </sentence><sentence id="2054">From there, we were transported to Sasel. </sentence><sentence id="2055">And I, as much as it was, the conditions were not good -- this camp was situated in a very woody area. </sentence><sentence id="2056">And I am very sensitive to good air. </sentence><sentence id="2057">And also, when we came there, there were always accommodations that the doctor -- there was a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2058"> So when people came from work, they could come there. </sentence><sentence id="2059">It was called the ambulance. </sentence><sentence id="2060">Actually, it's like an infirmary. </sentence><sentence id="2061">And I approached this doctor and I asked her whether I could work for her. </sentence><sentence id="2062">And she says -- so she had chosen me to work for her. </sentence><sentence id="2063">That also allowed me to recuperate somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="2064">I had to work, I had to wash the floors, which no big deal. </sentence><sentence id="2065">It was a big deal for me then because, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2066">But anyhow -- and when people were coming, I was greeting them, I was taking reports, and I got -- they were saying that I am very polite and friendly to everybody and -- now, this doctor wanted me to sleep with her -- she was afraid to sleep by herself -- which I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2522">Q: Do you remember when this was? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2546">A: Probably, the screams, and they probably walked in, and we probably saw the uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2547">But I know as much as later on, at that point, there was no happiness. </sentence><sentence id="2548">Because after Bergen-Belsen, I -- I knew, that my parents didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="2549">And there was absolutely you know, maybe, seeing all these corpses, and I mean, you couldn't be happy about anything. </sentence><sentence id="2550">I wasn't happy. </sentence><sentence id="2551">However, once we were transferred to some human quarters, and I wanted to look for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="2552">He was in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="2553">But he didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="2554">And I do not know why. </sentence><sentence id="2555">And I was sure that Aros would survive, because he was such a tough young, young boy. </sentence><sentence id="2556">I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="2557">I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2558">There's no way to find out anything right. </sentence><sentence id="2559">I talked to people who knew my brother in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="2560">And that's why I didn't stay long in Bergen-Belsen -- I mean, not -- this camp in prison -- but liberated Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="2561">But I went to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="2562">I got some clothes there. </sentence><sentence id="2563">I don't know how I did it. </sentence><sentence id="2564">And then I went to Hanover, because it was where I was asking everybody -- I was inquiring whether anybody saw Lolick, and whether they know, and maybe he registered someplace or something. </sentence><sentence id="2565">But, he did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="2566">He did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="2567">And so everybody, everybody from this enormous family was tortured, starved, gassed. </sentence><sentence id="2568">And there is a story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2695">Q: Hanover. </sentence><sentence id="2696">Sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2699">A: We actually stayed there for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="2700">We also were in Frankfurt for a while. </sentence><sentence id="2701">And yes, the reason we stayed so long in Germany was we wanted to leave Germany as soon as possible. </sentence><sentence id="2702">There were too many memories and you never knew to whom you're talking. </sentence><sentence id="2703">Because if they told you that they always were buying into your stores -- or something     like that -- then you know: "Watch out." </sentence><sentence id="2704">Then we didn't want to -- but anyhow, Dave had a sister in the United States, in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2705">So actually, they were doing something to send us status. </sentence><sentence id="2706">However, I had no pleurisy in the ghetto and also in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2707">And so I didn't have the pleurisy when I was liberated just miraculously. </sentence><sentence id="2708">On an x-rays, there were shadows. </sentence><sentence id="2709">And the United States, very rightfully, didn't want to let people in with tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="2710">They would have let somebody in with pleurisy, because it's not contagious. </sentence><sentence id="2711">So I had a very hard time, to, until they declared me. </sentence><sentence id="2712">It took a long time because -- we came here in 1950, liberated in 1945 -- until I got a clearing that I can go. </sentence><sentence id="2713">And that's why it took so long for us to come here to the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2730">Q: So you and David got together pretty soon in Hanover? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2732">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2733">Well, we got married in 1946, March 16th. </sentence><sentence id="2734">And you know, the lady in whose house we lived, who we met afterwards -- she just couldn't believe it, that we got married. </sentence><sentence id="2735">You see, there is a big age difference between David and me. </sentence><sentence id="2736">But it really -- he's -- I mean, he's a young man. </sentence><sentence id="2737">So he now believes that he's -- am I on tape still? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2744">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2746">A: Oh! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2748">Q: You know, one thing that's confusing to me -- I've never heard this before about both you and your husband -- is -- I didn't realize, that you were sort of operating with German authorities, as opposed to with British -- the British military Government or the American military Government. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2750">A: Allright. </sentence><sentence id="2751">Now, we got the British Government -- and that was a UNRR, UNRR -- they were also helping. </sentence><sentence id="2752">Now, I don't know whether KZ Ausschussz was later. </sentence><sentence id="2753">Formed later. </sentence><sentence id="2754">I would have to check with Dave exactly where it was -- where it was formed. </sentence><sentence id="2755">Because in the very beginning -- I have a picture with La Guardia. </sentence><sentence id="2756">And yes, in the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2757">This happened later. </sentence><sentence id="2758">That's what -- what we are telling you about the KZ Ausschuss. </sentence><sentence id="2759">It didn't happen immediately after the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2760">It didn't happen immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2761">Because at this time, we were being sent supplies from the United States to the UNRR, and La Guardia came, and, since I was involved in with the distribution center of the food -- but this was food given directly to people -- and La Guardia came -- and there's a picture of him with me -- he was so shocked when we were telling him what was actually happening. </sentence><sentence id="2762">So in the very beginning, there were not so -- the people started coming, you know -- more and more people started coming. </sentence><sentence id="2763">And then when -- that's how, that's how I remember it -- because in the beginning, we weren't old. </sentence><sentence id="2764">That was -- the beginning, we were on Auerstrasse (ph), and food was coming, yes, to the UNRR. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2788">A: We wanted to keep our sanity. </sentence><sentence id="2789">So when we were digging this foundations in Sasel, we were doing some algebraic in the sand. </sentence><sentence id="2790">We were doing square roots, when we had a little bit of time. </sentence><sentence id="2791">And um.... See, we were going to the same school. </sentence><sentence id="2792">She's a little -- she was a little -- in a little bit older class than I. So this, we remembered. </sentence><sentence id="2793">That we had a little bit free time, and we were were doing the algebretical roots. </sentence><sentence id="2794">So you know to keep the sanity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2802">Q: Did you think about religion at all; did you pray? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2804">A: I never stopped praying -- I think that I never stopped praying. </sentence><sentence id="2805">I do not pray -- I mean, I change the way I pray. </sentence><sentence id="2806">Very frequently, and I pray with my own words. </sentence><sentence id="2807">But I don't think -- I might not have prayed in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="2808">I might not have prayed. </sentence><sentence id="2809">But I prayed in Hamburg, because I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="2810">And, I don't know whether it is, has something to do with my upbringing, or whether it has something to do with my spirituality. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And I think that we have certain powers. </sentence><sentence id="2812">Maybe powers is too strong a word. </sentence><sentence id="2813">But we were -- in the worst of times even, we have some abilities. </sentence><sentence id="2814">Not in Auschwitz maybe. </sentence><sentence id="2815">Not in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="2816">But we have some abilities. </sentence><sentence id="2817">We have -- and I think they are, maybe -- you could say they are God-given. </sentence><sentence id="2818">And so I keep praying. </sentence><sentence id="2819">I keep praying. </sentence><sentence id="2820">I keep -- actually, my way of praying is, if this is important, a way of  thanking God for what I want to have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2839">Q: Let me ask you one more question. </sentence><sentence id="2840">And if there's anything you want to add. </sentence><sentence id="2841">Have you thought about what sort of long-term impact these experiences have had on you, and, and have influenced the way you are today? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2845">A: It is absolutely miraculous. </sentence><sentence id="2846">I went, in the very beginning, after in Germany, through some times which I was very -- I may be depressed, nervous, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2847">It's likely that, having been blessed with two sons and two daughter-in-laws and four grandchildren, and having worked also on my physical and emotional health through things like yoga and others, I am, actually right now, in a very good, very good place emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="2848">Because I could talk about it and I could -- when my husband was testifying at UCLA [University California-Los Angeles], there's no way I was able to testify. </sentence><sentence id="2849">It still -- when I think about it, even about testifying, especially about the ghetto, I was having butterflies in my stomach. </sentence><sentence id="2850">However -- and I cannot watch any -- anything on television about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2851">And when I watched the first time when there was a Holocaust story, I was sick for quite a long time because I have a visual memory. </sentence><sentence id="2852">And when I hear something, it doesn't affect me so much. </sentence><sentence id="2853">But when I saw it, I cannot see it. </sentence><sentence id="2854">I cannot see. </sentence><sentence id="2855">And I try -- since I don't do any good to anybody and I have my responsibilities -- so I try not to look. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2867">Q: Can you think of how -- could you talk about it after the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2869">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2871">Q: It took you a while? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2873">A: Yes, we couldn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2874">In the beginning, we just could not talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2875">And I couldn't talk about it for quite a long time. </sentence><sentence id="2876">And, my son was always -- when I started talking quite recently, he was, was, like -- in a way, he was pleased that I talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2877">He'd be very surprised that I was able to testify, with pretty much of a composure, because I -- Dave was talking -- my husband -- I couldn't -- I was always, want to protect everybody from everything. </sentence><sentence id="2878">Now, I have a little number which I was wearing in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2879">And my granddaughter wants it, she said, "Don't give it to anybody," she wants it -- so probably -- I will show it to you -- probably when she will ever eventually give to the Holocaust Museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2887">Q: Can you think of any other way that these experiences have affected the way you've lived for the last 50 years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2889">A: What really affected me is my upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="2890">I was brought up to respect elderly people -- and I don't forget that I am one of them right now -- I was taught to be honest. </sentence><sentence id="2891">I was taught that you're supposed to be charitable. </sentence><sentence id="2892">We never were taught to hate. </sentence><sentence id="2893">And I think it's not so much the experience. </sentence><sentence id="2894">But the way I was brought up, there are certain things I just would not do. </sentence><sentence id="2895">I wouldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2896">Because this period of time -- of course, it is a big -- it's not a void -- a hurt -- my main concern is actually whether when my -- especially, my mother -- my father, of course, too -- when they went into this gas chambers, whether --  hopefully, they didn't suffer too much -- that is my very, very important concern. </sentence><sentence id="2897">And I do not want to investigate too much. </sentence><sentence id="2898">Because I don't off -- on the one hand, in the beginning, I was hoping it was instantaneous. </sentence><sentence id="2899">But I understand it was not instantaneous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
