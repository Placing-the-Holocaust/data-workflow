<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Tell us a little bit about your childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father at that time had these vending machines that were in the subways and elevators. </sentence><sentence id="12">It was quite a nice business. </sentence><sentence id="13">But when World War II came along, they couldn't get sugar. </sentence><sentence id="14">So he had to let the business go, and we moved to Detroit. </sentence><sentence id="15">In Detroit my dad became a businessman and opened up a laundry. </sentence><sentence id="16">From there on I spent the rest of my life so far in that particular Detroit, Michigan. </sentence><sentence id="17">Now, during the childhood the things I can remember, the things that stick out, is that as a child my mother had my brother and I sitting on her lap on a windowsill on Fifth Avenue watching the parade coming back from the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="18">I also had the pleasure of riding in one of the last horse-and-buggy street cars of New York. </sentence><sentence id="19">Then the next thing of memory is when I was 12 years old I started taking piano lessons, and when I was 14 I started playing square dances professionally with a fiddle player, violin player. </sentence><sentence id="20">Square dance people prefer to call themselves fiddle players. </sentence><sentence id="21">Then I went to the public school system in Detroit and graduated from high school after I dropped out of school when I was in eleventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="22">When I dropped out, I got interested in music again and went into Vaudeville for a period of about three, four months. </sentence><sentence id="23">And when I came back, I had a good friend who talked me into going back to school, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="24">And he enrolled me into the Castech (phonetic), which is one of the schools that was set aside for advanced students. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was fortunate because my friend happened to be the director of the Board of Education at that time. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I went through the school system of Detroit, Michigan. </sentence><sentence id="27">Went to Castech. </sentence><sentence id="28">Then went to Wayne University in Detroit and continued my education into the medical field. </sentence><sentence id="29">Premedics was at Wayne University. </sentence><sentence id="30">Medics was at Wayne University. </sentence><sentence id="31">I graduated from Wayne as a doctor and immediately after spending a short period of internship became a member in the United States Army as a first lieutenant. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: 1942. </sentence><sentence id="56">And then I had my internship, and I started residency. </sentence><sentence id="57">And from the residency I was drafted and ended up in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="58">Went in training at a field hospital. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Did you specialize in anything at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: At that time I was in surgery. </sentence><sentence id="78">I was a resident in surgery, and I continued that. </sentence><sentence id="79">When I was in the Army, I was placed in the hospital as a surgeon for the 170 VAC hospital. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Where was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: At that time it was just being organized. </sentence><sentence id="86">We were the youngest group of enlisted men. </sentence><sentence id="87">The doctors were quite young. </sentence><sentence id="88">It was more like an experimental hospital for the Army because they used to always hire -- not hire -- but place people of 35 or older in hospitals and save the young fellows for the infantry and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="89">So we were quite a young group in general. </sentence><sentence id="90">From there we went overseas in March. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: March of "43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="100">And ended up in Belfast, Ireland, our first stop. </sentence><sentence id="101">We were training our enlisted men for hospital duty in the hospital and were getting acquainted with the materials that we had to use when we were on the battlefield. </sentence><sentence id="102">The training would be every day. </sentence><sentence id="103">The enlisted men would have classes and would actually practice on each other to develop their techniques. </sentence><sentence id="104">From there we moved to Denby (phonetic), which was in North Ireland -- North England. </sentence><sentence id="105">And Denby, England -- we were there again training waiting for the invasion to occur. </sentence><sentence id="106">The invasion came, of course, on the 4th of June I think it is. </sentence><sentence id="107">The exact date I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="108">But we were scheduled to go behind the Army and over to France in July, the first of July. </sentence><sentence id="109">And that's when we went across the English Channel and into the French territory. </sentence><sentence id="110">From there we were placed at first with the first Army, who was at the beachhead wiping up the remains of pockets -- the remaining pockets of Germans that were left behind. </sentence><sentence id="111">It was the policy at that time for the Army to move forward as fast as it can and not try to destroy all the Germans as we go but bypass them and let the infantry come in and finish up the work that we started. </sentence><sentence id="112">That's when we first started seeing patients in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="113">From there we followed to the third Army with Patton, and this was in France. </sentence><sentence id="114">The first place was a beachhead. </sentence><sentence id="115">The second place was the base of the Brest peninsula, and the third place we went to -- and this was in a matter of less than a month or so -- was Crosan (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="116">which was a little bit north of Brest. </sentence><sentence id="117">As I said, we were with Patton, and we were transferred to the 9th Amny at that time. </sentence><sentence id="118">And then we finally came back and went back to Patton, and we followed them clear -- one of the hospital units that followed him clear across Europe until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="119">We were in all the major battles at Brest and Grodan (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="120">And then we got involved in the Bastogne, which was where the battle of the Bulge was. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were the only hospital functioning in the Bulge proper at the time, to our knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="122">We didn't know of any other hospital at that time. </sentence><sentence id="123">In fact, our hospital was listed as being missing because the communication was so bad during the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="124">During that time we worked as much as 12 hours every day anyway, but I can remember that I saw 28 -- did 28 operations in those 12 hours we were so busy. </sentence><sentence id="125">As for the surgeons in the unit, we spent most of the time in the hospital doing surgery. </sentence><sentence id="126">Very little time to explore too much around the area. </sentence><sentence id="127">And we were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="128">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="129"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection always kept busy because we were behind Mr. Blood and Guts, Patton, and he moved fast. </sentence><sentence id="130">From there we went on and ended up in Regensburg when the peace came, when it was declared, armistice was declared. </sentence><sentence id="131">And it moved back to Wurzburg where we at that time started to disband the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="132">I came back to the States in 19 -- in fact, I arrived back in the States New Year's of 1946. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Let's just back up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="170">Let's trace some of the things that you commented on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="174">During that trip across the continent of Europe, we came very close to a city called Weimar (phonetic) I think was the name. </sentence><sentence id="175">And I was sent on a mission by the colonel to Weimar. </sentence><sentence id="176">And in the course of conversation with a police officer in a police station, he told me that the Germans had just left Buchenwald, a concentration camp that was based in Germany in one of the most -- one of the larger ones and most famous for the various things that they did and the cruelty that left a mark on people for life. </sentence><sentence id="177">He gave me directions as to how to go to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="178">He told me it was a five-mile route, and he showed me the road. </sentence><sentence id="179">I got in a Jeep with my driver. </sentence><sentence id="180">We went out to see what we could see. </sentence><sentence id="181">I'll tell you the story of that. </sentence><sentence id="182">It was riding through a countryside which was green and very interesting in itself, and we came upon the gates of Buchenwald. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: How long a ride was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: It was five miles. </sentence><sentence id="196">So I would say probably about 20 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="197">Not too much of a ride from Weimar. </sentence><sentence id="198">In fact, it couldn't be too much of a ride because part of the story -- the prisoners would be paraded down the same road into Weimar on weekends and paraded through the city where people would throw garbage and everything else on them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Did you have any particular thoughts on that ride out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: At the time riding out I didn't know what I was going to see. </sentence><sentence id="206">We had heard all sort of rumors of the various concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="207">We had taken care of our own soldiers who happened to be captured at the Bulge and came back to the unit after we overran the Germans, and the average -- of our own soldiers -- the average weight they would lose would be 38 pounds in a matter of two and a half months. </sentence><sentence id="208">And they would tell us the stories that they had, and we thought that was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="209">But we found out that it wasn't nearly as bad as what happened in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="210">When I walked into the gates of Buchenwald, there weren't any other soldiers in Buchenwald at that time, and I felt that I was probably the first one through the gates. </sentence><sentence id="211">The odd part about it -- the prisoners were walking around. </sentence><sentence id="212">The gates were wide open. </sentence><sentence id="213">The prisoners were walking around in groups and talking, but I couldn't understand why there was no American soldiers or anybody who would guard the gates or anything. </sentence><sentence id="214">They were wide open. </sentence><sentence id="215">Later on I found out that what had happened is that the SS troopers who were running the camp fled from the camp on April 11th, and the underground which was in existence in Buchenwald, in and about Buchenwald, took over the camp with the help of the prisoners and started straightening out the camp before the American soldiers even arrived, which was a day or two later. </sentence><sentence id="216">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="217">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="218"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: What did you see at the gates when you pulled up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: When we pulled up, there was a big emblem on the top of the gate which stated -- and the words might be not exactly right -- but it said, "You enter through the gates, and you leave by the way of the furnace" or chimney. " </sentence><sentence id="236">Chimney" is the word they used. </sentence><sentence id="237">That was there in German in a great big emblem. </sentence><sentence id="238">It was very prominently in a spot where you couldn't help from seeing the emblem. </sentence><sentence id="239">Then when you walked into the gate in front of me -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: The gate was open? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: The gate was open, and prisoners were walking in and out freely. </sentence><sentence id="248">No resistance. </sentence><sentence id="249">Nobody checking them or anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Now, how long was that after the liberation of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: How long after the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Liberation of the camp did you go in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: The SS troopers left on April 11th. </sentence><sentence id="260">This must have been either the 13th or the 12th -- the 13th -- that I was there. </sentence><sentence id="261">I can't remember the exact date because when we were working like we did, we didn't even know what date it was sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="262">In the hospital we didn't keep track. </sentence><sentence id="263">But it was that time. </sentence><sentence id="264">I have it on the chart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Did your driver stay with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: The driver was with me. </sentence><sentence id="274">It's customary that -- I was a captain at that time, and it's customary that officers didn't drive a vehicle. </sentence><sentence id="275">We had always a driver to drive us, and he also entered the camp with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: You walked in on foot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: We drove up there in the Jeep and left it outside of the first gate or right inside of the first gate and walked from there on. </sentence><sentence id="282">Right in front of us was three barracks. </sentence><sentence id="283">Quite large. </sentence><sentence id="284">Went up about three to four floors in height. </sentence><sentence id="285">And they were stationed one next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="286">And I remember walking up to the -- the first two you couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="287">They were locked. </sentence><sentence id="288">The doors were locked. </sentence><sentence id="289">There was nobody walking with me. </sentence><sentence id="290">Nobody to stop me or prevent me from doing anything I wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="291">And my purpose was to see as much as I could and try to see what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="292">But the third barracks was open, and I have taken pictures of that, which we'll probably show later on. </sentence><sentence id="293">And I had the opportunity to talk to the prisoners in the barracks, and some of the stories that I'll tell you are from what the prisoners have told me. </sentence><sentence id="294">We had a pretty good idea before I went in there from our stories that we got out of our own soldiers and the prisoners that we took about things that were happening in these camps, but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="295">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="296"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection until you actually see them, it's hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="297">In fact, when I came out of the Army, I didn't talk to anybody or even take all the things I had put in my locker and so forth that I'd brought back with me for over 46 years until now because it's nothing that you like to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="298">Besides that when you start telling the story, the people -- they look at you, and they say, oh -- they have the look that we really can't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="299">Well, the same ideas went through our head when we were looking at it. </sentence><sentence id="300">How can you believe this? </sentence><sentence id="301">After I got through visiting the first camp and talking to the men, they would -- when the camp became crowded -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Let's back up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="326">You were looking into the barracks, and what did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: Well, there were these little bunks that they had. </sentence><sentence id="330">They were about six-by-four's. </sentence><sentence id="331">And they were originally made -- and part of this comes from the prisoners themselves -- they were originally made for four people to sleep in. </sentence><sentence id="332">And there were three decks going up of these bunks the length of the barracks on both sides of the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="333">And when the camp got crowded, they'd double up. </sentence><sentence id="334">And sometimes they had as many as twelve men in a place that would sleep three. </sentence><sentence id="335">And the sanitary conditions were terrible, and the stories that the prisoners told is how these people would get sick and have dysentery or so and would not be able even to go to the corner of the building or so -- wherever they could go -- and they couldn't even get out of bed. </sentence><sentence id="336">So whatever they had to do they did, and from the top it just drained right down to the prisoners below. </sentence><sentence id="337">My impression at that time after I left that was that these barracks were probably the very last barracks the prisoner would be put in before they would be put to death in the furnaces or other means. </sentence><sentence id="338">Many of them died from disease. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Were there people in the barracks -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: There were many people in the barracks that I spoke to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: What -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: There were at least five or six in one of my camera shots. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: How did you speak to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: The prisoners that were in the barracks wouldn't give you an idea of what happened to the other two barracks because they were the most recent prisoners, and they looked like they were still well fed. </sentence><sentence id="360">They were entirely different than what was remaining in the other two barracks, which we couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="361">But we know about them because we got the story back that they had to close those doors because they couldn't leave these people walk around. </sentence><sentence id="362">They were infected with all sort of diseases, dysentery, and many of them were in the last stages. </sentence><sentence id="363">You couldn't do anything for them anyway. </sentence><sentence id="364">So they locked the doors on them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: How did you communicate to the prisoners you talked to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Well, that's the interesting part. </sentence><sentence id="374">It's amazing how many Germans were able to speak English. </sentence><sentence id="375">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="376">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="377"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Then you find out that in Germany part of the school system teaches the children when they're in the third, fourth grade -- they start them on three languages -- German, French and English. </sentence><sentence id="378">And this is part of their educational system. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: How large was the barracks when you went in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How large was the barracks when you went into them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: Let me see if I can estimate. </sentence><sentence id="393">32 by -- they were much larger than 60 -- I'm thinking of a telephone pole, which are usually 32 feet. </sentence><sentence id="394">They were much larger than 60 or 75 feet in length, and in width I would say about 40 feet or so, each barrack. </sentence><sentence id="395">I didn't have an opportunity to count the amount of cubes that were in there, but that would be my estimate -- what I would estimate them to be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: What was the response of the prisoners to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: It seemed they were unusually quiet. </sentence><sentence id="403">They didn't react in a normal way, and I got the feeling they were afraid that tomorrow the Americans would be driven out and the Germans would be coming back. </sentence><sentence id="404">So they sort of didn't speak too much. </sentence><sentence id="405">You practically had to force them to give you answers sometimes by talking to them and sort of getting answers from them. </sentence><sentence id="406">But that was the feeling I had because they didn't -- even when I walked through the camp, they didn't even bother to look up to see who was coming. </sentence><sentence id="407">So that the feeling I had is that they all had -- frankly, one of them said that, "We don't know how long you're going to be here." </sentence><sentence id="408">They were afraid that the Germans might return, and that was the impression I received. </sentence><sentence id="409">But the funniest thing -- not the funniest but one of the most memorable parts of that particular time that I walked through these barracks, walked around the barracks -- I was walking in back of the barracks just to see what was back there. </sentence><sentence id="410">And as I walked by, a little window that probably was about one foot square or thereabouts -- I heard a voice, and I turned around and I saw a living skeleton talk to me, was talking to me, and he said, "Thank God the Americans have come." </sentence><sentence id="411">And that was a funny feeling. </sentence><sentence id="412">Did you ever talk to a skeleton that talked back?And that's what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="413">Later on I saw mounds of these living -- I mean these skeletons that the Germans left behind them. </sentence><sentence id="414">That brings back the story that when the prisoners -- when the SS troopers left, the underground took over, as I said, and they cleaned up a lot of the things. </sentence><sentence id="415">So that didn't exist very long. </sentence><sentence id="416">When I left those barracks, I went up to the administration building, which was closer to the front of the camp itself, Buchenwald, and then talked to several of the prisoners there and one in particular who had a specimen bowl that we usually use in labs -- glass specimen bowl that was about -- oh, I'd say about ten inches high and about four inches wide. </sentence><sentence id="417">And in there was three sections of skin that had tattoos on them in this vase which was saturated in a liquid of preservative. </sentence><sentence id="418">And the prisoner told me -- and he held it up for me to take a picture of -- he told me when the prisoners would first come into the camp, they would be lined up. </sentence><sentence id="419">And the Commander's wife would walk down the line, and wherever she saw anybody with a tattoo she would point to them, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="420">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="421"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and that was the last they saw of the prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="422">And this is the stories from the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="423">And it just happens that what they were doing -- they would get the skin off the people, and they were making lampshades out of them. </sentence><sentence id="424">These lampshades were in the building there. </sentence><sentence id="425">I didn't have a chance to get into the building at the time, but my nurse did with other nurses. </sentence><sentence id="426">And they had witnessed about four or five lampshades that were made out of -- the top of it was made out of the skin of men with tattoos on them for them to give. </sentence><sentence id="427">One in particular was made for Goehring -- and this is from my nurse that she had seen. </sentence><sentence id="428">It was made for Goehring, and they said this was made only of the fliers that were downed in the war that they had taken these tattoos from. </sentence><sentence id="429">That was one of the things that sort of makes you feel very empty inside to think that people would be that barbaric. </sentence><sentence id="430">The Jews in the camp -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: One moment. </sentence><sentence id="464">When you came into the camp, you were by yourself with your driver. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: I was with myself and a driver all the way through it except when I -- pardon me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Did the rest of your unit join you at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="472">Just the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="473">We walked around ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="474">There were many people, as you will see, in the camp, but they never came over and tried to start a conversation or anything. </sentence><sentence id="475">They'd walk through -- just like I said, I think they were afraid -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="481">Q: You had said your nurse had seen evidence of skin that was made into a lampshade, and I was wondering -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: Oh, she had been in -- she actually got into the building at the time. </sentence><sentence id="484">That was a week or so later. </sentence><sentence id="485">So that they had different -- incidentally, Eisenhower dictated an order that every person in Weimar would be taken to the camp to see what the Germans had done there because they denied that they knew anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="486">In talking to the prisoners, they would tell -- they told me that on weekends they would be paraded through the city, like I mentioned before, and these people would be lined up throwing the tomatoes and garbage and everything else on it. </sentence><sentence id="487">That was so ridiculous to think that they would deny that they didn't know what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q: Let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="494">You left the barracks, and then you said you walked over to the administration building? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="519">Q: Barbed wire? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: Barbed wire where they used to put the prisoners in when they first came off the train. </sentence><sentence id="522">They'd march them in there, and then they'd pass them in through the building and give them their clothes they were supposed to where and orient them. </sentence><sentence id="523">And that was right across the street. </sentence><sentence id="524">Then down from there the road continued on, and there was another section that led to another area which probably was the barracks for doctors or the officers and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="525">At least that's what I interpreted that to be. </sentence><sentence id="526">We had nobody to guide us. </sentence><sentence id="527">We just went through there, as I said. </sentence><sentence id="528">And on the other side of that was barbed wires, and then the entrance from the back was guarded by two guardhouses on each side of the road so that -- separating it from the camp proper. </sentence><sentence id="529">Later I found out that the camp was sectioned into three different sections. </sentence><sentence id="530">They had the small camp, the large camp, and then they had the tent camp they called it. </sentence><sentence id="531">And that was put up later on for the Polish people when Germany started sending the Polish people into the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="532">Then the administrating building, as I said, was the one we went through. </sentence><sentence id="533">And the SS troopers had their barracks there on the right side. </sentence><sentence id="534">And they had the ammunition factories, which I didn't see. </sentence><sentence id="535">I think they were back in the woods somewhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: What were your thoughts as you were walking through? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: Like walking through a different world. </sentence><sentence id="554">Not used to the tragedies that occurred there. </sentence><sentence id="555">The pictures of the -- they had these dummies at the entrance showing how they were whipped or clubbed -- actually, it was a club. </sentence><sentence id="556">They had another one hanging from a limb, which represented hanging from the trees. </sentence><sentence id="557">And then they had, of course, the furnaces. </sentence><sentence id="558">You could see those. </sentence><sentence id="559">Great big stacks, white stacks, back there that you could see the furnaces. </sentence><sentence id="560">Now I'm trying just to think if there's anything that I can think of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="569">Q: Well, then you were moving along -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="571">A: Then we saw the piles of bodies next to the buildings, some of the buildings, of these skeletons of the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="572">And the expressions on their faces -- what were faces -- were that of horror. </sentence><sentence id="573">You could just read probably the pain and agony they must have gone in before they died. </sentence><sentence id="574">The stories that go along with that is that they would be told to go into this building. </sentence><sentence id="575">And as they would turn the corner to the stairs leading down to the basement where the furnaces were, they would be clubbed on the head until they were supposed to be unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="576">And then they'd roll down the stairs and eventually be put into the furnaces. </sentence><sentence id="577">If I remember right, there's about maybe 10 or 12 furnaces in a row lined up in the basement with each door in the front. </sentence><sentence id="578">That was at that time I went in they were still warm. </sentence><sentence id="579">And some of the doors were open, and you could see the remains of the body. </sentence><sentence id="580">What had happened is on April the Sth the order came down to the SS troopers that they were to evacuate all Jews to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="581">They were trying to clean up the evidence that might be left behind when the Americans came through. </sentence><sentence id="582">That was the impression I had, and I think that was probably a fact. </sentence><sentence id="583">So that the next day they started evacuating all the Jews from all the camps. </sentence><sentence id="584">And then This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="585">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="586"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection later on when I got back to the States, I was interested enough to look up some of the history that was in the books. </sentence><sentence id="587">In fact, just more recent than that. </sentence><sentence id="588">And I found out the reason for what was happening and how it happened. </sentence><sentence id="589">The underground was sabotaging the orders so that slowing down the evacuation of the people that were to be evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="590">And it figures in one of the write-ups, recent write-ups, there was about 25,150 people evacuated in that time that met the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="591">If they were evacuated to Auschwitz, that was noted to be the entry for the termination which Hitler called the final answer to their problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: Can you describe the crematorium in more detail? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="618">As I said, the doors of -- several of them were still open, and the crematorium if you call it a crematorium -- I think it was just a murder box -- the entrance would be large enough to take a body and slide it all the way into the flames. </sentence><sentence id="619">The heat was generated by coal or so below. </sentence><sentence id="620">That was my impression. </sentence><sentence id="621">And the remains that were still in there were those that they didn't have a chance to finish. </sentence><sentence id="622">In fact, the bodies we saw outside were left there only because time did not permit them to put them in the furnaces. </sentence><sentence id="623">One of the prisoners said that the furnaces were running day and night for almost a week before I was there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="631">Q: When you went down into the crematorium, did you go with some prisoners who explained anything to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="633">A: Only the question of how they would lead these men into the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="634">And that was -- really that was gotten out -- down in the crematorium there was nobody there but myself and my driver. </sentence><sentence id="635">We were alone down there, and I took these pictures, which we may show, showing the crematoriums. </sentence><sentence id="636">When we were down there, there was nobody there with us. </sentence><sentence id="637">So the conversation about what was happening I got after I left the crematorium and was back on the road and talked to some of the prisoners about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="643">Q: What did the crematorium look like from the outside? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="645">A: My impression, if I can recall in going back years, was a white building. </sentence><sentence id="646">It looked like a house really. </sentence><sentence id="647">A white building. </sentence><sentence id="648">And all I could see in my mind is the one side of it because I took the picture that I did at that time from that side. </sentence><sentence id="649">It was well painted. </sentence><sentence id="650">It looked like a very pleasant house. </sentence><sentence id="651">I understand the first floor also had the furnace -- not the furnaces -- but the boxes to put them in. </sentence><sentence id="652">The crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="653">Both floors were crematoriums. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="663">Q: When you went in, did you know what you'd be seeing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="665">A: I didn't know what I was going to see, no. </sentence><sentence id="666">I just followed the course of -- the man told you, "Go in there, and go right down the stairs." </sentence><sentence id="667">I don't even know who told me that, but it was obvious that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="668">The stair was at the end. </sentence><sentence id="669">Then you'd walk down. </sentence><sentence id="670">Then the crematorium was immediately -- if you turned right, it was right in front of you. </sentence><sentence id="671">The face of the opening were toward the side that you came down. </sentence><sentence id="672">The back was that way. </sentence><sentence id="673">At the time we went down there, the floors were clean and everything. </sentence><sentence id="674">They had cleaned up a lot, but I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="675">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="676"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 understand it was quite a messy place before. </sentence><sentence id="677">That's all I can remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="693">Q: When you came out of the crematorium, then where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: When I came out of the crematorium, I continued my walk, which took us down toward the place where the better homes were. </sentence><sentence id="696">We didn't go in any of them, but we saw them from the outside where probably the doctors or the officers would stay. </sentence><sentence id="697">And that took in the whole camp. </sentence><sentence id="698">The administrating compound is what I -- two or three streets down and blocked off by another street going to the left with the barracks with the SS troopers on this side and the barracks on the other side and the wired fences where they put the prisoners when they first came in for registration to the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="703">Q: Did you talk to any of the prisoners while you were walking around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="705">A: Not while walking. </sentence><sentence id="706">But I would stop and start a conversation at the time, and during that time they would mention some of the things that happened to the prisoners such as that when they were strapped, there wasn't only -- not strapped but when they were hit with these blows with this -- it was about a two-inch round bat if you'd call it. </sentence><sentence id="707">And it looked like it was displaying from a tree limb or so because you could still see where places from the limbs of the tree would come out. </sentence><sentence id="708">It would be jagged. </sentence><sentence id="709">It wouldn't be smooth. </sentence><sentence id="710">They would say they would hit those people and sometimes let them stay there for a day or so just so other prisoners would see them. </sentence><sentence id="711">And by the end of the day that person was swollen up and disfigured tremendously, and many of them wouldn't even get off there alive. </sentence><sentence id="712">Stringing up was done the same way. </sentence><sentence id="713">They strung them up in a fashion where their hands were tied up behind them and their head was dropped down so that as a medical man you wondered how the person could survive just in breathing with the weight of the head down. </sentence><sentence id="714">Again, they would be swollen up laying in the sun for a day or so before they took them down. </sentence><sentence id="715">And those are the stories that fed back. </sentence><sentence id="716">The impression was my own as to medically what would happen with the person in that position. </sentence><sentence id="717">It was a very uncomfortable position to be in. </sentence><sentence id="718">It in itself would eventually lend itself to death instead of just hanging by the neck, which is quick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: Did you feel the need to render any medical assistance to any of the prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="735">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="736">We -- at the time absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="737">We couldn't interfere into that. </sentence><sentence id="738">What we did do is we came -- we -- when I say "we," what I did and probably other doctors -- before I left the camp, the camp started filling up with other doctors or GI's coming into the camp, and the MP's were at the gates, started to be at the gates. </sentence><sentence id="739">So I got in just ahead of that. </sentence><sentence id="740">At that time they were instructing the soldiers not to give them any of our K-ration -- which is that sweet candy bar that the soldiers would carry around in case they were on the battlefront and they needed some food. </sentence><sentence id="741">It was 100 percent energy -- with the idea that if you gave them that, they probably would die because it was too rich. </sentence><sentence id="742">And this is something we found out in the hospital when the post was done on some of these prisoners that we even received back from our own men that were captured only for two and a half months. </sentence><sentence id="743">Their stomachs started to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="744">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="745"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 shrink down. </sentence><sentence id="746">And instead of being a typical stomach, it shrunk down to a small -- almost to a tube-like effect, which is interesting to know because I never knew it before I saw it there that the stomach will shrink down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="761">Q: Besides not giving them food, did you have the urge to help any of them medically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="763">A: That was done by another group. </sentence><sentence id="764">We were behind the Army, third Army, and our job was to follow the third Army. </sentence><sentence id="765">We were the hospital that took care of all the casualties behind Blood and Guts, which you know as General Patton. </sentence><sentence id="766">And our job -- we had to move with them. </sentence><sentence id="767">And General Patton stopped for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="768">His idea was to go across the continent and get the Germans off into little pockets and let the infantry come back and clean them up. </sentence><sentence id="769">And that's what we were. </sentence><sentence id="770">We only saw very little of anybody from Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="771">We saw more from the people of Weidar who were unfortunate enough to get involved with some of the prisoners when they were let free and were beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="772">In some cases a couple of them were hung by trees. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: Towards the end of the time you were in the camp, did the U.S. Army medical personnel come in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: They came in. </sentence><sentence id="786">There was another unit that took care of it. </sentence><sentence id="787">It wasn't us. </sentence><sentence id="788">That's all I know about that because we had to move on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="793">Q: What else did you see that first time in the camp? </sentence><sentence id="794">Anything else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="798">I'm trying to think of -- I saw -- in one case I saw -- one of the prisoners was digging on the ground with a little tiny ax or so, and I couldn't understand what he was digging a hole for. </sentence><sentence id="799">And I asked -- the prisoner came by, and he said, oh, he's burying his food. </sentence><sentence id="800">He said they bury the food, and then they felt that we wouldn't be there long. </sentence><sentence id="801">They wanted to have some food after we left. </sentence><sentence id="802">And this came right from the soldier. </sentence><sentence id="803">So he must have had a fact because I couldn't understand why he was doing it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="804">But I think one of the methods of destroying the prisoners was a planned diet that gradually resulted in malnutrition, and the people really just died from lack of food over a period of several months, which gave -- the Jewish prisoners when they first came in were assigned to the factories to work or to the -- they had a stone mine there that they were digging from. </sentence><sentence id="805">Stones and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="806">They were getting labor done cheap by putting these Jews and prisoners to work in their ammunition factories and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="807">But along with that I think was this constant planned reduction diet, which ended up in these people dying or getting weak enough so they couldn't work, and then they were put into these -- and this is my own impression I had when I left the camp -- they were eventually put into one of these three buildings there just to be there and die and be burned through the furnaces. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q: What were some of the other conversations you had with the prisoners while you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: That's about all. </sentence><sentence id="822">They wouldn't talk, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="823">They didn't go out of their way to talk. </sentence><sentence id="824">If This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="825">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="826"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 you talked to them, they would respond. </sentence><sentence id="827">That's how I got the answers I did. </sentence><sentence id="828">One other thing is they mentioned that when they would beat these soldiers -- or these prisoners -- or hung them up, they would strip them down nude. </sentence><sentence id="829">If you look at the bodies that you'll see in these piles, you would see the black and blue marks of bruises on what was left of the skin and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="830">And I mentioned about the expressions. </sentence><sentence id="831">And also that the bodies -- if you look at them, you think they all reached the same stage before they died because they all looked so similar in the amount of malnutrition that you see. </sentence><sentence id="832">And I've seen many people in the hospital that would take them quite a while to reach that stage of malnutrition. </sentence><sentence id="833">So they weren't killed instantly. </sentence><sentence id="834">They were dragged on until they were weak enough that they couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="835">And then they'd get diseases, and many of them would commit suicide by themselves, and many of them would die from diseases and malnutrition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="853">Q: Did you know anything about any of the medical experiments that were performed in Buchenwald? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="855">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="856">They were using medical experiments, and the medical experiments they were using was, one, to study the effect of amputations and how to handle them. </sentence><sentence id="857">And I'll tell you a little bit about that in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="858">The other thing was giving them poisons in trying the strengths of the different poisons on people. </sentence><sentence id="859">And the other thing was using toxins that would irritate the skin like some of our gases do that we were using -- not we were using but the armies use sometimes in wars. </sentence><sentence id="860">Those are the three or four elements that they were -- some of them. </sentence><sentence id="861">And I also understand they were experimenting a lot on birth control. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="869">Q: What's that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: Sterilization. </sentence><sentence id="872">You see, the impression I received -- and this, again, was borne out later on -- they at first wanted the Jews to leave Germany, and they did everything to encourage them to leave. </sentence><sentence id="873">And then eventually in "41 I think -- 11th of "41 or thereabouts -- Hitler decided to lull -- take the final solution. </sentence><sentence id="874">And that was his order. </sentence><sentence id="875">And then Auschwitz was one of the places that used gas. </sentence><sentence id="876">They used cianide gas or carbon monoxide. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="883">Q: You said they were doing experiments on amputation? </sentence><sentence id="884">Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: Well, I could see why. </sentence><sentence id="888">I'm just associating what I saw and what I'm putting together. </sentence><sentence id="889">When we came across Brest and we emptied their hospitals -- which as we took over, we took over hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="890">And then the responsibility was ours to take care of their people. </sentence><sentence id="891">And we had probably a football field full with many of the people -- most of the people had amputations. </sentence><sentence id="892">And we stacked it up at that time to the fact that we had Penicillin, and the Germans only had Sulpha at that time as a drug. </sentence><sentence id="893">Sulfanilamide. </sentence><sentence id="894">And Sulfanilamide, of course, wasn't as effective as Penicillin was. </sentence><sentence id="895">At the time of war you've got to get these people off the battlefield as fast as you can because infection sets in almost immediate when they hit the ground. </sentence><sentence id="896">In Europe the people used the ground to defecate on and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="897">They called this fertilizing it. </sentence><sentence id="898">So you couldn't trust the ground of being clean of bacteria and so forth so that it was necessary to do something. </sentence><sentence id="899">And the quickest way to prevent infection is This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="900">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="901"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 to cut off the arm, cut off the leg to prevent it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1000">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I mean, it's like going out of the funeral home. </sentence><sentence id="1002">You didn't look for conversation yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1003">You're depressed and feeling alone. </sentence><sentence id="1004">You just want to -- you're lost in your own feelings. </sentence><sentence id="1005">You don't feel like talking. </sentence><sentence id="1006">If anything, you get a lump in your throat. </sentence><sentence id="1007">You're very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="1008">It leaves you not only depressed, but you have nightmares for a few days after about that. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Especially the one where I told you where I turned around and here was a skeleton talking to me. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I'll never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="1011">The skeleton that talked to me was exactly the same as the ones -- the piles of them. </sentence><sentence id="1012">So what can you say? </sentence><sentence id="1013">There are no words to express the tragedies of war. </sentence><sentence id="1014">There are absolutely no words. </sentence><sentence id="1015">I saw a lot of it right on the battlefield for that matter with dead soldiers all over the field and crazy things. </sentence><sentence id="1016">You don't try to remember those things. </sentence><sentence id="1017">It's not anything pleasant to see especially as a doctor where you'd like to give help and so forth, and there's nothing you can do. </sentence><sentence id="1018">This is the after effect. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And you walk away the same as any person. </sentence><sentence id="1020">You walk away and say, "What's going to become of these people?" </sentence><sentence id="1021">As it turned out, the people that were in the last two barracks that I mentioned probably died right there without going any further. </sentence><sentence id="1022">Even though we'd do what we could for them, we couldn't do enough. </sentence><sentence id="1023">When I say "we," I'm talking about the medical part of the Army. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Not our unit but whoever took care of them. </sentence><sentence id="1025">We got papers over there, newspapers, from the different units which would communicate back and forth and give us an idea of what we would be seeing so that we knew what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1075">A: -- where these prisoners were lying in this room on big mattresses and also sleeping bags which we know weren't theirs and they probably got it from the SS troopers. </sentence><sentence id="1076">But to them it was not like lying on the dirt and stuff in their own camp. </sentence><sentence id="1077">They told us their places were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Especially some of the prisoners got into very dirty areas where they would be sleeping and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1079">The sanitation of the camp was terrible back in the camps themselves, and that might not have been just at the very end stages. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I don't know what it was when they were functioning. </sentence><sentence id="1081">I don't think they could function in such a dirty place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1089">Q: You said you went back to your headquarters, and then how long did you stay there at that location? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1091">A: Probably at the most a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="1092">I think we moved. </sentence><sentence id="1093">On the 14th or 15th I think we moved out of that place and then on to the next place, which was a city Wieden (phonetic) I think. </sentence><sentence id="1094">Wieden or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1095">It was barracks there. </sentence><sentence id="1096">There we stayed only three or four days and then went forward again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1105">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1106">From there on we were too busy taking care of -- we didn't get anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1107">I mean I don't think we came near camps. </sentence><sentence id="1108">We might have. </sentence><sentence id="1109">It just happened that this one we happened to be the first group that was probably close enough to the camp to be affected by it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1119">A: From there on we were just taking care of our soldiers and prisoners and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1120">But we were busy 12 hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="1121">At least 12. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And even then after that during the Bulge, most of us worked on 14, 15 hours. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Incidentally, one of the prisoners mentioned that the Jews were given unusual cruelty -- they were very cruel treating the Jewish people there and that they would make them work in these quarries 15 and 16 and 20 hours. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1125">They would make them work a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1126">This was just mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1127">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="1128">How it came up I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1151">A: Well, we -- I'm trying to figure out where I heard of that in general. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I think we even got that before we got into the war. </sentence><sentence id="1153">I think we got it in our own papers probably. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And that might influence the impression and probably stimulated the question and probably all they were confirming what we probably already suspected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1159">Q: What was your itinerary for the rest of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1161">A: Well, we followed the German Army -- I mean the -- chasing the German Army across Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1162">And then at Bastogne the Germ -- the counterattack and the Bulge -- you probably read about the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And we survived that. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And then went on to Regensburg where the war ended, and that's where armistice was. </sentence><sentence id="1165">From Regensburg we moved back into Wurzburg where we for the first time were able to get into a hospital and use the hospital of the Germans, which was well taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="1166">It was a hospital with clean beds and everything else, and the instruments we used were most modern and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1167">But that was after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Then from there on, of course, we waited for the time when we were to go out -- go back -- and many of us were scheduled to go to Japan at that time, and I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I was one of the younger officers. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I'm not young now, but then I was. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And finally Japan gave up before we were moved. </sentence><sentence id="1172">So I got back into the States on New Year's 1946 and went back and continued my residency at the hospital that I was working before, Mount Carmen Mercy Hospital, (phonetic) and then got involved in industrial medicine and became the medical director of American Motors for 38 years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1185">Q: Let's talk a little bit about how the war, your experiences, affected you, your experience at Buchenwald affected you. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Your thoughts as a medical professional. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1189">A: You never used it. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I never used it. </sentence><sentence id="1191">In my experience that I had in the war doing almost around 3,000 operations, which many surgeons never see in a lifetime, the experience I obtained there was not recognized by the surgical specialty group. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So we never used it. </sentence><sentence id="1193">We just -- it's something you put aside. </sentence><sentence id="1194">It worked out you learned a lot of things doing that type of surgery. </sentence><sentence id="1195">It's traumatic surgery, and it came in useful when I got into industrial medicine. </sentence><sentence id="1196">The knowledge that you obtain by experience is something greater than any book can learn you -- teach you. </sentence><sentence id="1197">So that it was there, but you didn't recall it yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1198">It just would pop up every now and then, something that you did before. </sentence><sentence id="1199">But you never talked about the war. </sentence><sentence id="1200">I never did. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I'd be the last one to sit in a group -- and they'd be talking about different things -- to say anything about the war. </sentence><sentence id="1202">To me it's like you pull a shade down and say that's part of the life you -- it isn't pleasant to remember. </sentence><sentence id="1203">None of it. </sentence><sentence id="1204">The tragedies in war are something you don't talk about. </sentence><sentence id="1205">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1206">I wouldn't be talking here now if it wasn't for my darling daughter who insisted I -- and my nephew. </sentence><sentence id="1207">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1208">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1209"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1232">Q: What lasting effects do you think your experience at Buchenwald had on you emotionally, intellectually? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1234">A: Well, did you ever see a movie that was very impressive and many years later you recall different incidents of what you've seen? </sentence><sentence id="1235">That's the thing of it. </sentence><sentence id="1236">You never forget about them. </sentence><sentence id="1237">They're always in the back of your mind. </sentence><sentence id="1238">The only thing is sometimes they're stimulated by something that happens. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And you say, "Gee, I could remember this." </sentence><sentence id="1240">But you don't dwell on it or go out and say, "Well, I think I'll talk to this and that party about the war and tell them all the things I did" because you can't believe half the stuff yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1241">It's such an unreal experience to a person who goes through the war. </sentence><sentence id="1242">People that talk the most are the ones who see the least because many of my doctor friends who were with me in the same unit -- we never discussed the war. </sentence><sentence id="1243">We will discuss the comedy like you run into situations that you experienced during the war when you're visiting Paris or something like that, but you don't talk about death and murder and torture and the pain that -- it's amazing. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I saw people walk into the hospital with both legs shot out from under them, but they were walking on the legs, and both the femurs were broken. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I've seen fellows come in with a shell hole that went up the back, went through the tin and went around the protecting helmet and out. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Miracles. </sentence><sentence id="1247">You don't know -- the craziest things happen. </sentence><sentence id="1248">So it becomes a world of thinking of reality and what doesn't seem so real. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1264">Q: Did your experience at Buchenwald have a particular message to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1266">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1267">I sit down, and sometimes I get very, very mad of some person who tries to say that, oh, that didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="1268">But you don't try to correct them because they're too dumb to realize it. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And besides it's hard for you to appreciate what you saw. </sentence><sentence id="1270">It isn't appreciation, anyway, but it's just a feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1271">There's no sense of talking about something that isn't pleasant to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="1272">I think even talking here is not a -- I shouldn't say this, but I'll tell you the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1273">It isn't anything pleasing to me. </sentence><sentence id="1274">It's against what I usually do. </sentence><sentence id="1275">I don't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1276">In fact, I've had many people ask me about it, and I don't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And that's my attitude. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And as a corporate medical director of a large corporation, I don't think even half of them even knew I was in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Not half. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I don't think any of them knew I was in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1281">That's how much I talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Even today I'm on the staff -- I was on the staff and still am on the staff -- but as an old man you have to retire a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1283">I don't think many of the doctors I associated with know my experiences because you don't talk about unpleasant things. </sentence><sentence id="1284">You try to -- the mind blocks out. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Thank God for that. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And that's in real life too. </sentence><sentence id="1287">The same way with people that have miserable deaths and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1359">A: That's a picture walking down the street in front of the administration compound. </sentence><sentence id="1360">On the right side you see the barracks of the SS troopers. </sentence><sentence id="1361">On the left is part of the administration building where the camp officials would stay. </sentence><sentence id="1362">And people are just walking around there freely with no worry about being stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1363">So they're all prisoners of war -- I mean prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1371">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1372">That must have been quite a novelty for them to get some clean clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1373">We don't know where they got it, but they got it in the picture there. </sentence><sentence id="1374">I can't tell you how they got it except that I think what they did is get it out of the SS troopers" barracks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
