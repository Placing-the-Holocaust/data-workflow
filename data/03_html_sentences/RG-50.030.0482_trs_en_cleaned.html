<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Helen Bamber, conducted by Vera Frankel on December 28", 2003, in London. </sentence><sentence id="4">This is tape number one, side A. Helen Bamber, tell me about your background first of all, where you grew up and the family you grew up in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in North London. </sentence><sentence id="8">My father was born in America. </sentence><sentence id="9">My mother was born in the UK, in England, of course, as it was then. </sentence><sentence id="10">Their parents came from Poland and Russia respectively. </sentence><sentence id="11">Interestingly, one of my grandfathers was actually born, we found out many years later, in what was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me, Oswiecim, Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="12">And that sent shivers down our spine many years later. </sentence><sentence id="13">Now, it wasn't a happy household. </sentence><sentence id="14">My father was an accountant. </sentence><sentence id="15">He was a very obsessional man, and during most of my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was born in 1925. </sentence><sentence id="16">So I grew up in the years of unemployment, dole queues, and the rise of fascism. </sentence><sentence id="17">And I think this combination absorbed my father completely inasmuch as he was something of a visionary. </sentence><sentence id="18">He could see, I believe, what was going to happen in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="19">He was bilingual, he spoke German perfectly, and a number of other languages, and I've never understood how it was that a man who was not -- you know, was quite simply educated in this country, a good scholar, but how it was that he spoke the languages he did, and how he could be bilingual in German. </sentence><sentence id="20">I never understood that, and I don't now, but he was. </sentence><sentence id="21">So, as an only child, in a house in north London, with diminishing financial resources, as my father's activities on behalf of people who were -- who needed to leave Nazi Germany became more -- how can I say more active, or more -- yes, more active. </sentence><sentence id="22">And as I was exposed to his version of events, his -- his horror of fascism, his fear of anti-Semitism rising in Europe, and indeed, in England where we -- I mean, I was frequently aware of Mosely's fascists marching through north London, and the east end of London. </sentence><sentence id="23">I'm losing my thread, but what I'm trying to do is to give a background about an only child growing up in what was later a working class area, because we had to move from a rather sumptuous house to something very modest. </sentence><sentence id="24">Was a - - a -- a kind of house of -- of s-something bordering on fear and apprehension of what might happen in the future. </sentence><sentence id="25">My father insisted that we listened to the broadcasts from Germany, which he would translate. </sentence><sentence id="26">So that as a young child, I -- | was exposed to quite a lot of my father's understanding and vision, but also his fears, and my own. </sentence><sentence id="27">N -- my mother tried hard to avoid all this by -- and it wasn't that she didn't care, it was that like so many people of her time, and h -- and as is always the case, she actually couldn't face the possibility of what might happen. </sentence><sentence id="28">She began to disengage as much as she could. </sentence><sentence id="29">As my father's activities became, as I said earlier, more -- more active, there were refugees from Germany who came to our house, en route perhaps for somewhere else, but would often stay in my house for some days, weeks, and -- and as a sickly child, on top of everything else, because I had what later was thought to have been TB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my time, many children had it, I was bi -- be -- I was bedridden for a lot of my -- of the winters of my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="30">And they -- there were -- people who came and stayed would often come and talk to me, sit on my bed and talk to me, but they wouldn't talk to me about childhood events, or childhood dreams, and -- and fantasies, and i -- yo-you know, celebration. </sentence><sentence id="31">It was about what happened to them, and what was -- what happened in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="32">And I remember there was a pianist who stayed with us, who I disliked very much. </sentence><sentence id="33">I found him pompous, although he played beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="34">And he came and sat on my bed frequently. </sentence><sentence id="35">But he made a great change in my life, in my childish -- my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="36">He said to me, "You know, you don't have to be ill like this. </sentence><sentence id="37">If you want to, you can get out of bed when I leave this room, and you can walk round the room, touch all the furniture, and get back into bed, and say to yourself, I am now in control of myself." </sentence><sentence id="38">Now, I disliked him more than ever when he said this, because of course, illness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues. </sentence><sentence id="39">But I did exactly what he said. </sentence><sentence id="40">I got up and I walked round the room, and I touched everything, and I said to myself. " </sentence><sentence id="41">I can make changes, I can be in control." </sentence><sentence id="42">I wasn't very confident, but I said it. </sentence><sentence id="43">And I don't know, I think that was a -- a turning point for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father's outlook on life influenced your personality, and your thinking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don't want to magnify it. </sentence><sentence id="86">I was very moved by my father. </sentence><sentence id="87">I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair later on, when the Holocaust came. </sentence><sentence id="88">But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother's social skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the piano, and her desire for me to be somehow -- I don't know, something very special. </sentence><sentence id="89">Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="90">But it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really. </sentence><sentence id="91">Later they divorced; when I was in my late teens, they divorced. </sentence><sentence id="92">But it was an unhappy household, and I'm not sure that I -- I mean, | think I had a good role model for my future in human rights. </sentence><sentence id="93">I'm not sure that I had a good role model in terms of relationships, and in terms of parenting. </sentence><sentence id="94">I learned, though, as a -- as an only child in an unhappy household, with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I learned how to compromise. </sentence><sentence id="95">And these, I think, are skills I have. </sentence><sentence id="96">And that comes not only from later experience, but I learned it in the family home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: You -- you spent your teenage years, I believe, in London during the war. </sentence><sentence id="110">Tell me about what that experience was like, and -- and how you think now, looking back, that it affected you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war. </sentence><sentence id="114">What can I say about it? </sentence><sentence id="115">In some ways, it was almost -- it's crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear of be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans came, specially chosen for annihilation. </sentence><sentence id="116">So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing incident, when I was fire watching in central London, when central London was terribly bombed, and was buried, albeit it -- it -- it wasn't as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn't hurt. </sentence><sentence id="117">I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to go downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a solicitor's office, and standing on some steps, going down to the basement where all the documents were kept with little bits of pink ribbon tying them up. </sentence><sentence id="118">And I was going -- there was only about four or five steps, but as I stood on the top step, the steps collapsed under me. </sentence><sentence id="119">And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from that time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my chances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn't being particularly chosen at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="120">And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it's reliefs for me, although it killed, in another bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was considerably left wing. </sentence><sentence id="121">Did a lot of work in the east end of London, working with the Communists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely's fascists. </sentence><sentence id="122">And she was involved in the much glorified battle of Cable Street, which is an incident where when Mosely was going to march down one particular area of the east end, the people of the east end brought out all their furniture, their -- their pianos, their -- their tables, their kitchen equipment, and they blocked the roads of the east end. </sentence><sentence id="123">And for me, with a father who was growing into despair as to what was happening in Europe, this simple act meant a great deal to me. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn't succeed ultimately in making a stand, in making a statement. </sentence><sentence id="125">So my aunt was another very strong influence in my life because she represented anything but despair. </sentence><sentence id="126">She was vigorous, she was sexy. </sentence><sentence id="127">She had the strangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter. </sentence><sentence id="128">She was a fascinating, vigorous, lovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also doing these fantastic things. </sentence><sentence id="129">An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my life, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fiance, someone I think she might have married, were killed when the Cafe de Paris had a direct hit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Cafe de Paris in London? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: The cafe de p -- ki -- the Cafe de P-Paris was a very famous cafe for dancing, many soldiers and people would -- would go there on leave, and it was rather posh, and I think not inexpensive, but -- and it was supposed to be absolutely safe. </sentence><sentence id="151">I don't know why people talk about something being absolutely safe. </sentence><sentence id="152">It had a direct hit. </sentence><sentence id="153">Her body was never found, and I remember going with my mother to try and identify various objects that were lined up somewhere in the middle of London where people queued and looked at these objects. </sentence><sentence id="154">Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: You were brought up with this kind of terrible fear of what might happen to the Jews of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="161">When did you actually begin to discover, and to understand what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: I think I always understood, because my father had understood what was going on in the -- in -- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish people and the Gypsies, and the mentally defective. </sentence><sentence id="165">He had read men ka -- "Mein Kampf," he had read other documents. </sentence><sentence id="166">The information actually was there for anyone who wanted to know it. </sentence><sentence id="167">Members of parliament denied all knowledge of concentration camps, and people -- I think including my father, but I'm not sure about this -- did lobby, and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on , but I don't think that - - that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation. </sentence><sentence id="168">And maybe for other reasons as well. </sentence><sentence id="169">So I always knew, I always knew about the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="170">It was no secret in my house that people were being taken to concentration camps and murdered. </sentence><sentence id="171">We weren't -- I -- I don't always know -- now when I look back, it's difficult to be accurate. </sentence><sentence id="172">Whether the details were known, I'm not su -- to me, I'm not sure, but certainly the word concentration camps, in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my household. </sentence><sentence id="173">So it wasn't a stranger to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: What years are we talking about here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: I'm talking about the -- the years -- the -- the -- the -- all during the war really, th-the war years. </sentence><sentence id="188">The forties. </sentence><sentence id="189">The 1941, "42, 43, were years in which whilst the war was going on, and London was being bombed, my father was talking about concentration camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: I believe there was an exhibition of photographs in London. </sentence><sentence id="194">An exhibition of photographs from the camps which had a very profound impact on you. </sentence><sentence id="195">Can you recall how old you were when you went to see that exhibition and what -- what stayed in your mind from that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of photographs came -- yes, that's right, there was an exhibition of photographs that was shown in London. </sentence><sentence id="200">It wasn't the photographs that shocked me so much as the attitude of people. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I think that if I'm not mistaken, that the photographs were discontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people's reactions. </sentence><sentence id="202">Now, I'm not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want to believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn't really -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and rationing, and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="203">And to bring home to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that -- to that extent, I think either didn't move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it didn't -- I don't think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with real under -- |-let's say how difficult it was for anyone to understand what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="204">It wasn't the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to Germany at the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="205">I think that I'd started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I'm -- and in -- it's very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the more you think about it, you begin to understand your motives. </sentence><sentence id="206">People often ask me why did I want to go to the camps, wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me want to go and to work for the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I think it really, now talking today, I think it wasn't only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas everybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the -- the catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the concentration camps, but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war, I think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing. </sentence><sentence id="208">He also had his own personal reasons for -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="209">But I think it was also my aunt, because my aunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father. </sentence><sentence id="210">And her belief was you must do something, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to. </sentence><sentence id="211">And so I suppose it was my father's knowledge, and my aunt's kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do something, make a statement, however -- even if you're waving your arms and nobody's watching, do it, was what she was about. </sentence><sentence id="212">I think that's really what influenced me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Do you remember actually taking this decision? </sentence><sentence id="229">And how old were you at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: I found an organization called the Jewish Relief Unit, that was in formation before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="233">I think I was then about 18, and I made some enquiries and I went to see them, and they announced that I was very young, but they -- they said yes, they'd consider me. </sentence><sentence id="234">And I joined the relief unit in the hope that I would be able to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="239">Could you tell me what the unit consisted of, who organized it, how it was run, how big it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: The Jewish Relief Unit when I first came upon it was a small office near Woburn House in that square, Woburn Square, or Ensley Place I think was it's name. </sentence><sentence id="243">It was a -- a house on a corner, and it consisted of an office with about six or seven people in it. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was financed, I think, by the -- now I'm not sure about that, it might have been the Central British Fund, I cannot remember. </sentence><sentence id="245">This -- this could easily be established how the organization was funded. </sentence><sentence id="246">I do have a book about it, but I don't read the book, and I'm not sure why. </sentence><sentence id="247">But anyway, there is a lot of information about the funding of this organization. </sentence><sentence id="248">And there were people being trained to go. </sentence><sentence id="249">And these were people who were volunteers, it was a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to go, as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="250">And I started to -- to -- to train with them, telling my parents -- I was then living with my mother; my father was separated, as I said. </sentence><sentence id="251">And this was going to be quite a difficult issue. </sentence><sentence id="252">| remember sitting in Saint James's Park, and watching the ducks where I'd met my father, and I said to him, "I -- I want to go to Germany." </sentence><sentence id="253">And he didn't really say very much. </sentence><sentence id="254">He said, "Well, you must be sure you want to go, and you'll have to be safe and careful." </sentence><sentence id="255">Which hadn't actually occurred to me at the time, about being safe. </sentence><sentence id="256">Being careful, yes. </sentence><sentence id="257">But he -- he didn't express great enthusiasm or dismay or surprise or -- my mother, of course, was aghast. </sentence><sentence id="258">And her dreams of what she had expected of me for the future began to disappear to some extent, for her. </sentence><sentence id="259">She saw me taking a path that she really didn't like, and I suppose as a mother now it was, looking back, it must have been hard for her. </sentence><sentence id="260">But I was very determined to go. </sentence><sentence id="261">And so I continued to -- to train, to -- to be exposed to a psychologist who in pri -- in small intimate sessions would -- individual sessions would ask you questions, but also in group sessions. </sentence><sentence id="262">And I suppose there were about 20 of us volunteers at the time, who -- not all Jewish by the way, and I think that's important to know. </sentence><sentence id="263">There were several Quakers, people who felt very strongly about what had happened, who wanted to -- who offered their -- their services. </sentence><sentence id="264">And so that's what I did, and we went on various training courses, to a kibbutz somewhere in England, in Wiltshire, I believe, where we undertook various training in map reading and first aid, and -- but I do remember -- I do remember one session where we sat in a group and I think it was the psychologist asked everyone what they felt they expected to find, and how they would deal with the very impossible situations, and how they would deal with people who they cou -- who felt -- who didn't want to be helped, or were past helping. </sentence><sentence id="265">And I remember searching my -- my th- thoughts at the time, and trying to think what -- what is the answer to that, faced with a lot of people who you can't help. </sentence><sentence id="266">And I remember saying that maybe one has to accept that there will be people you can't save. </sentence><sentence id="267">And maybe if there are children and younger people there, we have to put our energies into trying to help them. </sentence><sentence id="268">And that maybe -- this now sounds all rather simplistic, but and maybe if -- if people see the energy going into the young and the children, that would be some compensation for them. </sentence><sentence id="269">I don't think it was such a bad idea now, looking back, because there were many people that couldn't be helped. </sentence><sentence id="270">Anyway, that was -- that was what I said at the time. </sentence><sentence id="271">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. </sentence><sentence id="304">Tell me a little bit more about the actual training process, and the extent to which you were really prepared mentally and physically for what you were about to find. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: Well, l-looking at how people are prepared today, say in aid agencies, which still leaves a lot to be desired, I'm not sure that we really were prepared so well. </sentence><sentence id="308">It was a disparate group of -- o- of volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="309">There were nurses, there were people with a variety of skills at the time. </sentence><sentence id="310">And -- but I can't remember sitting down and really -- th-th-there was just that one discussion we had in which we were asked to face the possibility of not being able to help everyone, not being able to save everyone. </sentence><sentence id="311">It is important because it stayed in my mind and it -- it's the situation that I'm faced with every day of my life now. </sentence><sentence id="312">And it's always hard, it's always hard and it should always be hard. </sentence><sentence id="313">But it has to be there, that acceptance that you can't save everyone. </sentence><sentence id="314">But it's so hard. </sentence><sentence id="315">We went to various -- as I said, we went to this kibbutz, and I remember I drove with somebody in a van, and the idea was that we had to follow the map and find our own way there. </sentence><sentence id="316">And map reading and finding our way around with a lot of emphasis, I think on practical help, on the provisions to be given. </sentence><sentence id="317">On the -- on the question of driving, and map reading, and knowing how to distribute the wherewithal, food, or provisions and so on. </sentence><sentence id="318">I don't really remember, even with the help of the psychologist, a great deal of help about how we would feel, faced with what we were going to face, which wasn't only about a d -- a -- a d-devastated people, devastated in every sense of the word. </sentence><sentence id="319">Suffering from malnutrition, suffering from loss, some behaving as if they were quite mad, all of that. </sentence><sentence id="320">But it was also that we were going to a country that was in rubble, and starving. </sentence><sentence id="321">And I certainly wasn't prepared for the fact -- I'd hardened all these years my heart against the German people. </sentence><sentence id="322">I'd grown up with a dislike and fear of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="323">And when I was on the train going out, on my own, with all my luggage and baggage and God knows what -- I mean, what a performance that was, I remember seeing starving German children standing along the railway line, holding out their hands. </sentence><sentence id="324">And I was traveling with soldiers, British soldiers, and everybody threw out their bread and whatever they had with them to the starving children. </sentence><sentence id="325">Now that I wasn't prepared for, and that was hard too, because these were children, these were innocent children. </sentence><sentence id="326">And that brought a conflict that I hadn't -- or an understanding that I hadn't expected to find in myself. </sentence><sentence id="327">And I learned that the very first moment I traveled. </sentence><sentence id="328">So there were many things one wasn't prepared for. </sentence><sentence id="329">One wasn't prepared for the devastated cities. </sentence><sentence id="330">No, we weren't prepared, but maybe there was no way to prepare us, because nobody really knew, I think, how catastrophic was the scene that we were t-to find eventually. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: My journey remains really a bit of a mystery to me myself. </sentence><sentence id="368">I was then just 20 by the way, when I went. </sentence><sentence id="369">I think I was -- have to be very careful about this, but I think I just -- I was just 20 years old. </sentence><sentence id="370">And I had uniforms, we all had. </sentence><sentence id="371">We had officer's uniform, we had officer's rank. </sentence><sentence id="372">And an ordinary khaki kind of ordinary wear. </sentence><sentence id="373">I don't know what you call it now. </sentence><sentence id="374">It's awful that I don't, but anyway, I traveled in my khaki ordinary, and I traveled with the yellow star on my shoulder, my left shoulder, which is what we had elected to do. </sentence><sentence id="375">And that in itself was an undertaking. </sentence><sentence id="376">So not only was I kitted out beyond belief with a -- a kind of a canvas thing that was like a mobile bath, or whatever, and a kit bag that really I could barely lift. </sentence><sentence id="377">And a bedroll and all kinds of -- the bedroll was very important later on, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="378">The -- the mobile bath, I never knew it's -- what it was intended to do, but it -- I used to sort of keep all my dirty underwear in it because I could sort of snap it together when anybody came into the room. </sentence><sentence id="379">You know, it was one of those things, it sort of opened out with two kind of sticks, and it wa -- oh, I don't know, it was a kind of ghastly thing. </sentence><sentence id="380">But it was very good for underwear and you could smack the two pieces together when anybody came in, and nobody could see. </sentence><sentence id="381">So that's what I did with that. </sentence><sentence id="382">And there was all kinds of equipment that one didn't actually need. </sentence><sentence id="383">I think the bedroll was very important. </sentence><sentence id="384">So I was in uniform, with a cap, you know, a beret, and m-my khaki, my ghastly shoes and navy blue underwear and -- and the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="385">And why I traveled on my own I do not know, but I think there was a very difficult procedure before anybody was allowed to go. </sentence><sentence id="386">There was a very careful vetting of every individual, not necessarily verbally, I mean I didn't meet anybody, but I know that there was one woman who belonged to the Communist party, who was not allowed to go. </sentence><sentence id="387">Which was a very great disappointment to all of us who knew and loved her. </sentence><sentence id="388">So, there was a very careful vetting of each individual, and I think there was a fear by the officials involved, that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the former concentration camps, or in Holland, or in Greece were somehow either a provocation or a difficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to control. </sentence><sentence id="389">Whatever it was, it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="390">And so everybody was vetted very carefully, and although we came under the auspices directly of UNRRA, we were also responsible directly also, to the British military government. </sentence><sentence id="391">At least we were in the British zone, that means to say those of us who went to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="392">I had to go -- I mean, my final destination was a small village called Eilshausen, which I -- I kept spelling in my head all the time, E-i-l-s. Eilshausen. </sentence><sentence id="393">It was difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="394">I'd spoke some German by the way, because I'd learned from my father enough German to get by. </sentence><sentence id="395">And the worst of all was that I went on a train from Victoria -- and I remember people were very helpful to me because I'm not very tall, and with all this heavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me. </sentence><sentence id="396">But of course they were also very -- they would also look quite quizzically at -- at the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="397">So I was constantly in conversation, having to explain oneself. </sentence><sentence id="398">Why one was going, what one was doing. </sentence><sentence id="399">And it was the beginning in a way of a kind of role in society, in the public, that was always slightly uncomfortable for me, and it exists to this day, where I have to explain what I'm doing for asylum seekers and refugees. </sentence><sentence id="400">And so I -- I'd already begun then to explain what I was doing with the yellow star on my shoulder.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: Nissen huts, yes, in kind of dormitories on paliasis and so on. </sentence><sentence id="461">And it was -- it was very primitive, and I remember wandering round Calais all on my own and feeling so alone, as I've never felt in my life before. </sentence><sentence id="462">I hadn't been out of England before, which is strange in this day and age, but I had never been out of England. </sentence><sentence id="463">And so this was the first time I'd been out. </sentence><sentence id="464">And I was very alone. </sentence><sentence id="465">Eventually we took our turn and we were put on the train. </sentence><sentence id="466">And I remember something quite awful about this train because it would always stop at various places which were not a station. </sentence><sentence id="467">I mean, in other words I couldn't -- you couldn't -- you had no platform, you had to get off the train, so to speak, without a platform, in order to go to wherever you were going to be fed on the way, which again was a kind of Nissen hut, specially prepared for the soldiers en route. </sentence><sentence id="468">And you would sit at a long table and -- and be fed. </sentence><sentence id="469">And I had the utmost difficulty with my height, in being able to mount this train. </sentence><sentence id="470">And this was one of the -- the extraordinary things that preoccupied me on the journey, all k-kind of, sort of incidental ridiculous things, not about the seriousness of my task, but how in heaven's name I was going to get up and down this train without making a complete idiot of myself. </sentence><sentence id="471">And usually I had to be hauled up and pushed from behind. </sentence><sentence id="472">But the train ricketed along, and there was one bridge that we crossed when we were in Germany, when the German guard, or person on the train came through carrying a lantern. </sentence><sentence id="473">Achtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one side of the train so that we actually balanced it properly, because there was a danger that the -- you know, that -- I don't know, that maybe the train would topple over. </sentence><sentence id="474">Whatever it was, that's what we all did. </sentence><sentence id="475">And then there were the children on the way. </sentence><sentence id="476">And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightmare because I was so terrified that I would not find myself at this tiny village -- no, it wasn't Eilshausen, do forgive me, Eilshausen was my final destination. </sentence><sentence id="477">The station I had to get out at was Badounhausen. </sentence><sentence id="478">Badenhausen, which was a base for British soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="479">And I had to find my way from Badenhausen, which was quite a long way, to Eilshausen, which was the headquarters of our unit, where Henry Lunzer, the capt -- a former captain in the British army, and who was then the director of the Jewish reli-lief unit, had set up our headquarters in the village. </sentence><sentence id="480">And because of the fact that I had taken a secretarial course at some stage, and was quite proficient in shorthand and typing, I was for the moment, to be his assistant. </sentence><sentence id="481">And so that was my route, Badenhausen and then on to Eilshausen. </sentence><sentence id="482">I had no idea how I was going to get to Eilshausen. </sentence><sentence id="483">Well eventually I managed to get out of the station, and I"! </sentence><sentence id="484">never forget it, it was an extraordinary sensation. </sentence><sentence id="485">I was in Germany, I was on a German station all on my own, with all my stuff. </sentence><sentence id="486">And I remember walking down the steps and walking into the street. </sentence><sentence id="487">And I remember hearing German, seeing German lettering, an-and this somehow German shops and the names of things in German, and German voices, and a s -- a terrible sense of panic. </sentence><sentence id="488">And it was the -- didn't -- doesn't -- didn't happen to me very often, but I really for the moment was frozen. </sentence><sentence id="489">And I remember standing there and thinking, "My God," you know, "what have I done?" </sentence><sentence id="490">I'm in the middle of Germany -- it isn't the middle of Germany, but you know -- I'm in Germany, and I'm with all this stuff. </sentence><sentence id="491">And I actually had to get the things down in -- in dribs and drabs. </sentence><sentence id="492">I think somebody helped me because I couldn't carry all the stuff down the steps in one go. </sentence><sentence id="493">I think somebody did help me, and I was standing there. </sentence><sentence id="494">A British officer came up in a car. </sentence><sentence id="495">And of course, this is what happens, and you learn this in post-war situations. </sentence><sentence id="496">There is a kind of help that doesn't normally exist that you -- you suddenly get used to. </sentence><sentence id="497">He drove up and he said, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="498">And I said, "I -- I have to get to Eilshausen." </sentence><sentence id="499">He said, "Where the devil is that?" </sentence><sentence id="500">I said, "I haven't a clue." </sentence><sentence id="501">And he said, "Well get in the car and I'll take you to my head -- my HQ, and -- and we'll try and find out where Eilshausen is." </sentence><sentence id="502">So I went with him to his HQ in Badenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="503">And you know, I can't remember whether I ate -- I can remember cleaning up, I do remember that. </sentence><sentence id="504">I remember there was some sort of provision there, and I -- I cleaned myself up a bit. </sentence><sentence id="505">I must have been filthy because the week in Calais, it was not the most hygienic. </sentence><sentence id="506">And I felt an awful wreck, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="507">And eventually -- but I don't remember eating anything at all, except on the train. </sentence><sentence id="508">And then he came down, and he was very efficient, rather like something you see in British war films now, on a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="509">You know, very elegant, very beautiful, very well spoken. </sentence><sentence id="510">And he said, "Look, I -- I've -- P've found a -- I've found somebody who -- we found Eilshausen, it's a small village, Ill get you there." </sentence><sentence id="511">I'm still conscious of the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="512">I was very grateful that somehow -- you know, this -- this curious thing of sh -- of pride and shame, you know, what was the yellow star going to do for us out there? </sentence><sentence id="513">Was it going to open doors, was it going to bring hostility? </sentence><sentence id="514">But ""d    explained to him what we were about, and he took it perfectly in his stride. </sentence><sentence id="515">And they found a driver for me, and finding a driver and finding a truck in those days was hard work. </sentence><sentence id="516">So I had to wait quite a long time, and then I was taken to Eilshausen. </sentence><sentence id="517">And I remember when I got to Eilshausen, which is a tiny, little village, and I met with Henry Lunzer, and I think he -- he and I at that time, at that moment, were the only people there, although some British officers were coming over that evening for whatever, I don't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="518">And he was in -- we were ina commandeered house. </sentence><sentence id="519">It was the house of the local Nazi, and that was the kind of way things were done there, that people were billeted in the houses of the former Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="520">And the former Nazi would have been Nazi leader, I don't know whether he was imprisoned or whatever the situation was for him. </sentence><sentence id="521">But certainly some of his staff was still around, and I was very conscious of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="782">On the other hand she didn't see the significance of showing me the picture of her son standing near the Arc de Triomphe. </sentence><sentence id="783">I did have to point that out to her. </sentence><sentence id="784">It was a -- it was difficult, this relationship with local Germans, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="785">And I remember looking out of the window one day when a colleague of mine, Edith Blau, who'd been in a concentration camp, and who'd been liberated with her mother by the Russians, and both of them were living in our house -- as I say, people came and went, and people stayed, and she stayed. </sentence><sentence id="786">And she's now in this country, in -- in England. </sentence><sentence id="787">And she was passing a group of Germans in -- she was in uniform with a yellow star, she became a member of our team. </sentence><sentence id="788">And Is -- I was looking out of the window and I saw her strike, very hard, one of the German women who'd obviously made a remark about the Jews, having seen the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="789">So    tensions were high. </sentence><sentence id="790">Strange things did happen. </sentence><sentence id="791">There were stories about Germans putting wire across the streets in order that British soldiers on motorcycle could be decapitated, and that did happen. </sentence><sentence id="792">And it was an uneasy time. </sentence><sentence id="793">You did not sleep easily, let me put it that way. </sentence><sentence id="794">You -- you were aware, all the time, of tensions, of hatred. </sentence><sentence id="795">Your own and others. </sentence><sentence id="796">And that was hard. </sentence><sentence id="797">That was hard, that bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: Well, for the first few weeks of my job, I think, was trying to help Henry to get some sort of order into what was a fairly chaotic situation, and to try to formulate some kind of strategy for the administration of a headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="824">I'd never had any experience of that before, but he, being an army officer, a captain in the British army, had experienced -- and so I learned from him. </sentence><sentence id="825">And we did quite well, I think; he was efficient. </sentence><sentence id="826">But after just a couple of days we went to Belsen together. </sentence><sentence id="827">We drove. </sentence><sentence id="828">And a ye -- part of Mrs. Henriekie's team, she led the first team into Belsen, the first team of the Jewish Relief Unit into Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="829">And her team was there, and I must say I was incredibly nervous. </sentence><sentence id="830">It was reassuring being with Henry, but nevertheless, I was very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="831">Now, I can't remember that first day very well. </sentence><sentence id="832">We went to the -- to the concrete blocks which had belonged to the -- oh, to the ger -- German army -- to the -- forgive me, Ill come back to that. </sentence><sentence id="833">But you know that the people who'd been in -- liberated from camp one, when camp one was burned down, they were taken to the concrete blocks, where the German army had -- had been billeted. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: It was the former German barracks, but I -- I -- I do not -- th-the name, it has escaped me. </sentence><sentence id="848">Some people refer to is as the former SS bar -- barracks. </sentence><sentence id="849">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="850">But whatever, the people were incarcerated there in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="851">And the barracks were bleak, they were kind of solid blocks of concrete. </sentence><sentence id="852">I can't remember the lighting. </sentence><sentence id="853">I always remember it as very dim. </sentence><sentence id="854">I remember candles. </sentence><sentence id="855">I remember staying all night one -- on one occasion with s-somebody who died in one of the rooms. </sentence><sentence id="856">And it was over time talking to people in the rooms that bu -- was my first encounter with the inmates. </sentence><sentence id="857">Now, it wasn't on that first day. </sentence><sentence id="858">That first day was a kind of initiation into the whole atmosphere of Bergen-Belsen at that time. </sentence><sentence id="859">I met the unit -- the workers. </sentence><sentence id="860">I went to camp one, which had been burned down. </sentence><sentence id="861">I saw the mounds, these huge mounds where had -- which had formed the mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="862">It was very -- there was always about that place particularly, that camp one, there was this strange, sweet smell which I -- I know to be the smell of death. </sentence><sentence id="863">I believe it to be, but I always refer to it as the smell of geraniums, because that's what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="864">It was like taking the leaves of the geraniums and crushing them in your hand and then smelling them. </sentence><sentence id="865">And it's -- it's a sweet, dank smell, and that was the smell. </sentence><sentence id="866">And I've never forgotten it. </sentence><sentence id="867">And sometimes I'm reminded of it when the smell returns, that kind of dank smell. </sentence><sentence id="868">And this sense of awfulness, the sense of death was there in that space that was empty. </sentence><sentence id="869">There were no bodies, there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="870">There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty space. </sentence><sentence id="871">And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was by the side of you. </sentence><sentence id="872">You felt very uneasy. </sentence><sentence id="873">I -- I know that I went there the first day, and I went there many times with other people who were involved in some kind of mourning. </sentence><sentence id="874">They may be people who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much later, this was much later -- or they were the inmates, although very few of them went there. </sentence><sentence id="875">But I went there sometimes, and I attended the ceremony there, where the monument was erected, the first monument, in memory. </sentence><sentence id="876">I believe there's a picture somewhere of my unit marching. </sentence><sentence id="877">It's somewhere in the Vina library, and I've never been to see it, but I believe it exists, because people have told me that it does, and they recognize me, mainly I think because I was very small, and I was in front for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="878">But I returned many times, and I spent many days there, and I spent a long period in the winter, because I remember sleeping in a sleeping bag with all my clothes on in the very cold winters that followed. </sentence><sentence id="879">And what was I doing there? </sentence><sentence id="880">And that's the difficulty, I can't really remember that [had a particular role as I had in other places. </sentence><sentence id="881">I went and I talked, and I can't remember anybody asking me to do that, or seeing any value in it. </sentence><sentence id="882">So maybe I elected to go. </sentence><sentence id="883">When I knew that a driver or somebody was going to Belsen, which was very frequent, people frequently went there with provisions or with papers, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="884">There was no other way of communicating than by going somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="885">The telephone systems were down, and it was very difficult to make telephone calls. </sentence><sentence id="886">And so it was -- the easiest thing was to always go to a place. </sentence><sentence id="887">So it is not surprising that I elected to go, and I elected to go I think because over time I found that by talking to people -- that by receiving the information that they gave me, was in itself a v -- a v -- a value. </sentence><sentence id="888">That doesn't sound very profound, but people who give the most terrible information, of death, destruction, loss. </sentence><sentence id="889">Who rock with misery and despair, who are desperately fearful, who want to die, many of them, but can't, it's very important to receive that information in a way that says to people, I am your witness, I am here to tell your story. </sentence><sentence id="890">If you can't tell it, I will be able to tell it for you. </sentence><sentence id="891">But all I can be is your witness, I can't take away the past. </sentence><sentence id="892">Now I didn't learn that quickly, I learned it painfully because I always felt I couldn't do anything, what am I doing here?I can't take away the past, I can't change anything. </sentence><sentence id="893">So what is the value of my presence, and why do I keep coming? </sentence><sentence id="894">And I think it was because I began to learn that being a witness, simple and ordinary and limited as that may be, does have a value to the person who may not live very long, and who knows it. </sentence><sentence id="895">And so, I think in a way that was one of my tasks, but why I spent so many weeks there, sleeping on the floor, and what work I did with Henry there, or with anybody else, I honestly can't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="896">I later went back there many times, when I was responsible much later for what was referred to as the TB train. </sentence><sentence id="897">I was sent to nic -- by Henry, to negotiate in Switzerland with a Jewish organization, humanitarian organization for the transfer of young people suffering from tuberculosis, who -- whose chance of recovery would be very much greater if they were taken to Switzerland to recover, which was one of the ways people treated tuberculosis in those days. </sentence><sentence id="898">And I went to Switzerland and I met this extraordinary woman. </sentence><sentence id="899">And I remember saying to her -- I wasn't in uniform, and I don't know why, maybe it was politic -- no, to be -- I just can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="900">And I remember saying to her, "Why -- why -- how did you recognize me?" </sentence><sentence id="901">And she said, "It really wasn't difficult to recognize you, I would have recognized you anywhere, as one Jew to another." </sentence><sentence id="902">Anyway, I went with the x-rays, and when I say I went with the x-rays, believe me, I'm saying something extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="903">Because to persuade people, young people, who were desperate to leave Belsen and other camps, desperate to get out, to emigrate to America or to England, desperate to get out. </sentence><sentence id="904">To persuade them to have an x-ray to identify that they were suffering tuberculosis was the last thing that they wanted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="967">Q: Because it excluded them from -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="968">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="969">Q: -- going to this country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="971">A: Yes, they would not be acceptable, and they knew that. </sentence><sentence id="972">And there was all kinds of maneuvering and manipulation of x-rays, and t -- name changing, and I mean it was a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="973">And it -- it was a killer, I mean I -- I worked incredibly hard, and I remember losing my voice with the sheer -- you know, the -- the energy needed to persuade people that they wouldn't be able to go anyway, that they would be identified anyway at some point as having the illness. </sentence><sentence id="974">And I'd hoped I was right to do that. </sentence><sentence id="975">I wasn't working alone, I had a -- good advisors, but I had to persuade people. </sentence><sentence id="976">And then I had to persuade this -- to go with this delightful woman and persuade the Swiss authorities. </sentence><sentence id="977">And I remember a very suave, very beautiful, tall Swiss gentleman, who made clear to me, reluctantly, that yes, a certain number of young people would be acceptable to the Swiss, to go to Davose to be treated for their tuberculosis, on the understanding only that they were -- could recover, and that they could return to Germany at the end of their treatment. </sentence><sentence id="978">And that was th -- one of the first political lessons of my lifetime, because I learned about the la -- lo -- lack of compassion, I lat -- learned about politics, and in that one meeting, I learned it all. </sentence><sentence id="979">I learned about officialdom, bureaucracy that -- that -- that -- tha-tha -- that -- that protects people from the truth, it protects people from looking at that sick, young person. </sentence><sentence id="980">And I was very sick at heart myself, I was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="981">But I'd actually got the agreement, so I went back to Germany, and then there was an enormous activity on my part, and others helping me, to try to arrange for the evacuation of the young people. </sentence><sentence id="982">And I have pictures of this that can be supplied, to go on what was referred to as the TB train from Hanover station, which was bombed and derelict, catastrophically so, to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="983">And eventually -- I mean it was, I suppose, a triumph, but nothing -- it didn't feel like a triumph, really. </sentence><sentence id="984">Nothing -- it just felt right, I suppose, that young people should be treated eventually after many months, having fought with many officials, British army officials in -- particularly on one occasion, when I needed a document that hadn't come. </sentence><sentence id="985">They needed about five or six different permissions in order to leave the camps, from the British military government. </sentence><sentence id="986">And if they hadn't got all five or six, they couldn't travel. </sentence><sentence id="987">And in one case I had to go to Diisseldorf, I think it was, and persuade them to allow a young person in Diisseldorf to travel to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="988">And I think we were all day trying to persuade them. </sentence><sentence id="989">Finally I think it was only because we offered a lift. </sentence><sentence id="990">We were going to Berlin to catch the train, to put the document on the train. </sentence><sentence id="991">I mean, it's all very primitive stuff. </sentence><sentence id="992">And -- and I got per -- I think that he was persuaded because we gave a lift to somebody to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="993">And finally I got the documents. </sentence><sentence id="994">Eventually the train went, but it was made clear to me by UNRRA and the Red Cross, that if -- that I was short of one particular document necessary for the TB train. </sentence><sentence id="995">And that, you know, I would be held responsible for that, that everything was on course, that the TB train would come. </sentence><sentence id="996">It was all arranged by the Red Cross, but that at the last minute, there could be a hitch, and that that was my responsibility because I hadn't got this document. </sentence><sentence id="997">So I remember standing on this train, waiting for it to go, and the sense of fear and trepidation, everybody was happy. </sentence><sentence id="998">The children, the young people were laughing and singing and looking out of the window, and I was terrified that at the end of the day there would be a hitch. </sentence><sentence id="999">Some official, some army official would come along and say I'm so sorry, but this is not correct, there's -- something here is missing. </sentence><sentence id="1000">However, it went. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And I remember jumping off the train and think, my God, it's gone. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And looking at this train -- and you've got to picture Hanover station without a roof, with things hanging down, and this train wobbling away, and the kids hanging out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And I remember standing there with tears running down my face and thinking it's going to be all right, they're going to go -- I don't know what happened to the children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1147">A: Yes, I do. </sentence><sentence id="1148">The day I arrived in Belsen, we were told that a woman who'd had a -- a child by, I think a Ukrainian guard, had drunk Lysol, and her -- poured the Lysol down the throat of her child, and they both died. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And it -- it was horrific. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And it was -- yes, it's strange I didn't remember that at first, that that was so important. </sentence><sentence id="1151">But we all block. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And there was a sense of real horror and upset amongst the workers about this woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1171">A: I think we often lacked supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I remember on one occasion we were waiting for some supplies to come, and eventually a -- a truck arrived at the -- our headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And it turned out to be a traveling synagogue and didn't have the supplies that we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And those of us who were less religiously inclined had quite a lot to say at the time, including myself. </sentence><sentence id="1175">We were furious, and very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1176">Oh, so much for what people feel you need. </sentence><sentence id="1177">It was -- I mean, a lot of supplies were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="1178">ORT was very good. </sentence><sentence id="1179">There were other American organizations </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1180"> bringing in supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And we ourselves did have supplies and we did man the hospital in Belsen, which was run, I think, by one of the nun's sisters, who was a m -- a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="1182">Henry Lunzer -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1183">Q: So this is a -- this is a sister of your boss? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1184">A: Yes, yes, yes, and she was running the hospital there. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And I remember her showing us around the hospital, and the hospital was called the Glen Hughes Hospital after Brigadier Glen Hughes who reli -- who liberated Belsen, and who was, I believe, a remarkable man. </sentence><sentence id="1186">What can I say about the hospital? </sentence><sentence id="1187">I think I learned -- I learned so much in those months I was in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1188">You know, I think what I -- I learned, looking at what was going on in that hospital -- you've got to remember that nurses of the 30's and the 40's were brought up to believe in everything being absolutely pristine, to be -- you know, to have sheets that are tightly drawn, to have -- you know, to have everything clean, and -- and cared for. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And again, it's like all the bureaucracies -- I mean, I do understand it, it -- it is -- the idea of chaos is always frightening, but chaos can sometimes be quite healing. </sentence><sentence id="1190">And what I thought was very good, was when I watched people helping their own people. </sentence><sentence id="1191">By that I mean maybe relatives, maybe friends, maybe a child, somebody feeding their -- their relative, or their friend. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And it would be a mess. </sentence><sentence id="1193">The cl -- the cl -- the -- the bed would be in a mess. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Their trembling hands would never quite reach the mouth appropriately and there would be mess all over the bedclothes, and -- but -- but there was a to -- it was noise, and there was bustle, and there was a sense of activity. </sentence><sentence id="1195">And I think that that is far safer for healing than the kind of -- the preparation for -- you na -- this sort of -- you being prepared for death with your white sheet tucked tightly round you, and I'm simplifying something very much, and I must be forgiven for that, because there is a place for order in a hospital scene, and many people do ask for it. </sentence><sentence id="1196">But there are situations in which chaos and care can match, and can bring about solutions. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And when I started, many years later with a group of other mothers, an association for the welfare of children in hospitals, so that mothers could go into hospital with their small children under the age of five, I remembered all the time the lessons that I'd learned in that hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And that is that sometimes it's better for a bit of chaos if you are looking after your child, and the sense of care and love is there. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And there will be people who will disagree with me about this, and people who will remember everything about Belsen differently than I do, but I was only 20 years old, impressionable, taking everything in and not all of it may be as coherent as the listener would wish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1217">Q: Well, you say you were very young, as indeed you were, but in -- how could you, at such a very young age, absorb and make any sense of what you were seeing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1219">A: I think I was all -- you know, I don't remember approp -- this sounds rather self indulgent, but I don't remember a proper childhood. </sentence><sentence id="1220">I remember being a very grown-up child. </sentence><sentence id="1221">Not willingly, but somehow forced upon me by circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="1222">I was always very serious, although I enjoyed fun, and I enjoyed fun when I was in Germany with my comrades. </sentence><sentence id="1223">We had lots of fun and laughter, like one does in extreme situations. </sentence><sentence id="1224">But -- I mean, you -- it -- it's difficult now to -- to be honest, and to say did I absorb all that then, or have I somehow taken it in and absorbed it slowly over the years? </sentence><sentence id="1225">And there may be something in the latter, because every time I look back, I realize of things I learned, and maybe I didn't realize at the time I was learning about human relationships, about everything, and about hatred, about love, everything was encapsulated in that experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1233">Q: Given the kind of desperate physical and psychological state of -- of these survivors, how did you begin? </sentence><sentence id="1234">Can you recall how you began trying to reach out to them, and help them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1237">A: I can't remember trying. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I remember moving into the blocks and talking, and being a ve -- and sort of sitting on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I mean, don't misunderstand, as people became stronger, they became angry, and you, being the carer, you being the provider, would often become the target for people's anger, because you could not provide the answers. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So I think with the creativity that existed amongst some of the survivors, and our own need to feed into that, we were able to support some of the things that were going on. </sentence><sentence id="1241">For example, Yosul, and Dr. Bunko, and somebody called Norbert Fallheim, who later committed suicide, formed a committee within the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1242">They were representatives of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1243">We were the next sort of go-between between ourselves, between them, and UNRRA, and the military government. </sentence><sentence id="1244">So we would naturally, whilst we were supporting what they were doing, at the same time we would become the recipients of much of their anger. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And I can remember sitting in an old Merck car that had been commandeered from somewhere by somebody, sort of closely packed in at the back with Norbert, and Yosul, and somebody else, and myself desperately trying to take notes with Henry and somebody else in the front, while they were raging and ranting and very angry indeed. </sentence><sentence id="1246">About -- but you see, curiously enough, I think it was a relief because it was human, and it was life. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And it was such a relief from the desperate, dejected, huddled figures. </sentence><sentence id="1248">You know, sometimes when I used to go -- when I first started to go into the rooms, people didn't look like human beings, they -- th-they were all kind of like a huddle of clothes sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1249">It was quite horrible, because it was dim, and y -- and you couldn't always identify nu -- it -- and here were people shouting about what they wanted, and being very angry, with us, with them, with everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1250">And in a way, although I felt very vulnerable sometimes, at being shouted at, I also was a go- between in my familiar familial pattern, between them and my own hierarchy, between them and Henry. </sentence><sentence id="1251">And so they would come to me, either in Eilshausen, and they would ask me to negotiate, and they would complain about Henry, and then they would complain to Henry about UNRRA, and then all the rest of it and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Because of course, what they wanted more than anything else was freedom, and they hadn't got it. </sentence><sentence id="1253">1 mean, I'm making it sound as if I understood it all, and I don't think I did. </sentence><sentence id="1254">I think it's only with hindsight that I can talk about anger as being something very positive. </sentence><sentence id="1255">But it's something that makes you feel alive, whereas when I used to see the people huddled, and I thought to myself, I wonder if they're going to die, th -- I'd -- I -- I think I just felt that I could do more in that situation of vigor and anger, and -- and vision, because they had a vision of what they wanted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: Which was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1279">A: Well, they wanted out. </sentence><sentence id="1280">They wanted out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1281">Some people wanted -- you know, this is a difficulty now, this is a big difficulty, because people talk about the formation of an organization that was -- whose aim was Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Now, my recollection is that there were many people who wanted to go, for one reason or another, either to America or to England. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And obviously they couldn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1289">Q: When you say obviously, can you explain that for us? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1291">A: Well, it's very little different than it is now, really. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I don't think you could get into England unless you were sponsored by a relative or friend, and sponsored quite energetically. </sentence><sentence id="1293">You had to be able to provide for that person completely and absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And one or two people did go from Kownitz. </sentence><sentence id="1295">So I don't remember anybody going from -- from Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And others wanted to go to America, and I'm sure some did. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And some people did come to -- to England. </sentence><sentence id="1298">But there were many -- the majority didn't and couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And I think it was only with the realization that nobody really wanted them again -- yet again. </sentence><sentence id="1300">That no -- that the doors were not opening generously to -- and -- and -- and with -- what's the word I want? </sentence><sentence id="1301">Like, with countries joining together in order to provide a solution for this group of people, who remained there, some of them, until 1950. </sentence><sentence id="1302">Which is a very long time from 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1303">So it's not surprising that people became more militant and more determined that Palestine was the only solution for the Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1317">Q: Again, let me take you back a little bit, because I think a lot of us don't know quite as much and -- and we need filling in. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I'm very interested to know what a typical day was, or a typical week in your life out there, or in the life of the team. </sentence><sentence id="1319">What you did in the office, what you did with the people, you know, in a fairly basic kind of way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1323">A: I mean, I was very involved with Henry in trying to negotiate for better facilities within the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And withi -- and within groups where Jewish people had -- had -- had come and were in need of provision, and -- and -- and support. </sentence><sentence id="1325">And so we would be writing and Henry would be meeting -- I might accompany him with others, to try to negotiate, either with UNRRA or with the British government for better facilities here, and better facilities there. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I would write endless letters, and I would be -- spend a huge amount of time screaming down the telephone because the telephones did exist, but it was almost impossible to hear anyone, and you would spend hours trying to get somebody, and it made such a difference because otherwise you just had to get ina truck and go. </sentence><sentence id="1327">So I would do normal secretarial work in support for Henry. </sentence><sentence id="1328">I would accompany him, particularly where Yosul and Norbert was concerned -- were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1329">But I spent a lot of time -- and this again is something I'd -- I can't put -- I can't be too correct about, because I simply can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1330">I went to Kownitz camp -- what happened at Kownitz was that -- and I can't even tell you exactly where it is -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1331">Q: This was a camp for women, was it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1332">A: There were mainly women, there were some men, but there were li -- a large number of Hungarians -- Hungarian woman, but there were some young men. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And we got a telegram to the unit, which -- which I -- it came to me, saying that -- that they were desperate, that they had no provisions, no means of support, that -- that there was this camp, and there was nothing and they were desperate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1337">Q: How many people were there, do you recollect? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1339">A: A lot. </sentence><sentence id="1340">I don't remember the number, and I can't tell you the number. </sentence><sentence id="1341">It was quite -- it must have been about 600 - 700 people, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1342">And I went there, but I don't remember with whom. </sentence><sentence id="1343">I went there with somebody and we had a meeting in a room, up some stairs, wooden stairs with -- there were only candles, it was very cold then, very cold. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1349">Q: Which winter was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1351">A: The first. </sentence><sentence id="1352">I just wish one could remember more, who was with me. </sentence><sentence id="1353">And I went back with whoever, and negotiated for provisions, for supplies, for acknowledgement that this camp existed and needed, you know, the support of UNRRA and other facilities, as well as our own. </sentence><sentence id="1354">But then they got -- was a -- was a situation in which I would go very frequently to the camp, and that doesn't seem to be acknowledged by anybody now who can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1355">Neither Henry, nor Allison Ward, with -- who was our personnel officer, and who is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1356">Both are still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Neither have a clear recollection of Kownitz. </sentence><sentence id="1358">Allison said yes, she remembers that I used to go off frequently with this former Hungarian Jewish Brigade leader, and that we would work there. </sentence><sentence id="1359">But I can't tell you how it was, whether I elected to g -- I know I must have elected to go because I was there so often. </sentence><sentence id="1360">I was there for their first Pesach, which we had in the open. </sentence><sentence id="1361">And I remember we arrived late, and they were quite fed up with us for being late, and they had to carry me across all the tables, and there was enormous hilarity about that, as I was carried aloft across tables. </sentence><sentence id="1362">And I got to know them very well. </sentence><sentence id="1363">But they needed a lot of support, they were young women, who were very beautiful many of them, who were very si -- very vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="1364">Who the person I was working with was very anxious to protect from the sexual advances of any soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And I remember a very moving discussion in which he spoke, and said -- and I was so touched that in the middle of Germany, in the middle of all this mess, a camp that was mud, you were up to your ankles in mud at the time -- or later, because it was snowing then, but he -- he spoke to the women and told them, you must preserve yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1366">You've been preserved for a reason. </sentence><sentence id="1367">I can remember it to this day. </sentence><sentence id="1368">You've been preserved for a reason. </sentence><sentence id="1369">Don't destroy yourselves, don't capitulate to men who find you beautiful and who want to give you chocolate, and who want to try to help you, and maybe not help you. </sentence><sentence id="1370">He was really telling them, you have a sexuality which you're only just realizing because in the camp your hair was cut, you didn't have your periods, you now do -- but he didn't say this in so many words. </sentence><sentence id="1371">But he gave this very moving talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="1372">I was so touched by this, and thought it was so wonderful that -- that we should be talking there, preserve yourselves somehow as a woman, and as women. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And it's important. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And then we danced, I remember we did lots of dancing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1400">Q: What kind of dancing was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1402">A: Oh, anything, we just danced. </sentence><sentence id="1403">We danced the hora a lot, and -- hora, and then we -- there were people who knew various variations that I'd never seen before, that were fascinating. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And lots of songs and wonderful, it was wonderful the way -- it was full of life. </sentence><sentence id="1405">I met two of the woman later, here. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And they'd managed somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1407">But i-it's -- I-I don't know what we were trying to do there, we were trying and -- i-i-it was such a unsupported group of people, and it was so primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I think it was a very primitive camp. </sentence><sentence id="1409">Somebody once described it as a very good one. </sentence><sentence id="1410">I thought it was very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1411">I remember there was a sort of wooden toilet, you know, one of these open jobs, and sort of just by the side of the camp, and you know, you had to have people on guard when you went in there, because there's no way you could fasten the door, and it was -- it -- that place was cold and primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1412">We got supplies in, we got learning material in. </sentence><sentence id="1413">We did something. </sentence><sentence id="1414">We did our best. </sentence><sentence id="1415">End of Tape Two, Side B    Beginning Tape Three, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1432">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Helen Bamber. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Now, the survivors who you dealt with were now officially displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="1434">What did that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1438">A: Well, first of all it meant that as far as the officials were concerned, the word survivor or victim had gone out of their vocabulary, and the word displaced persons, which is a sort of anonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a useful shield, just as we use the word asylum seekers today, so the word displaced persons, and then DPs, even worse, was used. </sentence><sentence id="1439">So the compassion that was there at the very beginning, and the sense of outrage when the camp was liberated, had gone, in my view. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And the DPs, displaced persons were seen as a problem, number one. </sentence><sentence id="1441">So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a nuisance, a -- a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1442">They were vocal, they'd become articulate, they had their committee, they were demanding, they wanted rights. </sentence><sentence id="1443">What wa -- what rights did they want? </sentence><sentence id="1444">They wanted rights within the camp, as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1445">They wanted rights of travel. </sentence><sentence id="1446">They wanted to be able to move about Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And that was very difficult because as far as I remember, and this - - this can be corrected by others, the people in the camps were not allowed to leave or to travel without special permit. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Now, in the early days, many of the young displaced persons went particularly, as I remember, to Poland, mainly to try to find their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1449">They went to their old, former homes to find their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1450">When they got there, they were set upon by the local people, who drove them out, and some killings took place, and some assaults took place. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And the people, bedraggled, and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet, would return back into Germany, and back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1452">I use barbed wire as a -- as a -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarceration. </sentence><sentence id="1453">So their options were very limited. </sentence><sentence id="1454">If they wanted to find their relatives -- and this was at the beginning, for the first year or so was the most important as I remember it, was the finding of relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Now we had set up a search bureau in Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And that was one of the things that one of the volunteers in our unit had trained at doing was to set up a search bureau. </sentence><sentence id="1457">People who would come to the camp, again presumably illegally because they would come and there was no way in which they should have been able to enter or to leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper, rolled up paper. </sentence><sentence id="1458">It was probably cigarette paper, with the names of relatives on it, asking has anybody seen or heard of so and so? </sentence><sentence id="1459">And the names would be on these little bits of paper. </sentence><sentence id="1460">And they would give them to you, or they would give them to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1461">They would just hand them out, and you would -- you would do your best. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1487">Q: How did the search bureau work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1489">A: I'm not well acquainted with the search bureau. </sentence><sentence id="1490">The search bureau presumably tried to marry people through the camp, or through other means, relatives of the named person, so -- on the piece of paper. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So, it did it's job. </sentence><sentence id="1492">Whether it did it adequately, I can't say. </sentence><sentence id="1493">It was primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1494">But in some cases people were reunited. </sentence><sentence id="1495">There were other search bureaus that were established as time went on. </sentence><sentence id="1496">I'm not quite sure if the Red Cross was not involved also in trying to reunite people. </sentence><sentence id="1497">That also can be confirmed. </sentence><sentence id="1498">I have -- you -- you know, I have a very fragmented, compartmentalized memory of this particular period of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1499">So I can't really speak with authority about the organization of the search bureaus. </sentence><sentence id="1500">I know that there were several, I know that we had one in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And I know that people came searching for their relatives, handing bits of paper to each other in order to see whether somebody remembered somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1502">It was pathetic, and very sad. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Full of pathos, very sad to watch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1519">Q: You'd been -- you'd been speaking earlier about the options available to people now -- once they were DPs, if you like. </sentence><sentence id="1520">Can you tell us a little more about the options they were seeking? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1526">Q: But what about those who -- who had their eyes set on other countries? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1528">A: I think my memory is of people wanting to come, many of them, to England or to America. </sentence><sentence id="1529">There was no means by which they really could simply ask to come. </sentence><sentence id="1530">I'm not sure if the American quota system was operating in the way that it normally does. </sentence><sentence id="1531">In other words, so many from -- you know, that you're on the German quota list, or the Romanian, Hungarian, or Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1532">But what I do know was that it wasn't possible simply to enter the US, or the UK, not really. </sentence><sentence id="1533">Some people did, and they're very proud of it, and they say it as though anybody could have done it, but they must forgive me, I don't believe it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise they would have done it. </sentence><sentence id="1534">I-It's -- it was hard for people, they couldn't get out, and they couldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1535">They couldn't go -- the Iron Curtain had already fallen, they couldn't go to the Iron Curtain countries. </sentence><sentence id="1536">They knew that they would be badly treated if they did. </sentence><sentence id="1537">They knew what was going on by returnees. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And so what were their options? </sentence><sentence id="1539">To find their relatives, to -- but then, as the months passed people realized that nothing had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1540">Perhaps they had found a relative, perhaps they'd accepted that that was it, that nobody was alive. </sentence><sentence id="1541">Or they lived in hopes, but they still wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Outside the camps, of course, the Germans were beginning to mingle, to fraternize with British, American and other soldiers in the various zones. </sentence><sentence id="1543">And this came very hard to the inmates, the fact that they were still displaced persons while something else was going on outside. </sentence><sentence id="1544">I believe then that a hardening of attitudes took place, a realization for many that they were not wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1545">That was the feeling, that nobody really wanted to open their doors. </sentence><sentence id="1546">I mean, many people returned to Holland, some maybe to France. </sentence><sentence id="1547">But on the whole, people remained, and they didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="1548">So, I think that is when -- and again I must be forgiven by tha -- by those people who see it differently, but I begin that i -- I believe that it was then that the idea of becoming more Zionist, wanting to go to Palestine is the only solution for their problem. </sentence><sentence id="1549">And I believe it was then that it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mission. </sentence><sentence id="1550">So people began to learn Hebrew if they didn't already know it. </sentence><sentence id="1551">They became more militant. </sentence><sentence id="1552">There were the illegal transportations to -- to cross frontiers to try to get illegally to Palestine one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="1553">And of course, many people perished on the way. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1583">A: What did I know? </sentence><sentence id="1584">Well, everybody knew that it was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1585">It was no secret. </sentence><sentence id="1586">An organization grew, an organization of -- I'm not giving it a name, I don't know it -- whether there ever was a name, but you know, with all these situations of -- of despair and need, a militancy grows, an urgency grows. </sentence><sentence id="1587">People are not going to stay in that situation forever. </sentence><sentence id="1588">And historically this has always happened. </sentence><sentence id="1589">It's happening now with the Kurds, and it's happened elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1590">People want something for themselves, and they want freedom and safety. </sentence><sentence id="1591">And people will, if they're not allowed to negotiate for it, they will try to take it. </sentence><sentence id="1592">And so people began to go illegally, and cross frontiers illegally. </sentence><sentence id="1593">And transports from the camps were organized. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1605">Q: From yours as well, among the people you knew? </sentence><sentence id="1606">That's to say, inmates held at Belsen also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1609">A: And Kownitz, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1610">Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1613">Q: So how would you find out about this? </sentence><sentence id="1614">Would you turn up one day and there'd be fewer people? </sentence><sentence id="1615">Or did it work other ways? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1619">A: [know -- I know relatively little about the transports. </sentence><sentence id="1620">They were small. </sentence><sentence id="1621">People didn't go in large numbers, to my knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1622">I remember one particular incident, let me concentrate on that. </sentence><sentence id="1623">We were told at the -- our headquarters that -- or we found out somehow, that there were a group    of I suppose about 15 to 20 people being held in a British army post. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And I can't tell you where it was, but it was a group of DPs who had been found crossing the Dutch frontier illegally and they were now being held, and had been held for many months in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1625">And in this camp, when we eventually got there, we found that the camp was also a holding place for infamous war criminals and Germans who had -- who -- with a -- with a poor reputation. </sentence><sentence id="1626">So I went with the leader of the Jewish brigade, who drove one lorry, and I think, too, we had another lorry with -- or truck, large truck, which would house another group, and a small, kind of mobile ambulance which was intended for the pregnant woman who was quite near term. </sentence><sentence id="1627">So I think we probably had a nurse with us. </sentence><sentence id="1628">I can't remember that, but I would imagine so, otherwise it would not be necessary or prudent to just have the ambulance. </sentence><sentence id="1629">So I think we must have had a nurse with us. </sentence><sentence id="1630">So there were several of us, and when we got to the camp, the lorries stood in the comp -- in the main kind of open area, bef -- we -- we came into an open space. </sentence><sentence id="1631">On the left of us was this open camp site with barbed wire, in which the Germans were standing or pacing. </sentence><sentence id="1632">And there was one woman, whose name I think has been given as Irma Grace, but I'm not sure if it was she, and I will check that for the record, but it was definitely a woman of -- who was well-known for her crimes. </sentence><sentence id="1633">And -- and when the lorries stopped, and we were to get out and go and negotiate with the British post, the inmates, the German inmates started to chant. </sentence><sentence id="1634">They realized that we had come for, in inverted commas, the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And they began to chant, and it wasn't a very friendly chant. </sentence><sentence id="1636">Something similar to do -- Jews, Jews, out with the Jews, but nasty stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1637">I can't remember the exact words, but it was very ominous, and the whole scene was very ominous. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And as we began to -- as we negotiated, and we received the people, and they were walking towards the truck, and we were loading them onto the trucks, the chanting got louder, and louder, and louder. </sentence><sentence id="1639">And my colleague said, "Start them singing, get them singing." </sentence><sentence id="1640">And so they started to sing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1664">Q: The -- the Jews who you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1665">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1666">Q: -- had come to collect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1668">A: Mm. </sentence><sentence id="1669">And so, rather reminiscent of that film with Ingrid Bergman and -- you know, that famous "Casablanca" thing, but not dissimilar may I tell you, because the singing got louder and louder, and the chanting got louder, and it was extremely unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And I've never -- that scene, I -- I will never forget, because of it's ominous nature, it's pure, unadulterated hatred that was present, and the kind of slightly banal, rather semi-amused laid back attitude of the British soldiers from whom we were collecting the former inmates. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And they were from Kownitz, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And we took them in the trucks, and the proud, pregnant lady haughtily rejected the ambulance, and was most affronted. </sentence><sentence id="1673">So the ambulance, it trailed behind, and we had our two trucks and we took them back. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And it -- th-there was some exuberance I remember, some -- some sense of release, relief. </sentence><sentence id="1675">And there was a lot of singing, but people were tired, and exhausted, and it was a long drive, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1676">And I remember that there was a boy, young boy, and we held out our arms to help the people out of the -- out of the lorry, and he refused that, and he jumped down. </sentence><sentence id="1677">And I -- I talked to him for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And when we got back into the truck -- because people needed to relieve themselves, I think we had food as well, we got back into the truck, this young boy, as we dropped him off in -- in the compound in Kownitz said to me, "You will remember me. </sentence><sentence id="1679">Remember me." </sentence><sentence id="1680">And I said, "Yes, I'll remember you." </sentence><sentence id="1681">And I stayed in Kownitz, I -- I don't know where or how, I can't remember where I slept. </sentence><sentence id="1682">And I asked, I think, several days later where the group was, and I was told that they'd gone off again, and that this time they had crossed the frontier and they had got away. </sentence><sentence id="1683">So not, I think, the pregnant lady. </sentence><sentence id="1684">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Well, it may have been, but whatever, they had gone. </sentence><sentence id="1686">So yes, there were transports, and they behaved as all people do in these situations, with incredible determination and much courage. </sentence><sentence id="1687">Many died. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Some were shot crossing the frontiers as well. </sentence><sentence id="1689">But more than that, I don't -- I can't say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1713">Q: Just pause it there for a second. </sentence><sentence id="1714">I wanted to talk a little bit now about how the camp at Belsen functioned, how it was organized and -- and what people did all day whe -- when you first arrived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1717">A: You know, I'm not quite -- to be honest, I'm not quite clear about what people did all day as far as the inmates were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1718">| think -- it wasn't a camp that I worked in day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="1719">My impression is that they did very little at the beginning because they were so vulnerable, so debilitated, it would be difficult to imagine an actual activity. </sentence><sentence id="1720">I believe that the more orthodox gathered and prayed, and went about their devotions. </sentence><sentence id="1721">And I'm sure there was some activity, but there was very little structure to the camp as I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="1722">It was the emergence of Yosul Rosenzoft and Norbert Fallheim, and the establishment of a committee many months later. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And also with the presence of ORT providing workshops. </sentence><sentence id="1724">And I do have, and I w-will have to donate it at some time, a small pot, a small vase from some metal that was found somewhere, which someone gave me, which is one of the f -- one the early products of the er -- ORT workshop. </sentence><sentence id="1725">So people began to occupy themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1726">They began to form into their political and religious groupings. </sentence><sentence id="1727">The theater was established and became one of the liveliest and the most exciting exponents of resilience and life in the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1739">Q: Tell me about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1741">A: Well, the theater would start with, nearly always as far as I remember, with a very raw just sort of exposure on the stage of the destruction of a family. </sentence><sentence id="1742">The scene would start with the mother, father and children sitting round a table, very familiar table. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And you can see that they were joyful, that they were engaged with each other, arguing, discussing, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And then you heard the marching toward the door that would open on the family in which the Germans would come. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And you saw the family being beaten, being taken, you hear the screams, you see the mother being dragged away. </sentence><sentence id="1746">The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was played time and time and time again. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And it would be received in absolute silence. </sentence><sentence id="1748">It was the homage to the family, to the destroyed family. </sentence><sentence id="1749">Whether it was a form of mourning, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1750">It could -- it could have been. </sentence><sentence id="1751">It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage, letting the world know this is what happened to my family. </sentence><sentence id="1752">I think it was more that than mourning, because it's my view that many Holocaust survivors have never found the way to mourn such grotesque happenings as those that they witnessed and were part of. </sentence><sentence id="1753">So I think it's probably to do with -- to do with exposure of what happened, and wanting the world and everybody to see it. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And as the military government and -- and officials from UNRRA were often invited to th -- these concerts. </sentence><sentence id="1755">Not always, but -- but -- but especially so on some occasions, it's not surprising that they would want to say this. </sentence><sentence id="1756">This is, or was my family, and this is how it was for me. </sentence><sentence id="1757">It was incredibly intimate, and terrible to watch. </sentence><sentence id="1758">And there was never any applause, there was only silence. </sentence><sentence id="1759">But then there would be other things taking part. </sentence><sentence id="1760">I don't remember all of it, but I remember that very often there would be a kind of cabaret element to it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or Polish, or whatever, really making fun of, and poking the finger at the establishment of the British rule, the British command and the British zone, the attitude to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1761">There would be - - and it would be received with roars of laughter and applause, and at the end of which, of course, everybody stood up and applauded, including the front row of officials from the army, who'd hadn't understood a word of this cabaret. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And I think the cabaret was done very much in the old-fashioned kind of really sort of German style cabaret. </sentence><sentence id="1763">You know, it was ironic, it was -- it was -- it's meaning was very, very clear, and I believe it was very, very clever. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I didn't always understand it all. </sentence><sentence id="1765">And so the theater was very important, the hospital was important, the workshops, the committees. </sentence><sentence id="1766">The constant badgering for different individuals to move or do something, to go somewhere within Germany for whatever reason. </sentence><sentence id="1767">Other than that, I cannot really -- I cannot really remember other activities. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1797">Q: How about the -- the newspaper, wasn't there a newspaper? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1799">A: Oh yes, there was a newspaper, of course there was a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="1800">Yes, there was a newspaper produced with again, factual and ironic comments about the life of the DP, and the life of Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="1801">And -- and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1802">No, th -- th -- there's a newspaper, I wish -- I wonder if there's ever any of this left. </sentence><sentence id="1803">I've never seen anything. </sentence><sentence id="1804">So much was of the moment, and you don't think in terms of history, which one should. </sentence><sentence id="1805">Anyway, that's how it was, as far as I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1813">Q: So it went from being a rather desolate, to maybe quite a spirited place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1815">A: Yes, it was. </sentence><sentence id="1816">It had its spirit, it had its resilience, it had its sense of life. </sentence><sentence id="1817">And I think that there was a group of younger people there who were going to survive at all costs. </sentence><sentence id="1818">Somehow survival and strength meant a great deal to them, and I think that they very often turned towards the idea of Palestine as their solution. </sentence><sentence id="1819">Whether the Palestine or the Israel that we see now would have been different, I believe it might, but others don't agree with me. </sentence><sentence id="1820">Had Britain and America taken people more readily and quickly, and quickly solved this question of people remaining within the camp that once abused them -- I mean, there's nothing much worse than that, really. </sentence><sentence id="1821">Pretty awful stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1822">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1823">It may be a very simplistic way of looking at a very complex problem. </sentence><sentence id="1824">But the sense of not being wanted, and the sense of not being a victim again, was prevalent. </sentence><sentence id="1825">And I have seen it elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1826">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1839">Q: This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. </sentence><sentence id="1840">To what extent do you think the work that you did, and the work that your colleagues did contributed to this resurgence of the human spirit, if you'd like, in the camp? </sentence><sentence id="1841">The one that you've just described. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1845">A: I find it difficult to make claims, I always do. </sentence><sentence id="1846">I think that we were part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1847">We were part of the res -- I don't want to use the word resurrection, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac -- something of the restoration of the human spirit. </sentence><sentence id="1848">We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the people, something of the spirit. </sentence><sentence id="1849">Okay, they were angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed and performed, and -- and -- and were quite remarkable in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="1850">I'm not taking responsibility for it. </sentence><sentence id="1851">1 believe we played a small part in it, and I believe that we offered support and resources, and that probably, as is so often the case, we were responsible more for particular individuals being helped than we were for the kind of global picture, if you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="1852">I mean, I can think of individuals, and I think of the German woman I spoke to, and who I had quite a lot to do with, and I think that without making too many claims, our relationship was helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1853">The fact that she could speak to me about her husband, about her losses, and the fact that -- no, I just feel somehow I can think of individuals that were helped by my colleagues, and on occasion by myself, but I don't want to make too many claims about what we achieved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1863">Q: All right, well to get away from the claims, let me ask you about this. </sentence><sentence id="1864">Beginning, let's say with a good -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1865">A: I think the hospital was important. </sentence><sentence id="1866">I think -- I -- I had less to do with the hospital, but I think the hospital was valuable, and did a great deal for the individuals. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1869">Q: Tell me in what way. </sentence><sentence id="1870">I mean, you've spoken about one aspect of the hospital, the fact that it was open to friends and relatives and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1873">A: Mm, mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1875">Q: But it -- when you say it was particularly important, in what way do you mean that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1877">A: Well, it was -- i-it was a place for recovery. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And it was of Jewish [indecipherable] and it wasn't a German hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1879">It wasn't a British hospital ostensibly, it was somehow manned by Jewish people helping Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And I think that was very important because you are very vulnerable when you are helpless. </sentence><sentence id="1881">And they had been helpless many, many times, helpless victims at the mercy of others cruelty and lack of care, and lack of anything. </sentence><sentence id="1882">And I think whatever else we did or didn't do, we did operate it well. </sentence><sentence id="1883">I believe that. </sentence><sentence id="1884">So I think that was a plus. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And I -- I can think of many individuals who were helped along by something. </sentence><sentence id="1886">But if you ask me were we responsible for all that renewal of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don't think we were responsible. </sentence><sentence id="1887">I think it came from the resilience of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Had we not been there it might have been more difficult, let me put it that way. </sentence><sentence id="1889">That might be the fairest way to put it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1903">Q: Can you describe in -- in greater detail how your relationship with people developed, how when you arrived on this very desolate scene, how you made contact with people, how they reacted to you, and how, if at all, you -- you managed to establish some kind of dialog with them, and -- and draw them out. </sentence><sentence id="1904">Tell me how that process happened there in Belsen, as opposed to since. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1907">A: I think in the early days -- I mean, this sounds very, again, rather trite, I think, and simplistic, but what I found was very important was to say very little, but to take somebody's hand. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I -- I found that very important, and I sometimes find it important in my present day work. </sentence><sentence id="1909">When there's nothing to say and the situation is so terrible, all you can do is to take somebody's hand and stroke it and hold it and try to indicate through your touch that there is a communication. </sentence><sentence id="1910">So you don't begin with words, you begin with touch, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And sometimes I would just walk away. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day. </sentence><sentence id="1913">But it would be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so exhausted, that to take somebody's hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person, trying to give strength, as it were, to the other person. </sentence><sentence id="1914">So that was all I could do sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1915">Words came later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1926">Q: And what happens when -- what happened when the words came, and what happened when you didn't have a language in common with the people you were nonetheless communicating with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1928">A: Sometimes people would simply come out with a whole story in explosions. </sentence><sentence id="1929">I've -- I've said before like spitting up, like kind of vomiting something. </sentence><sentence id="1930">So that it would come out stacat -- come out in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in a coherent way. </sentence><sentence id="1931">And I would sometimes say either in German -- and I would always apologize for speaking German, and I would try to bring in Yiddish words that I'd learned, as much as I could, if I couldn't understand somebody, because there would be other people there, and often people would sort of want to come to help you to understand the story. </sentence><sentence id="1932">So that again is a form of communication. </sentence><sentence id="1933">The fact that you don't understand puts you in a less powerful position, therefore they have the power to inform you. </sentence><sentence id="1934">Without them, I can't understand that person. </sentence><sentence id="1935">So that's always a very useful way of looking at things, to accept your powerlessness, and let them have the power to inform you. </sentence><sentence id="1936">And I would ask for help from them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1946">Q: You've said, I believe, that sometimes you were -- they were angry with you, they didn't want your sympathy, they wanted simply somebody to work out their anger on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1948">A: Yes, well then, I mean, this is something you get in all -- with most survivors and something that you get y -- I -- I have to get used to in my present day work. </sentence><sentence id="1949">People are angry because they are helpless and frightened and -- and they can't see a way out. </sentence><sentence id="1950">And you just have to let them shout and be angry. </sentence><sentence id="1951">There's nothing else you can do. </sentence><sentence id="1952">You don't walk away from it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1958">Q: Did you have at the time any sense that you were achieving something? </sentence><sentence id="1959">I mean, when you went back to the requisitioned house at the end of the day, after a visit to Belsen, what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="1960">Did you get blind drunk, did you hide under the sheets? </sentence><sentence id="1961">What -- what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="1962">How on earth did you live with this stuff day after day, and what sense did you have, had it been worthwhile, the day you just spent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1968">A: I never talked to anyone about it, and I think that was one of the failures in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="1969">It was born of it's time when organizations were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things that they couldn't achieve. </sentence><sentence id="1970">So that organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more difficult the outside circumstances, the more institutions call upon the solutions for the institutions rather than for the people they're there to help. </sentence><sentence id="1971">So we would look at, if we met in the evening, we would talk about the difficulties of transport, or the difficulties of a car being stolen, or an accident. </sentence><sentence id="1972">But we wouldn't talk about how I felt, or anybody else felt. </sentence><sentence id="1973">So there wasn't much of that. </sentence><sentence id="1974">What there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that house, that requisitioned house. </sentence><sentence id="1975">We would sing, we would read poetry, we would read aloud to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1976">We would put on various -- we had one boy who was an extremely good mimic, and Richard Talbor was a very popular tenor of the day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of performing on the stage which was quite unique, and a little bit what can I say? </sentence><sentence id="1977">Little bit arrogant and pompous. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor. </sentence><sentence id="1979">And so he would sing and perform and we would all act out something. </sentence><sentence id="1980">Or we would dance. </sentence><sentence id="1981">Now we would dance, we would have ballroom dancing, we were very good at this. </sentence><sentence id="1982">We'd put on something or other. </sentence><sentence id="1983">We had some very sentimental Italian songs, you know -- you know, I can't even remember them now, but they were very sentimental, and we would all swoon, we would listen to music. </sentence><sentence id="1984">So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think, in the evenings, but we didn't talk about our feelings. </sentence><sentence id="1985">So my main relief would be laughing at somebody taking off Richard Talbor or somebody else for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="1986">And we'd have all those sort of activities, which was fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2007">Q: Privately, did you despair of what you were seeing day after day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2009">A: No, I didn't despair at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2010">When I came back to Britain, when I came back to London, I went through a very difficult phase, one that I haven't experienced since. </sentence><sentence id="2011">| -- I can't explain what it was, it was an inability to work with what I'd seen. </sentence><sentence id="2012">I was absolutely terrified of a recurrence of that kind of happening, I was terrified of it. </sentence><sentence id="2013">And I was sure that it was going to happen again. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And I don't know why I felt that, but I felt afraid. </sentence><sentence id="2015">And I used to go to the cinema and sit and watch film after film after film. </sentence><sentence id="2016">And I had traditional, classical panic attacks, when I would feel overwhelmed with fear. </sentence><sentence id="2017">So a lot of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when I had come home. </sentence><sentence id="2018">And it was partly fostered by the lack of interest by anybody around me in understanding or listening to what I had to say. </sentence><sentence id="2019">That was very difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="2020">I'd learned a lot of negotiating skills in Germany, and in my family, but I hadn't learned how to deal, and I still find it hard to deal with a bystander, to deal with people who know and don't know, who don't want to hear, and who didn't want to hear. </sentence><sentence id="2021">And I couldn't bear it. </sentence><sentence id="2022">I came back to a country that was preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of meat they were going to get that week, and any effort I made on my part to communicate what I'd seen, even when I was asked to give official talks about it -- 1 remember going to the east end and talking in a theater there to people. </sentence><sentence id="2023">I was actually asking for money, and that may have had something to do with it, but money for the relief -- the Jewish Relief Unit. </sentence><sentence id="2024">I still do that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="2025">And I had to ask for money and say what was going on, and I -- I mean, I met with cold, angry stares as much as to say, don't you think we've suffered enough, we've heard enough? </sentence><sentence id="2026">But I think it's partly guilt. </sentence><sentence id="2027">I know now that it's guilt. </sentence><sentence id="2028">And so that before you start, you have to try to reduce that sense of guilt with people that they couldn't and didn't want to do anything or know anything at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2029">And they certainly didn't then. </sentence><sentence id="2030">And I found that the hardest thing of all. </sentence><sentence id="2031">So I despaired when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="2032">I despaired when I came back, and I was really very low, the lowest I've ever been in my life, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2033">Well, almost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2059">Q: What was it that made you decide to come back and made you decide to come back at a particular time? </sentence><sentence id="2060">Maybe you could remind us of the date as well. </sentence><sentence id="2061">What -- what was that one single thing or that -- were you just completely overloaded with what you'd seen and done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2065">A: No, I'd been ill, I'd been in hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2066">I'd been involved in an accident which I'd had what they thought was concussion, I was quite unwell. </sentence><sentence id="2067">And I came back on leave and it was decided for me, I didn't decide. </sentence><sentence id="2068">I had wanted to go back. </sentence><sentence id="2069">In fact, I was dying to go back, I couldn't wait to go back. </sentence><sentence id="2070">And I think that partly my despair i-in this -- in coming back, was due to the fact that I couldn't go back there, and that I felt more at home there than I did here. </sentence><sentence id="2071">And I felt more at ease there, and with myself. </sentence><sentence id="2072">And that was very hard for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2081">Q: Why did you feel more at ease? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2083">A: I felt more at ease because I knew where I was, and who I was, and what I was doing, and what I was doing it for. </sentence><sentence id="2084">And even if we were failing, or not doing a fantastic job, at least we were trying to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2085">Whereas I came back to nothingness, to people who didn't want to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="2086">And that was -- that was awful. </sentence><sentence id="2087">So I really found myself in the wilderness when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="2088">And the fact that it -- that things had changed, new people, new order had been set up out there, Henry was no longer there. </sentence><sentence id="2089">It meant that it was difficult for me to go back. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And in a way that was quite difficult for me, that whole scene. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2100">Q: Well, I mean it was two things as well, wasn't it? </sentence><sentence id="2101">It was unfinished business, and you hadn't really said your goodbyes if you were expecting to go back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2104">A: [hadn't said my goodbyes to anybody, I hadn't -- I'd finished the TB train. </sentence><sentence id="2105">I mean, that was a job, that was a project that lasted many months, and that was the one thing I did achieve, whatever else I did or didn't achieve, I achieved that. </sentence><sentence id="2106">So I felt quite good about the bi -- the -- the -- the -- the fact that I'd got a -- managed to get a group of young children and adolescents to Switzerland for treatment of their TB. </sentence><sentence id="2107">That was quite an achievement, you know, bearing in mind the difficulties that we were faced with. </sentence><sentence id="2108">So I felt good about that, but I didn't feel good about leaving unfinished business, not saying goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="2109">| felt very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2110">It was bad, very difficult for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2118">Q: So when you came home and you found this kind of uncomprehending response, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="2119">What -- what happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2122">A: Well, there was a period which I really can barely remember, in which I wandered about, as I say, going to the cinema. </sentence><sentence id="2123">Sort of not knowing quite what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2124">I eventually went to work for the Jewish Refugee Committee in their emigration department. </sentence><sentence id="2125">And then finally, from there, I was asked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, working with a group of young children and adolescents who'd been brought to this country whilst I was still in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2126">They came here in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2127">They were young people, orphans who'd been in Auschwitz, and been in the slave labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="2128">And because of my background I was asked if I would be a caseworker with that organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2136">Q: Well, w-why don't you tell me a little bit about that organization and the -- and the work that you did? </sentence><sentence id="2137">We're taking a little pause. </sentence><sentence id="2138">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Before we move on to look in some depth at the work you did when you came back to England, give me an assessment of what you, your organization, and people like you achieved in Germany after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2144">A: I think that had it not been for Henry Lunzer, with his or -- with his sort of military organization, in setting up an administration, and an office that actually could operate within German, and particularly in the British zone, but not only in the British zone, in terms of provision, in terms of negotiation with British military government for the needs of different individuals and groups, I think that we would have achieved very little. </sentence><sentence id="2145">I think we -- and I think that his support of the need for children to go to the sanatoria in -- in Switzerland was -- was good, and he gave me all the support -- moral support that I needed in order to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2146">I think that he was misjudged, as is often the case, where you have a small -- where you have small resources, and you have a base in another country of purse holders and trustees, who have the reputation of the organization at heart, and want it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to have a view, a good overview of what Henry Lunzer was trying to achieve there. </sentence><sentence id="2147">So there were inevitable, and there always are, I think, tensions, even in organizations today, which are well known, where the base is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the world. </sentence><sentence id="2148">It's very difficult to keep those communications clean and good. </sentence><sentence id="2149">And it certainly was a handicap in -- in the -- in the Jewish Relief Unit at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2156">Q: Let's move on now then, fairly swiftly to the work that you be -- began to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2158">A: But I -- I did want to -- but I do -- I do really, at this point, want to pay tribute to Henry Lunzer because I think that he was a courageous negotiator and was very knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="2159">He    knew Germany well, he spoke German well. </sentence><sentence id="2160">He could speak to military government. </sentence><sentence id="2161">I think, you know, somebody needs to say he did a bloody good job, because he did. </sentence><sentence id="2162">Thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2169">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2170">Let's talk then about the work that you did once you came back to London after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2173">A: Once I'd recovered my equilibrium, which took some months before I could actually face the world, really, I was appointed a case worker to the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps. </sentence><sentence id="2174">| think I mentioned this a little earlier. </sentence><sentence id="2175">It was an organization sponsored and financed by the Central British Fund, and had a board of trustees. </sentence><sentence id="2176">And it's director was a practicing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, who I'd admired very much. </sentence><sentence id="2177">Who had been the director of a type of [indecipherable] institution in Germany, until he himself, as a Jew, was expelled and taken to a concentration camp before the war started, and finally released, and who came to this country, or at least came to Britain as a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="2178">And he was, as I say, a practicing psychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of the committee, a knowledge of institutional life, and of working with people who in turn were trying to care for what was considered to be a -- in the best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, a difficult or complex group of young people. </sentence><sentence id="2179">I came back in 1947, in the early months of 1947, so the children had already been, and -- or -- and adolescents had already gone through a kind of preliminary phase of being in special homes, out of London, where they were helped with language and many different things. </sentence><sentence id="2180">By the time I got to work with them, they were looking at schooling, at advance study, at apprenticeships, and some kind of future. </sentence><sentence id="2181">Again, we were looking at a very vigorous, articulate, demanding group of young people, competitive. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Now, they were very different in some ways from the people that I remembered from the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2183">Their survival, as -- as had the people in the camps, but let's just make this kind of -- let's mark this difference. </sentence><sentence id="2184">The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2185"> people I was working with had survived the daily selections for work, or for the gas chamber, through their ability to maintain strength, to maintain totally focused on their survival, nobody else's but their survival. </sentence><sentence id="2186">Although of course, some were concerned with friends and siblings, but basically focused on their own bodily survival. </sentence><sentence id="2187">They had to prove their strength, their capacity to work another day. </sentence><sentence id="2188">Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival. </sentence><sentence id="2189">So in dealing, in communicating with this group of people, one always had to have in one's mind that that was how they survived. </sentence><sentence id="2190">And there was never going to be an easy, immediate communication and trust. </sentence><sentence id="2191">There couldn't be. </sentence><sentence id="2192">Nobody in their life really could be trusted for some time. </sentence><sentence id="2193">So it was very important to find a way to build that trust, and to build a form of communication that took into account their need for their own private space. </sentence><sentence id="2194">And this is quite important because I found it very important in working with them that -- for example, I -- I spoke about taking someone's hand in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2195">What I found with the young people to be very important was to pi -- allow a space between you and them. </sentence><sentence id="2196">A kind of actual, physical space so that -- and I -- I could never quite put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important to maintain that space, but it was. </sentence><sentence id="2197">And I believe that it gave them a sense of their own kind of power base, their own sense of identity and strength. </sentence><sentence id="2198">And I did not invade it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2199">End of Tape Three, Side B    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2200"> Beginning Tape Four, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2201">Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber. </sentence><sentence id="2202">You were talking about the space and your approach -- you were talking about your approach to these young people, and how actually they needed precisely the opposite kind of approach to the people you dealt with in Belsen. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2203">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And a -- a -- this space was -- was a recognition, a kind of instinctive recognition. </sentence><sentence id="2205">It wasn't something that I could put down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he was a guidance to me in many of the cases that I had. </sentence><sentence id="2206">But I just -- it was something that I just sensed as very, very important. </sentence><sentence id="2207">Now, my job then was to try and help the young people to be placed in jobs, to begin a life that would be possibly creative, or would certainly give them some sense of solid -- solidity. </sentence><sentence id="2208">However, I have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to, so to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced. </sentence><sentence id="2209">And I do feel that there was, in some way, a denial of need here. </sentence><sentence id="2210">I believe that these young people -- and I've said earlier I believe, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the resources in time to mourn their dead. </sentence><sentence id="2211">And it's not only to mourn their dead in the sense of their dying, but in the sense of their grotesque manner of dying. </sentence><sentence id="2212">And to mourn the grotesque is more complex, and needs skill. </sentence><sentence id="2213">I don't think that we had thought that through, and even if we did fumble towards an understanding that their inner world was not being addressed, such was the -- the kind of culture of the day, that the idea that -- you see, Britain at the end of the war was a country blunted by war, where the message to everyone was to -- to just put the past to rest and let's move forward. </sentence><sentence id="2214">A new world is born, the war is over, let's get on with life. </sentence><sentence id="2215">That was the message of the day. </sentence><sentence id="2216">Soldiers were not encouraged to speak about their inner fears and their nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="2217">They were not encouraged to talk about the horrors of war. </sentence><sentence id="2218">All the war films that came out were really like    something out of Peter Pan, they were so -- so banal, and so sentimental. </sentence><sentence id="2219">So sentimental a -- you know, sa -- the war was sentimentalized. </sentence><sentence id="2220">It wasn't portrayed at that stage with all it's horror. </sentence><sentence id="2221">And to bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the open was felt not to be appropriate. </sentence><sentence id="2222">Now, I'm not saying that there wasn't some attention to their inner world. </sentence><sentence id="2223">I believe there was some. </sentence><sentence id="2224">The Anna Freud clinic was involved in some way in observing the young people. </sentence><sentence id="2225">But I don't believe that we dealt with the need to mourn. </sentence><sentence id="2226">And when I look today at the -- at the older people as they are now, men in their 60's and 70's, women, and I look at their relationships and the next generation, I don't believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done. </sentence><sentence id="2227">It's easy to say that in hindsight. </sentence><sentence id="2228">I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social terms, flourished, made good, married, had children. </sentence><sentence id="2229">But if you observe them, and their relationships, and their long -- I don't want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very supportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks. </sentence><sentence id="2230">So, I mean, I went about my task of trying to help people, young people t -- into jobs. </sentence><sentence id="2231">I negotiated yet again with schools, and colleges, and institutions and most in a -- most unpleasant sometimes, landlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and employers. </sentence><sentence id="2232">It was a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="2233">It had been a hard war, and people were tough, and employers were tough. </sentence><sentence id="2234">And the fact that these young people were -- I was just going to say asylum seekers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust survivors, it did not call for compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2235">Some were good, some were very good. </sentence><sentence id="2236">And many people worked well with the young people, and offered much. </sentence><sentence id="2237">And there was a club, and there were facilities and money was sought for special needs. </sentence><sentence id="2238">But I would have liked to have dealt better with some of the strange things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="2239">I had a young man, for example, who'd been -- who had TB. </sentence><sentence id="2240">And I went every week to see him here, in a sanatorium near Brentwood. </sentence><sentence id="2241">He was a delightful young man from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2242">We spoke together, we talked about his needs. </sentence><sentence id="2243">We talked about all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="2244">But one day when I went there, after many, many months of treatment, and he was doing very well, he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="2245">And I was quite upset and I asked the nurses what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="2246">And they said he just got up and went. </sentence><sentence id="2247">Now he -- we don't know what happened, and I still to this day don't know exactly what the process was, whether it was long planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very enquiring of me as to why I hadn't noticed a problem. </sentence><sentence id="2248">But such was the defense of this young man that he could converse week after week, and I could become quite close, and we could talk about quite intimate things, about sexuality, about the difficulty of being ill, about a possible girlfriend, all these things we could talk about. </sentence><sentence id="2249">But somehow he could, nevertheless, just g-get up and go. </sentence><sentence id="2250">So it's that kind of thing where the defenses have been developed through crisis, through extremis, through the most terrible losses and catastrophes, and genocide. </sentence><sentence id="2251">Where people have built defenses that are no longer so good in every day life, and do not make for absolute intimacy and trust. </sentence><sentence id="2252">And this is what I think happened with this young man. </sentence><sentence id="2253">We ca -- w-we managed to speak about it later, but it happened, and it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a failure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2307">Q: One boy out of many, then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2309">A: Well, I mean, he succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="2310">He got better, he had a girlfriend in the end. </sentence><sentence id="2311">No, I don't think it was a total failure. </sentence><sentence id="2312">He was one boy out of many. </sentence><sentence id="2313">There was another boy I took, a very, very brilliant boy, who I've lat -- just recently found as a professor of chemistry in Canada, in university in Canada. </sentence><sentence id="2314">I looked for many months, years in fact to find him. </sentence><sentence id="2315">He had TB of the spine, and I wondered if he'd survived. </sentence><sentence id="2316">And I -- I took him before a group of headmasters in a special school in north London, because he was a very brilliant child, and we had wanted a particular standard of education for him. </sentence><sentence id="2317">In coming before the headmasters -- it was a team of headmasters, to judge this young man. </sentence><sentence id="2318">I had to, of course, to say that the -- he had lost quite a number of years of his education. </sentence><sentence id="2319">Brilliant as he was, he had lost years. </sentence><sentence id="2320">And I explained that he'd been in this camp, and that camp, slave labor, etcetera, etcetera, Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2321">And then the chair of the headmasters turned to me and said, "But didn't they give them books to read?" </sentence><sentence id="2322">And I was so aghast. </sentence><sentence id="2323">I couldn't believe it, and I couldn't find anything to say. </sentence><sentence id="2324">Sufficient to say that the young man was taken into that particular school. </sentence><sentence id="2325">But I've never forgotten that, and it's an indication of society's capacity to deny what is taking place. </sentence><sentence id="2326">But there was also denial amongst the Jewish community when I came back from Germany, as to what had happened to our brethren, to our brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2327">And denial can exist in every population. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2348">Q: Why did it exist among Britain's Jewish population? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2350">A: I think it was partly guilt, that s -- si -- a -- si -- their own survival and other people had not survived. </sentence><sentence id="2351">I -- I shared that. </sentence><sentence id="2352">I shared that feeling of -- of having survived when nobody -- you know, when other people did not, and you know, just by the luck of the draw, really. </sentence><sentence id="2353">Many of my relatives in Poland indeed had not survived. </sentence><sentence id="2354">So -- my father's relatives. </sentence><sentence id="2355">So I think it was partly guilt, but it's also denial. </sentence><sentence id="2356">If you deny something, you don't have to do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="2357">If you recognize something, you have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2358">And you know, I'm faced with this every day, in my every day life now. </sentence><sentence id="2359">It's the denial of society to accept that certain people have suffered sufficiently to require our attention. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And I think that's what I felt when I came back from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2361">It wasn't just the experience of the camps, of the people, of the ghastliness, of everything I'd seen and heard. </sentence><sentence id="2362">It was the fact that when I came back I couldn't get anybody to even unders -- want to -- want to understand what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="2363">And so this really is my -- my most urgent plea. </sentence><sentence id="2364">It's not only about remembering the past, it's about preserving the future. </sentence><sentence id="2365">And we can only preserve the future if we recognize what we are doing to each other, and what that means for the victims, and what we need to do if we're to be a compassionate society. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2387">A: I worked for many years, about eight years on and off with the -- the boy survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2388">Of course, there were girls, we

work finished probably after a -- a few years, I think, after about four years, but I continued to see them, and continued to work with them for a number of years after that. </sentence><sentence id="2391">And I still see them, particularly one or two of them. </sentence><sentence id="2392">But I then went on to do some hospital jobs, social work jobs in hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="2393">I joined Amnesty in 1961. </sentence><sentence id="2394">And I -- I just do want to say something about why I joined Amnesty, I know it's not relevant, except to do with hatred. </sentence><sentence id="2395">It was very easy to hate one particular nation, and one particular group of people. </sentence><sentence id="2396">And I'd enjoyed, if I can use that word, or indulged in that hatred for many years, particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways, and seen his family destroyed in grotesque ways, and I -- at least his -- certainly his father, who was beaten to death in the house in which they were on the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="2397">So living with his depression and his misery over the death of his mother, and rest of his family in Majdanek concentration camp, I certainly nursed my hatred of the Germans for many years. </sentence><sentence id="2398">But it was when I began to realize that torture and other human rights violations were going on in so many countries in the world. </sentence><sentence id="2399">That the French were torturing the Algerians, that other people were torturing. </sentence><sentence id="2400">That you could not put -- you could not put a frontier up and say this is where it begins, and this is where it ends. </sentence><sentence id="2401">And I'm not making, and I'm not comparing one genocide, or one cat -- catastrophe with another. </sentence><sentence id="2402">The Holocaust will always remain the most terrible of genocides of the 20" century. </sentence><sentence id="2403">But I still feel that we mustn't close our eyes to other terrible disasters, such as we've seen recently, for example, in Rwanda. </sentence><sentence id="2404">So I joined Amnesty [indecipherable] in the spirits, you know, with the idea that I can't nurse this forever. </sentence><sentence id="2405">I have to accept and have to understand that violence and persecution goes on in many different forms, and I needed to understand it better. </sentence><sentence id="2406">My work in Amnesty went on for many years. </sentence><sentence id="2407">| -- I helped to form the first medical group in the British section of Amnesty International, taking testimony and documenting evidence of torture and human rights violations from relatives and survivors who'd come to this country, and in going on missions abroad for Amnesty. </sentence><sentence id="2408">And it was coming out of that -- that work, knowing that we could document, and we could take testimony, and we could supply evidence of human rights violations to organizations and institutions concerned with human rights, including the United Nations, but that we weren't actually treating the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2409">That made me feel we weren't really fulfilling our task. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And as people were beginning to ask us to take care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from many different countries who look -- resided in this country, and who'd been tortured and violated in many different ways, and lost sometimes, all their members of their family, that made me feel that we needed to move on. </sentence><sentence id="2411">We established as an independent charity, the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture at the end of 1985. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And we had a vision, and visions are difficult to hold onto. </sentence><sentence id="2413">And the vision was to combine human rights, and the care of the victims. </sentence><sentence id="2414">In other words, to take heed of people's protection, their human rights, to be part of that. </sentence><sentence id="2415">If necessary even to be advocates for that, which is not easy for therapists. </sentence><sentence id="2416">But also to look at the medical, psychological and social needs of the people who came from the -- to the medical foundation. </sentence><sentence id="2417">We've treated over 35,000 people, from over 91 different countries, and I have to tell you that my room every day, my    consulting room every day, is filled with horrendous stories of torture, of deliberate mutilation, of hideous rapes, of dreadful executions from all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="2418">And I suppose really, that is the beginning and end, in some ways of my story. </sentence><sentence id="2419">I'm doing what I set out to do. </sentence><sentence id="2420">I know I can't save everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2421">I know that my own skills are limited. </sentence><sentence id="2422">We're an organization with no -- insufficient resources to meet the needs of everyone. </sentence><sentence id="2423">I believe we live in as hostile an environment as -- or at least our survivors do, as they ever did in the 30's. </sentence><sentence id="2424">People are not welcomed, people are deported back to the countries which tortured them. </sentence><sentence id="2425">European countries are closing the doors, we have a fortress Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2426">We don't look for good solutions. </sentence><sentence id="2427">We didn't in the 30's and we don't now. </sentence><sentence id="2428">So really, my work is again about human rights, and the care of the individual, and the individual's family. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And that can be very rewarding work, even if it can also be quite distressing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2475">Q: Is there a thread that directly links your experiences at -- of Belsen with the Medical Foundation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2477">A: I don't think I would have established the Medical Foundation, and worked so long in the Medical Foundation if I hadn't been to Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="2478">What I learned in Belsen was about a kind of suffering that we have never really begun to understand, about loss, about grotesque death, about the need to mourn. </sentence><sentence id="2479">About -- about despair and the desire to die. </sentence><sentence id="2480">I learned all of these things in Belsen, but I also learned about the resilience, and something about the human spirit and people's capacity to survive, and people's capacity to overcome, if you are able to resource something within them. </sentence><sentence id="2481">And that's what I've learned. </sentence><sentence id="2482">I didn't understand how to resource it for many years. </sentence><sentence id="2483">But with time, you are able to resource people's skills, people's -- you are able to retrieve something of who that person was. </sentence><sentence id="2484">And that's very, very important. </sentence><sentence id="2485">You are able to deal, or to try to come to terms with grotesque death. </sentence><sentence id="2486">To find ways of burying the dead that are very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And this we've had to do in the Medical Foundation. </sentence><sentence id="2488">It's about an holistic approach to    trauma, and to loss, using medicine, using psychology, but also using very adaptive measures. </sentence><sentence id="2489">You can't deal -- you know, you can't bring a very traditional form of therapy very often to people from different -- from certain dif -- from different cultures, from different beliefs in healing. </sentence><sentence id="2490">You'll have to listen to what is going to help them, and you have to find very creative ways of working with people, and I can give many examples of that, but I don't think that that is the purpose of this discussion. </sentence><sentence id="2491">I think the Medical Foundation has learned how to address government, it's home office. </sentence><sentence id="2492">It doesn't always succeed, but it tries. </sentence><sentence id="2493">It's learned skills of negotiation and understanding other people's difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="2494">But how you hold the vision, and how you deal with continuing -- a continuing lack of compassion and understanding, both in the public -- or some of the public, not all of the public, we have quite a following, but in some of the public, and in some of government, is very difficult to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2514">Q: Now, on a slightly different tack, but not entirely, one aspect of the work that you've done for the Medical Foundation, I believe in June 1993, you went to Israel and you testified on behalf of a Palestinian prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Could you tell me about that whole case, and your involvement in it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2518">A: I'll tell you some of it, because it would take a lifetime to discuss it properly. </sentence><sentence id="2519">I went to Israel to take part with a colleague of mine who is formerly -- was -- was born in Israel, but lives in this country and works as a psychologist. </sentence><sentence id="2520">I went to attend a conference of the Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. </sentence><sentence id="2521">The Medical Foundation does link to various human rights organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2522">And because of my background, and because of the background of my colleague, it seemed very appropriate that we should link to something that sounded as constructive as an Israeli and Palestinian Formation for the Benefit of Human Rights. </sentence><sentence id="2523">We knew, and had met the Israeli members of the organization, and the Palestinians. </sentence><sentence id="2524">I had known and worked with for many years -- that means to say, when I say worked with, I mean I've communicated with a very profound child psychiatrist from Gaza who studied in this country, and is working with the Gaza community mental health team in Gaza. </sentence><sentence id="2525">So it seemed a logical thing to do, for us to attend the conference, which regrettably was on the subject of torture. </sentence><sentence id="2526">Torture worldwide, torture throughout the world, but torture also in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2527">And when I was there, I was asked by the Physicians for Human Rights if I would help them in the case of a Palestinian where it had become obvious from the papers that had been found of his interrogation, that he had been tortured in order -- in order for him to confess, whether I will be prepared to help them. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And I met the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer involved in his case before I made any decisions. </sentence><sentence id="2529">And I was very impressed with his integrity, and his dignity, and his desire as an Israeli to provide fairness and justice where he felt it was appropriate. </sentence><sentence id="2530">On reading the document, it was obvious to me that certain forms of what we would call torture had taken place. </sentence><sentence id="2531">And I agreed, reluctantly may I say, to, as a visiting director of an organization concerned with torture, to take part in a certain aspect of his trial. </sentence><sentence id="2532">It -- it was agreed -- it was agreed with the lawyer that this -- I mean, it was at the lawyers request that I acquiesced to this. </sentence><sentence id="2533">And I produced a document, and I attended the court. </sentence><sentence id="2534">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2553">Q: This is tape number four, side B, of an interview with Helen Bamber. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2555">A: And so we went -- I went with the -- with the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer, and my colleague who had come with me and escorted me from the UK, to Hebrum. </sentence><sentence id="2556">It was extremely hot. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And we had to wait for many hours because the judge was not happy about my giving any evidence in the court. </sentence><sentence id="2558">And I think that she, quite understandably, had to take advice from other authorities before she could proceed, and she went on really for many hours before eventually, I was allowed to come into the court, and to give only very restricted information. </sentence><sentence id="2559">I could not refer to certain aspects which they considered I was not qualified to refer to. </sentence><sentence id="2560">So, my role was rather a limited one. </sentence><sentence id="2561">But I could talk about confessions under torture, and that confessions under torture can never be reliable ones, for quite obvious reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2562">That people will often say something in extreme discomfort that isn't necessarily true. </sentence><sentence id="2563">And as torture is universally outlawed, it does seem rather inappropriate for any court to take, to accept a confession that actually took place under coercion, and under extreme pressure. </sentence><sentence id="2564">Before I went to the court, I sat for some time in a very small, hot flat, without air conditioning, to see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick, smelly, kind of wooly, wool material, army material hood. </sentence><sentence id="2565">I didn't have such an exact hood, but I had sufficient to give me a feeling of how claustrophobic, and how terrible such a feeling would be. </sentence><sentence id="2566">I wasn't able to adopt the position that is adopted, that was adopted, and is -- is often used in such cases in Israel, where somebody is placed on a low chair, their hands tied behind them, and the chair's feet are shorter in the front than the back, so that the -- when you are hooded, and exposed to quite a lot of noise, loud noise, and you are also in this very uncomfortable position, sitting on this seat, which has a traditional name, which I shall remember soon, I think if anybody were to try that position, they would find it extremely uncomfortable, because the weight of the body is distributed in such a way that there's enormous pressure on the back, and one is in extreme discomfort and fear, and exposed to noise. </sentence><sentence id="2567">Man also had an injury that had been recorded in the notes, but which I was not allowed to refer to in the court, which was an injury to his nose, which the doctor had recorded. </sentence><sentence id="2568">Now, I -- it's difficult for me to discuss this particular case. </sentence><sentence id="2569">It so happens that the case was resolved, inasmuch as an expert came from -- an expert in confessions under pers -- under duress, came from the Mordsley hospital as an independent expert, and gave evidence in this case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2586">Q: A British hospital, that is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2588">A: Yes, a British hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2589">Because, as they professed to be uns -- not satisfied with my credentials as an expert witness, I did suggest to the court, that if they were concerned, as they said they were, to ascertain whether the man had confessed under torture, then perhaps the best way of doing it was to get somebody whose expertise could not be denied. </sentence><sentence id="2590">And so this was agreed, and eventually an expert, as I say, from a renowned institution, and whose seminal work is in confessions obtained under duress [indecipherable] attend the court. </sentence><sentence id="2591">And the man's sentence was commuted. </sentence><sentence id="2592">Is i -- is that the word? </sentence><sentence id="2593">From I think 15 years, which was his convicted -- was the -- was what he was convicted -- was what he was given on conviction. </sentence><sentence id="2594">But I think it -- he w -- did -- it was then -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2595">Q: Reduced, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2596">A: Reduced to a very short period, and he was released quite soon. </sentence><sentence id="2597">It was a very, very difficult experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="2598">For me, with my background, to stand in Israeli court, defending a Palestinian, who was there, and who looked extremely fearful, and obviously with a -- some -- well, was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="2599">But it was much harder to do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2600">If had done nothing, I could never really have lived with my principles, which is that nobody, under any circumstances should be signaled out for torture, and that there are other ways. </sentence><sentence id="2601">If you do want information, you have to find, with all the ingenuity that exists within societies, other ways. </sentence><sentence id="2602">But you do not torture, you do not torture. </sentence><sentence id="2603">Torture is such an abominable, devastating experience, both to those who practice it, I believe, in the end, and those on who it is inflicted. </sentence><sentence id="2604">It is really the most terrible memory that la - - that -- that man can have. </sentence><sentence id="2605">And the nightmares, and the physical pain, the sense of one's own betrayal -- the body betrays in torture. </sentence><sentence id="2606">The body gives out, and the body betrays you in torture. </sentence><sentence id="2607">And for a civilized country, for civilized people to be practicing torture on an individual is unforgivable, and cannot be condoned under any circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="2608">And I know there's a great discussion going on about -- at the moment about whether torture is justified, and others must indulge in that. </sentence><sentence id="2609">But my views are clear, and my experience of working with survivors is that they -- they do not -- it is very difficult to overcome, just as it is with Holocaust survivors to overcome the effects of torture. </sentence><sentence id="2610">And for -- to employ people to torture as your agents is, I think the s -- beginning of a very slippery slope. </sentence><sentence id="2611">If you employ people to torture, or to apply as they say, minimum pressure, or whatever the phrase is. </sentence><sentence id="2612">It doesn't matter what the phrase is. </sentence><sentence id="2613">What it means is to frighten through physical and psychological pain into a confession. </sentence><sentence id="2614">It's no way to behave for a civilized society. </sentence><sentence id="2615">And there are people in Israel who feel very, very unhappy, very uncomfortable about what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="2616">And torture does exist, I'm afraid, in -- in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2617">And I have been witness to a number of testimonies of people who've been tortured. </sentence><sentence id="2618">And it's an unbearable thought, but I think that we have to -- I take heart from the fact that there are people in Israel who are working very, very hard to find a way to end this, and who've spoken out very courageously. </sentence><sentence id="2619">I wish there were more. </sentence><sentence id="2620">I know that there's a great deal of fear, but I don't with to get into the political scene in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2621">People have elected their representatives, and they have made a decision. </sentence><sentence id="2622">I with there was not so much hatred against the Palestinians. </sentence><sentence id="2623">And I wish the Palestinians would not do what they are doing. </sentence><sentence id="2624">I've worked with moderate, and intelligent, and caring Palestinians and Israelis who come together and want to bring about change, and it's our job to help them do that. </sentence><sentence id="2625">Not to be defensive about what is going on there, but rather to look for a solution, I think, as to how we as individuals can assist people to bring about change in their societies. </sentence><sentence id="2626">It is about the way people lose it, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2659">Q: Let me ask you a final question. </sentence><sentence id="2660">What lessons can you draw so far from your rather extraordinary life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2663">A: I don't know whether it's extraordinary, I -- I would question that. </sentence><sentence id="2664">But I -- I think really, my concern, what -- what worries me most is lack of compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2665">I think it's so easy to turn against people, to create scapegoats. </sentence><sentence id="2666">I mean, no -- no nation, no group of people can be more conscious of that than the Jewish people, how easy it is for them to be scapegoated. </sentence><sentence id="2667">They always have been, and they're still being scapegoated. </sentence><sentence id="2668">But we have to be careful about this, and we have to be informing all the time, people about the need to understand other people, to be compassionate. </sentence><sentence id="2669">We're not a compassionate society here or anywhere else that I can see. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And we can do so many things. </sentence><sentence id="2671">We're now going off to Mars, and to the moon, and here and there, but we don't know how to maintain compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2672">What I saw happen in Belsen was the dying of compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2673">There was outrage and compassion when the camp was liberated, but I watched it die. </sentence><sentence id="2674">I watched it not there when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="2675">And when I speak today to people -- I watched it in hospitals where children, in my view, were really abused, and restrained, when they should not have been. </sentence><sentence id="2676">I don't mean -- when I say abused, I mean cruelly treated, really. </sentence><sentence id="2677">Stupidly treated. </sentence><sentence id="2678">I just -- I just -- I mean, for example, when the Kosovan refugees came to this country -- we can question why, but people came to the airports with teddy bears and presents, and there was all kinds of support and interest in their welfare, particularly families with small children. </sentence><sentence id="2679">People were able to identify them. </sentence><sentence id="2680">But even though they were able to identify them, the compassion is gone. </sentence><sentence id="2681">If I say today that my own government is considering sending back a Kosovan family, who we feel, for reasons of torture and rape and various other situations, really should not go back, but should be allowed to stay, there won't be that compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2682">The compassion has died. </sentence><sentence id="2683">And so I don't know what maintains compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And I don't know how to help people or to instill compassion in people when they've lost it. </sentence><sentence id="2685">And I think that is really the predicament for s -- f -- f -- and always has been. </sentence><sentence id="2686">It's about being compassionate to the people who are so different from you. </sentence><sentence id="2687">And even people you may not like very much. </sentence><sentence id="2688">I mean, I don't like all my clients, I don't have to, it's not my job. </sentence><sentence id="2689">I remember when I was in Germany and I said on one occasion to a much more experienced colleague, my God, I'm so tired of -- there's one particular person that drove me literally -- drove me quite mad, and was very demanding. </sentence><sentence id="2690">And he said, "Look, you're not here to like people. </sentence><sentence id="2691">You're not here to like them." </sentence><sentence id="2692">And that's quite true. </sentence><sentence id="2693">I'm not doing this work because I like everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2694">And I don't expect to, and it would be foolish for me to do so. </sentence><sentence id="2695">But there has to be a degree of compassion if we're to deal with the ills of society. </sentence><sentence id="2696">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2697">I [inaudible]. </sentence><sentence id="2698">I can't finish it. </sentence><sentence id="2699">I've come to the end. </sentence><sentence id="2700">I don't know, it sounds like a sermon from God knows where. </sentence><sentence id="2701">I don't intend it to sound like a sermon. </sentence><sentence id="2702">It's not like that, but " ve watched compassion die so quickly, I just -- it's just a plea for some kind of understanding that isn't there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
