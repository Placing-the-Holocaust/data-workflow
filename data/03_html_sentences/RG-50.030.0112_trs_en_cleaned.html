<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: It was very...we were very badly treated, all of us. </sentence><sentence id="34">Incidentally, there was anti-Semitism in the army. </sentence><sentence id="35">There was no anti-Semitism in the all-Czechoslovakia, in Bohemia and Moravia but there was anti-Semitism, even anti-Semitic remarks made by officers. </sentence><sentence id="36">The army was very badly treated by the French. </sentence><sentence id="37">It was ill-equipped. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was...the food was bad. </sentence><sentence id="39">We lived in barracks where the wind was blowing through and there happened to be...we were in the south of France where generally the the climate is mild, but it was a very cold winter, the winter of 1939-1940. </sentence><sentence id="40">And we believed we are kind of parade army and we will be used when Germany is defeated, we will be used as the as the core of the Czech army, which will move back to Prague, but when France suffered one defeat after the other, in May 1940 we were well-equipped, or relatively well-equipped and we were sent to the front and we were...we were positioned uh east of Paris as part of the army to defend Paris and the front was broken and we retreated. </sentence><sentence id="41">We were again...I...my...there there were only small units left. </sentence><sentence id="42">This unit in with which I was was again used at the River and that was the end of the of the campaign of France. </sentence><sentence id="43">France was defeated and uh I like other people tried to get away from France. </sentence><sentence id="44">Now some people went to where the army in southern France...where the army had originally been stationed. </sentence><sentence id="45">I tried to get to western France and to get from western France on a ship to to England or to the west, but I couldn't get on any ship and finally...finally I ended up at the at the Spanish frontier together with some other boys and we thought we would go into Spain so we were afraid of this because we guessed that uh in Franco Spain we would be arrested and while we were approaching the frontier, we learned from the radio that Germany will not occupy the whole of France but only a stretch of territory uh inland from the Atlantic, so when you were beyond this demarkation line, you would be in unoccupied France, so we didn't go to it. </sentence><sentence id="46">We went to Spain and then to to this unoccupied part of France and there I was together with French refugees, my comrades...they're not close friends but whom I had just met...and they went to a little village in southern France. </sentence><sentence id="47">There again I became...or not again, but first 1 became a teacher in a very interesting family. </sentence><sentence id="48">The family was in part very pro-German, very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that France had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...it was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on Germany and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light..-with a light-heart, light-heartedly, . </sentence><sentence id="49">And uh six weeks later they were beaten in , so this lady found a  The young people were...were anti-German. </sentence><sentence id="50">They were very nice and I stayed with them and I taught a little boy and a young girl until one day my wife, my present wife, came and found me there and we traveled together toto__, a little place, near near the city of Lemouge (ph) where her father and her mother had been and they found themselves after dramatic circumstances because millions of French people had left, had fled the Germans at this time, and uh I stayed with them but they had nothing to eat and I decided there...and they shared everything but I decided I can't stay with them, so I went on my way to Grenoble (ph). </sentence><sentence id="51">Why Grenoble? </sentence><sentence id="52">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="53">It was in the unoccupied zone and there I was demobilized by the French and there I got a carde identite (ph) as a student. </sentence><sentence id="54">Now very few foreigners had a carde identite, a permission of staying in France. </sentence><sentence id="55">I had one but it...from this I couldn't live and after many attempts to...after many attempts to to find some way of uh ma...making a living which I couldn't do, I I found a job as I told you before in western France, again as a teacher in a family, in an aristocratic refuge family and I I decided to go there and but you you could only travel at this time with a special permit, de voyage (ph) it was called so I went to the police and asked for a de voyage and they told me why why you want to go there and I said my aunt is  anti-Jewish laws, generally when we had to deal with the police and even in the camp, we were not singled out as being Jews. </sentence><sentence id="56">There was no anti-Semitism except in there...I mean no open anti-Semitism except in in Government levels but we didn't hear any any anti- Jewish remarks and uh anti-Semitism came in to force for us only when we were deported, or when people were arrested as Jews, but that was much later. </sentence><sentence id="57">Of course, many French people might have lost their jobs or their business, but I speak now from my own personal experience. </sentence><sentence id="58">There was no anti-Semitic movement or attitude. </sentence><sentence id="59">We were dirty foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="60">The French have an expression... . </sentence><sentence id="61">Dirty foreigner, and we belonged to the dirty foreigner who potentially took away...took away French jobs, but this reminds me that during my flight uh to the south when the army was dispersed and I tried to go get on a ship, I was once by chance...in the very last days of the French campaign in a compartment, a railroad compartment. </sentence><sentence id="62">There were three British students and a lady, and the lady turned out to be the wife of the French Ambassador to Franco, . </sentence><sentence id="63">She was Madame , and the Monsieur was the successor to , and she came into the compartment. </sentence><sentence id="64">She was very friendly and she said since . </sentence><sentence id="65">She says these are the German Jews who have done us this, and this  hundred fifty grams of bread. </sentence><sentence id="66">At noon...at...in the forenoon, in the morning, which was the basis of all our food. </sentence><sentence id="67">At noon we got a water soup with carrots or with uh onions and in the evening we got, believe it or not, one artichoke and some of for drink...long period...one artichoke or a little bit of artificial honey, sometimes a glass of uh of wine. </sentence><sentence id="68">Now wine has calories. </sentence><sentence id="69">The net effect of this was that uh if people didn't get help from outside, parcels or some help in some other way, they died after about one year, and many people died there. </sentence><sentence id="70">The regime was very strict and from time to time they shot somebody, always saying that the person wanted to escape and that was probably partly true but partly was other...their method of intimidating people. </sentence><sentence id="71">As I said, there were foreigners from all over Europe and the Gestapo came from time to time together with German officials and asked people whether they want to work voluntarily in Germany and many people see that they can't survive, Poles in particular, Hungarians uh volunteered for work in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="72">I have read...I don't know anymore where, but I believe it's true...that there were other Jews from eastern Europe, from Hungary, who said they wantto__-- in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="73">Didn't say they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="74">They were Hungarians, and they survived in this way as foreign workers in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="75">Uh I stayed there for two years and the hygienic conditions were horrible. </sentence><sentence id="76">We were filthy. </sentence><sentence id="77">We were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="78">We had nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="79">We had lice. </sentence><sentence id="80">We had fleas. </sentence><sentence id="81">Many people died, of course, from diseases, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Did you work? </sentence><sentence id="134">Was there work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="138">We didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="139">We didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="140">We had to do some what they called </sentence></p><p><sentence id="141"> , some work in...for the camp, you know, but otherwise we didn't have to work and being told all the time. </sentence><sentence id="142">I was...after...I don't know...after I was there for a while I was called and said...by the...by a captain whose name incidentally was Vernet, Captain Vernet, and Captain Vernet said you are here by mistake. </sentence><sentence id="143">Uh yes, we recognize you have been in the army and so we will send you to a better camp, and that happened...I was in say a month and at the beginning it raised my my hope and my morale and I didn't believe inin___ anymore, but I got indeed some privilege because of their alleged mistake. </sentence><sentence id="144">I was made deputy postmaster, . </sentence><sentence id="145">That is to say I was allowed to </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Uh | for instance, was reading a tremendous lot and many people were were reading a tremendous lot. </sentence><sentence id="147">Other people there were...I don't reca...there were small Jewish religious groups but I must repeat that wasn't a Jewish camp so it was a camp for foreigner, so many of the foreigners were Jewish, but except for knowing that there were Jewish, there was no identification of being Jewish and there were other religious groups, Jewish religious people which...whom I haven't seen in Auschwitz...I haven't seen any...a few I have to ...uh what did they do? </sentence><sentence id="148">They were desperate. </sentence><sentence id="149">Uh they played chess  There was a railroad station of Vernet, and you could see it. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was uh perhaps a mile away but you could see it, and we saw on the Sth or the 6th of uh August that there are railroad cars there which generally were not there and probably on the 6th, a great number of people were surrounded in the camp, because in the camp we were...and you believed you are...you were free in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="151">You can...within limits, you were free. </sentence><sentence id="152">We were surrounded and __ say they would be deported. </sentence><sentence id="153">Now all of them were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="154">There were many non-Jews in the camp, but I do believe we didn't realize that all of them were Jews because as I said before, there was...we didn't feel being Jews in this sense that we were singled out, and they were deported and they were marched to the station and were deported. </sentence><sentence id="155">At the end of August of 1942, something uh incredible happened. </sentence><sentence id="156">Whole families came into the camp and these were all Jews, people, Jewish people who had taken refuge in France and who had managed to live outside camps, who had some even jobs. </sentence><sentence id="157">How they managed, I don't know...if some lived from their savings and had some savings...but they were people living outside and they were all brought into the camp, and that was far sensational. </sentence><sentence id="158">Not only...we had...there were no women in the camp, so there were not only men and women came in...whole families and children. </sentence><sentence id="159">We hadn't seen children for two years, and uh they were not badly treated. </sentence><sentence id="160">Uh they had enough to eat and they were, of course, deeply depressed and I guess they knew already but we might have heard too, that there were de...deportations of Jews to Germany because I think some people listened...could listen or to the to the British broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="161">They had heard about it, so this was an all Jewish affair. </sentence><sentence id="162">That was very clear, and it was a deportation affair and the first transport was also deportation, but it wasn't very clear...didn't seem so much as a punishment. </sentence><sentence id="163">It could be interpreted as a...and since it was only men, it could be interpreted as meaning they are going to work. </sentence><sentence id="164">The Germans uh uh always hired people who were imprisoned or wanted those people in Germany so that they took Jews to Germany was a bit strange but we didn't think about this as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="165">It's now fifty years, but as far as I remember about the second time, this was ominous. </sentence><sentence id="166">This was dangerous, and we couldn't understand what it means. </sentence><sentence id="167">And there was in the camp a group of perhaps fifteen, twenty people like I who had been in the French army, and we were suddenly separated from the others and we believed that we are separated because France would never send the people who had...who have fought for France, would never surrender those people to the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="168">On the contrary I mean what they did was to be sure that we don't run away, they...it wasn't impossible to run away. </sentence><sentence id="169">In spite of all the guards and for men like...who like me who had a right to be around in the camp because I was postmaster, it would have been considerably possible, like in Auschwitz later. </sentence><sentence id="170">I'll tell you about it. </sentence><sentence id="171">It was possible, possible to run away. </sentence><sentence id="172">But what happened afterwards is the second question because where would you ever run. </sentence><sentence id="173">You had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="174">You had no mon...money. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh people there are certainly hostile. </sentence><sentence id="176">If you were to knock at their door, who would have helped you. </sentence><sentence id="177">But so they wanted to be sure that we don't run away, but we cer...we misinterpreted this. </sentence><sentence id="178">As a matter of fact there was in the camp a French police officer who was and I was quite on good terms with him because he spoke  friendly way, and he had likewise because it was profound dishonor. </sentence><sentence id="179">The French  0 freight car, and we considered breaking out but again the question was, you know, we could have lifted the boards. </sentence><sentence id="180">There was nothing in the freight car but the boards. </sentence><sentence id="181">Uh perhaps you could have lifted them and jumped out and we were...also it was strange the French uh gendarmes, not not the Germans but uh then the question arose . </sentence><sentence id="182">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="183">We will be caught again. </sentence><sentence id="184">So after perhaps twenty-four hours, we came to Drancy and that's in...and then then _-- Drancy. </sentence><sentence id="185">Drancy looked horrible. </sentence><sentence id="186">Drancy consisted of barracks or which had been made for the French police before the war and which could not be occupied because they were wet and badly built, so they stood empty, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="187">I know...I think they stood empty before we came. </sentence><sentence id="188">Not only before we came...before Drancy became a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="189">Uh we left incidentally on the Ist...on the 1st of September...the 1st of September of Vernet. </sentence><sentence id="190">We were perhaps on the 2nd or the 3rd in Drancy, which is in a suburb of Paris. </sentence><sentence id="191">It was fully of concentra...of uh of of uh barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="192">Of course, we couldn't see the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="193">We know there were other sections, except the section where we were. </sentence><sentence id="194">We were put into rooms which were full of uh rotten straw. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was rotting, you know. </sentence><sentence id="196">It's wet and rotting, and there we were waiting, and, of course, uh uh being very much concerned and preoccupied what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was a morbid situation already you know. </sentence><sentence id="198">Under the rotten straw and with children and uh old people and the complete uh uh the complete helplessness and the complete lack of uh of...we didn't know what's going to happen...to happen to us but we knew, of course, we are now in the clutches of the German and at night we heard sometimes shooting from other parts of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="199">We didn't know what it means. </sentence><sentence id="200">I remember I | went to one of the barbed wires and saw...and tried to see whether I can get...I can get out but it was out of questioning, and then after three or four days there, uh we were ordered to go down...down...we we were upstairs I remember. </sentence><sentence id="201">We had to go downstairs, you know, to the...to the platform and on the platform there was already the SS and with...with their customary politeness, shouting and beating and and uh sending us into the...into the railroad cars. </sentence><sentence id="202">Now, the French railroads had on every...perhaps they have it to day...I don't think they have it today, but in the 2nd World War, an inscription saying forthe _. </sentence><sentence id="203">That was from the 1st World War and they still have it in the 2nd World War. </sentence><sentence id="204">For the . [ </sentence><sentence id="205">know we were, but I I know this from having read it  1 knew this. </sentence><sentence id="206">But we were never told, and I have always said, no Nazi ever now told why I was in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="207">I was never told why I was persecuted by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="208">I would say...no, they didn't...but they treated us like Jews. </sentence><sentence id="209">I mean they treated us like uh like non-human beings. </sentence><sentence id="210">They beat us and they shouted and uh the worst thing which happened was when I stayed with the French freight cars were for forty...forty men or eight horses. </sentence><sentence id="211">I guess they put in about eighty people. </sentence><sentence id="212">I cannot say how many, but I do know when we were...when we came in, we came into the in the freight, into the freight train, on on the on the side opposite the door were little...they're little openings and they were with barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="213">You could look out there but not very well. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was pretty dark there, and it...we were so crowded that when you sat down, you couldn't stretch your leg. </sentence><sentence id="215">You...you couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="216">You you were...you were fixed in this position. </sentence><sentence id="217">There were women, children, old people. </sentence><sentence id="218">They gave us...they gave us and I think they gave us enough  2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Bracelet...and it had a number...7 - 7 - 7, and here I have the number 1 -7-7-7-7-4, SO... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: Uh Linda would like you to repeat the phrase about the bracelet so my voice isn't in there, so the only identity...just say it again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: The only identity...iden...not id...identity, document or identity piece which I had on myself was a military bracelet which...from my military service in France which had a number 7 - 7 - 7. </sentence><sentence id="224">And it...and I I threw away at this point. </sentence><sentence id="225">That's really the point I want to make. </sentence><sentence id="226">I threw it away somehow because I thought it would indicate that I have been in the French army, which was right, but the strange coincidence is that there were three 7's, and here I have four 7's on my...here. ( </sentence><sentence id="227">Cough) So after a couple of hours, pandemonium broke out. </sentence><sentence id="228">People were crying. </sentence><sentence id="229">People were uh shouting, wailing. </sentence><sentence id="230">It was...there was the terrible stench and people always...the train stopped quite often. </sentence><sentence id="231">I remember it stopped once I believe in Mintz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="232">Mintz, in in the Alsace (ph). </sentence><sentence id="233">I I figured it's Mintz, in the Alsace. </sentence><sentence id="234">And people shouted to to the outside, open the door. </sentence><sentence id="235">We want to so that we throw the the the excrements out and we want water, but the doors were not opened. </sentence><sentence id="236">Then we came...there was a little incident. </sentence><sentence id="237">We came into a big railroad station and I believe it was Frankfurt or__. </sentence><sentence id="238">It was in a big city, and opposite our tra...in the train...our train stopped and opposite our train was a first class train of Germans and they stared at us, and and a lady who was...a woman who was on the train took her little girl and and held it up to the little window with barbed wire, and shouted, water, please, water, please, water. </sentence><sentence id="239">And the Germans...there were...there were fifty in this railroad...in this other train, looked at us and they didn't move because they were afraid and I mean there was no satisfaction on their...they could have shouted dirty Jews, which happened later on, but nothing , and suddenly a German woman was running on the platform with a  3 they are trying to kill us there, so suddenly after three, or four or five days...I don't know...the train stopped in an open field and we heard shout...shouting...shoutings...everybody...all men between I guess they said fifty and...fifteen and fifty...1 don't know...something like this. </sentence><sentence id="240">Perhaps...yeah, probably...fifteen and fifty...all men between fifteen and fifty, out. </sentence><sentence id="241">Women and children remain inside. </sentence><sentence id="242">Well, we jumped out of the...out of the...out of the wagon and there was...there was a little hill and we walked...we we run down the hill, and the SS came and and uh and uh uh pushed all the people back, but you see there were some younger people, young men who didn't want to separate from their families. </sentence><sentence id="243">They didn't want to come down, so they tried to get them down and the same woman who had shown her child in the train on the German station, walked out and an SS man came...with the child...and an SS man came and threw the child against the wagon and probably killed the child and shoved the mother back and she carried the child. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="245">She had the child back. </sentence><sentence id="246">And we walked down a little slope and suddenly let me go back to the train. </sentence><sentence id="247">I really do not recall and cannot really imagine now how...what happened with this one bucket and with this...with this bucket of water. </sentence><sentence id="248">You know, the bucket of water was, of course, empty, but the toilet bucket, I know it was overflowing. </sentence><sentence id="249">There was stench. </sentence><sentence id="250">I must say I personally wouldn't recall that I used it. </sentence><sentence id="251">I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="252">I don't recall, and there was stench. </sentence><sentence id="253">There was dirt. </sentence><sentence id="254">There was...you know, the the excrements were all over. </sentence><sentence id="255">Also, when you're in a lot of stench, you become insensitive to it. </sentence><sentence id="256">You don't...I don't think you you you don't feel it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="257">Uh it was hot. </sentence><sentence id="258">It was depressing. </sentence><sentence id="259">Also physiologically de...depressing. </sentence><sentence id="260">Uh you were not very active, not very alert, but I must say...that's a very good question...I do not really know what people did after the bucket...and I myself...after all, as I say, I think it was between three or five days...I myself don't recall, and after all, after three or five days you have some need to go somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="261">I don't recall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Would you tell us again now about the train stopping? </sentence><sentence id="302">Where it stopped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="306">The train stopped near a little town called Kozel (ph), which is in Upper Salasia and which is I believe at the River. </sentence><sentence id="307">at this time. </sentence><sentence id="308">It stopped in the open  4 construction work, on the high....highway. </sentence><sentence id="309">It was very important that I speak about this because people think of gas and beating and sickness and starvation, but  5 Kubacheck (ph), and when the train moved west and we moved to , he was standing next to me and suddenly started to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="310">He said to me, I am not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="311">I am a Polish officer, and I cannot say that I am a Polish officer because...you see, he had some confidence in me because I had given him...I had preserved his nice stamps, and if he dared to say that he is a Polish officer, they would take him out and kill him. </sentence><sentence id="312">And he later on...I'll tell you later on...he helped me. </sentence><sentence id="313">He really saved my life twice, so it was Stanislov Kubacheck and then we...the train went west and we came to a camp called Lauerhutte (ph). </sentence><sentence id="314">Now Lauerhutte...you know what a hutte is...a hutte in German is a combination between a mine and a blast furnace. </sentence><sentence id="315">In Upper Salasia it was full of heavy industry and Lauerhutte was one of those huttes where you had blasted furnaces and where you had...I don't know whether there was a coal mine or not. </sentence><sentence id="316">Lauerhutte which is the German name is...was part of a big city called...a relatively big industrial city called in German Hindenburg (ph) after Hindenburg, and I know it was called in Polish , and it's a combination of many industrial smaller towns in  6 came there sometimes in the middle of September. </sentence><sentence id="317">We left uh Paris, Drancy, the first of September and we came there around the middle of September. </sentence><sentence id="318">By the beginning of November, about one third, all the Dutch were gone. </sentence><sentence id="319">All the Dutch who had...didn't survive Kozel, had died. </sentence><sentence id="320">And the people who died and every day people died, the people who died...we were in this big room where there had been boilers before, a boiler room...and there were...there were bunker beds...beds, you know, uh three story beds, and behind us there was some straw and the Dutch people were always around into the straw. </sentence><sentence id="321">The next day they were carried out in one coffin...one coffin, and there was a a team (ph) which didn't do anything else but the whole day they they they carried the dead people out and uh and as I said, by November I guess one third of the people had died, and new people came in. </sentence><sentence id="322">Uh at this time, before this happened, I was once ordered to go by truck to the station...now I don't know whether whether Lauerhutte had a station or whether it was , to a station and I was sitting with another buddy, with another inmate,  7 could ask for sick leave...sick leave...you could ask not to go to work for one day but it was very dangerous because when you came to the sick bay and then you went... . </sentence><sentence id="323">Lwas so weak I stayed in bed andI didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="324">I was what happened. </sentence><sentence id="325">I couldn't anymore and this Stanislov Kubacheck, this Polish officer who had become a kapo, helped me. </sentence><sentence id="326">In the first place, the kapo has...had to...had to watch whether his people got one ration...got their food, and he had to watch others that they don't don't come twice and take food twice, so he allowed me to go twice. </sentence><sentence id="327">I was the first and came the last one. </sentence><sentence id="328">Then he took me to his commander in his team and I didn't have to work, so I recovered and I must say amongst the many circumstances why I survived, that was one, but it's only one because there were thousands other dangers which I was exposed to and that's then another story. </sentence><sentence id="329">Uh I must say from Lauerhutte we also were sent to work in combination. </sentence><sentence id="330">I don't remember  8 what and it was very difficult to help people back. </sentence><sentence id="331">And from time to time there were selections, particularly these prisoners were sent out because they couldn't work but we didn't quite understand why that was. </sentence><sentence id="332">Uh but we did understand because I want to say now at the end of our stay in in Lauerhutte, we had a very good Polish master. </sentence><sentence id="333">We worked in a factory under German masters or Polish masters and we were watched and guarded by by these uh SR or whatever they were, and it was known that we would uh be transferred and he thought we would be sent to the gas and so he was very kind and sad. </sentence><sentence id="334">He gave us cigarettes and then one day we were...we were transferred in August of 1943 and we went to Blechhammer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="335">Now Lauerhutte was a small camp and it was an outside camp of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="336">Blechhammer was a big camp. </sentence><sentence id="337">There were five thousand people in Blechhammer and it was Auschwitz No. </sentence><sentence

id="341">Then Auschwitz II was Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="342">That was the extermination camp, so not everybody that was in Birkenau was exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="343">There were people who were for weeks in Birkenau and instead of going to the gas, they were sent to work, and then there were...was Auschwitz III, and to my knowledge that was the camp of Blechhammer, uh Buna

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="388">And in Blechhammer, after a short period where we were guarded by the German army and the German shouldn't say the army didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="389">We were guarded by the German regular German army. </sentence><sentence id="390">Then we were guarded by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="391">Uh there is a very good book by who wrote....  9 where I had it...a spoon, but there were people who had nothing of this, so they would get their food in a big washing...wash dish for let's say six people, and now imagine how can you get your food...how can you fish out part of the soup and the potatoes...there were potatoes in it...if you have no instrument, you know, utensil to take it out. </sentence><sentence id="392">These people quarreled, didn't get what was their due, and uh many of them died of course. </sentence><sentence id="393">Uh we worked...we were in the camp and we got up in the summer at five o'clock...no, in the summer at four or three o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="394">In the winter later and we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening, twelve hours. </sentence><sentence id="395">We worked on various jobs and the type of job you had depended...determined very much your your your fate because if you had a heavy job, it was exhausting and you were exposed to beatings. </sentence><sentence id="396">If you had a relatively light job, you were exempt from this. </sentence><sentence id="397">You were not exposed to this and I must say in Blechhammer I worked on construction work, but I was able to make it and then then I had light...light work, and the last job I had in Blechhammer was...there were...there there were...and there were...all the windows were broken from bombings and so we had to fit in uh cardboards where the the glass had been. </sentence><sentence id="398">I must tell you that Blechhammer was one of the German factories where oil, petrol, gasoline was derived from coal. </sentence><sentence id="399">It was one of the most important German factories and there were a few of such factories in Bohemia, in central Germany, and there, and at the end when the Germans lost uh Romanian oil fields, they were of of utmost strategic importance and I'll tell you later on about the bombing. </sentence><sentence id="400">Uh how should I systematize Blechhammer. </sentence><sentence id="401">I've told you about uh there being various nationalities, and uh we had to walk about two, three miles...no, two, three kilometers to the factory. </sentence><sentence id="402">We had to get up very, very early. </sentence><sentence id="403">Uh the factory employed twenty-five thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="404">Among them were five thousand Germans who were free workers, a small number of French and Czech workers who were free workers who were only obliged to work there, and a great number of slaves of uh various degrees, prisoners of war, English prisoners of war, French prisoners of war, Yugoslav prisoners of war and so on. </sentence><sentence id="405">Uh so in the morning, you could...it was an incredible picture. </sentence><sentence id="406">You could see...it was still dark...you could see from all sides the people marching towards the factory and uh we were surrounded on both sides by the SS which had like long whips with  0 end...at the point which I am now talking about...there were some thirty children and Demera, the lageraltester, the head of the of the camp, the Jewish head of the camp, was afraid that his child and his children who were badly...who were well treated, they had enough to eat...the Germans gave them enough to eat, but that they would would be gassed, so he persuaded...uh he told the SS look...we have the children. </sentence><sentence id="407">They're not working. </sentence><sentence id="408">I mean they're parasites. </sentence><sentence id="409">We need to have children, the children work. </sentence><sentence id="410">And a column was created, a kommando was created, consisting only of children. </sentence><sentence id="411">The kapo was Mr. Klepich (ph) from Paris, the deputy kapo was Mr. Bornstein (ph) from Warsaw...I knew them well...I happened to know them well...and for some reason which I cannot recall, I had...1 was thrown out of my kommando. </sentence><sentence id="412">It was a bad work...I don't know what I did, and nobody wants to have me in his kommando, so being during the roll call pushed from one...one kommando to the other, I landed at the children's kommando which had the first day...which was...had it's first day, and since I knew that the the the kapo and his deputy, they took me in. </sentence><sentence id="413">I don't know what right they had to take me in but I had somebody else to throw me out or push me out from their kommando. </sentence><sentence id="414">I was with the children's kommando, and so we walked on this day...that was in October 1943..-with the children to work. </sentence><sentence id="415">Now the children...the SS on both sides with its sticks and with whips and its machine guns and all the five thousand people in this __ this way and the thirty children. </sentence><sentence id="416">Now when we met the other prisoners, the French prisoners, the British prisoners, everybody started to shout and to to whistle and to call shame on the Germans and the SS itself was embarrassed and they did react, so we walked with the children to our assigned working place and there somebody uh uh a kapo appeared and said the children have to do the following. </sentence><sentence id="417">There are stones on this side of the road and they have to bring the stones to the other side of the road, and he disappeared and we were alone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="418">And some of the children started to work and took the stones and brought them to the other side and other children knew that they were in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="419">They were between six and twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="420">Whatever the little boy and a charming little boy called Malich (ph) and he didn't recognize that he was in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="421">He wanted to play, so when we came to this place and the other children were...brought stones from one side to the other, he played. </sentence><sentence id="422">He played. </sentence><sentence id="423">He had...there was a broken down machine. </sentence><sentence id="424">It was a plane or something...a steam engine. </sentence><sentence id="425">He played there, and suddenly there came a young SS man whom I had never seen and he liked this boy and he started to play with Malich and then he started to carve out of wood which was laying around, little things which he...little toys and gave it to to Malich and then he said to me, isn't it a pity. </sentence><sentence id="426">Such a nice boy, but he is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="427">He must die. </sentence><sentence id="428">Now the children's column had no tragic end I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="429">After a while the children gave up carrying the stone. </sentence><sentence id="430">The whole thing was was meaningless and they were staying around there, but it was October. </sentence><sentence id="431">It became...it was very, very cold. </sentence><sentence id="432">It became colder and colder and uh we didn't know what to do with ourselves and with the children and I remember they they were singing and they were singing two songs. </sentence><sentence id="433">One of the which is their home, and another song  1 few have survived. </sentence><sentence id="434">I mean of the five thousand...I don't know what happened to the children, but nothing happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="435">The the the kommando was dissolved again. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="436">(drinking) Now I want to tell you the story about the gallows. </sentence><sentence id="437">The SS beat people. </sentence><sentence id="438">The SS uh could take uh a stick or something, an iron bar and hit somebody and kill him. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="439">Nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="440">They were not called. </sentence><sentence id="441">They were not in any way responsible, but there was a very strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="442">The one...they hanged somebody and erected a gallow. </sentence><sentence id="443">A person was hanged upon order of the chief of the...no...the furher of the SS and chief of the German police. </sentence><sentence id="444">Furher of the SS and chief , and when somebody was  2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: One day we were...we were asked to load sheets of tin which were in front of a barrack and transport them to another barrack, so we loaded a few of these sheets on this little cart and started to walk towards the other barrack, and suddenly we heard behind us, sabotage, sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="446">In the factory, there was not only the SS. </sentence><sentence id="447">There was what was called Factory Gestapo, Work Gestapo, and they had noticed that we had loaded this, and they noticed that we transported it and behind the Gestapo came SS man. </sentence><sentence id="448">You dirty Jews. </sentence><sentence id="449">You traitors. </sentence><sentence id="450">You...and they started to shout sabotage, sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="451">And that was a very good example. </sentence><sentence id="452">I mean in general, , generally they beat us why. </sentence><sentence id="453">Because we didn't  3 death. </sentence><sentence id="454">They had his number and they called all the people together and would uh...they could...they called all the people together and suddenly would read...his first name was Sam Johnson...uh number so and so...sentence death for sabotage, so we were afraid for for many weeks thereafter that we would be called...that there would be another hanging and then they would call us and say we are sentenced to death, so we got out of this. </sentence><sentence id="455">But it was not only an extraordinary experience, very extraordinary experience...I think there are a few people who considered under the gallows but walk today. </sentence><sentence id="456">Now it's difficult to give you other highlights if there are other highlights in the life of the camp, but I must say, our enemies were the SS, hunger... even so we were much better fed than the County Vernet. </sentence><sentence id="457">We were working hard and even if we were not working hard, I mean sixteen hours. </sentence><sentence id="458">I mean I tried to work as little as possible but still uh so there was hu...the
