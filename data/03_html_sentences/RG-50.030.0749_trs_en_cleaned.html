<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: And that was what's -- that was my father instigated it when he said, "I want you to be a college graduate, but you have to understand I don't have any money to give you." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: And is that what you meant by support from the Stern family is that they contributed in some way? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: No, not financially. </sentence><sentence id="233">They contributed by being active lookers in the audience. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: You have to understand, in a town of 5,000 where we're a railroad, that includes workers on the railroad that laid the ties, laid the track and so on so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: You know some towns -- because I'm not familiar with the Midwest -- some towns can be very homogenous, and some are not. </sentence><sentence id="265">And that's the sense I'm trying to get is, "How much were there -- how much influence was there? </sentence><sentence id="266">How much knowledge was there? </sentence><sentence id="267">How much interaction was there with people who either would have been Jewish, people who would have been from Europe, people who were different from, let's say, a midwestern American?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Well, that's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because when some new family moved in, the first question you ask them, "Can you play football or baseball or basketball?" [ </sentence><sentence id="270">laughing]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Those were the important questions? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Yeah, you do that, everything else is fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: [laughing] Those are not bad criteria actually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: But -- okay. </sentence><sentence id="282">So I'll go about it this way. </sentence><sentence id="283">I'm trying to ask, "In school, were current events talked about?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Current events were talked about, but only in Europe, not Japan. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="286">So in other words, you heard what was going on in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: We heard what was going on, but we truthfully didn't believe it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="292">So this was in the 30's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: -- when Hitler comes to power? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: People in your town knew about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: I said "I was told about it, but I didn't believe it." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: And what was it that you didn't believe? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: That there was a Hitler who was killing people and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: At that time in the 30's, it would have been like political people -- it would have been people who were opponents ideologically from his regime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: Well, Hitler's speeches were on the radio. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: You mean you heard them in the original German? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Wow. </sentence><sentence id="313">And were they translated then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: No, except my mother could speak a little Dutch, a little German and so on. </sentence><sentence id="317">And my friends -- some of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="318">And my minister, whose name was Reverend Joe Jordan, he could speak German fluently. </sentence><sentence id="319">And he had been in World War I. So he pretty much kept us up to speed. </sentence><sentence id="320">He said -- again, I repeat -- I did not believe that this was actually happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Yeah, okay. </sentence><sentence id="327">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: And you have to understand that I was raised in an isolationist atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: That's what I wanted to get at too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="335">The answer is that "We did not believe in being involved in other people's wars." </sentence><sentence id="336">Let Hitler do what he's going to do in Europe and so on so forth, but we're not going to be involved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: That was a widespread feeling in the town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: That was very widespread. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Was it something that you took for granted as the right way to be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Did that change for you at any point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Pearl Harbor when I was a freshman in college. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: What college did you go into? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: It's funny, because I went to Indiana University on a full scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="355">But then my father was transferred from Garrett to Buchanan, West Virginia. </sentence><sentence id="356">So I transferred to University of West Virginia, and my sister did too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: And she was going to college as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: She was a sophomore in college. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: She was a first semester junior when I was a first semester freshman at Indiana. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: That's pretty -- that's quite an accomplishment for a poor family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: That's very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="371">In my high school class, I think either two or maybe three went to school -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: -- beyond -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: -- went to college. </sentence><sentence id="374">In fact, one of them went to nurse's school. </sentence><sentence id="375">Somebody else went to college. </sentence><sentence id="376">There's only three of us that went to college. </sentence><sentence id="377">The point being is that you could walk down to B &amp; O Railroad and get a job instantaneously. </sentence><sentence id="378">There was really no advantage of going to college -- financially. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Well, by the time you finished. </sentence><sentence id="386">Because, when you started, it was still a depression. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="389">When did jobs come up again? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: Well, the answer is that the B &amp; O -- the B &amp; O did not do much hiring during the Depression, but there were jobs for kids, which paid, you know, $3.00 or $4.00 an hour. </sentence><sentence id="391">Now, it was way below -- what was the minimum wage then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: Yeah, it probably would have been way less than $3 or $4. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: So it couldn't support a family, but it could employ a kid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: So you're saying there wasn't that much incentive to going on to college because there was this choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="407">Still -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: And, in addition to that, a fair number of kids" family lived on a farm. </sentence><sentence id="409">Indiana -- northern Indiana is a big farm area. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: So they were needed at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: They were needed at home, and they made their -- all had money. </sentence><sentence id="413">The farm kids all were financially stable, because they -- what they did was, they would bring in a pig or a cow and get credit for it at the grocery store for a long period of time. </sentence><sentence id="414">So those kids could take me and go into these grocery stores and always get a candy bar on a trade-type thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: And did they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: Yeah, they sure did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="422">Q: Did you feel the difference between yourself being from a not so well-to-do family and the other kids or not so much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="424">A: There was zero feeling -- zero feeling as far as wealth was concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="426">Q: As far as what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: Wealth -- money was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="429">No one had much money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="432">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="433">But I go back to it. </sentence><sentence id="434">It still is quite unusual and quite impressive that the two children in one family that is not so well-to-do end up going to college. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="440">Q: What do you attribute that to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="442">A: My grandfather paid for my sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="444">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="445">So education was something that was valued not only by your father but by his father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="449">No -- by my mother's father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="452">Q: Uh-huh -- by your mother's father. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: Engineering officers -- okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="636">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="637">So the answer is -- is that I was just called up and said, "You're being shipped out." </sentence><sentence id="638">And I was going to go to Mississippi State College for engineering. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="642">Q: Wow -- okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: And I did that for one year. </sentence><sentence id="645">And then the army decided they didn't need engineering officers. </sentence><sentence id="646">So they just canceled the program. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="677">Q: Not frightening at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="679">A: There was a sign that was on -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="680">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="681">I'm going to read this out. </sentence><sentence id="682">This is from a presentation that you have given in the past and will give again on leadership. </sentence><sentence id="683">It's called "Leadership from a foxhole and passing the baton of freedom." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="712">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="713">And you did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="716">A: And I did. </sentence><sentence id="717">And the first sergeant said, "I don't have the slightest idea what this is all about. </sentence><sentence id="718">Go to battalion." </sentence><sentence id="719">I go to battalion, and I talk to the sergeant major, "What is this all about?" " </sentence><sentence id="720">I don't have the slightest idea. </sentence><sentence id="721">Go to regimen." </sentence><sentence id="722">So I walk to regimen, and they didn't have the slightest idea. </sentence><sentence id="723">They sent me to division headquarters, and the first time I heard the word "Ranger." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="725">So even then it was just volunteers without even the word "Rangers?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: They not only gave you an explanation, there were physical and mental tests involved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="750">Q: Mm-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: So for two weeks I did much road marching and took tests for mental stability and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="781">I remember they -- they asked a lot of questions. </sentence><sentence id="782">In fact, you're asking here about growing up and so on. " </sentence><sentence id="783">Why do you want to be in the rangers?" </sentence><sentence id="784">That sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="790">Q: It was kind of hard to answer why you want to be in the rangers if you don't know what the rangers are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="792">A: Well, by this time I had a very thorough understanding that they were going to hit the beaches on D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="793">They were going to lead raids all through Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="796">Q: So that kind of explanation had been given. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="820">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="822">A: And I hear "Neighborgall, come in." </sentence><sentence id="823">So I walk in this room, and it's fairly dark. </sentence><sentence id="824">Not very well lit. </sentence><sentence id="825">And behind a desk in front of me is the meanest-looking guy I ever saw in my life who's a ranger. </sentence><sentence id="826">My first ranger I've seen. </sentence><sentence id="827">He says, "Neighborgall, sit down."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1202">Q: So I'm going to just bridge this a bit and say you survived the assault on Normandy on D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And only one last question before we go forward -- and that is, "Were you able to sleep at that time after -- after you knew you were safe, did you have any chance to recover?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1204">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1205">No -- it didn't bother me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1206">Q: Didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1207">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1208">So when you -- what happened -- where did you get to? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1222">A: No big towns. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: And then what were your tasks? </sentence><sentence id="1231">What were your assignments? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1234">A: We were a part of Patton's third army. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And we were on individual missions. </sentence><sentence id="1236">He would send us out there, attack the Germans, find out how strong they are, how many -- make a guess as to what the estimated numbers are concerned, and we did that continually. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1237">Q: What kind of missions were you personally on; do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1238">A: They were all -- they were all the same type of missions. </sentence><sentence id="1239">The answer is that you would go a certain distance before you ran into drillmen shooting at you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1242">Q: So in other words -- (walkie talkie talking). </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1243">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1244">So the missions were all similar, you're saying. </sentence><sentence id="1245">But I'm trying to get a sense of, if I were on the ground -- or, if you were describing it to me in detail, what would you be experiencing? </sentence><sentence id="1246">What would you be doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1251">A: Firing at Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And, by the way, the casualty list was very high. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1255">Q: From this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1257">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1258">You would -- during missions like that, you'd expect 50% casualties. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1271">Q: Weren't you scared by this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1273">A: I don't think "scared" -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1274">Q: That's not the word, huh? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1275">A: No, that's because we're highly-trained. </sentence><sentence id="1276">See, you're highly-trained so you wouldn't be scared. </sentence><sentence id="1277">If you were scared and someone told you, "See that guy up on top of the hill with a machine gun? </sentence><sentence id="1278">Go kill him." </sentence><sentence id="1279">You wouldn't do that unless you were highly-trained. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1285">Q: Allright. </sentence><sentence id="1286">I guess what I'm trying to say is that, before you leave the U.K. -- before you leave England -- everything is theoretical. </sentence><sentence id="1287">The minute you hit France, it stops being theoretical. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1291">A: Theoretical and training are the same thing to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1293">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1295">A: In other words, we were highly trained. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1297">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1298">So that -- so that that's what kicks in -- this almost-automatic response, "Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1312">Q: Any interaction with those that you captured? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1314">A: I didn't speak German, but some of the rangers did. </sentence><sentence id="1315">But there really wasn't any interaction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1318">Q: What did these people look like -- these German soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1338">Did you ever go -- it sounds like you were in skirmishes rather than actual battles at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1339">A: Well, remember -- we were 500 people. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And that -- and we were never -- and we never attacked as 500. </sentence><sentence id="1341">We always attacked as 25 or 30 or 40. </sentence><sentence id="1342">Sometimes just a couple. </sentence><sentence id="1343">Before we went into Germany, we came out of France and went to Belgium. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1656">A: Well, they came up with facts and figures -- I mean, not "facts and figures," but they came up with descriptions which defied absolute logic. </sentence><sentence id="1657">Even though people had seen it, it's really hard to accept unless you've seen it yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1660">Q: So it didn't really sink in with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1662">A: Say again? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1680">Q: Yep. </sentence><sentence id="1681">It's, you know, what we're doing now is trying to reconstruct what it looked like then. </sentence><sentence id="1682">That's not so easy to do, but it's part of trying to get an historical record through, you know, a medium like an oral history interview is to remember what you didn't know at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1683">That's not so hard -- that's not so easy to do when you already know something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1688">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1690">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Let's go back then to -- you know, you bring this officer back whom you were his now lifesaver. </sentence><sentence id="1692">You dragged him back to your lines. </sentence><sentence id="1693">You weren't able to finish your mission. </sentence><sentence id="1694">What happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1722">A: This was -- Eisenhower is here. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And he put his line right across the Battle of the Bulge and divided the responsibility between Patton in the south and Montgomery in the north. </sentence><sentence id="1724">So British troops here were under Patton. </sentence><sentence id="1725">American troops up here were under Montgomery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1730">Q: Isn't that interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1731">You know -- a switch, that British troops would be under an American general. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1734">A: But that was only because he had to have some responsibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1736">Q: Where were you on this map? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1738">A: Down here. </sentence><sentence id="1739">And we were -- the third army was attacking east. </sentence><sentence id="1740">When Patton got the mission of this, he moved about 100,000 people from attacking east to attacking north. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And the weather was bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1746">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1782">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1783">And someone said, "That couldn't have been very comfortable." </sentence><sentence id="1784">And I said, "It's better than walking." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1785">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1786">A: Now, something unusual happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2295">Q: [laughing]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
