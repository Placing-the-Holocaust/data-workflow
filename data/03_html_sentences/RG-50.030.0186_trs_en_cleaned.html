<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you... Uh, welcome. </sentence><sentence id="4">And would you tell me your name, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: My name is Liane Reif-Lehrer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Iwas born in Vienna, Austria, Zweitebitziek, on November 14th, 1934. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Uh, tell me about your parents. </sentence><sentence id="14">Uh, what did your father do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Uh, my father was born in Poland, and came to Vienna to go to medical school. </sentence><sentence id="18">And then uh went on, after he finished medical school, to study dentistry; and then opened a dental practice uh in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="19">Uh, my mother was also born in Poland; and came to Vienna, I think, probably for some frivolous reason--like a vacation, or to buy clothes or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="20">And somehow met my father. </sentence><sentence id="21">Uh, and they were married; and uh my mother stayed in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="22">And uh they uh...I guess things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's practice off the ground. </sentence><sentence id="23">And I think during those early years my mother helped out-- answering the phone and...and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="24">But then after that, she really did not work as long as we were still in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="25">And my father had a rather thriving practice, uh which was inside our house. </sentence><sentence id="26">There were two apartments that ...and they had the wall broken down  between them. </sentence><sentence id="27">So that basically we had this... I guess there were fourteen rooms on one level. </sentence><sentence id="28">At one end was my father's practice, and the other end were our living quarters. </sentence><sentence id="29">Uh, so I guess it...it was fairly thriving. </sentence><sentence id="30">And I think there was a fair amount of uh...oh, social activity--in the sense of going to the opera, and uh... I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="31">Maybe some theater. </sentence><sentence id="32">And uh I think once a week they went to some relatives" and played cards. </sentence><sentence id="33">And uh, you know, probably the usual kind of thing that any middle-class family in that era would have been doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q: Uh, what about your...your very uh early years? </sentence><sentence id="53">Uh, you were born in "34. </sentence><sentence id="54">What do you remember of your very early childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: Well, my memories are very spotty. </sentence><sentence id="59">Uh, but uh...1 remember ...1 remember my father's office, and I remember my own room and I remember parts of the layout of the apartment quite well. </sentence><sentence id="60">Not all of it. </sentence><sentence id="61">I mean, I don't think I could draw you a map. </sentence><sentence id="62">But I uh...I remember the dining room, for example; and I remember the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="63">Uh, I think I liked messing around in the kitchen a lot. </sentence><sentence id="64">And I liked... We had a cook, and she let me uh play around in there and do things; although I seem to remember my mother didn't like me to do that. </sentence><sentence id="65">Uh ,the cook used to let me stand up on a chair and help dry the dishes; and I...I think my mother was not too thrilled about that. </sentence><sentence id="66">Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act...We...there were other uh... I hate to use this word, but "servants," in the house. </sentence><sentence id="67">I mean, people who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and did all those things; and I think they were sort of fun for me. </sentence><sentence id="68">And I remember a fair number of...of things. </sentence><sentence id="69">Like when they uh ...they  used to roll up the carpets and the runners and take them up to--I don't know, the roof maybe--to beat them with those old-fashioned paddles. </sentence><sentence id="70">And when they rolled up...Especially there were long hallways in the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="71">So we had these long runners, and they would let me stand or sit on one end; and as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a ride. </sentence><sentence id="72">Uh, and then when they folded the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know, getting swung in the sheets. </sentence><sentence id="73">Uh, and I remember getting rides on brooms. </sentence><sentence id="74">You know, I'd put my feet on the two parts of the broom and they would sweep along. </sentence><sentence id="75">Uh, so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="76">I...1 remember ...uh I remember one of my governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my room, actually. </sentence><sentence id="77">I think in my room there was my uh sort of crib and...and maybe... I only remember that there was a crib, although as I look back on it by the age four it's hard to believe that I still slept in a crib. </sentence><sentence id="78">But who knows? </sentence><sentence id="79">And then right in...in uh line with that, there was this other bed where I think the governess slept. </sentence><sentence id="80">Uh, and I remember quite well the layout of my room and where there was a dresser, and I think there was a furry animal, and...and where the window was. </sentence><sentence id="81">Uh, I'm not sure I remember terribly much else about those early uh years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: What about people? </sentence><sentence id="110">What about your parents? </sentence><sentence id="111">What do you remember about them? </sentence><sentence id="112">What do you remember about...? </sentence><sentence id="113">I believe you had a brother. </sentence><sentence id="114">Tell me about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember very much from the Vienna era about people. </sentence><sentence id="122">Uh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I think I remembered my father when I was younger. </sentence><sentence id="123">But then, at some stage when I was probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we  were already in the United States long since by that time. </sentence><sentence id="124">But my mother always had a large picture of my father on her bed, uh her night table; and I remember a day when I looked at that picture and suddenly realized that the actual memory of my father that I remembered having then had been replaced by the memory of this photograph. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="131">Let's get a sense of...of... You described a child having a good time in the house. </sentence><sentence id="132">Uh, as the Hitler years progressed and we move toward the years uh of uh...to the Anschluss, uh can you tell me what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about from my first-hand recollection is about Kristallnacht, because I remember that with incredible clarity. </sentence><sentence id="137">Uh, my mother was holding me in her arms, and my brother was holding onto her skirt. </sentence><sentence id="138">Uh, and there was this knock at the door. </sentence><sentence id="139">And uh I re...1 mean, I remember that it was a very tense time and it was in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="140">And uh my mother went to... We had one of these peepholes that has like a metal cover, you know, that you push aside; and my mother pushed it aside, and somebody whammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass. </sentence><sentence id="141">And then the superintendent called out, "Don't worry for life. </sentence><sentence id="142">It's just me; let us in." </sentence><sentence id="143">I thought two men came in, but my brother tells me actually were five or six. </sentence><sentence id="144">Uh and then, I mean, they were very unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="145">And uh I think they kind of totally ignored all three of us, actually. </sentence><sentence id="146">They kind of rummaged through the house. </sentence><sentence id="147">And I...and I...they took a lot of things; but the only thing that I specifically remember them taking is that the cook... There was a white closet in the kitchen where they kept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-related things. </sentence><sentence id="148">And...and there was a uh...a tall  can from these things called "pastilles," which came in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind. </sentence><sentence id="149">And this was the three-tier kind; and the cook used to save coins in it, groschen--which are sort of like pennies. </sentence><sentence id="150">And that must have been important to me, because I remember that they took that. </sentence><sentence id="151">And I was not disturbed...I don't remember being disturbed about them taking anything else. </sentence><sentence id="152">But I remember being disturbed about them taking that. </sentence><sentence id="153">And uh...so that evening is sort of like a frozen still photograph in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="154">But L...you know, then it blacks out on either side of that. </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, and one of the things that I just recently uh said to my brother- -who has often asked me, you know, "Why do you think backwards instead of living your life forwards?" </sentence><sentence id="156">Uh, and I...1 mean, that's a hard question to answer. </sentence><sentence id="157">But about a year ago, when he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter. </sentence><sentence id="158">I suddenly realized that I guess...I guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that era, it's perhaps a little easier. </sentence><sentence id="159">I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what happened and then what happened. </sentence><sentence id="160">And for me, I said to him, I feel as though there's kind of a black box there that I'm maybe constantly trying to pry open but I can't get it open. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh I guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I somehow...I suppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person or some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to remind me of... But I...1 can't get it back. </sentence><sentence id="162">And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a lot about how...how much my father wanted a daughter and how fond he was of me, and...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="163">And I sort of would like to try to go back and remember what that relationship might have been like, but I can't. </sentence><sentence id="164">I can't bring it back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="196">You've moved to your father. </sentence><sentence id="197">And let's talk about what happened, as it were, on either side of Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="198">You had started...your parents had started looking for papers to come to America, or a way to come to America? </sentence><sentence id="199">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Uh, my father uh... And I can't seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father was one of uh quite a few children. </sentence><sentence id="206">And some people say five, some people say seven, some people say nine. </sentence><sentence id="207">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="208">I have a feeling it was either seven or nine. </sentence><sentence id="209">Uh, and there actually was a set of twins in the family. </sentence><sentence id="210">But, anyway, two of the siblings had come to America, uh I think maybe as early as 1920's. </sentence><sentence id="211">And there had been some talk in the family, apparently, of coming to America to join them. </sentence><sentence id="212">Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk got more. </sentence><sentence id="213">Uh, but apparently my father's feeling was, you know, "Look, I'm forty years old. </sentence><sentence id="214">I don't know English. </sentence><sentence id="215">Uh, I wouldn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in America without extensive re-training. </sentence><sentence id="216">How can |...? </sentence><sentence id="217">And, you know, I have such a good practice here. </sentence><sentence id="218">How can I just get up and go?" </sentence><sentence id="219">Uh, well, my father never made it to Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late that they really had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="221">And so, uh on the morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother and father left the house in the morning to do a number of chores. </sentence><sentence id="222">And one of the chores was to pick up our passports, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="223">Uh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they parted to do some separate things; and they were supposed to meet, I think, either at home or at the home of this cousin where they sometimes played cards. </sentence><sentence id="224">But anyway, they were supposed to meet in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="225">And my father never came back. </sentence><sentence id="226">And he was found dead at the bottom of a uh...a four-story stairwell. </sentence><sentence id="227">And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly     depressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer allowed to to work. </sentence><sentence id="228">Uh, and a lot of people were committing suicide. </sentence><sentence id="229">And so I kind of grew up with uh...I mean, a very strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="230">I mean, it was kind of talked about, that he had committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="231">Uh, but uh...my mo...my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and she...she was very adamant that I never tell anybody about that. </sentence><sentence id="232">And I think, really, that must have been a a very difficult thing for me as I was growing up. </sentence><sentence id="233">But anyway, you know, I didn't really think about it very much uh either. </sentence><sentence id="234">As an adult now, as I look back and I ask people, "Well, how...?" </sentence><sentence id="235">You know, and I hear from other survivors about the horrible things that were being done to people, my question has been: "How do you know that he jumped?" </sentence><sentence id="236">And, well, you know, and they say, "Well, we don't know that he jumped. </sentence><sentence id="237">But he was very depressed, and a lot of people were committing suicide." </sentence><sentence id="238">And uh...and my brother also provides a very rational uh reason, which is that he probably thought that the family would be better off without a male. </sentence><sentence id="239">Uh, and so it seems likely that...that he did this. </sentence><sentence id="240">But I can't help always wondering, with all the other stories I hear about, could somebody have pushed him?I mean, nobody would know the difference. </sentence><sentence id="241">So I don't know what the answer to that is. </sentence><sentence id="242">But, anyway, he never came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="284">So you and your mother now were left--this is at the end of September 1938--uh without a father and husband. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: And by the way, those passports that my mother got that morming were taken on Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="288">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="292">So we move from September to November. </sentence><sentence id="293">Kristallnacht happens. </sentence><sentence id="294">You are without passports. </sentence><sentence id="295">What did your mother do? </sentence><sentence id="296">What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="297">All of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately did. </sentence><sentence id="306">I think there was probably a lot of correspondence with the Klinghoffer family, which was my father's sister in New York. </sentence><sentence id="307">Uh, and at some point--and I don't remember when this was, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous van came to the house. </sentence><sentence id="308">And my...my mother was really in, I think she was in really bad straights after my father's death. </sentence><sentence id="309">Uh, and this friend of ours who was a lawyer came and kind of supervised, I think, the packing of this van. </sentence><sentence id="310">Uh, and I don't remember what went into it; but I do remember what came out of it at the other end. </sentence><sentence id="311">And it was ... (Laughter) I mean, it was just a ridiculous assortment of some useful but many totally useless uh objects. </sentence><sentence id="312">But anyway, this van was packed, I suppose, without much thought and in a lot of hurry and sent off to New York; and it was in storage for three years until we finally came there. </sentence><sentence id="313">Uh, so I...I do think I remember the day the van was being packed. </sentence><sentence id="314">But then again, there is... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="326">The van was packed; and then what did you and your mother do, specifically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news, I guess, of this ship that was leaving from Hamburg, this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as they call it here. </sentence><sentence id="330">Uh, and because people were  not allowed to take money out of the country--I think you were allowed four or ten dollars per person--uh I think we and a lot of people like us, who might not have bought first class tickets, uh bought first class tickets. </sentence><sentence id="331">Because you couldn't take the money anyway, so you might as well, you know, spend it on this. </sentence><sentence id="332">Uh, and so we...we got these tickets and we got these visas, uh which also cost a fair amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="333">Uh, and on...in early May of 1939, we took a train to Hamburg uh to get on this boat. </sentence><sentence id="334">Now, I don't remember anything about the voyage except, I think, I remember two things. </sentence><sentence id="335">One is that there's kind of a sense of fear that I still have whenever I have to uh go through any kind of checkpoints. </sentence><sentence id="336">And I think that part of that must have started at that time. </sentence><sentence id="337">And from what my brother tells me it was very scary in Hamburg, because you didn't know, you know, were you going to get on? </sentence><sentence id="338">Was something going to happen before you get on got on? </sentence><sentence id="339">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="340">Uh, and the other thing is that I remember and still have a little white sun-suit uh that I that I was wearing on the ship; and I just happen to remember--again, it's like a still photograph of me in this little uh white sun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region. ( </sentence><sentence id="341">Laughter) Uh, and then I don't remember anything else from from the ship. </sentence><sentence id="342">But uh...I mean, I know that the ship, of course, came to Cuba and we were not allowed in. </sentence><sentence id="343">Uh, and my brother tells me that uh this lawyer, whose name was [Kleinfeld (ph)], uh actually had already been in Cuba at that the time that the boat docked. </sentence><sentence id="344">And he rode out on a little boat to come and see us. </sentence><sentence id="345">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Who was the lawyer? </sentence><sentence id="365">Was he a connection with you personally, or with your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: Well, we were quite friendly with them then when we came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="369">But I think USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 10 we were friends...I'm not sure that our parents were such good friends. </sentence><sentence id="370">I have a feeling that the friendship might have come about through the friendship between their son and my brother, but I'm not sure about that. </sentence><sentence id="371">But they certainly figured in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="372">I mean, L...I remem...they were always talked about. </sentence><sentence id="373">Uh, so he came to the ship, to...to see us, apparently; and then, I mean, what--(coughing) excuse me--what happened on the ship is...is of course well-known, historically. </sentence><sentence id="374">And the ship was turned back, and we went to France. </sentence><sentence id="375">And that's when I start to have much more coherent memories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Tell us what happened when the ship docked. </sentence><sentence id="386">What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: You mean, when we got back to France? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: When you got back to France, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: Uh, well, we ended up first at uh a little town in uh centrally...central France called Loudun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: How did you get there? </sentence><sentence id="396">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: I don't remember getting to Loudun. </sentence><sentence id="400">But uh in Loudun, we were put up in this hotel. </sentence><sentence id="401">And I guess there must have been a group of about twenty of us from the St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="402">Uh, and I remember this hotel, and I remember this...what I thought was a very, very large square in front of the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="403">But in my adult life--when I went back in 1978, I think it was, to Loudun-   USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 11 -the square didn't look nearly as large as I remembered it. ( </sentence><sentence id="404">Laughter) Uh, uh the things I remember from the hotel in Loudun: uh, I remember where our room was--it was a little room on the side. </sentence><sentence id="405">And uh...and I remember some fairly dramatic things. </sentence><sentence id="406">I remember having this little so-called boyfriend that I guess I played with. </sentence><sentence id="407">Uh... What I remember much more dramatically are two things. </sentence><sentence id="408">Uh, well, first off, there are some trivial things I remember. </sentence><sentence id="409">I remember my mother was always very neat and clean. </sentence><sentence id="410">Uh, and I remember that my mother was really horrified at the lack of cleanliness in this hotel, and that there were cats running around on the food preparation tables. </sentence><sentence id="411">Uh, and I also remember that she was absolutely horrified because there was no place to bathe or shower in the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="412">There were toilets, but no, you know, bathing rooms. </sentence><sentence id="413">And so my mother apparently asked the woman who ran the hotel where the town bathing facilities were; and the woman apparently didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="414">And my mother was totally horrified by that. </sentence><sentence id="415">And uh, oh, for years later my mother always did talk about "You don't know how much perfume this lady wore," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="416">So I remember trivia like that, and I remember somehow running around. </sentence><sentence id="417">And I remember uh...I remember once these two older girls sort of held me and made me watch while they were killing uh a chicken that was going to be used for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="418">And...and that was really...1 remember that with great horror. </sentence><sentence id="419">You know, I didn't want to watch that, and they sort of forced me. </sentence><sentence id="420">Uh, so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="421">But the more dramatic things that I remember is that one morning we woke up and there uh was this incredible commotion outside. </sentence><sentence id="422">And there were uh shots; and, I mean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were. </sentence><sentence id="423">And the Germans had come in to Loudun. </sentence><sentence id="424">And uh so, for I guess what must have been a couple of weeks we lived in this hotel, and uh a lot of the German soldiers either... I don't know if they also lived    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 12 there, but they certainly were around all the time and they had meals there. </sentence><sentence id="425">And one of the things that I remember, to this day, being incredibly puzzled about--because at this point uh I was only about five and a half or so--uh is that I was... First of all, you have to understand I was always a very "good girl," and I always did everything I was told. </sentence><sentence id="426">Uh, and I was told that under no circumstances was I to let on that I spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="427">Now, how they expected to perpetuate this hoax I don't know; because my mother spoke no French. </sentence><sentence id="428">My brother had had French lessons in Vienna, so he probably did have some command of French. </sentence><sentence id="429">But I was kind of cute as a little girl, and the soldiers would come up and talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="430">And I remember very clearly continually saying, as they spoke to me in German, "Je ne comprends pas. </sentence><sentence id="431">Je ne comprends pas." </sentence><sentence id="432">And I remember also thinking that there was something very funny about, I guess, having always been taught that you're not supposed to lie and here I was being instructed to tell this out-and-out lie. </sentence><sentence id="433">And also nobody explained to me why I was telling this lie. </sentence><sentence id="434">And so I was really very perplexed, I think, by this whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="435">But I did exactly what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="436">And I remember the soldiers saying all these things to me--which I, of course, understood perfectly--but just saying "Je ne comprends pas." </sentence><sentence id="437">So that was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="438">Another thing... Oh, even before that time, there was one other thing I remember. </sentence><sentence id="439">There was an air raid one night, and I...somehow L...I got away from my mother and I ran outside. </sentence><sentence id="440">And they had to come and retrieve me. </sentence><sentence id="441">I somehow thought it was interesting, or fun, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="442">Uh, but anyway, uh...so for the two weeks or so that we stayed in this hotel in Loudun, in the morning the Germans would do these...1 don't know. </sentence><sentence id="443">Whatever you call them--you know, maneuvers or something. </sentence><sentence id="444">They'd march around the hotel in formation, with their big boots and things. </sentence><sentence id="445">And uh my mother and my brother and I would watch from    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 13 the window. </sentence><sentence id="446">And there was one soldier...and I don't remember his face, but I remember, I remember his form. </sentence><sentence id="447">And I remember that he had sort of wavy sandy-colored hair. </sentence><sentence id="448">And I...can't help wondering, in retrospect, maybe he didn't even know I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="449">I mean, or maybe he did. </sentence><sentence id="450">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="451">I always sort of in the past assumed that he knew. </sentence><sentence id="452">But now I think, "Well, you know, maybe he didn't know." </sentence><sentence id="453">Who knows? </sentence><sentence id="454">But he threw me candies uh on a number of occasions. </sentence><sentence id="455">And my mother was sure they were poisoned, and...but I ate them anyway. </sentence><sentence id="456">And here lam. </sentence><sentence id="457">And then, on one of the last days we were there, he brought me a little doll. </sentence><sentence id="458">And I think that interaction through; I think that interaction very, very strongly colored my life attitudes. </sentence><sentence id="459">Uh, because I think...I think even then, you know, I somehow must have known that these were the bad guys. </sentence><sentence id="460">But this guy, who I have a feeling might have been you know eighteen or nineteen, uh was just nice, you know; and he was nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="461">Uh, and...and maybe I jump to conclusions on very naive grounds; but several years later, when I came to the United States, and kids would and...and their parents ask me, you know, really ridiculous things to say to a child--like, uh, "How do you like America?" </sentence><sentence id="462">And, "Do you hate the Germans?" </sentence><sentence id="463">And I remember always saying, "No, I don't hate the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="464">There are good Germans, and there are bad Germans." </sentence><sentence id="465">And I ...1 mean maybe this is simplistic, but I've always thought that it really had to do with this one soldier that somehow made me get a...a very sensible attitude, even though I was so young, about the differences between people. </sentence><sentence id="466">And I've always sort of very fondly remembered that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="549">A: I think...I think in retrospect--and I wish I had realized this more when she was still around-- my mother must have really, basically, been an incredibly strong person to have gone through that. </sentence><sentence id="550">Because when I try to think back on it, I often think L..you know, I don't think I could have done the things that she did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="557">A: I...1 know what you're asking, and I...I really had to give that preamble; because my...my sense of my mother during those years, and...and many years later, is that that she somehow never got it all together except for the practical things. </sentence><sentence id="558">That she somehow was so...I'm not sure what the right word is, but maybe almost frantic. </sentence><sentence id="559">I mean, she was... And who knows? </sentence><sentence id="560">I mean, maybe I would have been the same way. </sentence><sentence id="561">But I mean, she really...she was in mourning for my father for the rest of her life. </sentence><sentence id="562">And she only died in 1982 at age, you know, 84. </sentence><sentence id="563">I guess she was a woman who already had learned something like five languages, but she could not learn French. </sentence><sentence id="564">You know, it was not just there at that time. </sentence><sentence id="565">Uh, and I think uh... I wish I could remember the German word that that she used to use a lot. </sentence><sentence id="566">That she was just uh...she just didn't...she sort of didn't know what to do, you know, with herself or what was   USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 15 going on, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="567">Uh, and I think the... What she had always told me was that after the Germans came into Loudun, that my brother--who was uh about thirteen at that time, I guess, uh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that he was not staying in Loudun, and that whether she left or not he was leaving. </sentence><sentence id="568">Now, I'm not sure whether my brother really said that in those terms. </sentence><sentence id="569">What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some refugees in the hotel, and that it was decided that they should get the Hell out of there. </sentence><sentence id="570">Uh, and there were...there was only one family, or possibly a family and one other person, who decided not to go. </sentence><sentence id="571">And that family uh is the family of the two sisters that I showed you the picture of before. </sentence><sentence id="572">And it was a mistake, because they didn't get here until 1947. </sentence><sentence id="573">But anyway, so I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="574">What I do remember is that one night we left everything that we owned--which was not much, but we did have, you know, suitcases and valises and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="575">We left everything, and we left in the dark of night. </sentence><sentence id="576">And I think I have a...my recollection is that it was like midnight, uh with nothing except my brother's violin. </sentence><sentence id="577">And this group of us went; and somehow, in a way that was not quite kosher, got on a train that went to the south of France. </sentence><sentence id="578">Uh, and then uh so I remem.... I remember walking to the train station in Loudun, but I don't remember anything of this trip. </sentence><sentence id="579">But what my brother tells me is that uh when we got to the border--which I guess was Poitiers--and we had to go through this uh...you know, whatever you do at borders, uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940, the lower echelon people in these offices were still French people rather than Germans. </sentence><sentence id="580">And apparently one woman in this group of twenty went up to this woman in this office, and said, "Look, you know, I've really got to get across the border, because I'm here and my husband is already on the other side." </sentence><sentence id="581">And so this woman said, "Yeah, alright." </sentence><sentence id="582">You know, and    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 16 stamped her whatever you needed to get stamped. </sentence><sentence id="583">And then she turned and said, "You know, that's also the situation for all these other people. </sentence><sentence id="584">They also have somebody else waiting on the other side." </sentence><sentence id="585">And apparently this woman, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said, "Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="586">OK." </sentence><sentence id="587">And so we all got across. </sentence><sentence id="588">And we went to somehow uh to Limoges, and now that's where my memory picks up again. </sentence><sentence id="589">Uh, the first...I think the first night we slept in the railroad station; and I...1 remember, I think I slept on a...on a scale. </sentence><sentence id="590">You know, the kind of thing you weigh the baggage on. </sentence><sentence id="591">Uh, and then the next night--and I thought it was just one night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an abandoned uh circus arena that was...I guess it was stone. </sentence><sentence id="592">And uh...and I remember waking up the first morning we were there and being all black and blue and sore uh from just sleeping on this...on this stone. </sentence><sentence id="593">Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for six weeks and that people graduated. </sentence><sentence id="594">You know, gradually people found places to live, and so you kind of got to move to the better seats. </sentence><sentence id="595">And then, apparently, the...the most desirable place was around the periphery of the arena. </sentence><sentence id="596">There were these uh...what I call orange crate make-shift beds that had straw mattresses in them. </sentence><sentence id="597">And so that was... for the last few days we were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on those. </sentence><sentence id="598">And then, uh somehow there was a...this Jewish committee that found...you know, was helping the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="599">And they found uh a uh place that I think had been a pool hall, and there was a small room that must have been...I mean, it was really not a very big room. </sentence><sentence id="600">It might have been maybe twenty feet by twenty feet, or twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet. </sentence><sentence id="601">Certainly not...not any bigger than that. </sentence><sentence id="602">Uh, and there were about thirty women who slept in that room. </sentence><sentence id="603">And then, right above that, there was another room where all the...the men slept. </sentence><sentence id="604">And I don't remember there being any other    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 17 female children except for me. </sentence><sentence id="605">And I could be wrong about that, but I have no recollection of anything but adults. </sentence><sentence id="606">And my brother slept upstairs with the men; and I have a feeling he might have been the only, you know, minor in that group as well. </sentence><sentence id="607">But then, I mean, this is where I really start to remember. </sentence><sentence id="608">I mean, I remember this place well. </sentence><sentence id="609">And actually, I went back there in 1963 to visit it. </sentence><sentence id="610">And uh so we slept in this room; and at night we had these straw mattresses, and we'd line them up. </sentence><sentence id="611">It was body to body on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="612">Uh, and then in the morning, they would get piled up against the side of the room. </sentence><sentence id="613">And there were all these sort of orange crates, you know, really wooden kind of crates that got pulled out. </sentence><sentence id="614">And we sat on those and...and ate off them and...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="615">And uh so we were in this room for...I don't know, quite a long time. </sentence><sentence id="616">And I began going to school. </sentence><sentence id="617">My first year of schooling was in Limoges; and I remember walking to the school, and I remember the classroom. </sentence><sentence id="618">And I still have my three notebooks from that year. </sentence><sentence id="619">And I remember the teacher, uh who I remember as a quite not very pleasant woman. </sentence><sentence id="620">And uh she seemed very old to me them. </sentence><sentence id="621">I mean, she had sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a very harshly drawn back with a bun; and she sat up on a dias. </sentence><sentence id="622">And uh, I mean, I remember quite a few things from this; but two things that stand out in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="623">Uh one is that every morning she would come down every aisle of seats with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="624">And uh I don't think it ever occurred to her that, by doing that, that she was actually spreading this. </sentence><sentence id="625">And so sure enough, one day I came home and one of the women spotted that I had lice. </sentence><sentence id="626">And I mean, my recollection is that there must have been five women every day who kind of attacked me and washed my hair with kerosene, and then combed it mercilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine-toothed combs until they cleaned my head    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 18 out. </sentence><sentence id="627">So that was kind of horrible. </sentence><sentence id="628">The other thing that I remember is I was ...1 was very anxious to be very good in school, and I did very well at almost everything except penmanship. </sentence><sentence id="629">I mean, penmanship was so stressed in that thing, in that system or whatever; and I remember this teacher constantly after me, because on French 1's and s's you're supposed to have this little bump, you know at the top. </sentence><sentence id="630">And I could never quite get that right. </sentence><sentence id="631">I mean, she did...she accepted all the others. </sentence><sentence id="632">I've never had a good penmanship, but she accepted everything else. </sentence><sentence id="633">But she was constantly after me about that little, you know, squiggle that I couldn't get right. </sentence><sentence id="634">So I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="635">The other thing that I remember is that everything was, in terms of food, was incredibly difficult to get. </sentence><sentence id="636">And so uh I...my brother was too old to get milk, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh something that sort of looked like a straightened version of a coke bottle. </sentence><sentence id="637">And my mother insisted that we share that. </sentence><sentence id="638">And so, every morning we would go down and collect this... this milk. </sentence><sentence id="639">Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that I really have added to that a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I got sent into bakeries to beg for bread. </sentence><sentence id="640">And the line was, "I've got uh...I have...1 have money, and I have ration coupons. </sentence><sentence id="641">But uh..." Or maybe we didn't have ration coupons, whatever it was, you know. "... </sentence><sentence id="642">we really need bread." </sentence><sentence id="643">And so that was my role. </sentence><sentence id="644">And I would...that bread was not only for us, but it would be shared with some of the other people. </sentence><sentence id="645">And when I was interviewing my brother last year--because I wrote an article about this-- I...1 said to my brother, "Did it ever occur to anybody how incredibly demeaning it must have been to a little girl to have to go in and beg for bread?" </sentence><sentence id="646">And my brother, who is a very practical person, looked me straight in the eye and said, "It wasn't demeaning. </sentence><sentence id="647">It was bread." </sentence><sentence id="648">   USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 19 And uh...but somehow I can't feel that way about it. </sentence><sentence id="649">And uh...and I guess...1 mean, I guess we shared duties in that he had to...all the...you know, he filled out all the forms, and when things had to be packed or when you had to go to an office to ask about visas, I mean, he got to do all that. </sentence><sentence id="650">And, of course, I was too young to do that. </sentence><sentence id="651">But uh but I got this horrible chore to do, because I was younger and cuter I guess. </sentence><sentence id="652">Uh, so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="653">Uh, and then I remember very clearly, two times uh...I think you were allowed a pound of potatoes per month per person and one egg per month per person, according to these ration coupons. </sentence><sentence id="654">And so, one time my mother heard that there were eggs out in this farm, which was...I mean, I remember just walking what seemed like miles and miles and miles. </sentence><sentence id="655">And we came home with these eggs, and my mother opened them and they were all rotten. </sentence><sentence id="656">And then another time, we heard that there were potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="657">And again, I mean, you know, it seemed as though we walked for just ages and we came home with these three pounds of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="658">And I guess we were just... this is like such a feast that uh my mother just cooked the three pounds of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="659">And I think we just ate them all up. </sentence><sentence id="660">Uh, and then there was a...probably the most wonderful birthday of my life happened in this period. </sentence><sentence id="661">I don't know how my mother pulled this off} but on my birthday, uh she came with a little brown paper bag. </sentence><sentence id="662">And in this paper bag was--I don't remember, I think it might have been like a peach, or...and one other big fruit and some dried fruits. </sentence><sentence id="663">And it was probably the nicest present I've ever gotten. </sentence><sentence id="664">So, uh so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="665">And...and the two other dramatic things that I remember from that era is one that my brother somehow had a Bar Mitzvah in the midst of this. </sentence><sentence id="666">And I don't remember much about the Bar Mitzvah, except that he was given a...a silk...a beautiful blue silk string bag--which we had for years--and it was filled with uh, I don't know, just a lot of different    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 20 goodies that were kind of nice. </sentence><sentence id="667">Uh so that was one thing I remember. </sentence><sentence id="668">And the other thing-- and we still have one of these, and it's in my son's car, as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="669">And I just said to my son the other day, "Don't you ever lose this!" </sentence><sentence id="670">Uh, somewhere, after...1 don't know whether it was weeks or months, uh two things happened. </sentence><sentence id="671">First of all--and I can't remember which happened first--but one day these two guys walked down. </sentence><sentence id="672">It was sort of a mild hill, the street we were on; and these two guys came down the hill, and each of them was holding one end of a bolt of grey blanket cloth. </sentence><sentence id="673">And it...I mean, I still have it. </sentence><sentence id="674">So I can tell you with with great accuracy that this is the...the worst quality fabric I have ever felt in my life. </sentence><sentence id="675">I...I don't think it had an iota of warmth in it. </sentence><sentence id="676">But uh it was such a...1 remember that nice feeling of these guys coming with this blanket cloth, and they just had like a knife or something. </sentence><sentence id="677">And they just stood there and kind of, you know, pulled off...I don't know, maybe a yard and a half. </sentence><sentence id="678">Uh, and everybody kind of got a square of this, and...and we got two squares. </sentence><sentence id="679">Uh and that was, you know, that was like manna from heaven. </sentence><sentence id="680">Uh, and as I say, that grey blanket is in...in ... One of them got lost somewhere; but the other one is in my son's car. </sentence><sentence id="681">Uh, and then I guess somewhere along those uh months, the little house right next door to where we were staying became free. </sentence><sentence id="682">And I don't know why we had the good fortune, but the little place next door was a one...I think it was just a one story place, and it had two rooms. </sentence><sentence id="683">And there was a smaller inner room, and then this larger outer room. </sentence><sentence id="684">And my brother and mother and I were given that little inner room. </sentence><sentence id="685">And the outer room was kind of divided in half. </sentence><sentence id="686">And the back part of it was given to these two sisters who were married to two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="687">And one of the brothers was named [Lutz (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="688">I don't remember his last name. </sentence><sentence id="689">And he was almost blind. </sentence><sentence id="690">He had very bad vision, and he spent a lot of his time cutting out those kind of leather belt    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 21 loops that, you know, you hook one into the other and make belts. </sentence><sentence id="691">And I...1 remember we used to help him do that sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="692">And he did that in the outer part of this room, which was like his workspace. </sentence><sentence id="693">Uh, so those are, those are some of my... Oh, there was one other nice thing that I remember from Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="694">There was a...a carpenter that we somehow got to know. </sentence><sentence id="695">Uh, and I think he was kind of a very mellow-looking guy, with maybe reddish kind of hair and beard. </sentence><sentence id="696">And you know, he seemed old to me then; but in retrospect he probably was thirty-five or something. </sentence><sentence id="697">Uh but he made a wonderful little set of toy furniture for me out of wood, and then he...he glued little pieces of wallpaper on the chairs, you know, to make it look as though they were upholstered. </sentence><sentence id="698">And uh I certainly had those for years and years after that, and always treasured them greatly. </sentence><sentence id="699">Uh, so I guess those are uh... Oh. </sentence><sentence id="700">One thing that I didn't mention, uh and this was from Loudun. </sentence><sentence id="701">We went from Loudun to Paris, to try to get visas; and that must have been like late in August of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="702">Uh, and I remember there was an air raid. </sentence><sentence id="703">My mother and my brother and I were in a hotel. </sentence><sentence id="704">There was an air raid, and for some reason we didn't hear it and we didn't wake up. </sentence><sentence id="705">Somebody came and banged on our door and woke us up, and we all rushed to this air raid [shelter] in the middle of this huge boulevard. </sentence><sentence id="706">And what I remember is that the smell of dog doo in that air raid shelter was just overwhelming; and I remember that sort of scary feeling of being down there and the sirens and the commotion. </sentence><sentence id="707">And then...and then we were told to go back to Loudun, and that we would get visas in, you know, whatever it was--six weeks or something. </sentence><sentence id="708">But then, of course, the war officially started. </sentence><sentence id="709">The Germans came in, and uh...and...and we never got back there. </sentence><sentence id="710">But...but that I do remember--being in Paris in the air raid shelter. </sentence><sentence id="711">So then uh... Well, I remember a lot about school. </sentence><sentence id="712">I mean, I remember doing design in school. </sentence><sentence id="713">I    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 22 guess that was one of my favorite subjects. </sentence><sentence id="714">It was uh...it was...it was a very controlled kind of art class. </sentence><sentence id="715">Design, it was...it was not the kind of thing that kids do now. </sentence><sentence id="716">And you know, you colored in and out the little squares and things. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1002">A: I don't remember anything until we got on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And then I only remember something which is not very pleasant; and that is, that I guess on the ship uh there was, you know, suddenly food. </sentence><sentence id="1004">I mean, real meals, and...you know, and a dining room which looked nice, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1005">But all three of us were seasick, essentially, the whole way across the Atlantic. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And so uh I don't think we were able to, after finally getting to some nice food, uh to really avail ourselves of it. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Uh, and I guess that's about all I remember about that trip, uh until we arrived in the U.S. And one of my earliest recollections, there was something that was very uh...it caused a lot of apprehension in me; because uh I had never seen an oral thermometer, because in Europe we use these underarm, you know, mammoth-sized thermometers. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And these people, I think, in white uniforms came around; and I remember sitting in this big room in these chairs, and somebody came around and stuck an oral thermometer in everybody's mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Uh, so I think I was apprehensive, not only because I was little and I...you know, this seemed like really weird. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Uh, but as an adult, as I look back, I have a feeling that I also was very aware that this was still another check point and that you could still be turned away. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And I don't know whether somebody had told me that, you know, if you weren't healthy you couldn't come in. </sentence><sentence id="1012">I mean, maybe my mother had been talking about that or something. </sentence><sentence id="1013">But I remember that arrival time as being a time of...of apprehension. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And then I remember being   USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 26 picked up by the relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Uh, and what I...what I remember most dramatically... Well, first of all, there was this...I think it was a big fancy black car. </sentence><sentence id="1016">I mean, not fancy by American terms; but to a small kid who, you know, just had not seen anything like this for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Uh, and I was sitting in the back seat with my mother and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1018">And my mother was next to me, and she was at the window seat; and my aunt lived in uh...in the lower part of Manhattan, which was not a very nice place--uh, Avenue D. And uh as we drove into that neighborhood, my mother...[ mean, I could hear her. </sentence><sentence id="1019">I could hear her very audibly. </sentence><sentence id="1020">My mother whispered in German, under her breath, something like, "Have I suffered so long, and come all this way, for this?" </sentence><sentence id="1021">And I think that that was...I mean, that struck me as being...I mean, in retrospect... As I think back on it, I don't know what I thought at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1022">But in retrospect, it seems like such an ungrateful statement to make at that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Because, you know, I mean, suddenly we were free. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And uh...but I think she was so appalled. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And I don't...you know, I'm not sure why she was so appalled, because it surely must have been better than, you know, what had been in France, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1026">But uh...but anyway, that's ...I remember her saying that. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And uh so then uh we went and lived in my Aunt Lena, who was Lena Klinghoffer. </sentence><sentence id="1028">Uh she had what was really quite a small apartment, and she had five children. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And they were grown; but three of them were still living in this apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Uh, and Leon and [Albe (ph)], the two boys, were living at home; and the youngest daughter, Dorothy. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Uh, and somehow she made the kids double up. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And...and so my brother and my mother and I got one tiny bedroom, and we actually lived there with her for about three months. </sentence><sentence id="1033">And uh I guess my mother went out apartment hunting and job hunting, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Uh, and I mean, I remember a lot of anecdotal things happened in my Aunt Lena's house. </sentence><sentence id="1035">  USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 27 Like uh uh...I mean, everybody sort of assumed that, because we had been starving for the last two years, that we would eat anything that was put in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Well, that was not true at all. </sentence><sentence id="1037">My brother and I were the world's fussiest, pickiest eaters. </sentence><sentence id="1038">And you know, and this food that was put in front of us was...I mean, it was very alien kind of...of food. </sentence><sentence id="1039">Uh, and so we...we...and probably our stomachs were so shrunken anyway that we didn't need very much. </sentence><sentence id="1040">And so we...we were very...you know, we didn't eat a lot of things that were put in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And I think my aunt thought that was very peculiar. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And uh uh...and then I...I remember, uh you know, my mother had always been very proud of the fact that she never learned to cook, and that she...you know, that other people had done things for her. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And uh, of course, she very quickly, when we got out apartment, learned how to cook a certain number of things. </sentence><sentence id="1044">But uh she would always say, "I don't even know how to boil water." </sentence><sentence id="1045">And then one time my Aunt Lena got sick, and the kids were out. </sentence><sentence id="1046">And...and I think my mother really...I don't know, she was supposed to make some porridge or something. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And she really...she sort of couldn't do it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1048">Hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And I don't know; I sometimes get the feeling that it was like almost, you know, could she really not do this? </sentence><sentence id="1050">I mean, how do you get to grow up and not know how to do this? </sentence><sentence id="1051">Or was it all a put-up job?Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Uh, turned out that my mother was a very talented lady. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And uh...and uh very quickly learned how to do all the things that...that were needed. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And I think the really sad thing is that uh there was nobody around to really guide her about what she should do. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And you know, and...and my Aunt Lena was not a wealthy woman. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And uh so I think it was...it was necessary to uh... to sort of quickly get something going. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And so my mother did uh the easiest thing, and the first thing that came her way. </sentence><sentence id="1058">And she spent the whole rest of    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 28 her life working as a sewing machine operator in a factory. </sentence><sentence id="1059">Which was kind of very heavy work, uh but I think... And she's a very hard worker, but... And I think it was not so much the hard work that bothered her; but I think she was...she was very, very bothered by the kinds of people that she met in the factory, and she felt totally alien from those people. </sentence><sentence id="1060">You know, they uh... I mean, she was...she made acquaintances very easily, but she didn't make friends very easily. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Uh, and I think the people that she tended to make real friendships with, insofar as she did, were always, you know, other people her age from Vienna, or other places like that, who sort of...you know, where they could talk about what had been, or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Uh, and she just found the conditions in the factory appalling. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh, I mean she was so ...first of all, she was so European and so formal. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And I mean, it...it drove her crazy that people called her by her first name. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I mean, nobody every would have done that. </sentence><sentence id="1066">You know, she was "Frau Dr. Reif," and not, you know... And all of a sudden, she's "Klara." </sentence><sentence id="1067">Uh, she would come home, and sometimes... I think one time she even cried, because she walked into an office and some guy was sitting at the desk with his feet up; and he didn't take his feet off the desk when she walked in. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Well, you know, you didn't treat ladies that way. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And uh uh...and then, I mean, the whole new thing to her was the kind of language that people used in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="1070">I mean, she had never heard anything like this before. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And so she...you know, and...and gradually she learned to cope with it, and she kind of... You know, she would kid around with people at work; but I don't think she ever, you know, really felt happy in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="1072">And as I say, it wasn't just the hard work, but it was really more that she just felt this was not her milieu. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Uh so she was a very...I mean, she was a very...basically a lonesome, unhappy woman in many ways in her life. </sentence><sentence id="1074">But, on the other hand, on the    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 29 surface she was not. </sentence><sentence id="1075">I mean, she...you know, she always kept herself busy and very involved in this and that and the other thing. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And she learned English, I think, relatively quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Uh, and uh she...you know, kept herself active and always knew where all the free concerts and free plays were, and took advantage of all those cultural things, and ran around to the museums. </sentence><sentence id="1078">And uh uh...and so she did all those things. </sentence><sentence id="1079">And L...actually, I should say that really was much later; because in the early days, life uh... in the early years, life was very very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1080">So after three months, when we left my Aunt Lena's house and got an apartment in Brooklyn, uh I think at her first job she was earning $15 a week. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And I think the rent was $45 a month in this apartment, or maybe $35 a month. </sentence><sentence id="1082">So for...for a long time she hardly ate. </sentence><sentence id="1083">I mean, you know, all her money went to paying the rent and feeding us. </sentence><sentence id="1084">And uh... mean, she was the usual, you know, Jewish mother. </sentence><sentence id="1085">I mean, we came first always, everything, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Uh, and she gradually...you know, she...I...she never... I mean, she would have been a fantastic bookkeeper, and she would have been so much happier, you know, if somebody had led her into that when she...once she mastered the language. </sentence><sentence id="1087">But they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1088">So she spent the rest of the time in the factories. </sentence><sentence id="1089">And uh she...uh she really...she did not... I don't know what to call it. </sentence><sentence id="1090">I mean, for example, my brother and I never worked. </sentence><sentence id="1091">You know, and in retrospect that's really weird. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Nobody ever asked us to contribute to the family income. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Uh, our job was to study; and everything, you know, kind of rotated around that. </sentence><sentence id="1094">Uh, so that...and in some sense, I mean, you could say that I was a spoiled brat once I came here. </sentence><sentence id="1095">Because when I wanted to do my homework, I told my mother she couldn't wash the dishes until after I finished. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Because the noise of the water running bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="1097">So here's this lady who's been working in the factory and then, you    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 30 know, travelling and...and coming home. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And I mean, I did help around the house a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Uh, but I mean, she basically made dinner and she washed the dishes. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I think I sometimes dried them. </sentence><sentence id="1101">And uh so she did all this work, and then she...she did this incredible bookkeeping thing every night. </sentence><sentence id="1102">She would not go to sleep until the amount of money in her change purse matched with this little...she had a little book she carried with her. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And every...even if it was only two cents, it got written down; uh and it had to match to the penny. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And she would go over it, and over it and over it again. </sentence><sentence id="1105">You know, "Where did I spend that extra ...?" </sentence><sentence id="1106">Whatever, even if it was only three cents, until that matched everyday. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And it got to be funny, because in...in later years once I remember having a little argument with her about how much a certain dress that I had cost. </sentence><sentence id="1108">And she just went right back and pulled out her book.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1226">A: Well, uh I think I was kind of a...in some sense, a dual personality kid. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I mean, I was...I liked to play, and I was kind of, you know, fun-loving and...on one side. </sentence><sentence id="1228">Uh, but there was this other side of me that was serious and thoughtful, and I guess introspective and a lot of other things. </sentence><sentence id="1229">And...and lonesome. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Uh, not the kind of lonesome that... I wrote a poem about this, actually. </sentence><sentence id="1231">More thinking about my mother; but not the kind of lonesome that goes away when other people are around, but just a kind of inherent feeling of...1 don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1232">Uh, I mean, only now in recent years I very often think that the only way I can explain it is, you know, maybe it's what happens to a kid... I mean, what happens when a four year-old kid is   USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 31 told that she's never going to see her father again. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Especially, you know, having been told that...that he was incredibly affectionate to me. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I mean, what does that do? </sentence><sentence id="1235">What does that mean? </sentence><sentence id="1236">Uh, so I mean...I mean, I still am basically...I...you know, I love to dance and I like to sing. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I'm a very uh...and I love to tell jokes. </sentence><sentence id="1238">And my brother and I love to tell jokes. </sentence><sentence id="1239">Uh uh...but there's a very incredibly serious part of my brother, which is much more evident I think in him than in me. </sentence><sentence id="1240">But there's a very morbid part of me also. </sentence><sentence id="1241">I mean, it's a...I don't, you know, it's...it's like a little sideline, but it never goes away. </sentence><sentence id="1242">So uh...and then I think, I mean, my mother certainly tried very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1243">But I think she did and said some things that were not really very good for kids growing up. </sentence><sentence id="1244">She always told us that we were different. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I don't think that was very good for us. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Uh, we were supposed to be "aristocratic"--you know, in quotes. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I mean, that was a myth. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I don't...we were not aristocratic in Europe, either. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I mean, we were just reasonable, middle-classed people. </sentence><sentence id="1250">Uh, but uh so I always felt different. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I felt different, anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1252">I mean, you know, I come, here I am at age seven learning my third language, and sort of--if you consider the whole Judaic thing--my fourth culture uh by age seven. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And I remember coming to school in the U.S.; and you know, all the little girls and boys around me are, you know, obviously talking about me. </sentence><sentence id="1254">And I can't understand what they're saying. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Well, I learned English really fast, let me tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Uh, but I always felt different. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Well, you know, the more different you feel, somehow you stay different and you become different. </sentence><sentence id="1258">And uh uh...and to this day, I still... mean, no matter...1 mean, I always feel different. </sentence><sentence id="1259">And I think I never thought of it, but there was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist that they interviewed in the [Boston] Globe; and he said, "I always felt a little different, and it always hurt a little." </sentence><sentence id="1260">And when I read that, I thought, "That's...that's    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 32 really...that describes me." </sentence><sentence id="1261">Because I think subconsciously, somehow I've always wanted to belong to certain, you know...I don't know-- whatever, you know, groups of things. </sentence><sentence id="1262">Not ever to belong to...uh, I mean, I rarely sign things and I don't want to belong. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I don't uh... don't like being associated with divisive things. </sentence><sentence id="1264">I mean, I have very mixed feelings about, you know, even about belonging to the...the quality of being Jewish, or whatever you want to call it. </sentence><sentence id="1265">Uh, because I think that's very divisive. </sentence><sentence id="1266">I mean, I...you know, all the divisive things that have happened in history have happened because people are...you know, belong to...to some of these things. </sentence><sentence id="1267">So that's not the kind of belonging that I want. </sentence><sentence id="1268">But the...belonging to...to, for example, uh... Oh, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Within an academic environment, uh people who have similar interests or people who like to do some activity or something. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And I always...I mean, I'm 55 years old but I still always feel that there is something different about me compared to all these other people. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And it always...in some strange way, there's a difference. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Uh, and then, of course, when I was little, the difference became greatly exacerbated because there was such an an emphasis put on learning and studying and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And that was not the favorite activity of most of the other kids at 1092 President Street. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And so the other kids would come home and uh go out and, you know, play--this, that and the other thing. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And I would very often...I mean, I did play outside in the street, too. </sentence><sentence id="1276">But I did a Hell of a lot of homework. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And in retrospect, I think I did a lot more homework than was ever assigned. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Uh, so...and I, you know, I just...I mean, those kids were different. </sentence><sentence id="1279">They were not interested. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And I, at some very early age, decided I was going to be a scientist and I was going to do this and that and the other thing. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And they, I mean, they didn't have any aspirations. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And uh I suppose part of that was enhanced, in that, you know, I mean my mother just kind of    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 33 expected that we would do things and she knew that they were not going to do things. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And uh...and I think she did not let that pass quietly by. </sentence><sentence id="1284">Uh, so anyway, I uh...you know, I was...I played and I uh...but I didn't do any...I was not allowed to do anything dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And that included uh... My mother used to have a fit. </sentence><sentence id="1286">I mean, in those days people thought that if you walked up and down the stairs--and we lived on a fourth-floor walk-up--that you'd get a heart attack. </sentence><sentence id="1287">So you know, so it was a major issue about my walking, you know, every time I had to walk up and down the stairs. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Uh, I was not allowed to uh ride a bicycle, uh when the other kids were learning to ride bicycles; and I think...I think partly that was a financial matter. </sentence><sentence id="1289">You know, I mean, it took a quarter an hour to rent a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1290">Uh, but I think mostly it was a safety matter. </sentence><sentence id="1291">But one of the things that happened very early on is that uh... mean, I had this brother who was almost eight years older, who was a very...we were very close; and I had my mother, who was a very worrisome Jewish mother. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And I think very early on, there were many times when my mother would say "Black," and my brother would say, "White." </sentence><sentence id="1293">And at a very early age, I think I discerned that my brother's responses came from the head and my mother's responses came straight from the gut. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And that, obviously, from the head was better. </sentence><sentence id="1295">And uh so whenever there was...you know, whenever I had to make a decision between the two opinions, I almost invariably did what my brother said. </sentence><sentence id="1296">Uh, and he was very protective of me; and we had a very sort of uh weird family situation, probably, in retrospect. </sentence><sentence id="1297">But it was a very uh uh loving, and very uh you know sort of...we were always, you know, sort of kissing and that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And, by and large, people did not yell, and...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1299">But if my brother heard my mother say something to me in the kitchen, because L...he had his own room but I studied in the kitchen, uh he would be right there. </sentence><sentence id="1300">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 34 "What are you saying to this child?" </sentence><sentence id="1301">And uh I remember funny things, like uh if I had a cold uh my mother would say, "Well, maybe you should stay home from school and stay in bed." </sentence><sentence id="1302">And my brother said, "You take two handkerchiefs, and hang one out to dry while you're using the other one. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And go to school." </sentence><sentence id="1304">Well, I mean, I went to school with the two handkerchiefs; and uh uh...so and I guess...I guess, I probably spent or tried to spend and probably did spend a certain amount of time with my brother's friends, who were much older than me. </sentence><sentence id="1305">I mean, they were adults and I was still a kid. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And I think they were trying to get rid of me a certain amount of the time. </sentence><sentence id="1307">I mean, they did...my brother took me to my first museum. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And one of his friends took me to my first ballet, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Uh, and I remember once my mother getting involved, because my brother didn't want to take me someplace he was going with a friend. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And my mother - I remember this is so ridiculous - my mother said, "You can't go, because Fred is big enough to walk between the rain drops but you aren't."

First of all, is there anything that you want to add that you haven't already covered? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1407">A: Well, uh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I think maybe I'd like to mention that I talk about this very easily now, but that all the times when my mother was still alive and that she wanted to talk about some of these things, I really didn't want to hear about it. </sentence><sentence id="1409">I didn't want to listen. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Uh, first of all, because she would get very emotional, and I... And I mean, in retrospect, I couldn't tolerate   USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 35 that. </sentence><sentence id="1411">Uh, and I know sometimes now when I get emotional about something, I can see my kids responding in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="1412">I mean, that [they] don't really need this. </sentence><sentence id="1413">Uh, and so I really went through very many years, essentially, not thinking very much about this and making believe it never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And when the other kids or other people would ask me, "Well, what effect do you think your background had on you?" </sentence><sentence id="1415">I would say, "Well, I was too young and I don't remember anything, and I don't think it had any effect on me." </sentence><sentence id="1416">And I think uh--and I've been trying to write about some of these issues--I think that there's a certain age, and I see this in other people, when you have a period of great strength and you're sort of building your life and it's very easy to sort of not look back and push everything aside. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And then I think there comes another period, when for me and for I think for other people also, somehow the back...background comes back to haunt you. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And it wasn't really until after our kids were born, and...and uh you know maybe when I was about 35, that I started noticing that I...that certain things I did were not really logically explainable by...by things that were happening then. </sentence><sentence id="1419">And that the only logical explanation of why I was doing certain things in that way, or doing them at all, had to do probably with some of the things that had happened very early in life in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1420">And you know, my father disappearing and uh...and things that happened in... in France and uh...and in that school in Limoges, and uh... and that whole business of sort always being on the run for those years, and being scared, and uh... And I think there is a lot of interesting material uh to explore there. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Uh, and uh...and to explore with other people who have had similar experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Uh, I think the unfortunate thing--and being a scientist, | mean, I would always like to have a controlled experiment, and of course there is no controlled experiment--but trying to pick    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 36 apart. </sentence><sentence id="1423">Uh, and of course it's only conjectural, and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but somehow trying to define for myself, you know, what things that have stayed with me are really due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in France, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And what things are just because...you know, I mean everybody's parents by and large are crazy anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1425">Right? </sentence><sentence id="1426">And...and so you, your parents uh somehow inflict on you uh some of that craziness that they have. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Uh, and it's hard to tell, because of course I don't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And it's only in recent years, and actually since she's died, that I've really thought enough about this to to realize that, you know, she might have been and probably was a very sort of, you know, happy carefree person in many ways uh but I never knew her. </sentence><sentence id="1429">I mean, my mother wore black for years and years and years; and then she finally switched to navy. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And it was, you know, it was only very very late, when I was already essentially an adult that she would ever wear anything that was red, or uh uh...and she always, you know, all the years she lived she kept up on [my] father's grave. </sentence><sentence id="1431">She always you know, lit a uh yahrzeit candle. </sentence><sentence id="1432">Uh uh she she always uh...you know, I mean, she always I think in...in many ways--in her thoughts, at least--she always lived in her past. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Not...not in her actions, but you know... "If I only had my sister to talk to," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1434">And then one other thing that I should have mentioned, uh because I...1 do remember this and it was very dramatic was right after the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="1435">There was a blue letter that arrived from...I think it was from a cousin of my mother's who ended up in Israel--and I don't know if he's still alive or not--uh sort of delineating what had happened to many of our relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1436">And I mean, that, you know, I remember it as being horrendous; but now, when I think back, that must have been just such an incredible    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 37 nightmare to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Because the news in that letter, as you can imagine, was...I mean, essentially everybody was killed, and...and some of them in rather grotesque ways. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Uh and I...1 guess I wish I could have been a little bit more understanding of me in relation to my background, and I think that would have lead to...to my having a better understanding and appreciation of my mother uh during those years. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Uh, my mother and I, by the way, got along very well uh until the other girls started dating. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And then she got... END OF TAPE ...like our live-in baby sitters. </sentence><sentence id="1441">And I had my very strong, very very democratic ideas about uh...you know, the way those people should be done, should be treated. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And I...and I think in some sense there was kind of...I guess, she verbalized it often. </sentence><sentence id="1443">She felt that we treated our live-in baby sitters better than we treated her. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And that was probably true, because they didn't sort of interfere in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And she somehow tried to continue to be a mother when she should have become a friend. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And I think...I mean, in retrospect now that was because she was very lonesome. </sentence><sentence id="1447">So there's a lot more, I suppose, to be said; but maybe I'll write it sometime. </sentence></p></dialogue>

But anyway, they...they were - I don't know, they just didn't uh...they were not so interesting to me when I was a little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1512">And I did occasionally go to the store and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1513">But the thing that I remember just incredibly about Leon uh is that, somewhere along the years there, uh my mother said I could have some piano lessons with this absolutely horrible teacher. </sentence><sentence id="1514">I mean, it was a dollar an hour. </sentence><sentence id="1515">And I don't know whether that was a lot in those days - | think it was not even a lot in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1516">But she was...she was not a very good teacher. </sentence><sentence id="1517">Uh but anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1518">And I only took lessons for maybe a year or something, but somehow in the course of that year--or maybe it was a little longer--there were two recitals where I played, you know, a diddley something-- "In My Country Garden," or something-- for you know thirty seconds. </sentence><sentence id="1519">At one of these recitals uh... and you have to understand that in those days I could never have anything that any of the other kids had, and I rationalized it very well. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I always said I didn't want any of the other things. </sentence><sentence id="1521">But uh at Easter time, you know, the other kids would get new suits, and I...J usually didn't, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1522">  USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 39 Leon Klinghoffer appeared at my little diddley piano recital with this unbelievable bouquet of pink peonies, you know; which are these really hugh full flowers. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And I...I just will never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="1524">I mean, that was...that made quite an impression. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And just a few months ago, I was thumbing through one of my mother's old photo albums and on one of the last pages this, there was this bunch of flower petals, and in one corner one of these flower petals - you know, they were all brown, there was still a little bit of pink and I suddenly realized that those were probably the left-over of the pink peonies uh so that was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Then I remember Leon Klinghoffer went into the army and I remember hearing that he uh I don't know whether - but anyway something happened and I guess he was in Europe and he became hard of hearing in one ear uh and then he came back and he met this very attractive doll-like woman who he married, Marilyn Klinghoffer. </sentence><sentence id="1527">Uh and I remember sort of thinking, because he was not really very attractive physically, and uh I think he already then maybe had a receding hairline and uh so he must have looked very old to me, and here, you know, he married this incredibly uh pretty uh woman uh and they went on to have kids. </sentence><sentence id="1528">And my mother kind of kept contact and went to the wedding and I don't remember where I was at the time, but I I didn't go and I didn't see Leon Klinghoffer for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1529">I did occasionally, like in college I needed something and I went to his store to buy it and uh but about what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one of the other members of the family had a bar mitzvah in Worcester and Leon came. </sentence><sentence id="1530">And by that time, he had already had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Uh, and he pulled me over to him--and I remember it just brought tears to my eyes, even then--he pulled me over. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And his speech was quite slurred, because of the stroke, at that time; and we just talked for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1533">And he said, "You know, I want you to know that    USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 40 your mother was really a very good woman." </sentence><sentence id="1534">Uh, and I...1 remember being incredibly impressed that night uh by talking to Marilyn. </sentence><sentence id="1535">And she was still so attractive-looking; and thinking, you know, "What a fantastic lady this is! </sentence><sentence id="1536">I mean, she takes care of him, she works..."

( </sentence><sentence id="1654">2) This is a picture that was taken shortly after my father's death. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And uh uh that's me cheek-to- cheek with my mother, and uh that's my brother on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1656">And uh I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1657">Somehow, to me this picture says it all. </sentence><sentence id="1658">It's just, I mean, all the faces look very grief- stricken. </sentence><sentence id="1659">And especially--I didn't mention this before, but--my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1660">Who, of course, was much older; was uh...he, I guess he never got along very well with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1661">But he really liked my father very much. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And I think he was incredibly devastated. </sentence><sentence id="1663">And I think during those times when my father was so uh depressed, I know he told me that that my mother just couldn't take it anymore and she would go off and do other things. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And he would stand in a dark room, just holding my father's hand. </sentence><sentence id="1665">And I think...I think he was just totally, you know, knocked for a loop that his favorite parent was taken away from him that way. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And I think it really shows in his face. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And I think uh... think you can see in my mother's face that she is just totally, you know, broken up; and...and I have a feeling that I probably didn't really understand too much about what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1668">But I think I must have reflected all the feelings that were happening around me. ( </sentence><sentence id="1669">3) Uh, this June there was a 50th reunion of the survivors of the St. Louis uh in Miami. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And uh USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 44 one evening, there was a dinner and a lot of people brought various artifacts. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And this uh woman by the name of Mr.... Actually, a couple--the Irones (ph)--brought a photo album; and I was sort of thumbing through it, and I found these two photographs with me in it. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And this one not only had me--and here I am, right here--uh but this one also had a picture of my brother looking absolutely miserable. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And my first thought was that he look miserable because he was forced to wear a double-breasted suit with short pants. </sentence><sentence id="1674">But uh I think he looked miserable because he just really knew what was going on; and I think he was very serious and unhappy on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="1675">But I guess this was mostly a group of the children; uh and this is actually the woman with whom I roomed at the reunion, and who I had gone to visit about fifteen years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1676">She lives near Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="1677">Uh, so that was a great find. ( </sentence><sentence id="1678">4) This is a photograph of one page of our passport, which we have in a very well-preserved condition. </sentence><sentence id="1679">It's the usual passport, with the swastika on the cover and a big red J; and uh it has a lot of information. </sentence><sentence id="1680">It tells that we left from Hamburghafen on May 13th, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And then it has a picture of my mother on one page, and our names with the uh the Jewish middle names--uh, Sarah for me--appended. </sentence><sentence id="1682">And on this page, it says in French: "Refugees of the S.S. St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="1683">Reif, Chaje"--which is my mother's Jewish name--"et ses deux enfants, uh Friedrich et Liane"--"and her two children, Frederick and Liane." </sentence><sentence id="1684">Uh, and of course there are many such passports. </sentence><sentence id="1685">But for me, uh somehow especially because I didn't think about this for such a long time, every once in a while when this whole episode comes into my mind, I sort of think, you know, this...this can't possibly really have happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="1686">This is some movie I saw, or some dream. </sentence><sentence id="1687">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION. </sentence><sentence id="1688">And then I go and   USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 45 fish out the passport, and convince myself that it really was real. </sentence></p></dialogue>
