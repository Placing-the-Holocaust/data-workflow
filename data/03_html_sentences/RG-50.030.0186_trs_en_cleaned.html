<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Uh, my father was born in Poland, and came to Vienna to go to medical school. </sentence><sentence id="16">And then uh went on, after he finished medical school, to study dentistry; and then opened a dental practice uh in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="17">Uh, my mother was also born in Poland; and came to Vienna, I think, probably for some frivolous reason--like a vacation, or to buy clothes or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="18">And somehow met my father. </sentence><sentence id="19">Uh, and they were married; and uh my mother stayed in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="20">And uh they uh...I guess things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's practice off the ground. </sentence><sentence id="21">And I think during those early years my mother helped out-- answering the phone and...and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="22">But then after that, she really did not work as long as we were still in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="23">And my father had a rather thriving practice, uh which was inside our house. </sentence><sentence id="24">There were two apartments that ...and they had the wall broken down This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="25">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="26"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 2 between them. </sentence><sentence id="27">So that basically we had this... I guess there were fourteen rooms on one level. </sentence><sentence id="28">At one end was my father's practice, and the other end were our living quarters. </sentence><sentence id="29">Uh, so I guess it...it was fairly thriving. </sentence><sentence id="30">And I think there was a fair amount of uh...oh, social activity--in the sense of going to the opera, and uh... I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="31">Maybe some theater. </sentence><sentence id="32">And uh I think once a week they went to some relatives" and played cards. </sentence><sentence id="33">And uh, you know, probably the usual kind of thing that any middle-class family in that era would have been doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Uh, what about your...your very uh early years? </sentence><sentence id="56">Uh, you were born in "34. </sentence><sentence id="57">What do you remember of your very early childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Well, my memories are very spotty. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh, but uh...1 remember ...1 remember my father's office, and I remember my own room and I remember parts of the layout of the apartment quite well. </sentence><sentence id="63">Not all of it. </sentence><sentence id="64">I mean, I don't think I could draw you a map. </sentence><sentence id="65">But I uh...I remember the dining room, for example; and I remember the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="66">Uh, I think I liked messing around in the kitchen a lot. </sentence><sentence id="67">And I liked... We had a cook, and she let me uh play around in there and do things; although I seem to remember my mother didn't like me to do that. </sentence><sentence id="68">Uh ,the cook used to let me stand up on a chair and help dry the dishes; and I...I think my mother was not too thrilled about that. </sentence><sentence id="69">Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act...We...there were other uh... I hate to use this word, but "servants," in the house. </sentence><sentence id="70">I mean, people who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and did all those things; and I think they were sort of fun for me. </sentence><sentence id="71">And I remember a fair number of...of things. </sentence><sentence id="72">Like when they uh ...they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="73">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="74"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 3 used to roll up the carpets and the runners and take them up to--I don't know, the roof maybe--to beat them with those old-fashioned paddles. </sentence><sentence id="75">And when they rolled up...Especially there were long hallways in the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="76">So we had these long runners, and they would let me stand or sit on one end; and as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a ride. </sentence><sentence id="77">Uh, and then when they folded the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know, getting swung in the sheets. </sentence><sentence id="78">Uh, and I remember getting rides on brooms. </sentence><sentence id="79">You know, I'd put my feet on the two parts of the broom and they would sweep along. </sentence><sentence id="80">Uh, so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="81">I...1 remember ...uh I remember one of my governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my room, actually. </sentence><sentence id="82">I think in my room there was my uh sort of crib and...and maybe... I only remember that there was a crib, although as I look back on it by the age four it's hard to believe that I still slept in a crib. </sentence><sentence id="83">But who knows? </sentence><sentence id="84">And then right in...in uh line with that, there was this other bed where I think the governess slept. </sentence><sentence id="85">Uh, and I remember quite well the layout of my room and where there was a dresser, and I think there was a furry animal, and...and where the window was. </sentence><sentence id="86">Uh, I'm not sure I remember terribly much else about those early uh years. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember very much from the Vienna era about people. </sentence><sentence id="130">Uh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I think I remembered my father when I was younger. </sentence><sentence id="131">But then, at some stage when I was probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="132">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="133"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 4 were already in the United States long since by that time. </sentence><sentence id="134">But my mother always had a large picture of my father on her bed, uh her night table; and I remember a day when I looked at that picture and suddenly realized that the actual memory of my father that I remembered having then had been replaced by the memory of this photograph. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="144">Let's get a sense of...of... You described a child having a good time in the house. </sentence><sentence id="145">Uh, as the Hitler years progressed and we move toward the years uh of uh...to the Anschluss, uh can you tell me what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about from my first-hand recollection is about Kristallnacht, because I remember that with incredible clarity. </sentence><sentence id="150">Uh, my mother was holding me in her arms, and my brother was holding onto her skirt. </sentence><sentence id="151">Uh, and there was this knock at the door. </sentence><sentence id="152">And uh I re...1 mean, I remember that it was a very tense time and it was in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="153">And uh my mother went to... We had one of these peepholes that has like a metal cover, you know, that you push aside; and my mother pushed it aside, and somebody whammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass. </sentence><sentence id="154">And then the superintendent called out, "Don't worry for life. </sentence><sentence id="155">It's just me; let us in." </sentence><sentence id="156">I thought two men came in, but my brother tells me actually were five or six. </sentence><sentence id="157">Uh and then, I mean, they were very unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="158">And uh I think they kind of totally ignored all three of us, actually. </sentence><sentence id="159">They kind of rummaged through the house. </sentence><sentence id="160">And I...and I...they took a lot of things; but the only thing that I specifically remember them taking is that the cook... There was a white closet in the kitchen where they kept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-related things. </sentence><sentence id="161">And...and there was a uh...a tall This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="162">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="163"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 5 can from these things called "pastilles," which came in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind. </sentence><sentence id="164">And this was the three-tier kind; and the cook used to save coins in it, groschen--which are sort of like pennies. </sentence><sentence id="165">And that must have been important to me, because I remember that they took that. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I was not disturbed...I don't remember being disturbed about them taking anything else. </sentence><sentence id="167">But I remember being disturbed about them taking that. </sentence><sentence id="168">And uh...so that evening is sort of like a frozen still photograph in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="169">But L...you know, then it blacks out on either side of that. </sentence><sentence id="170">Uh, and one of the things that I just recently uh said to my brother- -who has often asked me, you know, "Why do you think backwards instead of living your life forwards?" </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh, and I...1 mean, that's a hard question to answer. </sentence><sentence id="172">But about a year ago, when he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter. </sentence><sentence id="173">I suddenly realized that I guess...I guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that era, it's perhaps a little easier. </sentence><sentence id="174">I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what happened and then what happened. </sentence><sentence id="175">And for me, I said to him, I feel as though there's kind of a black box there that I'm maybe constantly trying to pry open but I can't get it open. </sentence><sentence id="176">And uh I guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I somehow...I suppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person or some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to remind me of... But I...1 can't get it back. </sentence><sentence id="177">And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a lot about how...how much my father wanted a daughter and how fond he was of me, and...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="178">And I sort of would like to try to go back and remember what that relationship might have been like, but I can't. </sentence><sentence id="179">I can't bring it back. </sentence><sentence id="180">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="181">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="182"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="221">You've moved to your father. </sentence><sentence id="222">And let's talk about what happened, as it were, on either side of Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="223">You had started...your parents had started looking for papers to come to America, or a way to come to America? </sentence><sentence id="224">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Uh, my father uh... And I can't seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father was one of uh quite a few children. </sentence><sentence id="231">And some people say five, some people say seven, some people say nine. </sentence><sentence id="232">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="233">I have a feeling it was either seven or nine. </sentence><sentence id="234">Uh, and there actually was a set of twins in the family. </sentence><sentence id="235">But, anyway, two of the siblings had come to America, uh I think maybe as early as 1920's. </sentence><sentence id="236">And there had been some talk in the family, apparently, of coming to America to join them. </sentence><sentence id="237">Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk got more. </sentence><sentence id="238">Uh, but apparently my father's feeling was, you know, "Look, I'm forty years old. </sentence><sentence id="239">I don't know English. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh, I wouldn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in America without extensive re-training. </sentence><sentence id="241">How can |...? </sentence><sentence id="242">And, you know, I have such a good practice here. </sentence><sentence id="243">How can I just get up and go?" </sentence><sentence id="244">Uh, well, my father never made it to Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="245">Uh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late that they really had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="246">And so, uh on the morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother and father left the house in the morning to do a number of chores. </sentence><sentence id="247">And one of the chores was to pick up our passports, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="248">Uh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they parted to do some separate things; and they were supposed to meet, I think, either at home or at the home of this cousin where they sometimes played cards. </sentence><sentence id="249">But anyway, they were supposed to meet in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="250">And my father never came back. </sentence><sentence id="251">And he was found dead at the bottom of a uh...a four-story stairwell. </sentence><sentence id="252">And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="253">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="254"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 7 depressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer allowed to to work. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh, and a lot of people were committing suicide. </sentence><sentence id="256">And so I kind of grew up with uh...I mean, a very strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="257">I mean, it was kind of talked about, that he had committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="258">Uh, but uh...my mo...my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and she...she was very adamant that I never tell anybody about that. </sentence><sentence id="259">And I think, really, that must have been a a very difficult thing for me as I was growing up. </sentence><sentence id="260">But anyway, you know, I didn't really think about it very much uh either. </sentence><sentence id="261">As an adult now, as I look back and I ask people, "Well, how...?" </sentence><sentence id="262">You know, and I hear from other survivors about the horrible things that were being done to people, my question has been: "How do you know that he jumped?" </sentence><sentence id="263">And, well, you know, and they say, "Well, we don't know that he jumped. </sentence><sentence id="264">But he was very depressed, and a lot of people were committing suicide." </sentence><sentence id="265">And uh...and my brother also provides a very rational uh reason, which is that he probably thought that the family would be better off without a male. </sentence><sentence id="266">Uh, and so it seems likely that...that he did this. </sentence><sentence id="267">But I can't help always wondering, with all the other stories I hear about, could somebody have pushed him?I mean, nobody would know the difference. </sentence><sentence id="268">So I don't know what the answer to that is. </sentence><sentence id="269">But, anyway, he never came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="313">So you and your mother now were left--this is at the end of September 1938--uh without a father and husband. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: And by the way, those passports that my mother got that morming were taken on Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="317">So...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="327">So we move from September to November. </sentence><sentence id="328">Kristallnacht happens. </sentence><sentence id="329">You are without passports. </sentence><sentence id="330">What did your mother do? </sentence><sentence id="331">What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="332">All of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately did. </sentence><sentence id="341">I think there was probably a lot of correspondence with the Klinghoffer family, which was my father's sister in New York. </sentence><sentence id="342">Uh, and at some point--and I don't remember when this was, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous van came to the house. </sentence><sentence id="343">And my...my mother was really in, I think she was in really bad straights after my father's death. </sentence><sentence id="344">Uh, and this friend of ours who was a lawyer came and kind of supervised, I think, the packing of this van. </sentence><sentence id="345">Uh, and I don't remember what went into it; but I do remember what came out of it at the other end. </sentence><sentence id="346">And it was ... (Laughter) I mean, it was just a ridiculous assortment of some useful but many totally useless uh objects. </sentence><sentence id="347">But anyway, this van was packed, I suppose, without much thought and in a lot of hurry and sent off to New York; and it was in storage for three years until we finally came there. </sentence><sentence id="348">Uh, so I...I do think I remember the day the van was being packed. </sentence><sentence id="349">But then again, there is... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="361">The van was packed; and then what did you and your mother do, specifically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news, I guess, of this ship that was leaving from Hamburg, this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as they call it here. </sentence><sentence id="365">Uh, and because people were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="366">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="367"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 9 not allowed to take money out of the country--I think you were allowed four or ten dollars per person--uh I think we and a lot of people like us, who might not have bought first class tickets, uh bought first class tickets. </sentence><sentence id="368">Because you couldn't take the money anyway, so you might as well, you know, spend it on this. </sentence><sentence id="369">Uh, and so we...we got these tickets and we got these visas, uh which also cost a fair amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="370">Uh, and on...in early May of 1939, we took a train to Hamburg uh to get on this boat. </sentence><sentence id="371">Now, I don't remember anything about the voyage except, I think, I remember two things. </sentence><sentence id="372">One is that there's kind of a sense of fear that I still have whenever I have to uh go through any kind of checkpoints. </sentence><sentence id="373">And I think that part of that must have started at that time. </sentence><sentence id="374">And from what my brother tells me it was very scary in Hamburg, because you didn't know, you know, were you going to get on? </sentence><sentence id="375">Was something going to happen before you get on got on? </sentence><sentence id="376">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="377">Uh, and the other thing is that I remember and still have a little white sun-suit uh that I that I was wearing on the ship; and I just happen to remember--again, it's like a still photograph of me in this little uh white sun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region. ( </sentence><sentence id="378">Laughter) Uh, and then I don't remember anything else from from the ship. </sentence><sentence id="379">But uh...I mean, I know that the ship, of course, came to Cuba and we were not allowed in. </sentence><sentence id="380">Uh, and my brother tells me that uh this lawyer, whose name was [Kleinfeld (ph)], uh actually had already been in Cuba at that the time that the boat docked. </sentence><sentence id="381">And he rode out on a little boat to come and see us. </sentence><sentence id="382">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: Who was the lawyer? </sentence><sentence id="405">Was he a connection with you personally, or with your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>

What I remember much more dramatically are two things. </sentence><sentence id="455">Uh, well, first off, there are some trivial things I remember. </sentence><sentence id="456">I remember my mother was always very neat and clean. </sentence><sentence id="457">Uh, and I remember that my mother was really horrified at the lack of cleanliness in this hotel, and that there were cats running around on the food preparation tables. </sentence><sentence id="458">Uh, and I also remember that she was absolutely horrified because there was no place to bathe or shower in the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="459">There were toilets, but no, you know, bathing rooms. </sentence><sentence id="460">And so my mother apparently asked the woman who ran the hotel where the town bathing facilities were; and the woman apparently didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="461">And my mother was totally horrified by that. </sentence><sentence id="462">And uh, oh, for years later my mother always did talk about "You don't know how much perfume this lady wore," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="463">So I remember trivia like that, and I remember somehow running around. </sentence><sentence id="464">And I remember uh...I remember once these two older girls sort of held me and made me watch while they were killing uh a chicken that was going to be used for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="465">And...and that was really...1 remember that with great horror. </sentence><sentence id="466">You know, I didn't want to watch that, and they sort of forced me. </sentence><sentence id="467">Uh, so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="468">But the more dramatic things that I remember is that one morning we woke up and there uh was this incredible commotion outside. </sentence><sentence id="469">And there were uh shots; and, I mean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were. </sentence><sentence id="470">And the Germans had come in to Loudun. </sentence><sentence id="471">And uh so, for I guess what must have been a couple of weeks we lived in this hotel, and uh a lot of the German soldiers either...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: I...1 know what you're asking, and I...I really had to give that preamble; because my...my sense of my mother during those years, and...and many years later, is that that she somehow never got it all together except for the practical things. </sentence><sentence id="618">That she somehow was so...I'm not sure what the right word is, but maybe almost frantic. </sentence><sentence id="619">I mean, she was...

What she had always told me was that after the Germans came into Loudun, that my brother--who was uh about thirteen at that time, I guess, uh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that he was not staying in Loudun, and that whether she left or not he was leaving. </sentence><sentence id="630">Now, I'm not sure whether my brother really said that in those terms. </sentence><sentence id="631">What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some refugees in the hotel, and that it was decided that they should get the Hell out of there. </sentence><sentence id="632">Uh, and there were...there was only one family, or possibly a family and one other person, who decided not to go. </sentence><sentence id="633">And that family uh is the family of the two sisters that I showed you the picture of before. </sentence><sentence id="634">And it was a mistake, because they didn't get here until 1947. </sentence><sentence id="635">But anyway, so I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="636">What I do remember is that one night we left everything that we owned--which was not much, but we did have, you know, suitcases and valises and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="637">We left everything, and we left in the dark of night. </sentence><sentence id="638">And I think I have a...my recollection is that it was like midnight, uh with nothing except my brother's violin. </sentence><sentence id="639">And this group of us went; and somehow, in a way that was not quite kosher, got on a train that went to the south of France. </sentence><sentence id="640">Uh, and then uh so I remem.... I remember walking to the train station in Loudun, but I don't remember anything of this trip. </sentence><sentence id="641">But what my brother tells me is that uh when we got to the border--which I guess was Poitiers--and we had to go through this uh...you know, whatever you do at borders, uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940, the lower echelon people in these offices were still French people rather than Germans. </sentence><sentence id="642">And apparently one woman in this group of twenty went up to this woman in this office, and said, "Look, you know, I've really got to get across the border, because I'm here and my husband is already on the other side." </sentence><sentence id="643">And so this woman said, "Yeah, alright." </sentence><sentence id="644">You know, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="645">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="646"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 16 stamped her whatever you needed to get stamped. </sentence><sentence id="647">And then she turned and said, "You know, that's also the situation for all these other people. </sentence><sentence id="648">They also have somebody else waiting on the other side." </sentence><sentence id="649">And apparently this woman, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said, "Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="650">OK." </sentence><sentence id="651">And so we all got across. </sentence><sentence id="652">And we went to somehow uh to Limoges, and now that's where my memory picks up again. </sentence><sentence id="653">Uh, the first...I think the first night we slept in the railroad station; and I...1 remember, I think I slept on a...on a scale. </sentence><sentence id="654">You know, the kind of thing you weigh the baggage on. </sentence><sentence id="655">Uh, and then the next night--and I thought it was just one night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an abandoned uh circus arena that was...I guess it was stone. </sentence><sentence id="656">And uh...and I remember waking up the first morning we were there and being all black and blue and sore uh from just sleeping on this...on this stone. </sentence><sentence id="657">Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for six weeks and that people graduated. </sentence><sentence id="658">You know, gradually people found places to live, and so you kind of got to move to the better seats. </sentence><sentence id="659">And then, apparently, the...the most desirable place was around the periphery of the arena. </sentence><sentence id="660">There were these uh...what I call orange crate make-shift beds that had straw mattresses in them. </sentence><sentence id="661">And so that was... for the last few days we were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on those. </sentence><sentence id="662">And then, uh somehow there was a...this Jewish committee that found...you know, was helping the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="663">And they found uh a uh place that I think had been a pool hall, and there was a small room that must have been...I mean, it was really not a very big room. </sentence><sentence id="664">It might have been maybe twenty feet by twenty feet, or twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet. </sentence><sentence id="665">Certainly not...not any bigger than that. </sentence><sentence id="666">Uh, and there were about thirty women who slept in that room. </sentence><sentence id="667">And then, right above that, there was another room where all the...the men slept. </sentence><sentence id="668">And I don't remember there being any other This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="669">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="670"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 17 female children except for me. </sentence><sentence id="671">And I could be wrong about that, but I have no recollection of anything but adults. </sentence><sentence id="672">And my brother slept upstairs with the men; and I have a feeling he might have been the only, you know, minor in that group as well. </sentence><sentence id="673">But then, I mean, this is where I really start to remember. </sentence><sentence id="674">I mean, I remember this place well. </sentence><sentence id="675">And actually, I went back there in 1963 to visit it. </sentence><sentence id="676">And uh so we slept in this room; and at night we had these straw mattresses, and we'd line them up. </sentence><sentence id="677">It was body to body on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="678">Uh, and then in the morning, they would get piled up against the side of the room. </sentence><sentence id="679">And there were all these sort of orange crates, you know, really wooden kind of crates that got pulled out. </sentence><sentence id="680">And we sat on those and...and ate off them and...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="681">And uh so we were in this room for...I don't know, quite a long time. </sentence><sentence id="682">And I began going to school. </sentence><sentence id="683">My first year of schooling was in Limoges; and I remember walking to the school, and I remember the classroom. </sentence><sentence id="684">And I still have my three notebooks from that year. </sentence><sentence id="685">And I remember the teacher, uh who I remember as a quite not very pleasant woman. </sentence><sentence id="686">And uh she seemed very old to me them. </sentence><sentence id="687">I mean, she had sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a very harshly drawn back with a bun; and she sat up on a dias. </sentence><sentence id="688">And uh, I mean, I remember quite a few things from this; but two things that stand out in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="689">Uh one is that every morning she would come down every aisle of seats with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="690">And uh I don't think it ever occurred to her that, by doing that, that she was actually spreading this. </sentence><sentence id="691">And so sure enough, one day I came home and one of the women spotted that I had lice. </sentence><sentence id="692">And I mean, my recollection is that there must have been five women every day who kind of attacked me and washed my hair with kerosene, and then combed it mercilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine-toothed combs until they cleaned my head This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="693">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="694"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 18 out. </sentence><sentence id="695">So that was kind of horrible. </sentence><sentence id="696">The other thing that I remember is I was ...1 was very anxious to be very good in school, and I did very well at almost everything except penmanship. </sentence><sentence id="697">I mean, penmanship was so stressed in that thing, in that system or whatever; and I remember this teacher constantly after me, because on French 1's and s's you're supposed to have this little bump, you know at the top. </sentence><sentence id="698">And I could never quite get that right. </sentence><sentence id="699">I mean, she did...she accepted all the others. </sentence><sentence id="700">I've never had a good penmanship, but she accepted everything else. </sentence><sentence id="701">But she was constantly after me about that little, you know, squiggle that I couldn't get right. </sentence><sentence id="702">So I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="703">The other thing that I remember is that everything was, in terms of food, was incredibly difficult to get. </sentence><sentence id="704">And so uh I...my brother was too old to get milk, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh something that sort of looked like a straightened version of a coke bottle. </sentence><sentence id="705">And my mother insisted that we share that. </sentence><sentence id="706">And so, every morning we would go down and collect this... this milk. </sentence><sentence id="707">Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that I really have added to that a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I got sent into bakeries to beg for bread. </sentence><sentence id="708">And the line was, "I've got uh...I have...1 have money, and I have ration coupons. </sentence><sentence id="709">But uh..."
