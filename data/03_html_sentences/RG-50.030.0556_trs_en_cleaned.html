<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: So you celebrated the holidays, and -- and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Yes, oh, definitely, this was part of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: -- and Shabbat, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: -- Shabbat, yeah, that was a-all part of life and I felt that that's the way it has to be. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: So, how old were you when you s -- did you start school where you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Inever started s -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: You never did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: --I never went to school until after we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="52">So basically, at that point I was almost nine years old before I went to school, without knowing how to read or write. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: So, when the war started, you -- you were on the Soviet side, or you were on the Polish side? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: We were on the Polish side, and then the -- the Soviets came in in -- I guess in 1940, maybe, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: And tha -- and of course, and then the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="62">The Soviets, we were a little bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to -- my father was afraid that they'd   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="63"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="64"> take him to Russia, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="65">And we thought that maybe ca -- jer -- he thought that maybe ki-- when the Germans came in, they didn't -- they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="66">But of course we discovered very quickly otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="67">And after awhile, which I don't really remember how long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, and everybody from all the villages and different neighborhoods -- our house was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="68">And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="69">Cause I remember people basically dying, I don't know how long it took after the ghetto was forming, but on our doorstep there would be dead people that have -- from hunger, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="70">And they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. </sentence><sentence id="71">And we basically, since we were in our hometown, I imagine my -- my parents may have stored some food, so I don't remember being hungry at that point. </sentence><sentence id="72">Maybe I was too young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti -- akejas they call it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="73">The first one we -- we had relatives outside of town, they -- we went there, to outside of town. </sentence><sentence id="74">My father, I think, remained in town, but my grandfather, when we came back, we discovered my father's father was killed, right across the street. </sentence><sentence id="75">He was shot right across the street from our house. </sentence><sentence id="76">And then the second one, we went into hiding someplace outside of the city. </sentence><sentence id="77">But the third one, my father brought us to a Christian family, and he -- they said that all workers should come and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="78">And after a day or two, he will come and get us. </sentence><sentence id="79">And it took about a week and he   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="80"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="81"> never came back. </sentence><sentence id="82">So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking out -- out of the -- their -- wherever they hid us, in their barn. </sentence><sentence id="83">And they were shotti -- shooting after us, you know, when we -- they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="84">And we went back to our home, but eventually this akeja must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out. </sentence><sentence id="85">Out of the house. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="86">And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab -- she had a -- her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it -- to take that. </sentence><sentence id="87">As a child I was able to sneak by with that. </sentence><sentence id="88">And this is basically -- that eventually saved our life. </sentence><sentence id="89">And then they made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father's side had survived, and then an aunt, my father's sister. </sentence><sentence id="90">And we went into the woods, and we --I guess my mother must have known that across this river, was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="91">And you -- you were able to get there. </sentence><sentence id="92">So we were in the woods right acro -- from the river, and hiding in there, and a young student came across. </sentence><sentence id="93">He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and -- and take you across. </sentence><sentence id="94">He carried me across, because I was the youngest one. </sentence><sentence id="95">My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had -- whatever they had. </sentence><sentence id="96">And we came to a little town, Potok Zloty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there. </sentence><sentence id="97">And we went on to Buczacz, and in Buczacz we lived with a family that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there. </sentence><sentence id="98">And there were also many   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="99"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="100"> akejas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="101">And I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children. </sentence><sentence id="102">And right after the akeja I'd come out and they'd say, the children are dead, they're -- they're gone. </sentence><sentence id="103">Or -- and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children, with bleed -- blood coming out of the -- the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="104">You know, when -- so I was always ready, I was afraid I'd be left behind, being the -- the youngest one. </sentence><sentence id="105">So as soon as they -- I'd be -- at night or whatever, I'd be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="106">And basically after this -- you know, after -- I'm--I'm not sure of how much time passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and my -- and we had an-another little town, my ki -- father's relatives, cousins were there, and they -- I don't how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there. </sentence><sentence id="107">And we went to Kopyezynce was that name. </sentence><sentence id="108">And we went in -- we stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="109">And of course then it started over there; the -- the killings started over there. </sentence><sentence id="110">And my f--- relatives" son, they -- he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the basement, and we were there. </sentence><sentence id="111">There were a couple of akejas there, but this was like the last one. </sentence><sentence id="112">We we -- all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that went in there. </sentence><sentence id="113">And they must -- they built a air -- you know, some type of air, to give us air in the street. </sentence><sentence id="114">And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we -- that there was a -- that we -- there was a bunker under there, so they started digging from   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="115"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="116"> the other side the street and came in that side. </sentence><sentence id="117">And then they realized that there had to be an opening in a -- in the house, you know, that we -- how we got in there. </sentence><sentence id="118">So they discovered us on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="119">They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades into the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="120">And basically, I don't know what happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="121">A -- but I was holding onto my brother. </sentence><sentence id="122">And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us. </sentence><sentence id="123">And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there. </sentence><sentence id="124">And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr -- they thought that he was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="125">But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. </sentence><sentence id="126">And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war. </sentence><sentence id="127">And then we -- we -- when -- after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people. </sentence><sentence id="128">At night we snuck out of there, went into a -- into another building, out onto a roof. </sentence><sentence id="129">We stayed there for a long time without any food. </sentence><sentence id="130">Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my -- my throat was closing up from not eating or drinking. </sentence><sentence id="131">But there was like a -- a --a rusty tub, or whatever with the -- with the water was leaking from the roof. </sentence><sentence id="132">And she found a straw and made me drink the water with a st -- through a straw, because it was feathers and dirt in that water. </sentence><sentence id="133">And then we were discovered there. </sentence><sentence id="134">But if-- they only robbed us. </sentence><sentence id="135">There were some other people from the bunker that survived, another three men, I think wi-with us. </sentence><sentence id="136">And -- you know, and they let us -- they --   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="137"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="138"> they told us, this is the end, they're gonna -- going to keep killing until all the Jews are gone, he says. </sentence><sentence id="139">But there is a labor camp outside of -- of -- that some Jews are working on the labor -- in the labor camp outside of town. </sentence><sentence id="140">To us, of course, it was a strange town, we weren't there very long. </sentence><sentence id="141">It was a ghetto -- walled ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="142">But we -- these two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a place to go over the wall. </sentence><sentence id="143">And they found like an old couch or a chair, I don't know what it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over. </sentence><sentence id="144">They threw me over the -- th -- over the fence, and we started running away from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="145">And it was -- a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the -- the gate, the Jews were escaping, and they start -- they shot after us. </sentence><sentence id="146">Well, we were able to get to -- I think one of the man got -- you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the fields, and there was -- the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of days in -- my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that labor camp where Jews were still working. </sentence><sentence id="147">We got there and we -- we s -- we got there at night and there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night. </sentence><sentence id="148">They were always afraid that at night they'd come and get them. </sentence><sentence id="149">We were in a building that wasn't quite finished yet. </sentence><sentence id="150">They came to rob us again, and they -- my mother had -- at this point she had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and they touched her boot that it was there. </sentence><sentence id="151">So they hit her to get off the boot and she refused. </sentence><sentence id="152">She said, we'll scream. </sentence><sentence id="153">They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren't allowed to rob. </sentence><sentence id="154">So they got scared and ran away. </sentence><sentence id="155">And then morning came, and my   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="156"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="157"> mother went into the camp, into that labor camp and ta -- find out if she could work there. </sentence><sentence id="158">And the man that was in charge of labor -- my mother happened to have been a beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the floor in her -- in his office. </sentence><sentence id="159">And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a Polish woman. </sentence><sentence id="160">So she says, but I have two children. </sentence><sentence id="161">So he said, two children, he says, do you have a -- so she says, I have a son and a daughter. </sentence><sentence id="162">Says well, no son, I cannot help you with a son, but with a daughter. </sentence><sentence id="163">But a couple of days later he said to her, I--if you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a friend that would be willing to hide you outside into -- in a -- outside in another farm. </sentence><sentence id="164">And my mother said she didn't -- she was afraid to say that she had the money with her. </sentence><sentence id="165">But she said, I have money in the ghetto, and I will sneak back in the ghetto and dig it out. </sentence><sentence id="166">She wanted to make sure that he meant it. </sentence><sentence id="167">And sure enough, he did have a friend, he sends a worker from that other farm to pick us up, you know, to -- to take us -- he wanted gold dollars, he didn't want -- so we were very lucky to have gold and not paper money. </sentence><sentence id="168">And they took us to this other f-- to this other farm, or to -- you know what -- what it was, it was -- was a lot of people working for him, he was like the boss. </sentence><sentence id="169">And they put us in the room, they -- it was an empty building. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="170">And there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="171">And he -- the man didn't tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as a--he was the bookkeeper on that farm. </sentence><sentence id="172">But he was a Jew, and he passed himself off as a-- you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="173"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="174"> could. </sentence><sentence id="175">I mean, mostly it was potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="176">And being the youngest one after we were there for eight months, and then they started -- rumors were he ki -- brought back rumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the war, and they were coming closer. </sentence><sentence id="177">And the partisans were in the woods, we were hoping we'd get liberated. </sentence><sentence id="178">But eventually, of course, the -- the war came closer, and I think that they -- that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in there. </sentence><sentence id="179">So they moved us to a still. </sentence><sentence id="180">But the -- and the still in -- these big barrels in a still, and -- and then we went up to the -- the roof, I don't -- and they were going to bomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that buildings because they didn't want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="181">And we heard them talking outside, you know, that this is next, they were going to [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="182">And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="183">And we didn't really know if we were -- if the Russians were coming, if the rai -- so we stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they -- they couldn't bring it to us over there. </sentence><sentence id="184">Eventually they came and they told us you're liberated, you're free. </sentence><sentence id="185">And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet were swollen. </sentence><sentence id="186">And we got outside and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next town. </sentence><sentence id="187">And -- and that town they were -- some Jews started coming out of -- you know, there were a couple of families came out of hiding, and we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="188">So basically, that was our liberation. </sentence><sentence id="189">And then we started running because the war was going on right near us. </sentence><sentence id="190">We tried to go closer to   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence
