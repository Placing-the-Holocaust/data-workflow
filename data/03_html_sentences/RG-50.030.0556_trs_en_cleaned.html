-- they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="69">But of course we discovered very quickly otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="70">And after awhile, which I don't really remember how long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, and everybody from all the villages and different neighborhoods -- our house was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="71">And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="72">Cause I remember people basically dying, I don't know how long it took after the ghetto was forming, but on our doorstep there would be dead people that have -- from hunger, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="73">And they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. </sentence><sentence id="74">And we basically, since we were in our hometown, I imagine my -- my parents may have stored some food, so I don't remember being hungry at

back. </sentence><sentence id="87">So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking out -- out of the -- their -- wherever they hid us, in their barn. </sentence><sentence id="88">And they were shotti -- shooting after us, you know, when we -- they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="89">And we went back to our home, but eventually this akeja must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out. </sentence><sentence id="90">Out of the house. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab -- she had a -- her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it -- to take that. </sentence><sentence id="92">As a child I was able to sneak by with that. </sentence><sentence id="93">And this is basically -- that eventually saved our life. </sentence><sentence id="94">And then they made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father's side had survived, and then an aunt, my father's sister. </sentence><sentence id="95">And we went into the woods, and we --I guess my mother must have known that across this river, was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="96">And you -- you were able to get there. </sentence><sentence id="97">So we were in the woods right acro -- from the river, and hiding in there, and a young student came across. </sentence><sentence id="98">He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and -- and take you across. </sentence><sentence id="99">He carried me across, because I was the youngest one. </sentence><sentence id="100">My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had -- whatever they had. </sentence><sentence id="101">And we came to a little town, Potok Zloty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there. </sentence><sentence id="102">And we went on to Buczacz, and in Buczacz we lived with a family that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there.

course, and play with other children. </sentence><sentence id="109">And right after the akeja I'd come out and they'd say, the children are dead, they're -- they're gone. </sentence><sentence id="110">Or -- and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children, with bleed -- blood coming out of the -- the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="111">You know, when -- so I was always ready, I was afraid I'd be left behind, being the -- the youngest one. </sentence><sentence id="112">So as soon as they -- I'd be -- at night or whatever, I'd be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="113">And basically after this -- you know, after -- I'm--I'm not sure of how much time passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and my -- and we had an-another little town, my ki -- father's relatives, cousins were there, and they -- I don't how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there. </sentence><sentence id="114">And we went to Kopyezynce was that name. </sentence><sentence id="115">And we went in -- we stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="116">And of course then it started over there; the -- the killings started over there. </sentence><sentence id="117">And my f--- relatives" son, they -- he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the basement, and we were there. </sentence><sentence id="118">There were a couple of akejas there, but this was like the last one. </sentence><sentence id="119">We we -- all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that went in there. </sentence><sentence id="120">And they must -- they built a air --

know, that we -- how we got in there. </sentence><sentence id="127">So they discovered us on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="128">They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades into the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="129">And basically, I don't know what happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="130">A -- but I was holding onto my brother. </sentence><sentence id="131">And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us. </sentence><sentence id="132">And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there. </sentence><sentence id="133">And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr -- they thought that he was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="134">But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. </sentence><sentence id="135">And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war. </sentence><sentence id="136">And then we -- we -- when -- after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people. </sentence><sentence id="137">At night we snuck out of there, went into a -- into another building, out onto a roof. </sentence><sentence id="138">We stayed there for a long time without any food.

outside of town. </sentence><sentence id="151">To us, of course, it was a strange town, we weren't there very long. </sentence><sentence id="152">It was a ghetto -- walled ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="153">But we -- these two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a place to go over the wall. </sentence><sentence id="154">And they found like an old couch or a chair,
