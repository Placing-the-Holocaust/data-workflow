<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Good afternoon, Dr. Friedman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Good afternoon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Id like to start by having you tell us just basic information about when and where you were born and take us rather quickly, if you would, to where you found yourself in the spring of 1945. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, that covers quite a bit of territory. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on March the tenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took in a cousin who was orphaned. </sentence><sentence id="11">So there were three boys and three girls in the family. </sentence><sentence id="12">I went to school locally in St. Joseph, Missouri, and of course grew up during the Depression. </sentence><sentence id="13">That covered quite a long era. </sentence><sentence id="14">We all worked. </sentence><sentence id="15">It was the usual paper route, selling magazines, eventually working in the drugstore and working my way through school as much as I could. </sentence><sentence id="16">Fortunately, we had a junior college in St. Joseph and I was able to go there for my first two years and get an Associate Arts degree. </sentence><sentence id="17">But after that, I ran out of money, so I was in search of jobs that would pay more. </sentence><sentence id="18">With that in mind, I went out to Colorado, where I had an older brother and his family, and I worked in an amusement park in Colorado -- Lakeside Amusement Park. </sentence><sentence id="19">It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids worked there as they did in ranches, dude ranches, in Colorado. </sentence><sentence id="20">So it was very pleasant work but by the end of the summer I still didn't have enough money to go back to school. </sentence><sentence id="21">So I went back home -- I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back. </sentence><sentence id="22">I went back around Thanksgiving of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="23">And made enough money to enter my first year of college-- of podiatry school. </sentence><sentence id="24">I'm almost afraid to go down that alley because it was my first profession. </sentence><sentence id="25">I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="26">I didn't want to be a doctor but this was the next best thing. </sentence><sentence id="27">In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into medical school. </sentence><sentence id="28">There were Jewish quotas. </sentence><sentence id="29">But I did go to Chicago and I talked to the registrar and when I came home during the summer of "39, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do, I decided to go to podiatry school. </sentence><sentence id="30">Well, that was in the fall of "41, and we know what happened on December the seventh. </sentence><sentence id="31">During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us to remain in school as much as we could, everybody was gung ho. </sentence><sentence id="32">We wanted to get into the army and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="33">Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I couldn't get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in school -- at least to finish that year, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="34">I went back to school, but during the week of finals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did. </sentence><sentence id="35">I came home and went into the army. </sentence><sentence id="36">I went into basic training to , Texas, with the 95" Infantry Division. </sentence><sentence id="37">I had had ROTC in high school at that time. </sentence><sentence id="38">ROTC was very good because we were able to wear uniforms and it would save on our clothing. </sentence><sentence id="39">Although they tell you never to volunteer for anything in the Army, when they asked if anyone had had any close order drill, my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon. </sentence><sentence id="40">At the  end of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC. </sentence><sentence id="41">The second month, I made buck sergeant, I'm sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that's three stripes, then staff sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="42">Then I was ready to go to OCS. </sentence><sentence id="43">I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. </sentence><sentence id="44">I had a first sergeant, was regular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn't send them into headquarters, so I didn't get to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Did you ever talk to him about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Yes, yes, and the reason he didn't put the papers in, although he'd called me, in all the promotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, "I don't want a kike (ph) on my staff". </sentence><sentence id="85">The other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the ranks. </sentence><sentence id="86">The reason he didn't send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97" Infantry Division and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you think of the fact that I did all his work. </sentence><sentence id="87">And also, one of the officers in my company said that I was going through too fast and that OCS is very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="88">They were flunking out at least half of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of army, and what's expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I'd have to spend would be to my advantage. </sentence><sentence id="89">And it was true. </sentence><sentence id="90">I did go to OCS and it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="91">I think around 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated and got their bars. </sentence><sentence id="92">Then we were sent to different camps. </sentence><sentence id="93">I finally ended up at a headquarters company at Camp Blanding, Florida, doing various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="94">And then went overseas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: When did you go overseas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: Went overseas during the winter of "42-"43. </sentence><sentence id="109">We were stationed in Preston, Lancashire, and we crossed the channel on a Polish ship called the Sobiesky (ph) and when we got midway through the channel, there was a lot of submarine and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans, so we had to back to Southampton. </sentence><sentence id="110">I later read, after the war, that the ship that left Southampton the same time we did was torpedoed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: When was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: It was. . . </sentence><sentence id="117">the dates are going to be a little difficult for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: The general time of year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="123">It was the same night that Glenn Miller disappeared over the channel. </sentence><sentence id="124">Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the war, or a lot of things that I thought about as being -- if something took off, took of paramount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the channel, and how lucky that I was. </sentence><sentence id="125">When they said that, ""you get on this ship, or you get on this ship, how many are in your complement", I said, ""Six officers and 96 men". " </sentence><sentence id="126">Okay, you get on this one, you get on that one." </sentence><sentence id="127">We were lucky enough to get on the Sobiesky (ph) that turned back. </sentence><sentence id="128">The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel. </sentence><sentence id="129">I didn't know  this until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics. </sentence><sentence id="130">At any rate, we landed. </sentence><sentence id="131">We had to go over the side of the ship with a rope ladder and landed in landing craft and went into LeHarve(ph). </sentence><sentence id="132">Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren't being shot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the water until we get onto dry land. </sentence><sentence id="133">Once, and I'm going very fast because there's quite a bit to cover, once we got into France, we started moving very rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="134">In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written about Patton streaking across France and into Germany and across the Rhine, across the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph). </sentence><sentence id="135">Then we went to, we were in the battle of Baston, we were in Belgium, Luxembourg, and then into Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: You came into about the tail end of the winter, fighting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: From the beginning of winter, of "44, deg45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: And the Battle of the Bulge was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: In winter of 45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: deg44,deg45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: And then you were at Baston in February? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Around that time. </sentence><sentence id="165">I once read where someone was telling an account of, it might not have been his war stories, it was something and what stuck in my mind was, he said "My memory has a lot of holes in it." </sentence><sentence id="166">So I'm going to paraphrase what he said, or copy what he said, and tell you that my memory, after 50 years of not going back to all this, until I was given an opportunity to give this oral history, my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it. </sentence><sentence id="167">So there will be a time period that will have quite a spread. </sentence><sentence id="168">Now with the Third Army, sl hope -- it would have been nice if it all happened that quickly to bring me to this point, but I know that this is the major thrust of the interview. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: We're in April. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: We're in April. </sentence><sentence id="177">Our troops uncovered the concentration camp at Ordruff (ph). </sentence><sentence id="178">Now Ordruff (ph) was one of the satellite camps at Bookenblow (ph) near Gotha (ph) and you can't get the full measure or the full thrust of what happens to you when you walk into a place like this and see bodies, emaciated bodies, stacked one on top of the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Back up a little bit for me. </sentence><sentence id="183">When you got the orders to go in and you were, how did you approach, what did the area look like, what time of day was it, can you remember those things? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Do you have that whole memory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="188">Vividly, vividly, it was daylight. </sentence><sentence id="189">Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in the ovens, and we could still smell it. </sentence><sentence id="190">In fact, after the war was over when my mother would fix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="191">I couldn't smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves. </sentence><sentence id="192">I've never bought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that's what they were wearing -- these striped pajamas, and I know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="193">I kept salivating. </sentence><sentence id="194">You know there's, before you vomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it's kind of a, well if you've ever done it, if you've ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there's, you know that you're going to throw up. </sentence><sentence id="195">And that's rather indelicate, but this is what happens. </sentence><sentence id="196">Some of the dead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a tree with their legs covered, and dead. </sentence><sentence id="197">Just all sorts of, maybe some in fetal positions, lying in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="198">Those who were still alive, in the barracks, if you could call it a barracks, they were sort of lean-tos with straw, were so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn't have the strength to push him off so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this pallet that had been his bed for many years. </sentence><sentence id="199">We did whatever we could -- we did in the way of food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still moving on. </sentence><sentence id="200">I was still with the combat troop. </sentence><sentence id="201">Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my men were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first line of casualties, and would carry them back to the evac hospitals that were in the rear of the combat line. </sentence><sentence id="202">We did whatever we could to make them comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="203">I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium, and I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran smoothly, it seems. </sentence><sentence id="204">As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere and something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention. </sentence><sentence id="205">But I understand that the Burgermeister (ph) of Ordruff (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body was dismembered and he was strung up on a tree in the center of town, the civic center. </sentence><sentence id="206">I think this is true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: You didn't see it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: I didn't see it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: But you have reason to believe . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Could you see, when you first came in, some of the people who were still alive were able to walk around and talk with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="238">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: And did you talk with people? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Briefly, briefly. " </sentence><sentence id="241">Cause we'd both cry. </sentence><sentence id="242">There wasn't too much, we'd start a conversation and they would love us and kiss us and we would hug them and whatever we had we would give them. </sentence><sentence id="243">Then there was the language barrier. </sentence><sentence id="244">Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian. </sentence><sentence id="245">They came from the Balkan countries as well, Romania, Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="246">There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one thing. </sentence><sentence id="247">They all had one thing in common -- that they were free. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I think, I think, wanted to get revenge. </sentence><sentence id="249">I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of them, of torture, of having their families taken away from them. </sentence><sentence id="250">And murdered in such a manner, in such a diabolical manner, that we've all learned about since then. </sentence><sentence id="251">I didn't know all this at that time. </sentence><sentence id="252">I was aware. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: What did you know then? </sentence><sentence id="267">Did you why these people were in this camp? </sentence><sentence id="268">Did you know who they were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Right away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, I knew, I knew, I knew that they were slave laborers. </sentence><sentence id="277">I knew that the majority of them were Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Do you know how you knew that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: Well, in my fractured Yiddish, and they told me, and I was able to understand a little bit of German. </sentence><sentence id="283">But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in the Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in Germany, or in Europe, we started hearing about these atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="284">But I didn't have any visual evidence of it until I went into the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="285">I didn't know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they were forced there, but I didn't know until later on when I read how they were put in vans, and put on trains and in boxcars and the methodical way that they were loaded into boxcars with the elderly going in first, pushed in. </sentence><sentence id="286">And then the younger ones and then the younger children and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and thrown into the boxcar to land on top of whoever was there and then the boxcar was sealed. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="287">If they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="288">The boxcars came into play, when the vans that they used to gas -- you know they would use vans and they would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the van and by the time they got to Treblinka, or Auschwitz. . . </sentence><sentence id="289">I didn't know all this until much later. </sentence><sentence id="290">When I saw them, well, they were prisoners who hadn't been fed who worked for the German war machine and given, not even, minimal rations. </sentence><sentence id="291">Not even just something to keep them going so they could keep the war machine going, and when they couldn't any longer do that, it was off to the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="292">That was all I knew then. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: And you saw mostly men? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Did you see women? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="299">I don't recall seeing any women then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: And did you spend some time -- how big was the camp and what did you see there and what did you piece together from seeing what was at the camp? </sentence><sentence id="303">Did you see what work they were doing? </sentence><sentence id="304">Did you know that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="309">No. </sentence><sentence id="310">By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="311">They tried to kill as many as they could before they left. </sentence><sentence id="312">A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went on, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given all sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these camps. </sentence><sentence id="313">I didn't see firsthand where they worked -- they weren't working anymore. </sentence><sentence id="314">They sort of spread out over the countryside because, as we progressed, as the army progressed, we would see them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Walking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Walking -- in the striped pajamas, foraging for food, perhaps killing justifiably, we thought. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: How long did you stay at Ordruff ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Perhaps the larger part of two days. </sentence><sentence id="329">Maybe a day and then left on the second day. </sentence><sentence id="330">But during that time, during that time, something must have started germinating in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="331">I couldn't help but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I. I and my antecedents were all from Russia, and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the concentration camp, had I lived in that surrounding, in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="332">The entire village, I later learned, the entire village that my parents and grandparents lived in and aunts and uncles whom I'd never met and cousins -- they were entirely wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="333">I later learned that they were all herded into a barn and the barn was set on fire and as they tried to escape, they were machine-gunned. </sentence><sentence id="334">This is in 1939 when the Germans went into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="335">I didn't know that that happened. </sentence><sentence id="336">I just know that we stopped getting letters from my grandparents in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="337">We stopped getting mushrooms. </sentence><sentence id="338">They used to send mother -- my grandmother used to send her dried mushrooms and she made delicious mushroom and barley soup. </sentence><sentence id="339">That all stopped of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: So even before you went in the service, you were aware of the situation for Jewish people in the eastern part... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: You knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: I knew. </sentence><sentence id="357">I wanted to go into Germany in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="358">I wanted to take a bicycle tour through Germany and I had talked to a friend who had been there and he said, "Don't go. </sentence><sentence id="359">It's not the place for Jews." </sentence><sentence id="360">So we knew as early, actually, as 1933, the things that were happening, the laws. </sentence><sentence id="361">I didn't pay that much attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="362">I was 13 years old then and the prom was much more important at the time, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: But your parents were concerned and keeping in touch with relatives? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: Were relatives coming over during the thirties? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: At the end of the thirties. </sentence><sentence id="377">An uncle of mine who survived, or who was able to come over, came over. </sentence><sentence id="378">But we didn't talk about it a lot. </sentence><sentence id="379">And I found that to be true among many first generation Americans, as I was. </sentence><sentence id="380">We were too busy trying to Americanize our parents. </sentence><sentence id="381">Which was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="382">What we should have been doing was talking to them and getting this beautiful, beautiful background that they had in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="383">I know later on when I'd take Mother for a ride in my car and we went out into the country because I came from a small town, in Missouri, and when the wheat was being harvested and the corn, she'd take it in. </sentence><sentence id="384">She'd smell the wheat and she'd say, "Oh, this is just like home." </sentence><sentence id="385">It was always home. </sentence><sentence id="386">And oddly enough, in the many years that I'd been away from St. Joe and I'd been away to school and in the theater, I've been away altogether, I guess, close to 50 years, whenever I told my wife, whenever I talked about home, she always knew that it meant St. Joseph. </sentence><sentence id="387">It wasn't where we were living at the time. </sentence><sentence id="388">That was a house. </sentence><sentence id="389">And we've lived all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="390">And I guess the army took me all over the world, too. </sentence><sentence id="391">But home, home was always St. Joe, the way Russia was always home to Mother and Dad. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I'm sorry I didn't find out more about that. </sentence><sentence id="393">We got busy with making a living, going to school, and finding the American dream. </sentence><sentence id="394">I'm digressing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: Well, that's okay. </sentence><sentence id="415">Dr. Friedman, when you spent that day and a half, more or less, in Ordruff ... When you left, what was it that the army was able to do for those people in that short amount of time? </sentence><sentence id="416">Very much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: Not a lot. </sentence><sentence id="421">Just enough to keep them alive. </sentence><sentence id="422">It became quite a hot potato after a while, on what to do with these people. </sentence><sentence id="423">I do know, and it might have been, it might be a rumor, but I was told that our Air Force, who did almost pinpoint bombing, eventually, was told not to bomb any of the German military camps. </sentence><sentence id="424">Or any of the IG Farban (ph) buildings. </sentence><sentence id="425">Now the IG Farban was this tremendous cartel that had quite a bit of American money involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="426">The army barracks, we knew that we were going to have to use them for the displaced persons, until they could be repatriated. </sentence><sentence id="427">Now it wasn't that difficult to send the western Europeans  back, who'd been slave laborers, send them back to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy -- although Italy was Allied Germany for a while -- they were also working in the war effort and had to be sent home. </sentence><sentence id="428">But we couldn't do anything with this tremendous, tremendous horde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took "til the end of the war, and then some. </sentence><sentence id="429">And then problems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="440">Q: Is there anything else about that day and a half in Ordruff that you remember, that you want to relay? </sentence><sentence id="441">Anything about the town itself, the local people in the town? </sentence><sentence id="442">Did you have any opportunity to interact with the local people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: I didn't speak with any of them, but they all stood around as though . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="448">Q: They came -- was the camp right in town? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2184">Q: But you are, I think saying, that part of the reason for the surreptitious nature of this effort to get Jews out was resistance by American military personnel, as well as the law prohibiting Jews from migrating to Palestine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2186">A: Well, you know, everybody was torn during those times. </sentence><sentence id="2187">If you wanted to obey directives, if you knew that they couldn't land in Palestine, then you tried to do -- I'm talking about regular army -- you thought why, why would I put them in camps? </sentence><sentence id="2188">Or why, why would I try to get them down to Italy so that they could get on ships for Israel "cause they're not going to take them anyway? </sentence><sentence id="2189">They won't take them -- they started taking them in Brazil, incidentally. </sentence><sentence id="2190">We didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2191">We didn't take them until much later but that's a whole other story. </sentence><sentence id="2192">Again, it was very chaotic, even at that time, as to what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2193">Most important thing was to see that they were well fed and clothed and had some degree of contentment and family because they, and, in some way, and some way that they could really reckon with their tremendous loss. </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="2804">Cause you can't use the same name in the union. </sentence><sentence id="2805">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="2806">So it became Joe Frederick. </sentence><sentence id="2807">And that's how it was when I did this round robin. </sentence><sentence id="2808">And as a result of that, we were honored at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles when they were, as liberators -- there were several and there all pictures here, and I was given a certificate by Vice-President Mondale. </sentence><sentence id="2809">And I'm very proud of

of Koburg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2836">Now Koburg (ph) was a tremendous German army camp. </sentence><sentence id="2837">As you can see, all the barracks were built out of brick to last forever. </sentence><sentence id="2838">Unlike our camps, we built out camps out of wood and plaster, and tore them down right after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2839">But Germany had theirs to go on forever. </sentence><sentence id="2840">Fortunately, we had these because we knew that we were going to house the displaced persons in these camps after the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="2841">So they did serve a great purpose for us. </sentence><sentence id="2842">This is a wonderful Unrah (ph) team that were immeasurable help in Koburg (ph) for me and they're sort of a polygog of nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="2843">The head of the Unrah (ph) team on the extreme left, the man, the balding man, was royalty. </sentence><sentence id="2844">He was related to the royals of Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="2845">And the one kneeling in front of him was White Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2846">And she was married to an official of Macy's in New York and felt that during the time that they escaped from Russia, people helped her family and this was the only way that she could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah (ph) team -- spoke excellent Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2847">In fact, she spoke about five different languages. </sentence><sentence id="2848">The other members -- there were two doctors, two nutritionists, a nutritionist for the entire camp, a nutritionist for the hospital, a nurse and chauffeurs. </sentence><sentence id="2849">And they worked day and night, right along with us, and God bless them. </sentence><sentence id="2850">This is a typical truck that, carrying the displaced persons from Koburg (ph) to Lichtenfelds (ph) which is a railhead, and, as you know, it was a happy time for them until they later learned what their fate held in store after they got to Russia or to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2851">But nevertheless, they decorated the trucks with leaves and trees and branches and also with pictures of their leaders. </sentence><sentence id="2852">I don't know where those pictures came from -- they just appeared out of nowhere and were on the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2853">And we saw to it that they plenty of food and clothing and sent families back together, quite unlike other trucks that carried out people to crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="2854">This is a photo of Russians and American soldiers, at, at a checkpoint. </sentence><sentence id="2855">They were there to see that things were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian directives. </sentence><sentence id="2856">At first, they were very, rather shy, the Russians, and not as talkative as our American officers, but later on there was quite a symbiotic relationship that developed between the two. </sentence><sentence id="2857">We wanted things from them and they wanted things from us. </sentence><sentence id="2858">And between the two forces we got quite a bit done. </sentence><sentence id="2859">Well, that happens to be a picture of me, in my Mercedes. </sentence><sentence id="2860">That was a 1936 Mercedes convertible, I think they called it a cabrolay (ph).And I got it quite legitimately -- we paid for it -- the Germans couldn't use a lot of their vehicles because they couldn't get gasoline for it. </sentence><sentence id="2861">In order for me to be able to draw gasoline and to have it serviced at the motor pool, I had to have it painted OD, and had to put the  2 army emblem on it, a white star on it, and I put some fictitious ordinance number on the hood of the car. </sentence><sentence id="2862">So there you have it, I'm, if the authorities find out at this late date, P'll probably have to go to jail. </sentence><sentence id="2863">This obviously is a wedding that was held in Bamburg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2864">I was in Koburg (ph) at the time, and they invited me to come up to Bamburg (ph), because they were people that I had worked with when I was in the camp at Bamburg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2865">The groom is Sergeant Richard Lane and the bride, her name is Hettie. </sentence><sentence id="2866">I don't know her last name but she was Estonian and she had been a dental assistant and very bright. </sentence><sentence id="2867">Her matron of honor was also from the, from one of the Baltic countries. </sentence><sentence id="2868">And then, I'm, you can see part of my head behind her. </sentence><sentence id="2869">We were all in the wedding party and it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="2870">It was nice to know that life could go on and that some of the institutions that we revered throughout life could take place under these most extreme circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="2871">As a footnote to this, many, many years later, I visited Hettie and Bob in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="2872">They had both gone back to college and were very, very happy. </sentence><sentence id="2873">A happily married couple. </sentence><sentence id="2874">This was an entertainment hall that we had in camp. </sentence><sentence id="2875">They had their own musicians. </sentence><sentence id="2876">They did requisition musical instruments and I have a whole roster here of what they requisitioned: guitars and violins, accordions -- they all played accordions and the Bolla Lika (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2877">I really thought that before it was all over with, I'd be an expert at doing the, the Kuzotzka (ph) or the polka. </sentence><sentence id="2878">One of the other, or both. </sentence><sentence id="2879">But, I enjoyed going to these concerts and they enjoyed having us there because they realized that we were interested in the cultural aspect of their life as well as the necessities, the other necessities of life such as eating, clothing and a roof over their heads. </sentence><sentence id="2880">This was a bonus for them. </sentence><sentence id="2881">Here I am again. </sentence><sentence id="2882">Periodically, of course, I inspected the camp and would see to it that they had enough in the warehouses. </sentence><sentence id="2883">We were always, always after enough wood so that we could heat the cauldrons that made the soup which was the mainstay of all the DPs in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2884">We would cut down entire forests in order to get enough wood and here's an example of how we would stockpile it and store it and just, it was as valuable as gold to us. </sentence><sentence id="2885">As we spoke of this before, the camp was run the same way an entire city would be run. </sentence><sentence id="2886">And this is the hospital of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2887">Many of the doctors, I should say that the majority of the doctors, were Polish although they, we would, they would answer to American medical, members in the medical corps of the American army. </sentence><sentence id="2888">And they received wonderful treatment. </sentence><sentence id="2889">Whatever they requisitioned for the hospitals we were able to get. </sentence><sentence id="2890">We would either get it from our own medical supply or we would get it from the German medical supplies but whatever had to be done was done. </sentence><sentence id="2891">Well this is a Polish doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2892">He was a very fine man. </sentence><sentence id="2893">I had occasion to talk him on a few, a few times that I went over to the hospital and of course many of the times when he came into my office to request medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="2894">But he was dedicated and very happy to be able to be a surgeon, to be a doctor again, which he couldn't do under the German thumb. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2960">Q: Do you recall his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2962">A: No I don't. </sentence><sentence id="2963">No, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="2964">I probably have it somewhere, on a requisition. </sentence><sentence id="2965">I'd have to go through the papers. </sentence><sentence id="2966">I'm certain that there's a name on the requisitions. </sentence><sentence id="2967">I have, I have a whole list of all the Polish personnel and also I have the emblem that they wore on their jackets that I'm gong to give to the museum. </sentence><sentence id="2968">This is an interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="2969">This gentleman had been a collaborationist. </sentence><sentence id="2970">Not in the sense that he collaborated with the Germans, although he might  3 have, but we do know that whatever organization took over the various DP camps, if he had been a member of the camp, he was able to ingratiate himself into the hierarchy of the camp to the extent where he was able to get supplies and whatever the camps needed. </sentence><sentence id="2971">But he would also service himself by doing this. </sentence><sentence id="2972">He probably worked the black market in cigarettes, in candy, in clothing, in liquor and the DPs knew about him. </sentence><sentence id="2973">When I became commander of the camp in Koburg (ph), he started this same thing with me. </sentence><sentence id="2974">And I was quite ignorant of what had gone before, and very innocent and he brought a beautiful dagger that he gave to me that he had sort of confiscated, I guess, himself and had belonged at one time to the Forestmeister of the Black Forest, near TreeAir (ph), Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2975">I still have that dagger but this gentleman is no longer with us because the night of the day that he gave me this souvenir, he was murdered by other members of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2976">Conclusion of Interview   </sentence></p></dialogue>
