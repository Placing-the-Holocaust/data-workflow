<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Good afternoon, Dr. Friedman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Good afternoon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Id like to start by having you tell us just basic information about when and where you were born and take us rather quickly, if you would, to where you found yourself in the spring of 1945. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, that covers quite a bit of territory. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on March the tenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took in a cousin who was orphaned. </sentence><sentence id="11">So there were three boys and three girls in the family. </sentence><sentence id="12">I went to school locally in St. Joseph, Missouri, and of course grew up during the Depression. </sentence><sentence id="13">That covered quite a long era. </sentence><sentence id="14">We all worked. </sentence><sentence id="15">It was the usual paper route, selling magazines, eventually working in the drugstore and working my way through school as much as I could. </sentence><sentence id="16">Fortunately, we had a junior college in St. Joseph and I was able to go there for my first two years and get an Associate Arts degree. </sentence><sentence id="17">But after that, I ran out of money, so I was in search of jobs that would pay more. </sentence><sentence id="18">With that in mind, I went out to Colorado, where I had an older brother and his family, and I worked in an amusement park in Colorado -- Lakeside Amusement Park. </sentence><sentence id="19">It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids worked there as they did in ranches, dude ranches, in Colorado. </sentence><sentence id="20">So it was very pleasant work but by the end of the summer I still didn't have enough money to go back to school. </sentence><sentence id="21">So I went back home -- I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back. </sentence><sentence id="22">I went back around Thanksgiving of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="23">And made enough money to enter my first year of college-- of podiatry school. </sentence><sentence id="24">I'm almost afraid to go down that alley because it was my first profession. </sentence><sentence id="25">I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="26">I didn't want to be a doctor but this was the next best thing. </sentence><sentence id="27">In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into medical school. </sentence><sentence id="28">There were Jewish quotas. </sentence><sentence id="29">But I did go to Chicago and I talked to the registrar and when I came home during the summer of "39, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do, I decided to go to podiatry school. </sentence><sentence id="30">Well, that was in the fall of "41, and we know what happened on December the seventh. </sentence><sentence id="31">During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us to remain in school as much as we could, everybody was gung ho. </sentence><sentence id="32">We wanted to get into the army and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="33">Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I couldn't get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in school -- at least to finish that year, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="34">I went back to school, but during the week of finals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did. </sentence><sentence id="35">I came home and went into the army. </sentence><sentence id="36">I went into basic training to , Texas, with  end of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC. </sentence><sentence id="37">The second month, I made buck sergeant, I'm sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that's three stripes, then staff sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="38">Then I was ready to go to OCS. </sentence><sentence id="39">I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. </sentence><sentence id="40">I had a first sergeant, was regular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn't send them into headquarters, so I didn't get to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Did you ever talk to him about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Yes, yes, and the reason he didn't put the papers in, although he'd called me, in all the promotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, "I don't want a kike (ph) on my staff". </sentence><sentence id="76">The other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the ranks. </sentence><sentence id="77">The reason he didn't send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97" Infantry Division and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you think of the fact that I did all his work. </sentence><sentence id="78">And also, one of the officers in my company said that I was going through too fast and that OCS is very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="79">They were flunking out at least half of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of army, and what's expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I'd have to spend would be to my advantage. </sentence><sentence id="80">And it was true. </sentence><sentence id="81">I did go to OCS and it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="82">I think around 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated and got their bars. </sentence><sentence id="83">Then we were sent to different camps. </sentence><sentence id="84">I finally ended up at a headquarters company at Camp Blanding, Florida, doing various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="85">And then went overseas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: When did you go overseas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Went overseas during the winter of "42-"43. </sentence><sentence id="100">We were stationed in Preston, Lancashire, and we crossed the channel on a Polish ship called the Sobiesky (ph) and when we got midway through the channel, there was a lot of submarine and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans, so we had to back to Southampton. </sentence><sentence id="101">I later read, after the war, that the ship that left Southampton the same time we did was torpedoed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: When was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: It was. . . </sentence><sentence id="108">the dates are going to be a little difficult for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: The general time of year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="114">It was the same night that Glenn Miller disappeared over the channel. </sentence><sentence id="115">Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the war, or a lot of things that I thought about as being -- if something took off, took of paramount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the channel, and how lucky that I was. </sentence><sentence id="116">When they said that, ""you get on this ship, or you get on this ship, how many are in your complement", I said, ""Six officers and 96 men". " </sentence><sentence id="117">Okay, you get on this one, you get on that one." </sentence><sentence id="118">We were lucky enough to get on the Sobiesky (ph) that turned back. </sentence><sentence id="119">The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel. </sentence><sentence id="120">I didn't know  this until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics. </sentence><sentence id="121">At any rate, we landed. </sentence><sentence id="122">We had to go over the side of the ship with a rope ladder and landed in landing craft and went into LeHarve(ph). </sentence><sentence id="123">Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren't being shot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the water until we get onto dry land. </sentence><sentence id="124">Once, and I'm going very fast because there's quite a bit to cover, once we got into France, we started moving very rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="125">In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written about Patton streaking across France and into Germany and across the Rhine, across the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph). </sentence><sentence id="126">Then we went to, we were in the battle of Baston, we were in Belgium, Luxembourg, and then into Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: You came into about the tail end of the winter, fighting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: From the beginning of winter, of "44, deg45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: And the Battle of the Bulge was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: In winter of 45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: deg44,deg45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: And then you were at Baston in February? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Around that time. </sentence><sentence id="156">I once read where someone was telling an account of, it might not have been his war stories, it was something and what stuck in my mind was, he said "My memory has a lot of holes in it." </sentence><sentence id="157">So I'm going to paraphrase what he said, or copy what he said, and tell you that my memory, after 50 years of not going back to all this, until I was given an opportunity to give this oral history, my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it. </sentence><sentence id="158">So there will be a time period that will have quite a spread. </sentence><sentence id="159">Now with the Third Army, ,1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Do you have that whole memory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="165">Vividly, vividly, it was daylight. </sentence><sentence id="166">Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in the ovens, and we could still smell it. </sentence><sentence id="167">In fact, after the war was over when my mother would fix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="168">I couldn't smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves. </sentence><sentence id="169">I've never bought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that's what they were wearing -- these striped pajamas, and I know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="170">I kept salivating. </sentence><sentence id="171">You know there's, before you vomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it's kind of a, well if you've ever done it, if you've ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there's, you know that you're going to throw up. </sentence><sentence id="172">And that's rather indelicate, but this is what happens. </sentence><sentence id="173">Some of the dead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a tree with their legs covered, and dead. </sentence><sentence id="174">Just all sorts of, maybe some in fetal positions, lying in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="175">Those who were still alive, in the barracks, if you could call it a barracks, they were sort of lean-tos with straw, were so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn't have the strength to push him off so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this pallet that had been his bed for many years. </sentence><sentence id="176">We did whatever we could -- we did in the way of food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still moving on. </sentence><sentence id="177">I was still with the combat troop. </sentence><sentence id="178">Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my men were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first line of casualties, and would carry them back to the evac hospitals that were in the rear of the combat line. </sentence><sentence id="179">We did whatever we could to make them comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="180">I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium, and I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran smoothly, it seems. </sentence><sentence id="181">As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere and something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention. </sentence><sentence id="182">But I understand that the Burgermeister (ph) of Ordruff (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body was dismembered and he was strung up on a tree in the center of town, the civic center. </sentence><sentence id="183">I think this is true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: You didn't see it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: I didn't see it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: But you have reason to believe . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Could you see, when you first came in, some of the people who were still alive were able to walk around and talk with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="215">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: And did you talk with people? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Briefly, briefly. " </sentence><sentence id="218">Cause we'd both cry. </sentence><sentence id="219">There wasn't too much, we'd start a conversation and they would love us and kiss us and we would hug them and whatever we had we would give them. </sentence><sentence id="220">Then there was the language barrier. </sentence><sentence id="221">Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian. </sentence><sentence id="222">They came from the Balkan countries as well, Romania, Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="223">There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one thing. </sentence><sentence id="224">They all had one thing in common -- that they were free. </sentence><sentence id="225">And I think, I think, wanted to get revenge. </sentence><sentence id="226">I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of them, of torture, of having their families taken away from them. </sentence><sentence id="227">And murdered in such a manner, in such a diabolical manner, that we've all learned about since then. </sentence><sentence id="228">I didn't know all this at that time. </sentence><sentence id="229">I was aware. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: What did you know then? </sentence><sentence id="244">Did you why these people were in this camp? </sentence><sentence id="245">Did you know who they were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Right away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well, I knew, I knew, I knew that they were slave laborers. </sentence><sentence id="254">I knew that the majority of them were Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Do you know how you knew that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Well, in my fractured Yiddish, and they told me, and I was able to understand a little bit of German. </sentence><sentence id="260">But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in the Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in Germany, or in Europe, we started hearing about these atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="261">But I didn't have any visual evidence of it until I went into the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="262">I didn't know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they were forced there, but I didn't know until later on when I read how they were put in vans, and put on trains and in boxcars and the methodical way that they were loaded into boxcars with the elderly going in first, pushed in. </sentence><sentence id="263">And then the younger ones and then the younger children and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and thrown into the boxcar to land on top of whoever was there and then the boxcar was sealed. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="264">If they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="265">The boxcars came into play, when the vans that they used to gas -- you know they would use vans and they would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the van and by the time they got to Treblinka, or Auschwitz. . . </sentence><sentence id="266">I didn't know all this until much later. </sentence><sentence id="267">When I saw them, well, they were prisoners who hadn't been fed who worked for the German war machine and given, not even, minimal rations. </sentence><sentence id="268">Not even just something to keep them going so they could keep the war machine going, and when they couldn't any longer do that, it was off to the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="269">That was all I knew then. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: And you saw mostly men? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: Did you see women? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="276">I don't recall seeing any women then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: And did you spend some time -- how big was the camp and what did you see there and what did you piece together from seeing what was at the camp? </sentence><sentence id="280">Did you see what work they were doing? </sentence><sentence id="281">Did you know that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="286">No. </sentence><sentence id="287">By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="288">They tried to kill as many as they could before they left. </sentence><sentence id="289">A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went on, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given all sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these camps. </sentence><sentence id="290">I didn't see firsthand where they worked -- they weren't working anymore. </sentence><sentence id="291">They sort of spread out over the countryside because, as we progressed, as the army progressed, we would see them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: Walking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Walking -- in the striped pajamas, foraging for food, perhaps killing justifiably, we thought. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: How long did you stay at Ordruff ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Perhaps the larger part of two days. </sentence><sentence id="306">Maybe a day and then left on the second day. </sentence><sentence id="307">But during that time, during that time, something must have started germinating in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="308">I couldn't help but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I. I and my antecedents were all from Russia, and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the concentration camp, had I lived in that surrounding, in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="309">The entire village, I later learned, the entire village that my parents and grandparents lived in and aunts and uncles whom I'd never met and cousins -- they were entirely wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="310">I later learned that they were all herded into a barn and the barn was set on fire and as they tried to escape, they were machine-gunned. </sentence><sentence id="311">This is in 1939 when the Germans went into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="312">I didn't know that that happened. </sentence><sentence id="313">I just know that we stopped getting letters from my grandparents in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="314">We stopped getting mushrooms. </sentence><sentence id="315">They used to send mother -- my grandmother used to send her dried mushrooms and she made delicious mushroom and barley soup. </sentence><sentence id="316">That all stopped of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: So even before you went in the service, you were aware of the situation for Jewish people in the eastern part... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: You knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: I knew. </sentence><sentence id="334">I wanted to go into Germany in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="335">I wanted to take a bicycle tour through Germany and I had talked to a friend who had been there and he said, "Don't go. </sentence><sentence id="336">It's not the place for Jews." </sentence><sentence id="337">So we knew as early, actually, as 1933, the things that were happening, the laws. </sentence><sentence id="338">I didn't pay that much attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="339">I was 13 years old then and the prom was much more important at the time, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: But your parents were concerned and keeping in touch with relatives? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: Were relatives coming over during the thirties? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: At the end of the thirties. </sentence><sentence id="354">An uncle of mine who survived, or who was able to come over, came over. </sentence><sentence id="355">But we didn't talk about it a lot. </sentence><sentence id="356">And I found that to be true among many first generation Americans, as I was. </sentence><sentence id="357">We were too busy trying to Americanize our parents. </sentence><sentence id="358">Which was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="359">What we should have been doing was talking to them and getting this beautiful, beautiful background that they had in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="360">I know later on when I'd take Mother for a ride in my car and we went out into the country because I came from a small town, in Missouri, and when the wheat was being harvested and the corn, she'd take it in. </sentence><sentence id="361">She'd smell the wheat and she'd say, "Oh, this is just like home." </sentence><sentence id="362">It was always home. </sentence><sentence id="363">And oddly enough, in the many years that I'd been away from St. Joe and I'd been away to school and in the theater, I've been away altogether, I guess, close to 50 years, whenever I told my wife, whenever I talked about home, she always knew that it meant St. Joseph. </sentence><sentence id="364">It wasn't where we were living at the time. </sentence><sentence id="365">That was a house. </sentence><sentence id="366">And we've lived all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="367">And I guess the army took me all over the world, too. </sentence><sentence id="368">But home, home was always St. Joe, the way Russia was always home to Mother and Dad. </sentence><sentence id="369">And I'm sorry I didn't find out more about that. </sentence><sentence id="370">We got busy with making a living, going to school, and finding the American dream. </sentence><sentence id="371">I'm digressing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: Well, that's okay. </sentence><sentence id="392">Dr. Friedman, when you spent that day and a half, more or less, in Ordruff ... When you left, what was it that the army was able to do for those people in that short amount of time? </sentence><sentence id="393">Very much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Not a lot. </sentence><sentence id="398">Just enough to keep them alive. </sentence><sentence id="399">It became quite a hot potato after a while, on what to do with these people. </sentence><sentence id="400">I do know, and it might have been, it might be a rumor, but I was told that our Air Force, who did almost pinpoint bombing, eventually, was told not to bomb any of the German military camps. </sentence><sentence id="401">Or any of the IG Farban (ph) buildings. </sentence><sentence id="402">Now the IG Farban was this tremendous cartel that had quite a bit of American money involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="403">The army barracks, we knew that we were going to have to use them for the displaced persons, until they could be repatriated. </sentence><sentence id="404">Now it wasn't that difficult to send the western Europeans  back, who'd been slave laborers, send them back to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy -- although Italy was Allied Germany for a while -- they were also working in the war effort and had to be sent home. </sentence><sentence id="405">But we couldn't do anything with this tremendous, tremendous horde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took "til the end of the war, and then some. </sentence><sentence id="406">And then problems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: Is there anything else about that day and a half in Ordruff that you remember, that you want to relay? </sentence><sentence id="418">Anything about the town itself, the local people in the town? </sentence><sentence id="419">Did you have any opportunity to interact with the local people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: I didn't speak with any of them, but they all stood around as though . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: They came -- was the camp right in town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="428">On the edge of town, on the edge of town. </sentence><sentence id="429">They acted as though, as they were surprised. </sentence><sentence id="430">But I honestly believe that no matter where the camps were, the people knew. </sentence><sentence id="431">They knew!They smelled it! </sentence><sentence id="432">They smelled the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="433">They smelled the smoke that came out of the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="434">They didn't think they were baking bread there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="444">Q: And the camp itself was close enough to the town... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="448">Q: . . </sentence><sentence id="449">that was no doubt in your mind that people must have smelled and seen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="452">A: Now, they might not have seen. </sentence><sentence id="453">They might not have been all that aware of how, how really despicable the conditions were -- how horrible they were. </sentence><sentence id="454">But I'm sure that they knew what was going on, and didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="455">Jews! </sentence><sentence id="456">Who cared? </sentence><sentence id="457">Hasn't that always been the history? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="464">Q: Did you, at the time, did you feel resentment towards those local people right away? </sentence><sentence id="465">Did that occur to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1455">A: Beginning, beginning in winter of "45 and early "46. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Now, when, when Unrah (ph) started taking over the camps, I was transferred. </sentence><sentence id="1457">I'm trying to think if there was anything more I wanted to tell you about Koburg, except that it was running rather smoothly, although people started trickling back and telling their countrymen that they weren't allowed to go home, that they were sent to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="1458">So that meant that more came in and that we would have to continue to take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="1459">On Bastille Day in camp, one of the French officers almost blew up the camp celebrating Bastille Day. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Jacques Jencam (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And when he left, he told me if I ever got to Paris to be sure and look him up, which I later did, but that's, I'll go into that. </sentence><sentence id="1462">Now, I, when the work was running smoothly in the camps, and, as I said, they had their own hospitals, they had their own entertainment. </sentence><sentence id="1463">We were invited to many of the affairs that they had in camp, as guests of honor, and I went. </sentence><sentence id="1464">I danced to many a oom- pah-pah band and Polish, and the polka. </sentence><sentence id="1465">I liked to dance. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Then I was transferred to Onzbock (ph) which was outside of Nuremburg. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And I was put in charge of several DP camps and also the exchange point at Hoapf, (ph) Germany, and we have that on the map. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Now the reason it was called an exchange point is because, apparently, and I believe it was at the Yalta Conference, we, that is the four major powers, said that we would repatriate the Germans, also, who had been displaced because of war. </sentence><sentence id="1469">German for German, who had been displaced prior to September the 1deg, 1936. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And they all, and they came from Russian zone into the American zone through Hoapf (ph), Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And I was in charge of that exchange point. </sentence><sentence id="1472">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And it was through this exchange point, the Jews came in. </sentence><sentence id="1474">They also had gone back to Poland, or wherever. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And they thought that they, well they did, they knew their homes were already occupied, their farms had been occupied, and they were being killed. </sentence><sentence id="1476">The progroms had started. </sentence><sentence id="1477">A little anecdote. </sentence><sentence id="1478">When the Allies got onto the government of Poland, after the war, immediately after the war, and started chastising them for starting these anti-Semitic picadilloes again, this one telegram that they got, or communicae that they got, said, "I don't understand how you can be so unhappy with us. </sentence><sentence id="1479">We've only burned one synagogue since last August." </sentence><sentence id="1480">This is what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1481">Lodz (ph), Lodz (ph), the city of Lodz (ph), that had 200,000 Jews before the war, two of them came back. </sentence><sentence id="1482">The Lodz (ph) Uprising. </sentence><sentence id="1483">When they were subdued, they were all taken out, but 40 of them hid in the, in various cellars, underground sewers. </sentence><sentence id="1484">This is why they either didn't go, or went and came back. </sentence><sentence id="1485">Poles wanted to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="1486">They didn't want to give up their homes. </sentence><sentence id="1487">They didn't want to give up their farms. </sentence><sentence id="1488">I'm not talking about the Poles that came to American during the mass migration in 1906 and 1909. </sentence><sentence id="1489">They came for the same reason my folks came -- to get away from religious persecution and to have a better life for their children. </sentence><sentence id="1490">There was a Polish family that took care of all of us in Saint, little St. Joseph, Missouri. </sentence><sentence id="1491">They were like brothers and sisters to my father and mother because they spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1492">My folks did too -- Russian Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1493">These are people that had been so indoctrinated with the hatred who had helped, I think they showed the Nazis a few things, and so did the Estonians and Lithuanians and the Latvians. </sentence><sentence id="1494">They came out smelling like a rose, too, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1495">To make Patton say, when he talked about the dirty, filthy Jews, he said, "They're nothing like the Estonians." </sentence><sentence id="1496">Well, how could they be? </sentence><sentence id="1497">Where was the soap? </sentence><sentence id="1498">Where were the water levels in the billets  5 that they were in? </sentence><sentence id="1499">There wasn't any water, there wasn't any running water! </sentence><sentence id="1500">How could they use the latrines or the toilets? </sentence><sentence id="1501">He didn't think about that. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And it was against his Anglo-Saxon sensitivities to put them in German homes. </sentence><sentence id="1503">You can't displace Germans! </sentence><sentence id="1504">For the Jews? " </sentence><sentence id="1505">I can't do that," he said. </sentence><sentence id="1506">I'm digressing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1629">A: It really didn't matter -- about burning them because I knew that they could make new papers. </sentence><sentence id="1630">It amounted to just the same as the paper -- but I didn't want to have any of the evidence because of what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1631">I knew I would have to account for it. </sentence><sentence id="1632">By morning, by morning, they were all out of jail. </sentence><sentence id="1633">The guards had been bribed with money, with drinks, with liquor and the Jews were on trains, again going to Jewish DP camps in the American Occupied Zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1634">The story doesn't end there with me. </sentence><sentence id="1635">I was called into the office--my commanding officer's office -- who was a colonel. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And I shan't tell you his name. </sentence><sentence id="1637">I've never mentioned his name. </sentence><sentence id="1638">He was regular army. </sentence><sentence id="1639">He had appropriated the finest chalet in Onzbock, for his family. </sentence><sentence id="1640">They were coming over. </sentence><sentence id="1641">After all, this was a war of occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1642">He had appropriated one of Hitler's specially built Mercedes-Benz bullet-proof touring cars for his own. </sentence><sentence id="1643">And he called me in because the security officer at Hoapf (ph) told him what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1644">He said, "What do you know about this?" </sentence><sentence id="1645">I said "Well, I know that 125 Jews, approximately, 125 Jews tried to come across the border last night and I told the captain to put them all in jail." </sentence><sentence id="1646">He said "Well, they're all gone now. </sentence><sentence id="1647">Where do you think they are?" </sentence><sentence id="1648">And I said "Well, I think they're all very happily ensconced in Jewish DP camps in Bavaria, in southern Germany." </sentence><sentence id="1649">He said, "You know, this is conduct unbecoming an American officer and I'm going to have to court-martial you." </sentence><sentence id="1650">Well.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1782">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1784">A group of Palestinian officers, now we must remember it wasn't called Israel then, they were Jewish officers who had fought with the Palestinian brigade in North Africa. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And they had permission from Third Army headquarters and they had their papers with them and they had a roster of families and names with them. </sentence><sentence id="1786">And you have a picture of that in your archives. </sentence><sentence id="1787">And I'm so proud of them. </sentence><sentence id="1788">I'm standing right in the middle of them. </sentence><sentence id="1789">I just wanted to be with them because of what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="1790">They were trying to find, ostensibly, they were trying to find, survivors of the relatives of members of the Palestinian Brigade. </sentence><sentence id="1791">Well, this is true, they were, and they did find as many as they could. </sentence><sentence id="1792">But, it was to be a cover for the Jewish Underground. </sentence><sentence id="1793">And what they were trying to do was to get the sympathies of the American Jewish officers, mostly American Jewish officers, although a very dear friend of mine that I worked with who is non-Jewish helped a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1794">And therein lies another story but, and when they realized that I would do all that I could to help out, they, they were satisfied and pleased. </sentence><sentence id="1795">And I think, I think if, if the museum would blow up this photo that I had, that there might be some faces on there that are easily recognizable because I'm sure that they later became leaders in the state of Israel or in, again, with repatriation of, of Jewish DPs, Jewish slave laborers. </sentence><sentence id="1796">And I think we might find among them some who had really dedicated the rest of their lives to this type of work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2002">Q: But you are, I think saying, that part of the reason for the surreptitious nature of this effort to get Jews out was resistance by American military personnel, as well as the law prohibiting Jews from migrating to Palestine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2004">A: Well, you know, everybody was torn during those times. </sentence><sentence id="2005">If you wanted to obey directives, if you knew that they couldn't land in Palestine, then you tried to do -- I'm talking about regular army -- you thought why, why would I put them in camps? </sentence><sentence id="2006">Or why, why would I try to get them down to Italy so that they could get on ships for Israel "cause they're not going to take them anyway? </sentence><sentence id="2007">They won't take them -- they started taking them in Brazil, incidentally. </sentence><sentence id="2008">We didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2009">We didn't take them until much later but that's a whole other story. </sentence><sentence id="2010">Again, it was very chaotic, even at that time, as to what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2011">Most important thing was to see that they were well fed and clothed and had some degree of contentment and family because they, and, in some way, and some way that they could really reckon with their tremendous loss. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2124">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2125">Kind of a thin line. </sentence><sentence id="2126">I really couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2127">I couldn't go to Hoapf (ph) and oversee this transfer unless . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2132">Q: Because that would be obvious, sort of participating . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2134">A: Yeah, I could, yes, I could oversee the German transfer. </sentence><sentence id="2135">But it was carried along as the same time as the Jews were coming across. </sentence><sentence id="2136">So it was best just to let it happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2140">Q: And some of them then, I guess, would come into the camps that you were overseeing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2142">A: That, not from Hoapf (ph), not so much, no. </sentence><sentence id="2143">By that time, they were going into Jewish camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2156">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2157">Only the one, no. </sentence><sentence id="2158">None of those. </sentence><sentence id="2159">But of course those who came through my camp at Koburg (ph), I knew when they were coming through and I knew when they were going out with the, in the trucks and they got special care -- food, clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2160">Years later, well let's go back to where, if you like, where I was almost court-martialed. </sentence><sentence id="2161">Is that alright? </sentence><sentence id="2162">Anyway, I was put under arrest of quarters in Onzbock (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2163">In the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel. </sentence><sentence id="2164">And as I said before, I told the colonel that you can't, that the responsibility was all his and it was under his command. </sentence><sentence id="2165">Now and he had all his family coming over, they were all ready to come over for the duration, however long that was going to be. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And the next day, there were orders that came from Third Army Headquarters sending me home. </sentence><sentence id="2167">That's among the orders that you have. </sentence><sentence id="2168">Now they would send divisions home, they would send battalions home, and my orders came through, one person, Captain Joe Friedman, report to Camp Philip Morris. </sentence><sentence id="2169">And I was escorted by the two military government, by the two MPs, to the train. </sentence><sentence id="2170">We went by car to Frankfurt -- we got on the train there for Paris. </sentence><sentence id="2171">Now Jacques Jangcam (ph), who had the Bourbon (ph) signet ring, or crest, told me that if 1 ever got to Paris, to call him. </sentence><sentence id="2172">Well, we had to change trains, either from the Guardinore (ph), or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2173">I don't remember because, because it's been 50 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="2174">But I took a chance and I called him. </sentence><sentence id="2175">Had his phone number in my little book when I knew I was going through Paris and I called him and he asked me -- and he was home! </sentence><sentence id="2176">And he asked me where I was and I told him I was at the train station. </sentence><sentence id="2177">And I told him what the circumstances were -- that were two MPs guarding me -- but at the time they were looking at magazines and French postcards in the train station. </sentence><sentence id="2178">And he said, "I know that train station." </sentence><sentence id="2179">He said, "I'll be over there. </sentence><sentence id="2180">You stay in the phone booth and pretend that you're talking to me. </sentence><sentence id="2181">I'll be over there in about ten minutes and when you see me in the doorway, you come out of the telephone booth and come right to where I am and we'll get in my car and I'll take you home -- to my, to my home." </sentence><sentence id="2182">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2183">I don't think anything happened to the MPs, because they were all so happy to get rid of me. </sentence><sentence id="2184">I'm sure that when he went back, when they went back to Onzbock (ph), and told the colonel what had happened, he probably felt that it would be fine if I was arrested for being AWOL, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2185">But, what actually happened was that Jacques took me to his home. </sentence><sentence id="2186">And his home happened to be a floor through apartments, apartment in the Trockadeero (ph) Section of Paris. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And you could see the Eiffel Tower from their home, their apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And it was the type of apartment that the elevator opened up into their, well as long as it's French I'd better say foyer, but it opened up into their foyer. </sentence><sentence id="2189">And I, his grandmother lived with them, and I received her, I was given her suite of rooms while I was there, which consisted of a sitting room, a bedroom and a bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="2190">And I was served breakfast in bed. </sentence><sentence id="2191">In fact, I had to wait until the maid got out, left the room so I could get out of bed and put the tray on the dresser so I could have breakfast comfortably. </sentence><sentence id="2192">I found out what the signet ring was: their dining room -- they had tapestries all over the, all over the apartment and they were these tapestries that depicted all the wars that the Bourbons (ph) had fought in from whenever to wherever. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And he was the descendant of the kings and it  5 didn't mean anything to him except that he had this signet ring that he wore. </sentence><sentence id="2194">And it was also in needlepoint on the back of all the chairs in the dining room. </sentence><sentence id="2195">And Jacques had a sister who showed me around Paris. </sentence><sentence id="2196">We went to the Louvre -- we did all the typical tourist things and I was there for about four days. </sentence><sentence id="2197">I was very anxious -- I was a little afraid that something might happen and I did leave after, I think it was four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="2198">But I'd been to the Leedo (ph) and the Moulon (ph) Rouge and the Casino de Paris and to the Napoleon's tomb and the famous cemetery -- well, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2199">I'll think of it. </sentence><sentence id="2200">And I got to Camp Philip Morris. </sentence><sentence id="2201">I could have stayed in Paris for a month! </sentence><sentence id="2202">When I reported there, they said, "Well, you'll go out on the next available ship, boat." </sentence><sentence id="2203">Washtub is what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2204">It was a victory ship. </sentence><sentence id="2205">I crossed in the Amsterdam, the SS something Amsterdam which was a huge luxury vessel. </sentence><sentence id="2206">Took us four and a half days to cross -- took me ten days to get back, and it was during that time and I was in a stateroom with other officers, and that's when all my things were stolen. </sentence><sentence id="2207">With the exception of that one bottle of perfume and the fifth of Three Feathers. </sentence><sentence id="2208">That was a very popular brand of bourbon during the war that I later had with my dad. </sentence><sentence id="2209">Then, I came home and I had a very difficult time. </sentence><sentence id="2210">I was being separated from the service at Jefferson Barracks and I sort of broached on this subject when we were talking before, but the first person I saw was a friend of mine that I grew up with in St. Joe and he was playing cards in the officers" recreation room. </sentence><sentence id="2211">And I ran up to him and I said, "Paul!" </sentence><sentence id="2212">You know, I was so happy to be home! </sentence><sentence id="2213">I said, "I'm going to be in St. Joe! </sentence><sentence id="2214">They're shipping me out tomorrow! </sentence><sentence id="2215">Is there anything you want me to tell your folks -- ll call them!" </sentence><sentence id="2216">And he said, "Eh, I see them every weekend." </sentence><sentence id="2217">He had spent the entire war in Jefferson Barracks. </sentence><sentence id="2218">I guess he did something. </sentence><sentence id="2219">Something that was necessary to the war effort. </sentence><sentence id="2220">But it hit me, really, how . </sentence><sentence id="2221">Four  6 butts or clean the latrine, or your platoon leader, your captain tells you to shape up these men -- go on bivouac, maneuvers. </sentence><sentence id="2222">There's always someone above you to tell you what to do and I was waiting for someone to tell me what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2223">I had this brother and sister living out in Colorado and I went to visit them. </sentence><sentence id="2224">And I spent almost the entire summer there -- went to the mountains, breathing some nice fresh air and just relaxing. </sentence><sentence id="2225">And slowly, the time was coming to go, when I would have to go back to school -- if I wanted to finish school. </sentence><sentence id="2226">And I was really very reluctant to go and I think that this same thing followed me, this same feeling followed me until I gave up practice until I gave up my practice and left St. Joseph to seek my career -- another career in the theater. </sentence><sentence id="2227">I had the typical midlife crisis. </sentence><sentence id="2228">I did go back to school because I thought let me finish one thing that I started. </sentence><sentence id="2229">Let me at least do that. </sentence><sentence id="2230">But I was very unhappy when I went back. </sentence><sentence id="2231">Many men, many of the students in my class were much younger. </sentence><sentence id="2232">They had just come out of high school or you know, they'd gotten a B.A. in college and had gone on to podiatry school. </sentence><sentence id="2233">And quite a few were married and I was kind of an old man at 26. </sentence><sentence id="2234">And an angry old man because the world had passed me by. </sentence><sentence id="2235">And I'd lost four years. </sentence><sentence id="2236">I really hadn't. </sentence><sentence id="2237">It was the most formative four years that I could have had to prepare me for what came later and that was just -- that was life. </sentence><sentence id="2238">I went back to school and I came back to St.Joseph to practice. </sentence><sentence id="2239">My first year back at school, though, was the hardest and I knew that I would need help. </sentence><sentence id="2240">And the Veterans Administration had a counseling service at the University of Chicago and I was able to go there, on Saturdays, every week for about six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2241">And I had a very intense and intensive meeting with a very, very good psychologist, analyst, therapist, counselor that finally culminated in taking various tests. </sentence><sentence id="2242">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="2243">I took, but I tried, I tried as objective as I could with these tests and they grade you, you know, on the curve. </sentence><sentence id="2244">Like, say in law, maybe four people will be better than you are if you follow that field but 95 won't be as good as you. </sentence><sentence id="2245">And, as I said, I tried to be as objective as I could in taking the tests but the results were that I would probably be best in personnel management, law and then medicine. </sentence><sentence id="2246">Medicine, of course, I'd had two years of pre-med prior to going into podiatry school. </sentence><sentence id="2247">So, I'm sure that that showed up in the exams. </sentence><sentence id="2248">And I came back and I practiced and I had a very lucrative practice for 14 years and then I had the typical midlife crisis. </sentence><sentence id="2249">And I see, gee, and I kept thinking about life back in the DP camps and how tenuous it is and how it just could hang by a thin thread. </sentence><sentence id="2250">And you're here today and tomorrow the whole thing could be wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="2251">So live each day and, that's not knew with me, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2252">But live it the way you want to live it. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And live it the way it'll give you the most pleasure, not the most remuneration. </sentence><sentence id="2254">But just that'I] make you a good man and I picked the most difficult profession in the world. </sentence><sentence id="2255">And I left St. Joe and joined a melodrama troupe in Colorado, on the western slope. </sentence><sentence id="2256">They called it the Kerosene (ph) Circuit. </sentence><sentence id="2257">And I played Aspen, Glenwood Springs, Leadville, Durango, Steamboat Springs -- did it an entire summer. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And I was 42 years old then. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2548">Q: You spent the last 50 years angry? </sentence><sentence id="2549">About what? </sentence><sentence id="2550"> 9 at the time, was a survivor -- an emigre, and he was telling me about this. </sentence><sentence id="2551">And I told him my involvement in the DP camps and he asked me if I would work. </sentence><sentence id="2552">They were going to set up a round robin with survivors and liberators, such as myself, in a church, actually. </sentence><sentence id="2553">And it was, I think it was on Wilshire Boulevard, on Pico Boulevard. </sentence><sentence id="2554">There was a church that had classrooms and we were going to have a round robin about, well I have all the papers -- we were going to take turns and tell our story over and over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="2555">And the classrooms that were bussed in would be in this class and then they would do -- they would go, each one of them, in time, would hear the story of about six of us. </sentence><sentence id="2556">And incidentally, the Fonz was one of them -- Henry Winkler. </sentence><sentence id="2557">I think that that was the main attraction for a lot of these kids that came in because, you know, Happy Days was running on the crest of television waves. </sentence><sentence id="2558">And I got involved, then, and that's, that was the change of name. </sentence><sentence id="2559">I think you, I was using Joe Frederick at the time because when I went into the theater, you couldn't have a very ethnic- sounding name if you wanted to work. </sentence><sentence id="2560">In fact, the first man that interviewed me for a job said that he looked at his calendar and when he saw Joe Friedman, he said, he thought to himself, he said, "Eh, another accountant? </sentence><sentence id="2561">Another insurance salesman? </sentence><sentence id="2562">I have plenty of insurance and I have my own accountant. </sentence><sentence id="2563">I don't need anybody like that." </sentence><sentence id="2564">And he told me this when I went in. </sentence><sentence id="2565">He was the director of Love of Life and Secret Storm -- these were soaps that were going on at that time, in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2566">And I wanted to work. </sentence><sentence id="2567">He says, "You'll never work under the name of Joe Friedman." </sentence><sentence id="2568">Well, I wanted to keep the same initials. </sentence><sentence id="2569">And also, a strange thing happened before I left St. Joe. </sentence><sentence id="2570">One of my patients called me Frederick, by accident. </sentence><sentence id="2571">She called me Dr. Frederick and I thought, gee, what a nice sounding name and it's the same initial. </sentence><sentence id="2572">But I didn't have to worry about that because there was a dancer in the Equity, one of the actors" union, who was Joe Friedman, and it didn't matter to him -- he was a dancer. </sentence><sentence id="2573">And so I couldn't use my name, anyway. " </sentence><sentence id="2574">Cause you can't use the same name in the union. </sentence><sentence id="2575">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="2576">So it became Joe Frederick. </sentence><sentence id="2577">And that's how it was when I did this round robin. </sentence><sentence id="2578">And as a result of that, we were honored at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles when they were, as liberators -- there were several and there all pictures here, and I was given a certificate by Vice-President Mondale. </sentence><sentence id="2579">And I'm very proud of that. </sentence><sentence id="2580">The only other time, in Los Angeles that I spoke of it and, again, I keep referring to the pictures that I have and I left it with the museum -- the Ludz (ph) survivors have a very strong club in Los Angeles. </sentence><sentence id="2581">A very affluent club and they do wonderful work with the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2582">And they called the Federation in Los Angeles and asked for entertainers for a fundraiser that they were going to have and I was sent to go to this Beverly Hills mansion and entertain. </sentence><sentence id="2583">I have a little act that I do -- I was in Fiddler on the Roof for three years -- I did close to 3,000 performances. </sentence><sentence id="2584">I was in Las Vegas for four months with it. </sentence><sentence id="2585">So I sing, and I, and I do Al Jolson. </sentence><sentence id="2586">I used to go down on my knee, but then when I couldn't get up one time, I stopped that. </sentence><sentence id="2587">At any rate, this Shobby Shoptie (ph) who's a terrorist from, he's one of the leading exponents of, an Israeli on terrorism. </sentence><sentence id="2588">He was the main speaker and I was the entertainment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2630">And I felt because of the occasion, and because they were all Ludz (ph) people from the, from the ghetto, that I would tell them a little bit about my

#3  1 Tape #4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2642">A: Here we have a picture of members of the Palestinian Brigade, who came into my camp, around the end of June. </sentence><sentence id="2643">They had a list of members of the Palestinian Brigade who fought in North Africa and ostensibly they wanted to see if there were still relatives of members of the Brigade that were alive and living in the Displaced Person Camps and they had legitimate orders from Third Army Headquarters at Bogtoles (ph) to come into the camps and when they came into mine, I was very happy to see them. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And, underneath it all, they were looking for the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out informing the links between various camps for Jewish DPs, who were coming out of the Russian Occupied Zone of Germany into the American Occupied Zone for a number of reasons that we've already talked about. </sentence><sentence id="2645">So that they could go down to Italy and get on ships for Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2646">This is an aerial view of Koburg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2647">Now Koburg (ph) was a tremendous German army camp. </sentence><sentence id="2648">As you can see, all the barracks were built out of brick to last forever. </sentence><sentence id="2649">Unlike our camps, we built out camps out of wood and plaster, and tore them down right after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2650">But Germany had theirs to go on forever. </sentence><sentence id="2651">Fortunately, we had these because we knew that we were going to house the displaced persons in these camps after the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="2652">So they did serve a great purpose for us. </sentence><sentence id="2653">This is a wonderful Unrah (ph) team that were immeasurable help in Koburg (ph) for me and they're sort of a polygog of nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="2654">The head of the Unrah (ph) team on the extreme left, the man, the balding man, was royalty. </sentence><sentence id="2655">He was related to the royals of Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="2656">And the one kneeling in front of him was White Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2657">And she was married to an official of Macy's in New York and felt that during the time that they escaped from Russia, people helped her family and this was the only way that she could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah (ph) team -- spoke excellent Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2658">In fact, she spoke about five different languages. </sentence><sentence id="2659">The other members -- there were two doctors, two nutritionists, a nutritionist for the entire camp, a nutritionist for the hospital, a nurse and chauffeurs. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And they worked day and night, right along with us, and God bless them. </sentence><sentence id="2661">This is a typical truck that, carrying the displaced persons from Koburg (ph) to Lichtenfelds (ph) which is a railhead, and, as you know, it was a happy time for them until they later learned what their fate held in store after they got to Russia or to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2662">But nevertheless, they decorated the trucks with leaves and trees and branches and also with pictures of their leaders. </sentence><sentence id="2663">I don't know where those pictures came from -- they just appeared out of nowhere and were on the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2664">And we saw to it that they plenty of food and clothing and sent families back together, quite unlike other trucks that carried out people to crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="2665">This is a photo of Russians and American soldiers, at, at a checkpoint. </sentence><sentence id="2666">They were there to see that things were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian directives. </sentence><sentence id="2667">At first, they were very, rather shy, the Russians, and not as talkative as our American officers, but later on there was quite a symbiotic relationship that developed between the two. </sentence><sentence id="2668">We wanted things from them and they wanted things from us. </sentence><sentence id="2669">And between the two forces we got quite a bit done. </sentence><sentence id="2670">Well, that happens to be a picture of me, in my Mercedes. </sentence><sentence id="2671">That was a 1936 Mercedes convertible, I think they called it a cabrolay (ph).And I got it quite legitimately -- we paid for it -- the Germans couldn't use a lot of their vehicles because they couldn't get gasoline for it. </sentence><sentence id="2672">In order for me to be able to draw gasoline and to have it serviced at the motor pool, I had to have it painted OD, and had to put the  2 army emblem on it, a white star on it, and I put some fictitious ordinance number on the hood of the car. </sentence><sentence id="2673">So there you have it, I'm, if the authorities find out at this late date, P'll probably have to go to jail. </sentence><sentence id="2674">This obviously is a wedding that was held in Bamburg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2675">I was in Koburg (ph) at the time, and they invited me to come up to Bamburg (ph), because they were people that I had worked with when I was in the camp at Bamburg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2676">The groom is Sergeant Richard Lane and the bride, her name is Hettie. </sentence><sentence id="2677">I don't know her last name but she was Estonian and she had been a dental assistant and very bright. </sentence><sentence id="2678">Her matron of honor was also from the, from one of the Baltic countries. </sentence><sentence id="2679">And then, I'm, you can see part of my head behind her. </sentence><sentence id="2680">We were all in the wedding party and it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="2681">It was nice to know that life could go on and that some of the institutions that we revered throughout life could take place under these most extreme circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="2682">As a footnote to this, many, many years later, I visited Hettie and Bob in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="2683">They had both gone back to college and were very, very happy. </sentence><sentence id="2684">A happily married couple. </sentence><sentence id="2685">This was an entertainment hall that we had in camp. </sentence><sentence id="2686">They had their own musicians. </sentence><sentence id="2687">They did requisition musical instruments and I have a whole roster here of what they requisitioned: guitars and violins, accordions -- they all played accordions and the Bolla Lika (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2688">I really thought that before it was all over with, I'd be an expert at doing the, the Kuzotzka (ph) or the polka. </sentence><sentence id="2689">One of the other, or both. </sentence><sentence id="2690">But, I enjoyed going to these concerts and they enjoyed having us there because they realized that we were interested in the cultural aspect of their life as well as the necessities, the other necessities of life such as eating, clothing and a roof over their heads. </sentence><sentence id="2691">This was a bonus for them. </sentence><sentence id="2692">Here I am again. </sentence><sentence id="2693">Periodically, of course, I inspected the camp and would see to it that they had enough in the warehouses. </sentence><sentence id="2694">We were always, always after enough wood so that we could heat the cauldrons that made the soup which was the mainstay of all the DPs in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2695">We would cut down entire forests in order to get enough wood and here's an example of how we would stockpile it and store it and just, it was as valuable as gold to us. </sentence><sentence id="2696">As we spoke of this before, the camp was run the same way an entire city would be run. </sentence><sentence id="2697">And this is the hospital of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2698">Many of the doctors, I should say that the majority of the doctors, were Polish although they, we would, they would answer to American medical, members in the medical corps of the American army. </sentence><sentence id="2699">And they received wonderful treatment. </sentence><sentence id="2700">Whatever they requisitioned for the hospitals we were able to get. </sentence><sentence id="2701">We would either get it from our own medical supply or we would get it from the German medical supplies but whatever had to be done was done. </sentence><sentence id="2702">Well this is a Polish doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2703">He was a very fine man. </sentence><sentence id="2704">I had occasion to talk him on a few, a few times that I went over to the hospital and of course many of the times when he came into my office to request medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="2705">But he was dedicated and very happy to be able to be a surgeon, to be a doctor again, which he couldn't do under the German thumb. </sentence></p></dialogue>
