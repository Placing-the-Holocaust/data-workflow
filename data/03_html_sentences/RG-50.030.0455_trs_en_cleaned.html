<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: The yellow star, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I didn't have to wear that, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: But how did you get away with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: Because, I -- as a half-Jew or half-Aryan, I didn't have to, it was only full Jews. </sentence><sentence id="300">This wh- whole crazy legislation of 100 percent and 75 percent and 50 percent. </sentence><sentence id="301">I was 50 percent and so I could not be treated like a normal human being, but on the other hand, I was not treated as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="302">I was sort of in-between. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: What -- what did that mean for you, in terms of having friends who were Aryan, who were not Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: They -- I mean, looking back on it now, I am absolutely amazed, because I mean, obviously I was, to a certain extent, probably being watched. </sentence><sentence id="310">But they -- they stayed low and treated me as -- just like a -- very good friends and so I owe a great deal to them. </sentence><sentence id="311">Then, of course, the critical time came in "44, when things were pretty desperate, sort of, in the west and in the east. </sentence><sentence id="312">And at this point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut Organization. </sentence><sentence id="313">The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler's ministers, to be engaged in emergency work, for instance, the building of the Atlantic wall and the repair of bombed railway stations, lines and all that sort of thing, in east and west. </sentence><sentence id="314">So we were not soldiers, but we were sort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens. </sentence><sentence id="315">We didn't wear a uniform, we just wore an armband which said, Tut Organization. </sentence><sentence id="316">And we were made -- made up of people with my background, political prisoners and also minor criminals. </sentence><sentence id="317">A queer mixture of people. </sentence><sentence id="318">And when was it? </sentence><sentence id="319">April "44, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen to her in Dresden. </sentence><sentence id="320">Obviously we had no real contact with my father in England. </sentence><sentence id="321">I didn't know where I was going to land up, they didn't tell us, we were just loaded onto a train in Dresden and eventually we realized that we were on our way to France. </sentence><sentence id="322">And we're then sort of detailed to work on railway sites that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going out -- going off at place-places. </sentence><sentence id="323">And that went on til September -- from April "44 to September "44, Mainly in the Paris area. </sentence><sentence id="324">Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived. </sentence><sentence id="325">And then there were four -- one, two, three, four of us -- five of us, I'm sorry -- who realized that one day this train would be dur -- and this was all during the allies invasion. </sentence><sentence id="326">The allies were sort of advancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to Germany and then of course, what was going to happen then? </sentence><sentence id="327">Especially towards the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="328">We had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="329">So we had determined that if there was the slightest opportunity, we would jump off the train and try to find the French Resistance movement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Could you say that a little louder, I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: Jump off the plane? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: We jumped off the train. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: Train. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: We would jump off the train and try and find the French Resistance Movement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: And eventually in Se -- one day in September "44, we got that opportunity as the train was being pulled back towards Germany. </sentence><sentence id="367">One evening, the five of us jumped off, disappeared in the undergrowth and found some refuge with some French farmers. </sentence><sentence id="368">And we gather that only a day or two later, the whole train was destroyed by British or American fighters. </sentence><sentence id="369">So, we were -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Why do you think the French farmers would have given you refuge, given -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Because we were all part of the French Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="372">And we -- we had said that we -- we'd run away and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="373">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="374">And they believed you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: They believed us, but day or two later, we were being arrested by the official French forces, because they thought we were German spies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: That's what I was thinking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: And they didn't quite know what to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="380">We weren't soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="381">We claimed we were of Jewish origin. </sentence><sentence id="382">And so, at that time there was sort of complete chaos in France. </sentence><sentence id="383">There were refugees from various countries which had been caught up by the Germans and also run away. </sentence><sentence id="384">And we were all taken down to the south of France to be repatriated to our various countries, but of course, they couldn't repatriate us. </sentence><sentence id="385">So we were eventually -- the Jews didn't want us, because we weren't proper Jews. </sentence><sentence id="386">So we -- there was an organization called Free Germany, which was really a -- a Communist organization, we landed up there. </sentence><sentence id="387">And we were indoctrinated to learn about Stalin and Marx and Lenin and all the rest of it. </sentence><sentence id="388">And that was not a very pleasant time and food was very short in France -- in the south of France at the time and there was no heating, terrible winter. </sentence><sentence id="389">But, eventually, I got a job with the American army. </sentence><sentence id="390">And also, about December, I mean post communications were [indecipherable] almost non-existent, but I wrote to the Bishop of Chichester -- Chichester, because that's all I knew, in very halting English, "Sir, I'm Juergen Simonson, I think you know my father. </sentence><sentence id="391">I would like to go to England and be reunited with him." </sentence><sentence id="392">And eventually he got the letter. </sentence><sentence id="393">I got a cable from him to say, "Letter received. </sentence><sentence id="394">I will put you in touch with my -- your father and I'm trying everything with the British Home Office, to get you a visa to England." </sentence><sentence id="395">That was still very difficult for a German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: Why did you pick Bishop Bell? </sentence><sentence id="414">What did you know that made you think -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Because we had the occasional -- there was a Red Cross letter, that you could write every six months, with 25 or 50 words, which really said very little. </sentence><sentence id="418">In addition to that, we were extremely fortunate that we had friends in Switzerland and we could write to them and they in turn could write to my father and vice versa. </sentence><sentence id="419">So, very occasionally, we had some news through them and they had mentioned this link with the Bishop of Chichester. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: And -- and Bishop Bell by this time, had -- he'd been working in the 30's -- am I correct -- with the German church, trying to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="424">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: -- initially get them to speak out against Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="885">Q: Of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: Which of course was for the more privileged Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="889">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: And -- I mean she would have been deported anyway, later on. </sentence><sentence id="892">And what I found in these papers -- this were -- this was all about the disposal of their property and their possessions, because everything went -- went back automatically to the state. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: And what particular branch of the state would have taken that? </sentence><sentence id="896">The Department of Treasury, Commerce, do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="949">A: Well, we -- no, what happened was that my other aunt in Dresden, my father's sister, wa-was also married to an Aryan and she was allowed to send monthly food parcels to my grandmother in Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="950">And I -- again -- only discovered this now, that all they were allowed to write back by way of n -- acknowledgment, was a printed card which said, "Parcel received, we are well." </sentence><sentence id="951">They were not allowed to add any other information. </sentence><sentence id="952">And once that information -- that acknowledgment stopped, we knew that they had gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="957">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="959">A: So probably after a few months, the -- these -- she must have died and my aunt was then moved on to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="960">The awful thing was that in one of these papers from Berlin, I found that the official document says they were -- my grandmother and my aunt were aukershoben, which simply means -- it's -- it's a word that you use for cattle transports. </sentence><sentence id="961">They were just shoved    away. </sentence><sentence id="962">I mean that's how people treated them. </sentence><sentence id="963">That's how they were looked at. </sentence><sentence id="964">Not as human beings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="972">Q: When did your father find out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="974">A: Well, immediately after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="980">Q: It's unbelievable, isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="981">What -- what a -- a funny sense it must have given you, of having been able to survive, when your own family was dying. </sentence><sentence id="982">It's a hard thing to deal with too, isn't it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="986">A: That's right, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="987">And again I've only just sort of realized that had my father not found this diplomat as a sponsor, he probably wouldn't have been able to go. </sentence><sentence id="988">He would have had the yellow star and what happened to all the other Jews, he would have been deported eventually. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="989">And we would have all moved into -- after some time, all the Jews were moved into Jewish quarters, where the Gestapo could kee-keep a close -- watch them. </sentence><sentence id="990">And -- so we would have been -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="991">Q: This in -- this in Dresden? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="992">A: In Dresden, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="994">Q: In Dresden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="996">A: So we would have had to move into Jewish quarters. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1000">A: Yes, that's right, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And so my father probably would have been -- and I wouldn't have had the same protection. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And also, after -- from "42 on, I -- as a mishling now, would no longer be allowed to go to a German school. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I was extremely lucky, really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1008">Q: It's a miracle. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1513">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1514">So I think depends very much on the way it's being interpreted by the church today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1517">Q: And I suppose that really, then, to me, is what the crux of it all was about, that -- that we need to get into our seminaries -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1518">A: Mm, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="1519">Here, here. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1520">Q: -- and teach students how to understand those texts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
