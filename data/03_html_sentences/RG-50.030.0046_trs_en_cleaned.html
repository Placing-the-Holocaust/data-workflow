<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: I was born in Lubochnia, Czechoslovakia, in 1934. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="14">Q: Would you tell me something about your parents, please? </sentence><sentence id="15">Where did they come from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: My mother came -- well, my -- actually, my -- both of my parents came to Czechoslovakia from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="19">They got, came there when Hitler came to power; and I was born there shortly after they got to Czechoslovakia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: Tell me about growing up. </sentence><sentence id="23">Did you grow up there? </sentence><sentence id="24">And your very early years, before the Nazis came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: What little I remember, really, in that period: I grew up in Czechoslovakia, in that town, very uneventfully; a small resort town. </sentence><sentence id="29">From what I remember, what little I remember, a very pleasant environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: You moved at one point. </sentence><sentence id="33">Where did you move to, again, before the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="36">A: Well, we moved from Lubochnia to a town in Slovakia called Zilina(ph). </sentence><sentence id="37">The--my, my father had bought a hotel in, in this town in Czechoslovakia, in Lubochnia. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was a hotel that was designed to be for German political refugees awaiting the fall of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="39">My father thought that Hitler would not last more than four years, and he wanted to be nearby and have his friends there. </sentence><sentence id="40">Well, by, by 1938, very few people could come out of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="41">So the hotel wasn't going very well. </sentence><sentence id="42">And at that point, we left the hotel and moved to Zilina(ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: All right. </sentence><sentence id="51">What happened there, when by 1938, "39? </sentence><sentence id="52">Did things change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: Well, the -- in Slovakia, the Hlinka, Hlinka Guard, which was a fascist group aligned with the Nazis, began harassing Jews and looking for certain people, and my father was one of the people they apparently had on, on some list. </sentence><sentence id="57">It became clear to us that if we didn't leave the  risk -- at least, the risk to my parents -- that the risk was very great. </sentence><sentence id="58">And that at some point, shortly before the German invasion, we tried to cross the border into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="59">It took about a week to cross the border, in, in no-man's-land between Poland and, and Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="60">The last time when we -- in no-man's-land, when we went -- were shipped back to Czechoslovakia, then the Germans were already there, in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="61">And it was curious that it was the Germans who actually helped us get into Poland at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: How do you mean, helped you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Well, the Germans didn't realize who we were. </sentence><sentence id="71">And my father told them that he was Polish, and that the Poles wouldn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="72">And so they actually carried our suitcases and told the Poles that they had to let us in. </sentence><sentence id="73">And that's how we entered Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Okay, Okay. </sentence><sentence id="79">But you entered Poland. </sentence><sentence id="80">And where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, we had political refugee status, my father, and we went to Katowice, in southern -- in Poland, to await our entry, or the right to leave for England. </sentence><sentence id="85">My father had papers that would have allowed him to go to England. </sentence><sentence id="86">We registered in Katowice with the British Consul and waited there until we were supposed to be called up to, to leave for England. </sentence><sentence id="87">And it was really on the day when the Germans moved into, into Poland, on September first that we were supposed to be leaving for England. </sentence><sentence id="88">And we actually left. </sentence><sentence id="89">What happened was that the British Consul -- there were quite a number of refugees in our position -- were put on a train chartered by the British to take us to the, to the Balkans, and hopefully, from there to England. </sentence><sentence id="90">But the plane -- the train -- never got very far; because we were bombed by German planes and had to abandon the train in Poland not, not very far from the Russian border. </sentence><sentence id="91">And at that point, the question was: "What do what do we do next?" </sentence><sentence id="92">My, my father actually went and crossed into, into the Soviet Union, across the Bug River; and came back and decided -- actually, he had crossed over to see whether we should go to the Soviet Union -- crossed over and decided that we weren't going to be much better off there than if we stayed in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="93">So he came back. </sentence><sentence id="94">And we then marched with the refugees on the, on the roads and were actually taken over by German tanks on, on the roads near some village in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="95">After a while, we ended up in a town more or less in central Poland, called Kielce, and eventually ended up in the ghetto of Kielce, and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Tell us -- by then, you are five. </sentence><sentence id="109">Tell us, if you can -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="113">By then, I'm -- yeah, five. </sentence><sentence id="114">Yes, six. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="119">Tell me what you remember of Kielce. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Well, Kielce was, was -- at least from what I remember initially, or maybe in retrospect -- it's often very hard to keep these things apart. </sentence><sentence id="123">I had never se -- Kielce really had a very large  Jewish community, and I've since found out that there were more than twenty thousand Jews in Kielce -- a long tradition. </sentence><sentence id="124">There were a lot of very religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="125">There were Jewish schools and everything -- things I had never seen before in -- in Czechoslovakia, where, where we were. </sentence><sentence id="126">There were -- let me see, what else do I remember from the initial period?There was another language -- two languages, in fact: both Yiddish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="127">Initially -- again, until things, until 1941, "42, things were not all that bad. </sentence><sentence id="128">It was when the when the ghetto was established, all the Jews were herded into one part of the city. </sentence><sentence id="129">Food became very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="130">Housing became very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="131">We lived in, in one room that my father and mother and I shared. </sentence><sentence id="132">And food was very difficult to come by. </sentence><sentence id="133">A lot of, lot of hunger, but still not as serious. </sentence><sentence id="134">There were still a lot of people who lived quite well, who had, had ways of getting food into the, into the ghetto, especially in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="135">Things gradually became harder and harder. </sentence><sentence id="136">And the, the walls were -- protection was built up much heavier than initially. </sentence><sentence id="137">Initially, it was still possible for people to go in and out, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="138">But after a while that became more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="139">Then, of course, in 1942, the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="140">Most of the people in the ghetto -- I would think about some close to 20,000 people -- were shipped to Treblinka," and that included my grandparents as well. </sentence><sentence id="141">That was sort of the first really serious killing experience that, that I had. </sentence><sentence id="142">During -- I should note, though, that in the ghetto itself there were -- ifnot daily, certainly sporadic -- killings going on by Germans of people, German guards of Jews on the street. </sentence><sentence id="143">At the same time, there appeared to be some sort of normalcy that, that reigned, but then in "42, all of that came to an end. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Can you describe the deportation? </sentence><sentence id="168">What did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Well, the, the--one morning we were awakened with screaming and shooting outside -- orders in German: "Everybody out!" </sentence><sentence id="172">And whoever wasn't to be out would be would be shot, and apparently a lot of older people, others who couldn't move, were shot. </sentence><sentence id="173">My father, who was, was a very cool person -- that's sort of the, the memory I have -- wasn't going to move until he had shaved and had time to think what to do. </sentence><sentence id="174">And -- actually that's what saved us because he took a group, he took us and a group of people out and marched us to -- he had been in charge of a shop -- and marched us out to the shop, saying that he had orders to protect the shop and keep the, the people in. </sentence><sentence id="175">And that's -- and safeguard a number of people, about twenty people, protecting the shop. </sentence><sentence id="176">And actually, that's how I was not initially shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="177">The -- we did, however, at the end -- when the, when the Nazis finally caught up with us -- we were all lined up, as everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="178">And you had most of the people marching in, in one direction, and maybe a few hundred people being saved. </sentence><sentence id="179">And we were in that group to : The ghetto was established in April 1941. </sentence><sentence id="180">&gt; This event, which constituted the liquidation of the ghetto, took place from August 20 to August 24, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="181"> end up in another camp, sort of a forced labor camp, also in Kielce. </sentence><sentence id="182">I'm compressing all of this a great deal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: It's okay, we have time, we have time. </sentence><sentence id="197">Can you tell us about the forced labor camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Well, that was basically -- when you, when you think of the ghetto as a substantial section of town, the forced labor camp was basically one street that was surrounded with barbed wire and, and other -- or maybe two streets. </sentence><sentence id="201">And most of the people worked -- were taken out from there to work in various, various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="202">I didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="203">I was there with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="204">And matter of fact, my mother had saved two other children from the--whose, whose parents had --were shipped out in, in "42. </sentence><sentence id="205">Two children had been left, and she took them in. </sentence><sentence id="206">So we ended up then in, in one-half room, I think, with, with two other children yet. </sentence><sentence id="207">And -- but life still, put it -- given what was to follow, was still more or less livable, but very -- under very difficult circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="208">Here the killing increased. </sentence><sentence id="209">Every so often, or anybody tried to escape, there would be executions and beatings and other things. </sentence><sentence id="210">The, the worst thing that happened in that camp was towards the end, when the -- when -- I think it was in, in "43, or the beginning of "44 -- and I'm -- my dates are wrong -- when there was another Selektion", Basically, you know, when people were shipped off to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="211">What happened there was that all the -- they lined us up on a sort of like a playground, and separated all the children, and that became the, the famous massacre of the children in Kielce. </sentence><sentence id="212">I was the only one to survive -- at least of the group that was, was visible. </sentence><sentence id="213">Two other children saved themselves by hiding in the house where the children were taken. </sentence><sentence id="214">But what happened there was that the, the children who were taken out, ended up -- were taken to a cemetery and killed with hand grenades. </sentence><sentence id="215">The Jewish cemetery in, in Kielce; I, I survived that one. </sentence><sentence id="216">That was the worst part in that, that episode. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: How did you survive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Very curious. </sentence><sentence id="237">They had us lined up on the field. </sentence><sentence id="238">The German, the commander of the, of the camp, was standing in the middle making the decision who was going to live and who was going to die, and they pulled tried to pull me out, and my mother and father more or less pulled the other direction. </sentence><sentence id="239">And finally, they -- my mother, my father and I deci -- went up to the German commander; and I said, in German, that I -- to let me live, because I could work. </sentence><sentence id="240">And in German. </sentence><sentence id="241">And I, I think what, what I saw happen in camps a number of times was that they were somehow shocked to find that somebody looked very much like their own children, who spoke the same language the way their own children would speak, was there. </sentence><sentence id="242">They had -- I think they believed a lot of their own propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="243">And he looked at me and 3 Nazi term for the selection of prisoners for transport. </sentence><sentence id="244"> said in German, "Well, let's see," and let me go. </sentence><sentence id="245">The whole thing may have lasted two seconds. </sentence><sentence id="246">And that's how I stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: What happened to you after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Well, after that we ended up in, in a factory, in -- still in Kielce. </sentence><sentence id="262">The surviving people in this group -- I think about two hundred -- were split up, half taken to one factory, another half to another factory. </sentence><sentence id="263">My parents and I ended up in a, in a -- and, incidentally, the two children who were younger than I that we had then died in that also. </sentence><sentence id="264">We, we ended up in a factory where they were making carts for -- wooden carts -- for their Eastern Front. </sentence><sentence id="265">At that point I had a very interesting job and assignment. </sentence><sentence id="266">The feeling was that, that to survive there, it was important to have something to do; and, and I wasn't even 10 years old. </sentence><sentence id="267">So I went to the commander, commander of the German -- of that camp; and told him, asked him whether he needed an errand boy. </sentence><sentence id="268">And he looked at me, and he said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="269">And so basically, my, my job in that, in that camp consisted of sitting outside his door and doing chores that he needed to have done, like getting his bicycle or taking something to one place or another. </sentence><sentence id="270">The, the job had great advantages because I could hear what was going on and could report back, and I could also alert people to his coming because I would be going ahead of him, running, announcing his coming. </sentence><sentence id="271">And so we had the signal that I would signal. </sentence><sentence id="272">He had -- he wore a hat with a feather; and if 1 went like this to people [gesturing], then he was coming. </sentence><sentence id="273">And -- because if people were seen not working, they would be beaten very badly. </sentence><sentence id="274">One interesting episode in that connection is that I could listen to the radio. </sentence><sentence id="275">He would listen to the radio, and I would sit outside, and I could hear. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I heard the, the capture of Mussolini," reported it. </sentence><sentence id="277">Of course, nobody believed me. </sentence><sentence id="278">We had no access to radio or any news. </sentence><sentence id="279">But that was -- and the fact that I worked there actually enabled us to have some food, and my father and mother both worked in that factory. </sentence><sentence id="280">But it was one way of, of surviving, and giving me a cer -- certain amount of protection, as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Did things change at some point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Well, what changed at, at some point was that in 1944 the decision was made, I guess, to ship everybody in that camp to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="304">And we were, we were shipped to Auschwitz." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Can you describe the transport? </sentence><sentence id="308">What was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="311"> " In September 1943. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="312"> . </sentence><sentence id="313">In early August 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: We were in, in open cars, railroad cars--put in. </sentence><sentence id="315">Interestingly enough, the Germans--we, we, of course, everybody was worried; and I remember people asking, "Where are we going?" </sentence><sentence id="316">and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="317">The Germans told us we were being shipped to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="318">And we once -- one believes what one wants to believe, and I suppose for a while we thought that's where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="319">Again, I remember my father saying initially that the direction of the train was going to Germany, and then suddenly it, it changed. </sentence><sentence id="320">And that's when he knew that we were, we were going to someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="321">And he knew then we were going to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="322">Some people jumped out of the train. </sentence><sentence id="323">The way those trains were set up, the, the Germans had machine guns at the end of the, the train, and if anybody jumped out, they would just try to lull the people, and I think a number of people jumped out of the train on the way to -- and I don't know, know whether they were, were hit or not. </sentence><sentence id="324">The, the most memorable thing was to arrive in, in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was, you know, from a child's perspective, it was just like having driven into an insane asylum, with people walking back and forth, doing things. </sentence><sentence id="326">We, we saw a group carrying bricks from one place to another and carrying them back. </sentence><sentence id="327">And we, we expected to be met by machine guns, so we had no idea what the, the arrival in Auschwitz -- apart from, from this total view of people in these prison -- those prison garb carrying, running different ways, with Kapos(r) with sticks. </sentence><sentence id="328">Was, was a certain calm. </sentence><sentence id="329">We arrived. </sentence><sentence id="330">We were, we were lined up and told we were going to go to, to a laundry. </sentence><sentence id="331">Had our hair shaved. </sentence><sentence id="332">At that point, we expected that things would happen as in Treblinka, where we would be immediately executed. </sentence><sentence id="333">What happened was that since our camp, since our transfer came from these two factories in Kielce, it was assumed that everybody there was capable of working. </sentence><sentence id="334">And there was no Selektion. </sentence><sentence id="335">That's really the way I came into Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="336">I would never have -- as a child, would never have gotten in because they would have selected me right out, at my age, at the camp. </sentence><sentence id="337">But there was no Selektion. </sentence><sentence id="338">We actually went through the, the sauna -- and I mean that they shaved our hair, disinfected us, and eventually, tattooed us; but I don't think right at the, at the arrival and sent us to camp. </sentence><sentence id="339">And we ended up -- this is, of course, Auschwitz-Birkenau -- ended up in what used to be the Gypsy camp, and was still known as the Zigeunerlager, the, the "Gypsy camp."" </sentence><sentence id="340">That's how I got to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="369">Describe where you were taken and what you did, what the barrack was like where you lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Well, the barracks were very much like the barracks you see in pictures that one sees. </sentence><sentence id="373">These big three story bunks, very broad, with about ten people fitting into them -- just wooden, wooden boards, very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="374">The first night on arrival, that was, was probably one of the : Overseers (German). </sentence><sentence id="375">7 Birkenau section B-IIe. </sentence><sentence id="376"> worst in, in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who had been collaborators in our camp and had shipped some people to Auschwitz were beaten very badly. </sentence><sentence id="377">So this was by people who had -- whom they had shipped to the camp, who in the meantime themselves had become Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="378">The world never changes. </sentence><sentence id="379">But, that was sort of the first, the first night, that experience. </sentence><sentence id="380">That's, you know, the, the sort of initial thing I remember of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="381">We -- there were some people that I. -- my father knew, who had been shipped out before. </sentence><sentence id="382">There again, my father and some friends thought that the way for me to survive was to try to find something to do. </sentence><sentence id="383">And I went -- or rather, I don't know who went. </sentence><sentence id="384">But at any rate, I managed to get to be the errand boy for the Kapo in the, in the laundry and sau -- I don't know what they called it. </sentence><sentence id="385">A place where people... The wash rooms. </sentence><sentence id="386">And that, again I think, helped because I, I had a certain protection by being there and also knowing when the Selektion process was going to, to happen. </sentence><sentence id="387">Because you could -- in Auschwitz, the Selektion of people, the Selektion out to the crematorium, to the gas chambers would usually happen every six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="388">The Germans, with their efficiency, would never repeat things immediately or do things irregularly. </sentence><sentence id="389">So, you could expect things to happen every four to six weeks, and it usually happened with certain people arriving in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="390">And if you knew that was going to happen and if you were where I was, it gave you a certain amount of protection because you could hide and get out of, out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="391">And that certainly helped me, in some instances, to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: Can you tell me what working in a laundry consisted of? </sentence><sentence id="414">I mean, you survived this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="417">What did you do there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: One of the things that I had to do was to go and fetch gas. </sentence><sentence id="419">Not very often, but I think two or three times -- the same gas that was used for the gassing of people -- this Zyklon C gas(r) --to pick it up, for disinfecting purposes, from the crematorium to the, to the laundry. </sentence><sentence id="420">And that was, and that actually enabled me to go to get out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="421">But basically, just go deliver a piece of paper from one place to another, and hang around. </sentence><sentence id="422">I certainly didn't work very hard. </sentence><sentence id="423">It wasn't, it wasn't a full-time job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: In carrying the gas, did you know that it was the same kind of gas? </sentence><sentence id="431">Did you make a connection? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="434">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="435">You, you couldn't, you couldn't live in, in Birkenau without knowing what the gas was for. </sentence><sentence id="436">You have to visualize it. </sentence><sentence id="437">In the, in the Gypsy camp -- that is to say, in the--each -- there were a number of camps in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="438">They were basically streets with barracks on each side surrounded by barbed wire, and there was Camp D and C and B, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="439">The, the gas chambers and crematories were at one side. </sentence><sentence id="440">You could stand, for example, outside your barracks in my camp, and see the smoke billowing out from the, from 8 Zyklon B.  the crematory. </sentence><sentence id="441">And not only the smoke, and even almost fire, but also the stench that would come out. </sentence><sentence id="442">So you couldn't be in any place in that environment and not know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="443">And, of course, it was close enough almost to hear the screaming of, of people "cause what happened usually, unlike in my case, people would come to Auschwitz at the railroad station, at the -- would be unloaded and there separated -- one group going into the camp, being allowed to go into the camp, and the others going directly to the gas chambers and the, and the crematory. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: Did you watch this often? </sentence><sentence id="456">Were you in a position to see this process? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: You --I could see it. </sentence><sentence id="460">To say that I watched it... You, you couldn't help but know what was going, going on. </sentence><sentence id="461">And as a matter of fact, towards the end, when I was -- at the very end, when the crematory no longer functioned, we were struck at one point that that suddenly there were birds and other things. </sentence><sentence id="462">There, there was nothing before. </sentence><sentence id="463">It was really sort of a, a cloud hanging over the over the place. </sentence><sentence id="464">I was at one point, I was -- later on -- sort of taking the story forward -- I was in a camp that was even closer to the gas chambers and the crematory, where you could really hear the screaming almost on a...on a regular basis. </sentence></p></dialogue>

and they avoided bombing it. </sentence><sentence id="681">As a matter of fact, at night they would drop flares around the camp, in order not to bomb it. </sentence><sentence id="682">And so it was really the safest place nearby. </sentence><sentence id="683">And that, to us, we were beginning to feel that the war, that we were maybe winning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
