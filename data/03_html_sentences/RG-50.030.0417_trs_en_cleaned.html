<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2601">A: None of my friends or acquaintances had running water. </sentence><sentence id="2602">I had one friend that I did not know until after the war who lived in the parsonage of a church and there was running water, but nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="2603">There were houses out in Marysin, where Rumkowski lived, they had running water. </sentence><sentence id="2604">It was the slum of a city. </sentence><sentence id="2605">Running water was not the customary thing to have. </sentence><sentence id="2606">The city also didn't have a sewer system. </sentence><sentence id="2607">The sewage ran between the street and the sidewalk, raw sewage, and you jumped over it as you crossed the street. </sentence><sentence id="2608">There was no underground canalization like for instance in Warsaw or in Paris or in Rome. </sentence><sentence id="2609">It didn't exist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2619">Q: So, the stench must have been unbelievable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2621">A: So, was the typhus -- the stench, the typhus, the summers, the snow and frost in the winter, and people just dumped their buckets and it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2622">It -- you had ceased to care, to observe sanitary conditions or laws. </sentence><sentence id="2623">There was really no way one could solve this problem. </sentence><sentence id="2624">It was -- it was not solvable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2629">Q: So, I'm just trying to get a sense of time. </sentence><sentence id="2630">Those first six weeks, this is the most shocking thing that happens to you -- I mean, other than the shock of the death of your father, but that's a different kind of a shock. </sentence><sentence id="2631">This is a physical as well as a psychological shock to you to be taken to Lodz and to be living under conditions that you've never come -- you've never lived like this. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2657">Q: And, during this, before you moved to Pawia Street, these first four to six weeks, do you see -- you're living with 1,100 people in a very small building. </sentence><sentence id="2658">Do people change a lot? </sentence><sentence id="2659">Do people start fighting with each other? </sentence><sentence id="2660">Do you see things even amongst the three of you where there are changes and it's difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2665">A: It was stressful. </sentence><sentence id="2666">People did argue. " </sentence><sentence id="2667">This was my space and why did you take my space?" </sentence><sentence id="2668">And "take this away and put this there." </sentence><sentence id="2669">It was community living at its worst. </sentence><sentence id="2670">It brought out the very best in very few people. </sentence><sentence id="2671">It brought out the worst in most of us. </sentence><sentence id="2672">And I don't think anybody was really to blame because to come out of the normal life into conditions of deprivation, of inhumanity, dehumanization -- it's indescribable. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2707">A: No, it wasn't harder for her. </sentence><sentence id="2708">She just took it more or less in stride. </sentence><sentence id="2709">She didn't quite understand what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2710">She once asked about the barbed wires or the soldiers with guns. </sentence><sentence id="2711">She remarked once on the lack of a playground. </sentence><sentence id="2712">Or she wanted a little roll with butter and there were no rolls in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2713">But she did not -- it did not have a full impact on her, not at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2741">A: Well, I went throughout the building to see if there was anybody I knew. </sentence><sentence id="2742">I met a couple of classmates, schoolmates. </sentence><sentence id="2743">I looked at the young people who brought the soup, and laid out the portions. </sentence><sentence id="2744">And I was guessing or thinking how does one get a job like that, but I had trouble with the language. </sentence><sentence id="2745">I could understand some of the Yiddish, and Polish I had probably a dozen words, no more. </sentence><sentence id="2746">So, there was no communication. </sentence><sentence id="2747">There was no possibility to make any connection. </sentence><sentence id="2748">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2749">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2750"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2764">A: Over a period of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2766">Q: But not when you came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2768">A: Not when we came. </sentence><sentence id="2769">Later on, there were transports -- several from Berlin, several from Vienna, five from Prague, one from Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="2770">I think there were in excess of 20,000 people brought in from what was called "Western Europe." </sentence><sentence id="2771">At that time, we were told we didn't read it and we didn't hear it, of a speech made by Rumkowski that 20,000 Jews had been brought in from the West and there was neither enough housing for them, and the Germans would make no allowances for it, and there was not enough food for them. </sentence><sentence id="2772">It was considered a tremendous burden on the already existing ghetto population. </sentence><sentence id="2773">And we were very unwelcome. </sentence><sentence id="2774">We were made fun of. </sentence><sentence id="2775">We were the ones from the West, the spoiled ones, the arrogant ones. </sentence><sentence id="2776">And in a way, it was true. </sentence><sentence id="2777">The majority of the German Jews especially, not so much the Czechs, came with the idea, or at least if they didn't come with it, it started within the ghetto, "We will teach them how to do things here, and we will change things in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2778">And we will run the ghetto the way we are used to running things in Germany." </sentence><sentence id="2779">And that turned out to be a big mistake. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2792">Q: Because there was a lot of hostility? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2794">A: There was a lot of hostility, and you can't walk into somebody else's house and turn it upside-down. </sentence><sentence id="2795">And of course, the Polish Jews would not hold still for it, which resulted in the fact that there was no employment for us. </sentence><sentence id="2796">We were by and large disliked. </sentence><sentence id="2797">We were called names, not nasty names, but not flattering names either. </sentence><sentence id="2798">You felt almost like an outcast among your own people. </sentence><sentence id="2799">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2800">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2801"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2811">Q: So, you were in -- it's not the same situation you were in Germany with the Nazis or the German non-Jews against you. </sentence><sentence id="2812">But there's somewhat of a similarity within the context of this horrible situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2815">A: Yes, but I was used to this situation. </sentence><sentence id="2816">I went to a German-Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="2817">And the school had about ten children who had Polish parents. </sentence><sentence id="2818">And when this became known, the parents of the -- of all those students said, "Don't play with those Polish Jews." </sentence><sentence id="2819">So, it was Jew against Jew on the one side. </sentence><sentence id="2820">It was the same again now. </sentence><sentence id="2821">And that, at that very beginning, something told me that you were sitting again between two chairs. </sentence><sentence id="2822">If you want to live here in any way and get work, you have to learn the language - Yiddish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2823">And it was hard; there was no school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2833">Q: So, how did you learn? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2835">A: By listening and by talking. </sentence><sentence id="2836">And I made horrible mistakes but people smiled. </sentence><sentence id="2837">They thought it was very cute that a 16 year old would at least try. </sentence><sentence id="2838">It took me six months and I spoke Polish grammatically incorrect. </sentence><sentence id="2839">I didn't know if two houses were male or female, but it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2840">People found it amusing, and it helped. </sentence><sentence id="2841">It gave me a chance at communication. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2849">Q: And, your mother could speak. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2851">A: My mother was educated and she spoke Polish, and French, and German. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2855">A: She tried at very first, but nobody would hire in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="2856">There was not enough work within the ghetto to fully employ everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2857">Work was not mandatory; it was not considered forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="2858">You worked and you received the noontime soup. </sentence><sentence id="2859">But you didn't have to work if you didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="2860">It afforded you no other privileges. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2877">Q: So, the people who are working are getting noontime soup plus the rations that you are all getting. </sentence><sentence id="2878">And you would cook these rations in your little room -- or try to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2881">A: If we had enough material to hit the little stove because sometimes you got items that weren't even combinable or cookable, but we would try in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="2882">And if you shared a room, and you had a corner for your food supplies or a shelf, it very often happened that by evening something had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2883">Somebody in the room was so hungry, they couldn't resist. </sentence><sentence id="2884">That was very, very common. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2889">Q: So, how quickly did you feel that you were starving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2891">A: I think with -- within two months, maybe two and a half months. </sentence><sentence id="2892">We were definitely starving by the end of the year, before Christmastime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2895">Q: And thirsty, I would imagine, or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2897">A: We did drink the water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2899">Q: You did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2901">A: Yes, that's why we got typhus. </sentence><sentence id="2902">It was really not much else to drink because it was difficult to heat up water, to bring it to a boil, and to make this so-called coffee that we were distributed. </sentence><sentence id="2903">I remember one ration and it was four pounds of salt. </sentence><sentence id="2904">I remember a ration of a half a pound of citric acid. </sentence><sentence id="2905">Citric acid thrown into a pot of raw vegetables makes it boil faster, but what are you going to do with that quantity. </sentence><sentence id="2906">It was a senseless type of distribution, but the food was distributed the way it came into the ghetto from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2907">There were, we heard, other items, but they were in small supply and they went to the elite of the ghetto administration, not to us. </sentence><sentence id="2908">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2909">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2910"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2928">Q: Could you take some of these rations and go to this market -- there was an outdoor market, and try to get some food of some kind, or was there very little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2930">A: Again, during the first six months there was an outside area where you could buy a rotten apple or frozen potato, or whatever anybody else would like to sell. </sentence><sentence id="2931">You could trade. </sentence><sentence id="2932">You could barter, but it was pretty senseless. </sentence><sentence id="2933">You didn't gain much by it. </sentence><sentence id="2934">And the market eventually just closed down for lack of interest and for lack of supplies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2940">Q: So, let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="2941">So, you're in Pawia Street, in the end of November, beginning of December? </sentence><sentence id="2942">Something like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2962">A: Well, starvation takes a strange form. </sentence><sentence id="2963">Your body swells. </sentence><sentence id="2964">Your legs and your feet become double its normal size. </sentence><sentence id="2965">It is difficult to walk. </sentence><sentence id="2966">You can't get into a pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2967">Those are the first signs of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="2968">It does ultimately affect you in other ways, as well. </sentence><sentence id="2969">It is just that the body responds to lack of nourishment. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2992">A: The only thing that I could try is sell whatever of my clothing I did not need or I did not want. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And that I gradually sold for food, but I didn't have much clothing to start out with, and I only had two pair of shoes in not very good condition. </sentence><sentence id="2994">Shoes would have brought a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="2995">The stockings were in such disrepair that the repairs on the back of the heel reached halfway up to the knee. </sentence><sentence id="2996">We kept repairing it with thread because you couldn't buy new ones. </sentence><sentence id="2997">But you could buy a lipstick. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3006">A: The ghetto had a little cosmetic store half a block from Balutaring. </sentence><sentence id="3007">And I guess the lady must have had a cosmetic store before the war, and you could go and buy powder or lipstick, and on the corner was a hairdresser and you could get a permanent if you had the right currency or enough food. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3955">A: This is paperwork. </sentence><sentence id="3956">It has nothing to do with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3957">It's like an audit at the Internal Revenue. </sentence><sentence id="3958">He goes over the figures. </sentence><sentence id="3959">We got forms, let's say, from the city of Berlin, and Mr. Smith lives in an apartment with four other people. </sentence><sentence id="3960">He was entitled to a hundred kilo of coal, and we had to figure that out. </sentence><sentence id="3961">Four times 50 or four times 25 is 100. </sentence><sentence id="3962">Then there is Mr. Joe who has eight people living in his apartment. </sentence><sentence id="3963">Each person gets 25 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="3964">So, we had to come up with the figures, and there were thousands of these forms brought into the ghetto in containers, and we went through box after box doing the clerical work and having them shipped out of the ghetto again to Germany, so they could take the forms, give them to their people, and have them collect the coal. </sentence><sentence id="3965">All we did was clerical work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
