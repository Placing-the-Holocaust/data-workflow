<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: And she did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: She did, because my father worked for her older brother as a salesman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Tell me what growing up with them was like. </sentence><sentence id="76">I know you were born in 1925. </sentence><sentence id="77">So, you don't have to talk about the first couple of years unless you actually have a memory. </sentence><sentence id="78">What was home life like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: It was very predictable. </sentence><sentence id="84">It was very middle class. </sentence><sentence id="85">It was very secure. </sentence><sentence id="86">It was very unpretentious, although there was a maid for the children and a maid for the house, and we went on nice vacation. </sentence><sentence id="87">There were music lessons and English lessons and dancing lessons. </sentence><sentence id="88">But we took it for granted. </sentence><sentence id="89">My parents were rather strict -- strict in terms of schooling, of grades, strict when I didn't practice violin. </sentence><sentence id="90">Children had to be seen but not heard. </sentence><sentence id="91">When my parents discussed personal things or business events, they would speak Polish. </sentence><sentence id="92">I did not understand. </sentence><sentence id="93">When they talked to me and later on to my sister, it was in German. </sentence><sentence id="94">Occasionally, they would speak French, but not very often. </sentence><sentence id="95">It was -- it was a nice childhood. </sentence><sentence id="96">The memories I have until 1933, when I was eight, are warm and they are loving. </sentence><sentence id="97">I really could not fault my parents for anything other than that were really very, very strict and very demanding. </sentence><sentence id="98">It was very important that a report card had an "A", maybe a "B", but anything below that was not acceptable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: What would happen to you if...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Nothing would happen, but there would be reprimand, there would be a conference with the teacher, and after deg33, when the grades slipped considerably, then there was a different tutor every afternoon -- one for German, one for Math, one for English, one for French, and the grades did improve. </sentence><sentence id="119">What my parents did not consider was that the outside world had an influence on children. </sentence><sentence id="120">They told us that things would change. </sentence><sentence id="121">It would not remain this way. </sentence><sentence id="122">The neighbor's children would begin to play with us again. </sentence><sentence id="123">The boys would no longer beat us up on the way to school. </sentence><sentence id="124">It would -- life would normalize. </sentence><sentence id="125">They didn't say exactly when, but they were very reassuring and very convinced that there would be a political change. </sentence><sentence id="126">And my parents, of course, could not vote in German elections. </sentence><sentence id="127">They never became naturalized German citizens. </sentence><sentence id="128">They didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="129">We went to Poland quite frequently to see the family, to see Grandmother, and what I heard in Poland as a very young child was that you, in Germany, are complaining about anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="130">You don't know what it's like in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="131">Your economic conditions do not compare to ours. </sentence><sentence id="132">To me, it did not make sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: You didn't understand what they were saying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="151">I could not comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="152">My grandmother spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="153">She spoke Yiddish to me, and I answered in German, but I really did not comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="154">The family in Poland was well-off, but nothing compared to life in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="155">For instance, the streets in this little town were not -- the streets were dirt streets, and when the peasants were pushing their wagons through the main street of the town, they took their shoes off because it was muddy, and I could see their feet with the -- with the mud oozing through the toes. </sentence><sentence id="156">When we arrived by train in Poland, we were picked up by a cousin with a horse and buggy. </sentence><sentence id="157">Well, I would not go into the buggy -- not with a horse in front of it that was moving. </sentence><sentence id="158">I was used to a black taxi with white stripes. </sentence><sentence id="159">So, these things I remember. </sentence><sentence id="160">I remember them warmly. </sentence><sentence id="161">I -- I remember that, and I appreciate that, I had a part of that culture, because it ended too soon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Your father remained -- he was in the wine business. </sentence><sentence id="175">He was a wine importer. </sentence><sentence id="176">Was he home a great deal, or did he travel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: No, he didn't travel at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: He didn't travel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="185">He had traveling salesman, and he was home continually. </sentence><sentence id="186">He came home for lunch time. </sentence><sentence id="187">He went with us on vacations every summer. </sentence><sentence id="188">It was usually a month or six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="189">How well the business did, I never knew. </sentence><sentence id="190">I was never told. </sentence><sentence id="191">I had a small allowance, probably of 50 cents a month. </sentence><sentence id="192">I didn't need anything, and I was not allowed to buy frivolous items. </sentence><sentence id="193">The clothing for the kids was custom made. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Was that unusual? </sentence><sentence id="205">The middle class that you were- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Middle class and upper-middle class it was custom made, yes. </sentence><sentence id="209">In those days, a man did not buy ready-made suits. </sentence><sentence id="210">There were hardly any. </sentence><sentence id="211">I went to a private Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="212">The teachers were -- at that time -- in their late 50s, and to me terribly old. </sentence><sentence id="213">They were very strict and they were very orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="214">You had to adhere to the rules and regulations. </sentence><sentence id="215">On Saturday, you didn't take a streetcar. </sentence><sentence id="216">You didn't write. </sentence><sentence id="217">You did not carry a purse. </sentence><sentence id="218">You pinned your handkerchief to your jacket. </sentence><sentence id="219">You learned Hebrew, post-modern Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="220">You learned Humash and Gemora and you had to translate. </sentence><sentence id="221">It was mandatory, five days a week. </sentence><sentence id="222">School was not a happy experience. </sentence><sentence id="223">It was very rigid, very regimented, very German in spite of the fact that the teachers were all Jewish, very demanding and it lacked compassion, understanding for the children. </sentence><sentence id="224">We were told going home on the streetcar to stand in the back, to be quiet, not to talk loudly, not to draw attention, and I remember saying one day, "They want us to become invisible. </sentence><sentence id="225">How does one do that?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: And who did you say this to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: I said it both to my parents and to some friends, because I could not understand the restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="248">I could not understand what I had done to deserve the punishment of being beaten up on the street or having stones thrown at me or obscene names. </sentence><sentence id="249">I did not -- I did not realize the impact, and I believed at that point, that it would change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: So, is your memory that 1933 creates a real change for you, when you're eight years old? </sentence><sentence id="254">Is that how your memory- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: It's between "33 and deg36. </sentence><sentence id="258">It was over a three-year period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Let me go back to your parents for just a moment. </sentence><sentence id="262">Did you feel closer to one parent more than another? </sentence><sentence id="263">Or were they both very similar for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: They were very similar both in background, in education, in upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="268">I would say my mother was more reserved. </sentence><sentence id="269">She never contradicted my father. </sentence><sentence id="270">She agreed with all of his decisions. </sentence><sentence id="271">I think I can only recall two times when she disagreed. </sentence><sentence id="272">She came home one day and had cut off her long black hair which was tied to the top of her head, and she came home with a fashionable bob. </sentence><sentence id="273">And the other thing she did -- which was before I was born, but I heard the story -- during the inflation, under the inflation of 1922, she pawned her silver to keep the business afloat, and she did not ask permission. </sentence><sentence id="274">After the business prospered, she of course got it back, but I think during the middle "30s, early "30s, she deferred him in all other decisions. </sentence><sentence id="275">I did not know at that time that my father bought commercial real estate. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was never mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="277">The decision was made between my father and my mother's brother, younger brother, who was an associate, but we had no idea about it. </sentence><sentence id="278">We might have picked up a word or two, but we would have never asked. </sentence><sentence id="279">That wasn't done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: So, when you would sit at lunch -- I assume you ate lunch together with your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: At two o'clock. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: At two o'clock, or dinner, would you -- and after your sister was born and she became a little bit older, she was born in 1930, I think- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Were you supposed to sit there very quietly and they would carry on the conversation, or would people ask you questions about what had happened at school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: There were very few questions at the dinner table. </sentence><sentence id="305">The maid would sometimes bring in a dish or plates, and then the language would immediately switch to Polish. </sentence><sentence id="306">We were asked questions about school, but not necessarily at the dinner table. </sentence><sentence id="307">It was when it came time to do homework, or when you wanted to postpone homework and the answer was, "No, homework first." </sentence><sentence id="308">It was a typical education of the "30s when you had to be within the role of a child, not have the freedom of being light-hearted or joking or tell funny stories. </sentence><sentence id="309">It wasn't done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: But you seem to remember it very fondly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: In spite of the restrictions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Yes because it was very secure. </sentence><sentence id="323">It was very predictable, and it gave us a sense of belonging. </sentence><sentence id="324">It gave us a sense of being cared for. </sentence><sentence id="325">It gave us a sense of never missing anything. </sentence><sentence id="326">Anything that was necessary for a normal life or a satisfactory life was provided. </sentence><sentence id="327">You didn't have to ask for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: Were you happy when Karin was born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Yes, I was delighted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: Did that mean that you had a place, even though she was so much younger, to laugh and be liked? </sentence><sentence id="339">I mean, did it give you something that you hadn't had? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Well, I wanted a sister, and I put a cube of sugar on the windowsill so the stork would come and take the sugar and bring a sister. </sentence><sentence id="343">Yes, we played, even though there was a five-year difference. </sentence><sentence id="344">She was very fast, very bright, and very pretty, and when she started school, I had to listen, "Why can't you behave like your sister? </sentence><sentence id="345">Why can't you be as intelligent as your sister? </sentence><sentence id="346">Why do you have to talk out of turn? </sentence><sentence id="347">Why can't you bring home A's like your sister?" </sentence><sentence id="348">And that was a little difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: So, were you a little bit rebellious in that household? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: Maybe not in the household, but definitely at school. </sentence><sentence id="359">At school, I got into trouble here and there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: How so? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: I would talk out of turn and we organized some pranks for teacher. </sentence><sentence id="365">I could think of putting thumb tacks some place, or put some glue on the chair. </sentence><sentence id="366">Or, when it's later on, when the physics professor said, "Turn the Bunsen burner on low," I turned it on high, and all the windows blew out, and my dad had to pay for new windows. </sentence><sentence id="367">So, I had my share of troubles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Did your parents explain about the Nazis, or simply said there was a change of government? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="374">Did you see things in the street? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: Yes, I saw the uniforms - first the brown uniforms with the red arm bands and the hats, which was called the SA. </sentence><sentence id="376">We saw the children in uniform, young children -- white shirts, brown skirts or trousers, and sort of a brownish necktie. </sentence><sentence id="377">We did not see many other uniforms at that point. </sentence><sentence id="378">The green uniforms came much later. </sentence><sentence id="379">The local police wore greenish uniforms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Wait one second. </sentence><sentence id="386">The noise is really too much. </sentence><sentence id="387">Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: The precinct police wore green uniforms and those silly helmets, but they were separate. </sentence><sentence id="392">Each precinct had a -- each living area had a precinct and it was mandatory that when you moved into an apartment or into a house that you register at the precinct -- name, address, occupation, tax id number, and religion. </sentence><sentence id="393">When you decided to move from A Street to B Street, you went back to the precinct. </sentence><sentence id="394">You told them where you're moving to. </sentence><sentence id="395">You went to the new precinct, and you went through the procedure again. </sentence><sentence id="396">This system still exists in Germany and in France, and this was probably one of the reasons that you could keep tabs on people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: But you clearly experienced a difference in terms of when you said that you felt, on the one hand, you're invisible, on the other hand, people know you're Jewish, and you're receiving all sorts of punishment of one sort or another. </sentence><sentence id="404">So, you're both invisible and not invisible at the same time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="407">A: Well, I was visible, but the adults wanted me to be invisible, not to draw any attention. </sentence><sentence id="408">While, on the other hand, we took the punishment regardless of where we stood, where we walked or what we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="411">Q: And when you would come home having been taunted or beaten up, your parents would know this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: Yes, and could tell it by the dirty clothing because it was soiled from the stones and from the dirt that they threw at us. </sentence><sentence id="414">Sometimes, it would be a black eye. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: So, it was really bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: It got progressively worse. </sentence><sentence id="420">At first it was taunts and remarks, and then it became physical. </sentence><sentence id="421">But they tried to comfort us, but I think, as children, or as growing children, we were afraid and became subsequently more so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: So, you became much more afraid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="429">Q: Ofa lot of things, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: So, did you then retreat into yourself? </sentence><sentence id="434">Did you stay at home more than you used to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="437">A: I stayed at home more, or somebody had to bring me to a friend's house or pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="438">I started to draw and paint a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="439">My grades slipped terribly, and that's when most of my spare time was occupied with tutors. </sentence><sentence id="440">The grades improved, but I don't think the happiness changed or the unhappiness changed. </sentence><sentence id="441">I would have like to leave the country like many of my school friends, but my parents saw no reason to leave because, in their eyes, we were former nationals. </sentence><sentence id="442">We had the protection of another government and we were untouchable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: Did they say this to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="451">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="453">Q: Now, how was Karin, your younger sister, responding? </sentence><sentence id="454">Equally fearfully, or was she- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="459">Q: She wasn't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="461">A: She was not. </sentence><sentence id="462">She was somehow able to ignore it, to shut it out, and she was probably less molested because she was blond and curly-haired at times. </sentence><sentence id="463">I had dark hair. </sentence><sentence id="464">I was older. </sentence><sentence id="465">It did not seem to bother her, or maybe she was so much younger that she did not get the impact from the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="466">She grew into it. </sentence><sentence id="467">When she started school in *35, this is the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="468">It hadn't just changed overnight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="477">Q: Did you talk with her, once she started school? </sentence><sentence id="478">Did you talk about what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: No, I never did. </sentence><sentence id="482">We talked about the teachers. </sentence><sentence id="483">We talked about grades. </sentence><sentence id="484">We did silly things. </sentence><sentence id="485">We would hide things or play tricks on our parents, or when my mother was looking for a pair of shoes, and one shoe was missing. </sentence><sentence id="486">We shared a room. </sentence><sentence id="487">The two beds were divided. </sentence><sentence id="488">In the middle was a big wardrobe. </sentence><sentence id="489">We had dolls and dolls" carriages, and we played like normal children in a home. </sentence><sentence id="490">She had her friends. </sentence><sentence id="491">I had mine. </sentence><sentence id="492">But as we grew older, there was less interaction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="505">Q: How did your fears affect you, besides the grades? </sentence><sentence id="506">Were you able to sleep? </sentence><sentence id="507">Was it disturbed sleep? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="511">A: I was dreaming a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="512">When my parents would go in the evening to a concert or to the theater, to the opera, and the maid would stay with us, they normally took a streetcar or taxi. </sentence><sentence id="513">I would not sleep until they got home, and it was sometimes one o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="514">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="515">It was just fear -- fear of something that I could not verbalize. </sentence><sentence id="516">I thought maybe the streetcar would crash, or the taxi would have an accident. </sentence><sentence id="517">There was no coherent explanation of why this terrible fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="525">Q: Did it affect your eating? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="527">A: Yes, I was a very poor eater, and the school doctor recommended that I go for summer vacation to a children's home so I could recuperate a little bit, and my father had to convince them that we went on vacation every year, and it was, you know, there was no shortage of food, and they didn't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="528">And I never did go. </sentence><sentence id="529">I would not go away from home alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="533">Q: Do you think your personality changed as you were by yourself a little bit more and you're painting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="535">A: No, I don't think at that point, not at that point, probably later, but not at that point. </sentence><sentence id="536">The change that I remember took place in 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: When your father is- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="620">Q: Although you had it in your head? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="646">Q: So, in "37, you don't leave the apartment, you stay there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="648">A: Towards the end of "37, we lived in a condominium, and the whole complex -- and the street is still standing -- made it clear that the six or seven Jewish families who occupied I would say a total of probably a hundred condominiums, they were no longer desired, and would we please sell our interest and move. </sentence><sentence id="649">And we moved to another apartment that was owned by a Jewish attorney in a not-so-nice area, but acceptable area, and all I remember of that apartment is that it had a tiny little orthodox synagogue in the backyard. </sentence><sentence id="650">We never went there, but there was one, probably a hundred members at the most. </sentence><sentence id="651">The other thing I remember is that on November 10" or 11", we had a knock on the door at four in the morning, and there was my mother's brother and his son and his wife, and they had spent the night in a train from Cottbus to come to Hamburg to escape the arrest of all males which took place on the 10" of November. </sentence><sentence id="652">So, they were hiding out in that apartment for a couple of weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="658">Q: But that's after your father's gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: My father was already in Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: Now, let me ask you something that I forgot to ask you about. </sentence><sentence id="663">Was yours a religious home in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="666">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="667">It was religious because both my families came from an orthodox home. </sentence><sentence id="668">All the laws were observed. </sentence><sentence id="669">There were some rabbis in the family on my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="670">My grandmother wore a wig, and I found that very amusing because she would lift it like you lift a cover on a pot of potatoes, and then she'd put it back. </sentence><sentence id="671">And -- but when my parents came to Germany, they somewhat -- they became somewhat more liberal. </sentence><sentence id="672">The congregation they belonged to we would call today "conservative" rather than "orthodox". </sentence><sentence id="673">The home had separate dishes. </sentence><sentence id="674">Kashrut was observed, but I would say looking back probably not a hundred percent, only 80 percent, but as far as school was concerned, it was very orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="675">So, they tried not to upset me with giving me two sets of values -- the more liberal value at home and the orthodox value at school, but yes, it was a religious household. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="686">Q: And that was comfortable for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="688">A: Inever questioned it. </sentence><sentence id="689">It was customary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: And were most of your friends orthodox, as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: Okay, let's go back up to "37-"38. </sentence><sentence id="697">How is it that your father is taken? </sentence><sentence id="698">Does he receive a notice? </sentence><sentence id="699">Does someone come to the door and say, "You're a Polish national"? </sentence><sentence id="700">And why aren't you all sent out, why only your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="706">A: The Polish Consul in Hamburg was supplied -- was supposed to supply a stamp or a validation on all Polish passports, those of Jews and non-Jews, except there happened to be no non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="707">But, for some reason, he refused. </sentence><sentence id="708">Whether the reasons were anti-Semitic or not, he refused, and I only know of one or two cases where bribery worked, which was very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="709">The moment he refused to validate the passports, the Germans said, "You're no longer a valid foreign national living on German ground." </sentence><sentence id="710">At five-of-one in the morning, they rounded up -- they came to our door. </sentence><sentence id="711">They rang the bell, and it was local police. </sentence><sentence id="712">And they said, "You have to come with me because of the matter of the stamps, and we take you to a schoolyard downtown." </sentence><sentence id="713">And my father said, "My wife just had surgery three months ago. </sentence><sentence id="714">Can she stay with the children?" </sentence><sentence id="715">And my sister and I stood in the hallway and listened, and since he was a local policeman, he said, "All right. </sentence><sentence id="716">You come with me, and I let the family stay." </sentence><sentence id="717">By afternoon, we heard by phone that this was done throughout the city, and they had rounded up several thousand people, or maybe in Hamburg alone it was not quite as much, and that they were held in a schoolyard, and somebody suggested that we bring my father a suitcase with some clothing. </sentence><sentence id="718">But they also said for my mother not to go because they would keep her. </sentence><sentence id="719">She packed a suitcase and I insisted to take it down. </sentence><sentence id="720">It was heavy. </sentence><sentence id="721">I took public transportation. </sentence><sentence id="722">I took the subway -- the underground and the above-ground, and I dragged that suitcase all the way down to the schoolyard. </sentence><sentence id="723">The gate was open and I started looking for my father, but there were a great many people -- men, women and children, and he found me. </sentence><sentence id="724">I gave him the suitcase, and I remember distinctly saying to him, "Come home with me. </sentence><sentence id="725">The gate is open. </sentence><sentence id="726">There is no guard. </sentence><sentence id="727">There are no people. </sentence><sentence id="728">Just come home and we'll hide, or something." </sentence><sentence id="729">And my father looked at me and he said, "That wouldn't be the honorable thing to do." </sentence><sentence id="730">I did not understand what he meant, but my father played by the tules. </sentence><sentence id="731">When the law was published that you were not allowed to have foreign currency or to have currency in a foreign country, my father took the money that was in Holland and brought it back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="732">So, you played by the rules, which I learned many years later that you don't have to. </sentence><sentence id="733">He could have just walked out. </sentence><sentence id="734">Nobody would have said a thing, and some people did, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="735">He was pushed over the border. </sentence><sentence id="736">The Poles pushed back, and the Germans pushed him in. </sentence><sentence id="737">They got to Zbaszyn, from Zbaszyn he went to Posen. </sentence><sentence id="738">He stayed there two months. </sentence><sentence id="739">He tried to come back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="740">He couldn't get an entry visa, and he went to Sambor, to mother's family, and he stayed there until May 1940, no 1939, excuse me, when he got permission to come back for four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="741">In the meantime, my mother decided to liquidate the household and to ship all that was contained in an eight-room apartment in huge containers to Palestine, to my father's brother. </sentence><sentence id="742">She handled the shipping. </sentence><sentence id="743">She handled the packing. </sentence><sentence id="744">She handled the Gestapo who came to watch, and tried to approve every single item that went out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="745">She put a bottle of wine and two glasses on the table, and she refilled it with two or three more bottles, and they drank a great deal and we packed fast. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="788">Q: Who drank? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="790">A: The two Gestapo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="792">Q: The two Gestapo, not your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="795">She just talked to the packers, "Hurry up, pack." </sentence><sentence id="796">We did not take anything of any particular value, just the furniture, clothing, linens and silverware, jewelry -- whatever we normally had in the apartment, but the faster the better. </sentence><sentence id="797">The two crates were packed. </sentence><sentence id="798">They were picked-up, and they were shipped to Trieste. </sentence><sentence id="799">We, in the meantime, had to give up under new German laws the apartment and we were assigned to a room on Werder Street Five. </sentence><sentence id="800">In the meantime, my father was granted permission and he came back. </sentence><sentence id="801">I think the permission partly was through the intervention of my mother who hounded the Gestapo in the Staathaus in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="802">She wrote. </sentence><sentence id="803">She went in. </sentence><sentence id="804">She talked to them. </sentence><sentence id="805">They threatened with arrest. </sentence><sentence id="806">She didn't give up. </sentence><sentence id="807">I never thought that a quiet, reserved woman would do what she did, and it absolutely amazed me. </sentence><sentence id="808">When my father came back, we started to work on an affidavit for the United States, and it certificate for Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="809">The four weeks ran out. </sentence><sentence id="810">My mother got an extension for another four weeks, and another four weeks, and one morning, on September 1*, the doorbell rang at five in the morning, six in the morning, and two men appeared with hats and long, black leather coats, and it was September. </sentence><sentence id="811">It was warm. </sentence><sentence id="812">And they asked for my father, and they said that Germany is at war with Poland. </sentence><sentence id="813">We have invaded Poland. </sentence><sentence id="814">You are an enemy alien, and you have to come with us. </sentence><sentence id="815">And that was the first day of the Second World War. </sentence><sentence id="816">He was first sent to a prison in Fuhlsbiittel, which later became a concentration camp, and we were still allowed to bring every week a briefcase with laundry and take home a briefcase with dirty laundry for about two or three weeks, but Poland lost the war for all intents and purposes within two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="817">They had pockets of resistance, but not of war, and the moment that became a fact, my father was transported to Berlin to Oranienburg, to Sachsenhausen, and the mail stopped coming. </sentence><sentence id="818">It was sort of an aerogram with one sentence: "T'm fine. </sentence><sentence id="819">I hope you are fine. </sentence><sentence id="820">Love, Ben." </sentence><sentence id="821">These letters became less and less frequent, until one arrived from Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="822">We had never heard of the place. </sentence><sentence id="823">My mother made, I would say, twice monthly trips to the Gestapo in Hamburg, in the Stathaus, pleading for release, trying to work for an exit visa, trying to work towards immigration papers, anyplace, writing a letter every week to the head of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="824">The end result was that they brought my father to Gestapo headquarters for an hour's visit. </sentence><sentence id="825">He had on a grey and blue striped prison uniform and matching cap. </sentence><sentence id="826">We were sitting on opposite sides of the table, no touching. </sentence><sentence id="827">We talked but nobody could talk. </sentence><sentence id="828">My mother assured him she would try. </sentence><sentence id="829">It was a Catch-22. </sentence><sentence id="830">To go to Shanghai, you had to have 400 American dollars, but you weren't allowed to have American currencies, and we had nobody who would give it to us. </sentence><sentence id="831">Our accounts had been blocked. </sentence><sentence id="832">Our money had been confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="833">We got a hundred dollars a month allowance to live on, no more. </sentence><sentence id="834">We had to move to the apartment next door, number seven. </sentence><sentence id="835">I still went to school. </sentence><sentence id="836">My sister still went to school. </sentence><sentence id="837">We went to the Jewish Community Council, who was headed at that time by a Doctor Plaut (ph). </sentence><sentence id="838">Doctor Plaut at that time was a man in his early 50s. </sentence><sentence id="839">He was unmarried. </sentence><sentence id="840">You had to wait for an audience, like you wait for the pope. </sentence><sentence id="841">We pleaded for papers because it was an emergency because somebody was sitting in a concentration camp, and he shrugged his shoulders and he said there was nothing he could do, but he became very well known for the fact that you could buy favors, but that was 1939, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="842">We heard rumors. </sentence><sentence id="843">He married a very much younger woman with two young children, and he remained, as I'm told, in Germany and was exchanged for a German I believe in Yugoslavia, pretty much into the war "43-"44. </sentence><sentence id="844">He ended up in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="845">My father remained in Dachau and one man was released, and he had papers, first for Italy and then for Palestine, and my mother and I went to see him one evening after curfew, and we saw this six foot tall man who was a skeleton -- no front teeth, shaven head -- and when my mother asked him, "How is Benno?" </sentence><sentence id="846">He said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="847">He managed to leave Germany with his wife and two children, and he promised to help once he would be outside. </sentence><sentence id="848">Going back to 39, when my father returned from Poland, he talked to the Italian Consul and they were on friendly terms, and he offered my father a three-day visa to Italy, and my father said, "And what do I do after the three days?" </sentence><sentence id="849">And being Italian the man said, "Go, and worry later." </sentence><sentence id="850">My father wouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="851">He was murdered in Dachau in February 1941. </sentence><sentence id="852">The Gestapo did something that the very rarely did. </sentence><sentence id="853">They brought us a cigar boxes with ashes. </sentence><sentence id="854">Whose ashes? </sentence><sentence id="855">We will never know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="944">Q: You just stood there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="946">A: Ijust--I couldn't comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="947">First of all, I didn't know what cremation was. </sentence><sentence id="948">I had never been to a cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="949">I didn't know what ashes meant at this point. </sentence><sentence id="950">It was a concept that was not within the Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="951">So, it took minutes or -- I don't know how long it took to really comprehend what it was. </sentence><sentence id="952">Somebody called the chief rabbi, which was Josef Carlebach, and it was an orthodox burial although it was not in accordance with law. </sentence><sentence id="953">And we never found out whether those are really his ashes. </sentence><sentence id="954">The body -- the ashes were buried in the Jewish cemetery in Hamburg, and we managed to save some money and give it to a non-Jewish business acquaintance to set a stone, and the stone still stands. </sentence><sentence id="955">We lived in this apartment until Fall 41, when we received notification for resettlement, and all it said was "East" nothing else. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1082">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Now, during this period, before your father returns for that month and then another four weeks and another four weeks, the money that you have as far as you know is the same amount that you have had before. </sentence><sentence id="1084">They haven't confiscated the money yet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1088">A: No, they didn't get around to that yet. </sentence><sentence id="1089">That only happened after the 1*" of September when Poland was invaded. </sentence><sentence id="1090">Until that time, we had free access to bank accounts, to anything within Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1094">Q: Right, and your mother didn't move money some place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1096">A: No, it was unthinkable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1098">Q: Unthinkable to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1100">A: It was unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I know sufficient people moved it to Switzerland or to Holland or -- no, it just was illegal, and you didn't do things illegal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1104">Q: Right, and you're smiling. </sentence><sentence id="1105">When your father is taken the second time, does this feel more ominous to you? </sentence><sentence id="1106">You're older now of course and you do- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: No, it did not, because he was treated for the first two weeks under the Geneva Conventions as an enemy alien, and believing, or having learned about the Geneva Conventions, I mean, after all it couldn't be bad. </sentence><sentence id="1111">You could bring laundry once a week, and pick up laundry once a week, and do the same over again. </sentence><sentence id="1112">And I don't think we even contemplated the end of the war or Poland losing the war. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I think we naively anticipated a settlement, international intervention, or something of that sort. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1119">Q: So, when did you start to worry? </sentence><sentence id="1120">When he's taken out to Oranienburg? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1123">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Once they shipped him to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg, and Dachau, then we began to realize that there is a concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1127">Q: Did you expect him to return in your head or were you pessimistic? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1129">A: My mother did. </sentence><sentence id="1130">I did not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1133">Q: And how do you know she did? </sentence><sentence id="1134">She said it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1137">A: She talked about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1139">Q: And you never said to her...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1141">A: No, because there were other men taken at the same time, I either knew their sons or their daughters, and several of them perished or were murdered, and I did not believe that there was escaping Dachau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1143">Q: And now the money is...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1145">A: Blocked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1147">Q: Blocked. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And you get a hundred dollars a month from where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1151">A: Out of our account administered by the Deutsche Bank. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1153">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1155">A: And by the Gestapo, under supervision of the Gestapo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1157">Q: So, life is getting narrower and tighter and harder for everyone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1159">A: Very hard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1161">Q: We should take a break now, the tape is running out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1163"> End of Tape 1 Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1166">Q: Once your father is taken away and ends up in Dachau, and your mother is now again the head of the household, because I imagine when he returned even for those 12 weeks, he became head of the household again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1168">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1170">Q: So, then it comes back to her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1172">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1174">Q: And her spirits keep up because she's fighting to try to get him back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1176">A: Yes, because our neighbor next door had a typewriter, Mr. Berman, and he would write the weekly letters to the Gestapo to release my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1178">Q: And she would dictate them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1180">A: Well, she would tell him what to write, and she would sign them and either deliver them or mail them week after week. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1182">Q: Now, you're old enough to notice some changes. </sentence><sentence id="1183">When your father comes back, does she change? </sentence><sentence id="1184">Does her personality seem to change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1188">A: A little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Not entirely to what it was before. </sentence><sentence id="1190">She was very reassuring that the certificate from Palestine would come. </sentence><sentence id="1191">She was very supportive. </sentence><sentence id="1192">But any initiation, any discussion, any plans were made by my father, and she agreed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1198">Q: She agreed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1200">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1202">Q: So, he didn't change very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1204">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1206">Q: That you noticed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1208">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1210">Q: When you saw him when he had been taken the second time, you saw him in the prison, and then you saw him later, did he change significantly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1212">A: He lost a lot of weight. </sentence><sentence id="1213">He was always slim, but not gaunt, and he was gray. </sentence><sentence id="1214">His skin was gray and gaunt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1218">Q: Did that frighten you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1220">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1222">Q: So, it must have been tough when you folks left him and you go back with the memory of what he was looking like and where it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1224">A: Yes, but we still believed there was a chance to get him released. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1226">Q: Would little Karin go with you, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1228">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: She was by then eight, nine -- nine years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1234">Q: Right, so you would all go together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1236">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1238">The building where we saw him still stands. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And when I come to the corner, I cross the street. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I just don't want to walk past it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1246">Q: What was the funeral like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1248">A: The funeral was small because there were few people left. </sentence><sentence id="1249">It was like all the orthodox funerals. </sentence><sentence id="1250">It was a plain, pine coffin. </sentence><sentence id="1251">The rabbi cut the lapels of the coat, and I really don't remember much. </sentence><sentence id="1252">It was an open grave. </sentence><sentence id="1253">There was a seven-day shiva. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1260">Q: There was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1262">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1263">There was really nothing to say because there were so few Jews left or so few Jews willing to come out to the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1264">There was a minion. </sentence><sentence id="1265">There were some visitors to the house during the week. </sentence><sentence id="1266">It didn't seem real. </sentence><sentence id="1267">It seemed like you had seen a film, but it really didn't happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1274">Q: Did you notice a change in your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1276">A: Yes, she was very withdrawn, very quiet, very disinterested in the daily routine. </sentence><sentence id="1277">We had to shop in special stores, food stores. </sentence><sentence id="1278">The food coupons had a "J" on them. </sentence><sentence id="1279">The rations were, of course, smaller. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And she, in a way, sent me out to do the errands. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1286">Q: So, did you then have to take more responsibility in the family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1288">A: Yes, I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1290">Q: Did you understand that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1292">A: Yes, I understood it to the extent that I went to the largest department store who, before the 9" of November was Jewish but no longer, and I said I could sew. </sentence><sentence id="1293">Could they give me dresses to sew at night? </sentence><sentence id="1294">And they said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1295">And they gave me the design -- a plain shirt top with a pleated skirt. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And I was sewing at night after school. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I was sewing on Saturdays, and my mother didn't say a word that you don't sew on Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And I got paid once a week in a little brown envelope, and after six weeks the lady in charge said, "The skirts are crooked and the sleeves are backwards and the collar doesn't close. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1300">We can't use you." </sentence><sentence id="1301">I mean, I was -- I had taken a course in school, but I was not a seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="1302">I was 16 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1314">Q: But, you certainly were trying, weren't you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1316">A: I was trying. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1318">Q: Were you disappointed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1320">A: Yes, I was heartbroken. </sentence><sentence id="1321">I was later on told by a lady that I should have tried in the infants department. </sentence><sentence id="1322">It would have been so much easier, but that of course had never dawned on me, and by then you couldn't get jobs for anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1326">Q: And how was Karin during this period? </sentence><sentence id="1327">Did she understand that your father is gone forever? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1330">A: She understood, but on a different level. </sentence><sentence id="1331">She also came with Scarlet Fever during that time, and she had to be put into a public hospital behind a fence. </sentence><sentence id="1332">We could talk to her through the fence, but it was highly contagious. </sentence><sentence id="1333">In those days, there was no medication. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And after six weeks she came back home. </sentence><sentence id="1335">She understood that he was gone, but she didn't understand for how long, or why, or how permanent it would be. </sentence><sentence id="1336">That came later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1344">Q: And did she ask you where he was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: No, she didn't ask because she was at the funeral. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1348">Q: So, she knew in some ways? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1350">A: She knew on some level that there was a grave and there was something in the grave. </sentence><sentence id="1351">She did not understand about the ashes. </sentence><sentence id="1352">Why would a human being become ashes? </sentence><sentence id="1353">That did not make sense at all, and I couldn't explain it. </sentence><sentence id="1354">I just couldn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1360">Q: This is a strange question I just thought of, but I'm going to ask it anyway -- did they put the cigar box into the coffin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1362">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1364">Q: Just as it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1366">A: That's Hallakik (ph) Law, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1367">I mean, cremation is not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1368">You don't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1369">And they did not know how to handle it because I don't think the rabbi, who was probably in his 60s, had ever had any experience. </sentence><sentence id="1370">He was a very learned man, and he made the decision and he said he would defend it and if necessary, and the box, the way we received it with a rubber band, was put into the coffin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1377">Q: So, that was- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1379">A: That was February 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1381">Q: So, you go from February "41 until October 21" when you get the notification. </sentence><sentence id="1382">So, you're not working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1385">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1387">Q: Your mother's not working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1389">A: But I'm going to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1391">Q: But you're going to school the whole time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1393">A: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1395">Q: And your mother gets more and more reserved and withdrawn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1397">A: Withdrawn, quiet, resigned probably is the proper word for it. </sentence><sentence id="1398">She still talked to people. </sentence><sentence id="1399">We still occasionally saw an old family friend, but there was no -- no joy. </sentence><sentence id="1400">There was no laughter. </sentence><sentence id="1401">There was no -- there was no plan for any kind of a future. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1407">Q: So, when you would eat together whatever the very small amounts of food you had, conversation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1409">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1411">Q: It was always quiet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1413">A: Quiet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1415">Q: And did you play with friends still? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1417">A: Yes, I still had friends. </sentence><sentence id="1418">There was still a youth organization. </sentence><sentence id="1419">There was still a so-called "House of Culture" for Jews, and there were films; sometimes there were ping- pong games. </sentence><sentence id="1420">I belonged to Bar Kochba. </sentence><sentence id="1421">There were even dance classes. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And I went dancing with the son of Rabbi Callabah (sp) who was a Hassidic Jew in New York. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1429">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1431">A: But he used to dance, when we were 13. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1433">Q: So, do you recall any moments of pleasure during that period. </sentence><sentence id="1434">I mean, were these kinds of things in some sense a relief? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1437">A: No, they were a relief, and there were moments when you just lived that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1438">You did not think about it, but when you went to them, you felt guilty, and yet the following week, you went back again. </sentence><sentence id="1439">You probably -- I probably knew that this was not the thing to do, but I did it. </sentence><sentence id="1440">There were light moments. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They were cheering when Bar Kochba won the ping-pong game. </sentence><sentence id="1442">I remember my old fashioned record player the Andrew Sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1443">I remember some American jazz, which was not permitted, but for five dollars you could have a copy made on a wax platter. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So, we learned to dance swing, which was the latest rage. </sentence><sentence id="1445">There were even fashion trends. </sentence><sentence id="1446">The boys would wear trench coats and those sloppy hats with the wide brim. </sentence><sentence id="1447">The girls would wear pleated skirts and thick rubber soles, white or beige rubber soles. </sentence><sentence id="1448">That was the style. </sentence><sentence id="1449">Stockings were no longer available so you painted your legs and you put a black line on the back. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Silk stockings were unobtainable. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And if you had a pair, you had them forever repaired. </sentence><sentence id="1452">Clothing coupons Jews did not get. </sentence><sentence id="1453">If there was clothing available in the store, we couldn't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="1454">The children or the young people did not mind. </sentence><sentence id="1455">It wasn't that important. </sentence><sentence id="1456">What was important was to be with other young people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1477">Q: Did your mother not want you to go, or she didn't say anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1479">A: She didn't say anything, but they -- I had the impression that she felt that it showed disrespect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1481">Q: That it would show disrespect to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1483">A: To the year of mourning for my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1485">Q: Isee, but you obviously were not going to respond to that somehow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1487">A: She did not say so. </sentence><sentence id="1488">She did request that we observe the first 30 days, and after that she did not say anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1491">Q: And, when you were with young people, I imagine you talked about what was going on in some way, or am I wrong? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1493">A: We talked about those people that had good chances of leaving -- how, when, where, by what means. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Do you take a boat to Shanghai or do you take the overland railroad? </sentence><sentence id="1495">We talked about Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1496">We talked about the small groups that were smuggled into Yugoslavia and that made it as far as the Mediterranean and then swam into Haifa, and they were put in Turkey prison. </sentence><sentence id="1497">We knew of course that England was heavily involved in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1498">We were being bombed during that time. </sentence><sentence id="1499">We had to go into air raid shelters, and Jews had to be in one corner. </sentence><sentence id="1500">Not that there were many. </sentence><sentence id="1501">But I think we were fairly aware of the fact that England couldn't possibly win the war. </sentence><sentence id="1502">It was too small a country, too far away, and there was no more Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1503">There was no more Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1504">There was no more Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1505">Holland was overrun. </sentence><sentence id="1506">We did not see any hope. </sentence><sentence id="1507">There was talk of Madagascar, of settling us in Madagascar, and then it turned out it was a joke. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1523">Q: And how did you hear about Madagascar? </sentence><sentence id="1524">From the other kids? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1527">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Iremember my mother going to Berlin when Molotov was in Berlin and signed the agreement with Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1529">The reason for my mother going was that the city of Sombor became Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1530">It was the first town on the Russian border. </sentence><sentence id="1531">And she thought that by going to Berlin maybe she could get a temporary passport, or maybe there would be a possibility to go there --all sorts of unreal schemes, but you tried anything. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And I remember the visit to Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1540">Q: You went with her or no? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1542">A: I went along and we had to stay with a girlfriend of an old acquaintance of the family because you couldn't stay in a hotel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1544">Q: Was that an expensive trip? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1546">A: No, you went by rail. </sentence><sentence id="1547">It took four hours. </sentence><sentence id="1548">We went third class because a) we didn't have the money, and b) you're less conspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="1549">I remember when we used to travel to Poland, we traveled first class and the upholstery was red plush and it itched when you sat on it, and at night the porter would make our beds. </sentence><sentence id="1550">So, the Berlin trip was quite different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1556">Q: Do you still have a radio in your house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1558">A: There was a radio in the apartment and a telephone, and I think the radio and the telephone belonged to Mr. Berman because he had privileges by reason of an intermarriage, and two sons -- | think they even were on the Wehrmacht, if I'm not mistaken, later in the war, and so he had the privilege of radio, but it was not a short wave. </sentence><sentence id="1559">It was just local stations. </sentence><sentence id="1560">And I think he had a telephone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1564">Q: Did you ever hear Hitler speaking on the radio? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1566">A: Yes, many times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1568">Q: Many times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1570">A: Leven saw him once. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1572">Q: Where did you see him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1574">A: We went downtown, and that was in the mid "30s, into the district where all the department stores were like a small Fifth Avenue. </sentence><sentence id="1575">And all of a sudden, the SS and the SR were pushing the people from the sidewalk facing the street on both sides, and a motorcade appeared, open, and Hitler was standing with his right arm raised, looking right, looking left, and everybody raised their right arm. </sentence><sentence id="1576">And I stood in front of my mother --she was a little bit taller than I -- and she put her right arm on my head instead of raising it over me. </sentence><sentence id="1577">She put it on my head. </sentence><sentence id="1578">We were afraid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1585">Q: And what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1587">A: Ijust sort of squeezed in between the other young people. </sentence><sentence id="1588">I just, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1589">I was petrified. </sentence><sentence id="1590">I heard him speak many times, or rave, it was not speaking, but that's the only time I saw him. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2140">Q: Why do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2142">A: Well, first of all, I had to give up the instrument itself, which was not a Stradivarius, but it was a good instrument. </sentence><sentence id="2143">And something about the orchestra -- two of my friends played in it in Auschwitz -- made me decide not to go back to it. </sentence><sentence id="2144">I also would never buy a pair of boots. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Boots became very fashionable a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="2146">I can't buy a pair of boots, but that's another story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2160">Q: When you think of the first moment that you got off the train, what did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2162">A: I saw the German soldiers lined up. </sentence><sentence id="2163">The railroad cars were opened. </sentence><sentence id="2164">We were ordered to come out. </sentence><sentence id="2165">We were ordered to line up in rows of five, and we saw a whole group of men in black jackets, black trouser, a black hat with an orange band, an orange arm band with the Star of David, and on their jackets were also yellow stars. </sentence><sentence id="2166">The Germans handed us over to these men. </sentence><sentence id="2167">The name given to them was "ghetto police". </sentence><sentence id="2168">The ground was sandy. </sentence><sentence id="2169">It was dirty. </sentence><sentence id="2170">It was not a railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="2171">We saw a wagon drawn by two horses and our suitcases were thrown on that wagon. </sentence><sentence id="2172">The Germans went back into the trains, and the ghetto police explained to us -- mostly in Polish, and hardly anybody spoke Polish -- that we had to walk into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2173">My mother, who stood next to me, asked the first available policeman in Polish, "Where are we? </sentence><sentence id="2174">What is the ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="2175">What's going on?" </sentence><sentence id="2176">And on the hour and a half or two-hour walk, and it was very warm and there were many elderly people, he explained to my mother that it was the city of Lodz, which was familiar to her. </sentence><sentence id="2177">It was the ghetto, which was an area that was totally enclosed. </sentence><sentence id="2178">And as we kept on walking, we saw people that didn't look at us. </sentence><sentence id="2179">They looked ragged. </sentence><sentence id="2180">They looked tired. </sentence><sentence id="2181">They looked ill-fed and ill-dressed. </sentence><sentence id="2182">And we saw buildings that were dilapidated. </sentence><sentence id="2183">Some were -- some streets were paved; others were not. </sentence><sentence id="2184">We saw no vehicles. </sentence><sentence id="2185">We saw no automobiles. </sentence><sentence id="2186">We saw no trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2187">But he explained to my mother, and she translated, that the ghetto was an area that was fenced in and guarded by Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2188">There was no into the ghetto; there was no out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2189">And my mother made a very flippant remark, "Well, if you want to get out of this situation, you always can." </sentence><sentence id="2190">And he said, "Hardly." </sentence><sentence id="2191">They walked us to a school on Mlynarska Street. </sentence><sentence id="2192">This school evidently had been abandoned, and they housed all 1,100 of us on two, possibly three, stories in what used to be classrooms, lecture rooms. </sentence><sentence id="2193">We eventually got our suitcases. </sentence><sentence id="2194">We put our coats or whoever had a blanket on the floor, and that's how we lived for six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2195">The Jewish ghetto administration sent in a kitchen detail once a day to bring soup. </sentence><sentence id="2196">This soup was mainly water, very little else. </sentence><sentence id="2197">In the mornings, we received sometimes a slice of bread and a liquid that was bitter tasting and supposed to look like coffee, but it had a grainy substance. </sentence><sentence id="2198">It had no coffee. </sentence><sentence id="2199">And at that point, most of us still had some money, which we had brought from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2200">Some of it sewn into shoulder pads, into belts, into shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2201">And those of us who had some money -- some more, others less -- you could go into the courtyard and the people who had lived in the ghetto since 1940 when it was first closed would sell out of newspaper a little piece of bread, a chunk of margarine, anything edible, and we would buy it with this German money, not realizing that the currency in the ghetto was not German money. </sentence><sentence id="2202">It was special ghetto-printed money similar to Monopoly money, and that we were by far overpaying. </sentence><sentence id="2203">When we ran out of the money, we would sell some of our so-called "western" belongings -- a silk blouse, a silk scarf, an alligator purse -- whatever any family had brought along and it was deemed no longer necessary, superfluous, and it brought in some food. </sentence><sentence id="2204">These things were not sold for money. </sentence><sentence id="2205">They were bartered for food. </sentence><sentence id="2206">I remember seeing my mother in the courtyard bartering for bread and margarine against a silk blouse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2254">Q: How big of a -- like a small piece of bread? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2256">A: Oh, I would say maybe 200 grams -- a small piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2257">The ghetto bread was about -- it was a round loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2258">It had to last at that point a week, and we cut it into seven or eight wedges once we got our permanent food rations. </sentence><sentence id="2259">And I took my mother's example, and I had a purse. </sentence><sentence id="2260">And when she did not realize it, I did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2261">I traded the purse for some bread. </sentence><sentence id="2262">It was traded to a young woman a little older than I was, who came with a very good- looking gentleman probably ten years older who had a briefcase, and he wanted to give me one piece of bread and I said, "It's too little." </sentence><sentence id="2263">And they laughed. </sentence><sentence id="2264">They didn't speak German and I didn't speak Polish, but we managed. </sentence><sentence id="2265">And I stood there for two hours and eventually they came back and I got two pieces of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2266">But even that had limitation because you ran out of tradable goods. </sentence><sentence id="2267">Nobody had jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="2268">That had to be left for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2269">And what was left was really the bare essentials, not more than that. </sentence><sentence id="2270">After six weeks, we were assigned to various rooms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2286">Q: Stop for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="2287">What happens to washing and sanitary conditions? </sentence><sentence id="2288">There's no bathrooms in the place. </sentence><sentence id="2289">There's no showers, bathtubs, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2290">So, what happens to you physically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2296">A: There was a pump in the courtyard, and if you knew somebody with either a bowl or a bucket, you would borrow it. </sentence><sentence id="2297">In the beginning, we had some soap, but you use up soap and then you make do without soap. </sentence><sentence id="2298">This school had outhouses in the backyard. </sentence><sentence id="2299">The outhouses were used by 1,100 people. </sentence><sentence id="2300">They were filthy. </sentence><sentence id="2301">They were unsanitary. </sentence><sentence id="2302">People got sick. </sentence><sentence id="2303">There were accidents. </sentence><sentence id="2304">You washed and we used to call it a cat's wash because you really couldn't wash. </sentence><sentence id="2305">There was no privacy. </sentence><sentence id="2306">There was no place. </sentence><sentence id="2307">There was no room. </sentence><sentence id="2308">| remember standing in a corner holding up a blanket. </sentence><sentence id="2309">My mother was behind the blanket washing and vice versa. </sentence><sentence id="2310">So, sanitary conditions didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="2311">At night, we slept on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2312">In the daytime, we sat on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2313">Crowded, one body next to the other. </sentence><sentence id="2314">And eventually, six weeks later, we were assigned to various rooms throughout the ghetto on both sides of the bridges. </sentence><sentence id="2315">The older part of the ghetto was the Balut, the former slum of the city. </sentence><sentence id="2316">It used to house Jews and non-Jews, but had been vacated for Jews only. </sentence><sentence id="2317">We were fortunate enough to be settled in the little newer section on the front side of the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="2318">We shared a probably 10 by 10 foot room with four other people. </sentence><sentence id="2319">We had two or three wooden cots. </sentence><sentence id="2320">My mother brought a little wardrobe so we didn't have to hang the clothing on the damp walls. </sentence><sentence id="2321">The view out of the window was a barbed wire and the red century house with a German marching up and down. </sentence><sentence id="2322">So, we did not go near the window. </sentence><sentence id="2323">At night, you had to put a black sheet over the window so no light could come out because it was wartime. </sentence><sentence id="2324">And the room had a little cast iron stove, but there was no lumber. </sentence><sentence id="2325">We slowly took out of the wooden cots one board at a time, cut it up for heat and for cooking. </sentence><sentence id="2326">We were issued ration cards, and the food distribution centers were throughout the ghettos. </sentence><sentence id="2327">The intervals of the spaces between them were several kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="2328">When a food ration was announced or posted on the walls, it gave a date when it would be available, and how much, and what items. </sentence><sentence id="2329">You had to bring your own containers, and during the first week, you stood in line for about three hours until you got your food. </sentence><sentence id="2330">If you waited beyond that, there were no more lines but sometimes the food ran out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2367">Q: And this was hot food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2369">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2371">Q: No, this was- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2373">A: This was a little bit of brown sugar at a time, a little bit of what they called ground coffee, a loaf of bread for a certain period of time, sometimes there was flour. </sentence><sentence id="2374">Once I got horsemeat, but only once. </sentence><sentence id="2375">And it was not really enough to sustain a human being. </sentence><sentence id="2376">And the conversation wherever you went centered around food. </sentence><sentence id="2377">The houses had no running water. </sentence><sentence id="2378">You had to carry a bucket up and a bucket down with dirty water. </sentence><sentence id="2379">There were no bathrooms. </sentence><sentence id="2380">The toilets were outhouses in the backyard. </sentence><sentence id="2381">There were no showers. </sentence><sentence id="2382">There were no bathtubs. </sentence><sentence id="2383">There was no transportation within the ghetto to get from one place to another. </sentence><sentence id="2384">There was an internal police force. </sentence><sentence id="2385">There was a fire brigade. </sentence><sentence id="2386">I don't think it was ever used, and aside from the police force there was a Sonder force, that meant special police with special orders, with more difficult tasks which larger, with larger food allotments, and some of these men were decent, and some were brutal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2401">Q: Lucille, let's stop now and change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2403"> End of Tape 2 Tape 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2406">Q: Lucille, I usually don't do this, but I wanted to give a sense to those people who will watch the interview that, as far as I know, there were over 31,000 departments in the Lodz ghetto, and a little over 700 had running water. </sentence><sentence id="2407">Just for a people to get a sense of this population of over 200,000 people, what you were living in, in terms of the sheer physical conditions let alone everything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2410">A: None of my friends or acquaintances had running water. </sentence><sentence id="2411">I had one friend that I did not know until after the war who lived in the parsonage of a church and there was running water, but nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="2412">There were houses out in Marysin, where Rumkowski lived, they had running water. </sentence><sentence id="2413">It was the slum of a city. </sentence><sentence id="2414">Running water was not the customary thing to have. </sentence><sentence id="2415">The city also didn't have a sewer system. </sentence><sentence id="2416">The sewage ran between the street and the sidewalk, raw sewage, and you jumped over it as you crossed the street. </sentence><sentence id="2417">There was no underground canalization like for instance in Warsaw or in Paris or in Rome. </sentence><sentence id="2418">It didn't exist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2428">Q: So, the stench must have been unbelievable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2430">A: So, was the typhus -- the stench, the typhus, the summers, the snow and frost in the winter, and people just dumped their buckets and it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2431">It -- you had ceased to care, to observe sanitary conditions or laws. </sentence><sentence id="2432">There was really no way one could solve this problem. </sentence><sentence id="2433">It was -- it was not solvable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2438">Q: So, I'm just trying to get a sense of time. </sentence><sentence id="2439">Those first six weeks, this is the most shocking thing that happens to you -- I mean, other than the shock of the death of your father, but that's a different kind of a shock. </sentence><sentence id="2440">This is a physical as well as a psychological shock to you to be taken to Lodz and to be living under conditions that you've never come -- you've never lived like this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2444">A: Nope. </sentence><sentence id="2445">It was a shock, and yet we believed, in the first six weeks, that once we get housing, once we get a room in a building, be it wood or concrete, conditions would be more normalized. </sentence><sentence id="2446">It never really occurred to us that most buildings would not have a bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="2447">I thought there would be maybe a bathroom on each floor or a shower. </sentence><sentence id="2448">The ghetto did have a bathhouse, but you needed a coupon to get in. </sentence><sentence id="2449">The ghetto had a laundry. </sentence><sentence id="2450">Once I had a coupon and I bought some sheets, and it took me six months to get them back. </sentence><sentence id="2451">They were sort of washed, but six months because the laundry did work for the Germans and for the higher-ups within the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2452">So, while some of the civilized amenities were within the ghetto, they were far and in between. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2462">Q: And, during this, before you moved to Pawia Street, these first four to six weeks, do you see -- you're living with 1,100 people in a very small building. </sentence><sentence id="2463">Do people change a lot? </sentence><sentence id="2464">Do people start fighting with each other? </sentence><sentence id="2465">Do you see things even amongst the three of you where there are changes and it's difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2470">A: It was stressful. </sentence><sentence id="2471">People did argue. " </sentence><sentence id="2472">This was my space and why did you take my space?" </sentence><sentence id="2473">And "take this away and put this there." </sentence><sentence id="2474">It was community living at its worst. </sentence><sentence id="2475">It brought out the very best in very few people. </sentence><sentence id="2476">It brought out the worst in most of us. </sentence><sentence id="2477">And I don't think anybody was really to blame because to come out of the normal life into conditions of deprivation, of inhumanity, dehumanization -- it's indescribable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2486">Q: How'd your mother change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2488">A: She became very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2489">When we first came into the ghetto, she thought, because she spoke Polish, she had lived among Poles, she had lived among Jews in Poland, she was educated in Lwow, she thought it would be manageable. </sentence><sentence id="2490">It would be possibly a little bit the way her life had been before the first World War. </sentence><sentence id="2491">But I don't think she fully expected the hunger, and the filth, and the sickness within the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2492">That was something that was incomprehensible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2499">Q: Your sister is 11, and you're 16. </sentence><sentence id="2500">So, what is it for her? </sentence><sentence id="2501">Is it harder for her because she's so much younger? </sentence><sentence id="2502">Or is it not harder? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2507">A: No, it wasn't harder for her. </sentence><sentence id="2508">She just took it more or less in stride. </sentence><sentence id="2509">She didn't quite understand what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2510">She once asked about the barbed wires or the soldiers with guns. </sentence><sentence id="2511">She remarked once on the lack of a playground. </sentence><sentence id="2512">Or she wanted a little roll with butter and there were no rolls in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2513">But she did not -- it did not have a full impact on her, not at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2521">Q: Did she have friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2523">A: No, nobody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2525">Q: Nobody had them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2527">A: Nobody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2529">Q: So, the kids did not play. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2531">A: There were very few kids. </sentence><sentence id="2532">There were mainly elderly people. </sentence><sentence id="2533">There were quite a few teenagers, but kids eight or 10 far in between. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2537">Q: What about you? </sentence><sentence id="2538">What happened to you during those first couple of months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2541">A: Well, I went throughout the building to see if there was anybody I knew. </sentence><sentence id="2542">I met a couple of classmates, schoolmates. </sentence><sentence id="2543">I looked at the young people who brought the soup, and laid out the portions. </sentence><sentence id="2544">And I was guessing or thinking how does one get a job like that, but I had trouble with the language. </sentence><sentence id="2545">I could understand some of the Yiddish, and Polish I had probably a dozen words, no more. </sentence><sentence id="2546">So, there was no communication. </sentence><sentence id="2547">There was no possibility to make any connection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2555">Q: But, there are, I don't know, at least a few thousand Germans who went into the Lodz ghetto, am I right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2557">A: Over a period of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2559">Q: But not when you came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2561">A: Not when we came. </sentence><sentence id="2562">Later on, there were transports -- several from Berlin, several from Vienna, five from Prague, one from Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="2563">I think there were in excess of 20,000 people brought in from what was called "Western Europe." </sentence><sentence id="2564">At that time, we were told we didn't read it and we didn't hear it, of a speech made by Rumkowski that 20,000 Jews had been brought in from the West and there was neither enough housing for them, and the Germans would make no allowances for it, and there was not enough food for them. </sentence><sentence id="2565">It was considered a tremendous burden on the already existing ghetto population. </sentence><sentence id="2566">And we were very unwelcome. </sentence><sentence id="2567">We were made fun of. </sentence><sentence id="2568">We were the ones from the West, the spoiled ones, the arrogant ones. </sentence><sentence id="2569">And in a way, it was true. </sentence><sentence id="2570">The majority of the German Jews especially, not so much the Czechs, came with the idea, or at least if they didn't come with it, it started within the ghetto, "We will teach them how to do things here, and we will change things in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2571">And we will run the ghetto the way we are used to running things in Germany." </sentence><sentence id="2572">And that turned out to be a big mistake. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2585">Q: Because there was a lot of hostility? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2587">A: There was a lot of hostility, and you can't walk into somebody else's house and turn it upside-down. </sentence><sentence id="2588">And of course, the Polish Jews would not hold still for it, which resulted in the fact that there was no employment for us. </sentence><sentence id="2589">We were by and large disliked. </sentence><sentence id="2590">We were called names, not nasty names, but not flattering names either. </sentence><sentence id="2591">You felt almost like an outcast among your own people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2597">Q: So, you were in -- it's not the same situation you were in Germany with the Nazis or the German non-Jews against you. </sentence><sentence id="2598">But there's somewhat of a similarity within the context of this horrible situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2601">A: Yes, but I was used to this situation. </sentence><sentence id="2602">I went to a German-Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="2603">And the school had about ten children who had Polish parents. </sentence><sentence id="2604">And when this became known, the parents of the -- of all those students said, "Don't play with those Polish Jews." </sentence><sentence id="2605">So, it was Jew against Jew on the one side. </sentence><sentence id="2606">It was the same again now. </sentence><sentence id="2607">And that, at that very beginning, something told me that you were sitting again between two chairs. </sentence><sentence id="2608">If you want to live here in any way and get work, you have to learn the language - Yiddish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2609">And it was hard; there was no school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2619">Q: So, how did you learn? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2621">A: By listening and by talking. </sentence><sentence id="2622">And I made horrible mistakes but people smiled. </sentence><sentence id="2623">They thought it was very cute that a 16 year old would at least try. </sentence><sentence id="2624">It took me six months and I spoke Polish grammatically incorrect. </sentence><sentence id="2625">I didn't know if two houses were male or female, but it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2626">People found it amusing, and it helped. </sentence><sentence id="2627">It gave me a chance at communication. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2635">Q: And, your mother could speak. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2637">A: My mother was educated and she spoke Polish, and French, and German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2639">Q: Did she try to get a job or was she -- or did she not even try? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2641">A: She tried at very first, but nobody would hire in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="2642">There was not enough work within the ghetto to fully employ everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2643">Work was not mandatory; it was not considered forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="2644">You worked and you received the noontime soup. </sentence><sentence id="2645">But you didn't have to work if you didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="2646">It afforded you no other privileges. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2653">Q: Except the noontime soup. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2655">A: Right, because money was very little and worthless. </sentence><sentence id="2656">So, she tried for a while in the felt shoe factory and in the hat factory, but they wouldn't hire her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2659">Q: So, the people who are working are getting noontime soup plus the rations that you are all getting. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And you would cook these rations in your little room -- or try to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2663">A: If we had enough material to hit the little stove because sometimes you got items that weren't even combinable or cookable, but we would try in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="2664">And if you shared a room, and you had a corner for your food supplies or a shelf, it very often happened that by evening something had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2665">Somebody in the room was so hungry, they couldn't resist. </sentence><sentence id="2666">That was very, very common. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2671">Q: So, how quickly did you feel that you were starving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2673">A: I think with -- within two months, maybe two and a half months. </sentence><sentence id="2674">We were definitely starving by the end of the year, before Christmastime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2677">Q: And thirsty, I would imagine, or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2679">A: We did drink the water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2681">Q: You did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2683">A: Yes, that's why we got typhus. </sentence><sentence id="2684">It was really not much else to drink because it was difficult to heat up water, to bring it to a boil, and to make this so-called coffee that we were distributed. </sentence><sentence id="2685">I remember one ration and it was four pounds of salt. </sentence><sentence id="2686">I remember a ration of a half a pound of citric acid. </sentence><sentence id="2687">Citric acid thrown into a pot of raw vegetables makes it boil faster, but what are you going to do with that quantity. </sentence><sentence id="2688">It was a senseless type of distribution, but the food was distributed the way it came into the ghetto from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2689">There were, we heard, other items, but they were in small supply and they went to the elite of the ghetto administration, not to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2703">Q: Could you take some of these rations and go to this market -- there was an outdoor market, and try to get some food of some kind, or was there very little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2705">A: Again, during the first six months there was an outside area where you could buy a rotten apple or frozen potato, or whatever anybody else would like to sell. </sentence><sentence id="2706">You could trade. </sentence><sentence id="2707">You could barter, but it was pretty senseless. </sentence><sentence id="2708">You didn't gain much by it. </sentence><sentence id="2709">And the market eventually just closed down for lack of interest and for lack of supplies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2715">Q: So, let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="2716">So, you're in Pawia Street, in the end of November, beginning of December? </sentence><sentence id="2717">Something like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2735">Q: With a disease or by starvation, her body is...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2737">A: Well, starvation takes a strange form. </sentence><sentence id="2738">Your body swells. </sentence><sentence id="2739">Your legs and your feet become double its normal size. </sentence><sentence id="2740">It is difficult to walk. </sentence><sentence id="2741">You can't get into a pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2742">Those are the first signs of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="2743">It does ultimately affect you in other ways, as well. </sentence><sentence id="2744">It is just that the body responds to lack of nourishment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2753">Q: And this is what was happening to her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2755">A: This was happening to her and thousands of others. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2763">A: The only thing that I could try is sell whatever of my clothing I did not need or I did not want. </sentence><sentence id="2764">And that I gradually sold for food, but I didn't have much clothing to start out with, and I only had two pair of shoes in not very good condition. </sentence><sentence id="2765">Shoes would have brought a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="2766">The stockings were in such disrepair that the repairs on the back of the heel reached halfway up to the knee. </sentence><sentence id="2767">We kept repairing it with thread because you couldn't buy new ones. </sentence><sentence id="2768">But you could buy a lipstick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2775">Q: What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2777">A: The ghetto had a little cosmetic store half a block from Balutaring. </sentence><sentence id="2778">And I guess the lady must have had a cosmetic store before the war, and you could go and buy powder or lipstick, and on the corner was a hairdresser and you could get a permanent if you had the right currency or enough food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2781">Q: And there were enough people to keep open this cosmetic store who would buy things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2783">A: I do not how much rent they paid. </sentence><sentence id="2784">I don't know who owned the building. </sentence><sentence id="2785">It was a little shack. </sentence><sentence id="2786">There was demand. </sentence><sentence id="2787">The ladies or women who were in fact within the ghetto were well- dressed. </sentence><sentence id="2788">They wore hats. </sentence><sentence id="2789">They wore decent boots or shoes, and they wore cosmetics. </sentence><sentence id="2790">The ghetto had several tiny little holes in the wall and you could get a manicure for one Mark. </sentence><sentence id="2791">But you had to have the Mark. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2817">Q: And what did you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2819">A: I think --I thought it was totally superfluous. </sentence><sentence id="2820">It was ridiculous, but I liked to see people with that bright red nail polish, which I've never worn since. </sentence><sentence id="2821">And it was very fashionable because women, Jewish women in Ledz, were very elegant, emancipated, very Western, very anti- religious customs, and quite different from what I had expected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2825">Q: So, they were more modern in some ways than where you came from. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2855">Q: So, when your mother begins to take on the symptoms of what one might call the disease of starvation, the diseases that come with starvation, do you kids sit in the house -- the apartment with her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2857">A: We did at first, and then one evening we had knock at the door. </sentence><sentence id="2858">It must have been around January. </sentence><sentence id="2859">And in walked a short little man by the name of Adolf Goetz, and he had lived around the corner from us in Hamburg on Holle Street. </sentence><sentence id="2860">We lived on Braumsen Way (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2861">We didn't know him but we'd wave from the back window. </sentence><sentence id="2862">He had a short little wife with very curly hair and she used to shake out her rugs off the balcony. </sentence><sentence id="2863">And he came in with another man and he used to be a dentist in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="2864">I think it was Rosenblum. </sentence><sentence id="2865">And he had remembered us and he said to my mother, "I have been given permission to open an office. </sentence><sentence id="2866">Would you allow your daughter to work in that office?" </sentence><sentence id="2867">My mother said, "Sure." " </sentence><sentence id="2868">Well, she doesn't get much money. </sentence><sentence id="2869">You know how it is, but she" ll get a daily soup." </sentence><sentence id="2870">Adolph Goetz had a terrific sense of humor. </sentence><sentence id="2871">He was probably not even five foot tall. </sentence><sentence id="2872">He wore glasses, and he had a funny face that you would expect to see in a cartoon, a very pinched little face. </sentence><sentence id="2873">He had been a playwright. </sentence><sentence id="2874">He had been an engineer. </sentence><sentence id="2875">He had a son in South America some place, and he convinced Rumkowski that the ghetto needed improvement and beautification. </sentence><sentence id="2876">And he hired probably a dozen architects and engineers that had come from Prague on this so-called Intelligenz transport, as they called themselves because everybody had a college degree, among them the general director of Schoda (ph), which was Dr. Reich. </sentence><sentence id="2877">And they were supposed to draw up blue prints with parks, with schools, with trees, with playgrounds. </sentence><sentence id="2878">And I was supposed to do some typing, but I couldn't type very well, and write the explanations to these blueprints. </sentence><sentence id="2879">And every once in a while Adolph Goetz would take the blueprints to Balutaring, to Rumkowski, and Rumkowski seemed enthused. </sentence><sentence id="2880">And we got the midday soup. </sentence><sentence id="2881">The office was on Rybn, 8. </sentence><sentence id="2882">And oh, Adolph must have been in his late "60s at a guess, and for fun he wrote poems and he wrote stories. </sentence><sentence id="2883">And he would make little airplanes out of them, and just sort of fly them over the office onto my desk. </sentence><sentence id="2884">That went on for several months. </sentence><sentence id="2885">I didn't know what to make it, but it was sort of funny. </sentence><sentence id="2886">But he complained bitterly about the lack of food, but the office remained for about six months, and then he was summoned by Rumkowski, and he was told, "I'm terminating the office. </sentence><sentence id="2887">I'm closing down the office. </sentence><sentence id="2888">And all of you can look for other jobs." </sentence><sentence id="2889">In the meantime, he had gotten double rations, which of course I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2890">And he was really unhappy for himself and for us, as well. </sentence><sentence id="2891">And everybody tried to get a job someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="2892">Dr. Reich went to work for the lumber department for Goodman. </sentence><sentence id="2893">Some others found employment some place else, and by then it was July. </sentence><sentence id="2894">And my mother died on the 30" of July 1942 of hunger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2933">Q: Were you with her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2935">A: No, I was not at home. </sentence><sentence id="2936">It happened in the afternoon, and the next day the black little wagon with the white horse came and picked up the dead bodies throughout the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2937">We did not hear. </sentence><sentence id="2938">My sister and I walked to the Jewish cemetery in Marysin, about a two-hour walk. </sentence><sentence id="2939">And in the burial hall, we went through hundreds of bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2940">And most bodies were between two boards, wooden boards, tied together with a string and a name tag. </sentence><sentence id="2941">We found my mother's body. </sentence><sentence id="2942">And we took two shovels. </sentence><sentence id="2943">And we looked for a plot and there were no more plots left on the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="2944">So, we found a walkway, and we spent that July day digging a grave until it was deep enough to bury her. </sentence><sentence id="2945">We put a wooden marker on it. </sentence><sentence id="2946">We scratched the name with a stone on the marker, and we walked back. </sentence><sentence id="2947">From that day on, I think, my sister stopped talking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2961">Q: Stopped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2963">A: Talking. </sentence><sentence id="2964">I couldn't get through to her. </sentence><sentence id="2965">I looked around for a school for her. </sentence><sentence id="2966">I couldn't find a school. </sentence><sentence id="2967">But I heard that one of the factories in the back room employed children, but it actually was a school. </sentence><sentence id="2968">I tried several. </sentence><sentence id="2969">And I was asked by the directors of the factories, "If I give you a place for your sister, what will you give me in return?" </sentence><sentence id="2970">And I explained that I had no jewelry nor did I have money. </sentence><sentence id="2971">And the answer was laughter. </sentence><sentence id="2972">I did not comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="2973">In the end, I did find her a place. </sentence><sentence id="2974">I asked her if she enjoyed it, if she learned Polish, if there were other children -- she wouldn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="2975">And, I, in the meantime, looked for work. </sentence><sentence id="2976">I found some work in the factory sewing ladies" dresses, but it was a two hour walk to Marysin. </sentence><sentence id="2977">And I worked at a machine for a while. </sentence><sentence id="2978">And the interesting part in that factory was that it employed young people my age, a little older, and they were very intent on striking, on asking for more food. </sentence><sentence id="2979">One young woman named Fajga made us walk, those willing to walk, around the courtyard, "No food. </sentence><sentence id="2980">No work." </sentence><sentence id="2981">It took an hour, and the police -- the Jewish ghetto police -- came into the courtyard and took her away. </sentence><sentence id="2982">She returned the next day a little bit black and blue, and she laughed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3003">Q: She laughed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3005">A: She laughed. </sentence><sentence id="3006">She had a boyfriend and she said, "We're not going to give up. </sentence><sentence id="3007">We're going to organize for food." </sentence><sentence id="3008">By that time, I got afraid. </sentence><sentence id="3009">But there were brave souls who still marched, "No Food, no soup, no work." " </sentence><sentence id="3010">No food, no work" in Yiddish and Polish, and she was taken away a second time. </sentence><sentence id="3011">The first time she was warned to cease and desist, not by Rumkowski, but by someone who was sent by him. </sentence><sentence id="3012">And when she was taken the second time, she didn't return for a week. </sentence><sentence id="3013">She came back in very bad shape: black and blue, a missing tooth, and she no longer demonstrated. </sentence><sentence id="3014">By then it was September, and the announcements were of the ghetto -- No, first Rumkowski made a speech that the Germans had demanded that the old and the very young be deported from the ghetto, and he had to comply with German orders. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3026">Q: Can I - because these are the big deportations -- can I go back a little bit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3028">A: Yes, there was one in May that I had skipped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3030">Q: May of 42, before your mother died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3032">A: Yes, and that took out most of the elderly Jews that had come from the West, most of them with very few exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="3033">We were on the list. </sentence><sentence id="3034">And I took our three Polish passports. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And I went from one administration to the other to convince them that we were not German. </sentence><sentence id="3036">And somebody in the administration who worked for Neftalin, his name was Kaplan, finally, after two days agreed to delete our names and we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="3037">That was in May before my mother died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3044">Q: And did you have an instinct that another deportation couldn't possibly be better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3046">A: We had the instinct -- here we knew of the misery. </sentence><sentence id="3047">If you go someplace else, what is going to await us? </sentence><sentence id="3048">We had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="3049">And I would say by an old Jewish saying, "What you have you have. </sentence><sentence id="3050">You know, you know your enemy. </sentence><sentence id="3051">If you go someplace else, what will you have?" </sentence><sentence id="3052">We did not know. </sentence><sentence id="3053">So, the instinct -- our instinct was -- I don't know how other people felt because we had very, very little contact with other Jews that had come from the West except for the Eichengreens, who really didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="3054">They thought it couldn't be worse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3064">Q: This is Jules and Julius. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3066">A: Right, and -- but, we decided, my mother and I, that it would be better to stay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3068">Q: And your mother by then is not very well, anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3070">A: No, she was not well. </sentence><sentence id="3071">It was my doing that we were permitted to stay, because I ran around with these Polish passports speaking German. </sentence><sentence id="3072">And people just looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="3073">They just laughed. </sentence><sentence id="3074">It was a joke. </sentence><sentence id="3075">It couldn't be for real. </sentence><sentence id="3076">Somebody who has a nationality can speak the language, but in the end, they agreed. </sentence><sentence id="3077">We could stay. </sentence><sentence id="3078">After my mother died... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3089">Q: I want to ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="3090">It's very unusual, I think, for two children to not metaphorically bury their mother but to really bury... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3093">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3095">Q: ...one of their parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3117">A: Yes, with those two boards. </sentence><sentence id="3118">How did we do it? </sentence><sentence id="3119">I really can't answer that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3123">Q: And did you say to each other, "We have to bury her." </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3250">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3252">A: The essence of the speech was that the Germans had demanded 20,000 sick, elderly, and children, most of them children to be sent out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3253">And the wording of the speech was, and that I think is a matter of record, "Mothers and fathers, give me your children so that the rest of us may live and survive." </sentence><sentence id="3254">There were outcries, maybe a stone or two were thrown, but police was present. </sentence><sentence id="3255">He tried to explain that he tried to negotiate that they wouldn't take children over 11 years of age, but they would have to take the sick. </sentence><sentence id="3256">He got the number decreased by a thousand and various other justifications. </sentence><sentence id="3257">Those who heard the speech and those who found about it were appalled. </sentence><sentence id="3258">It was -- the concept was unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="3259">During the process, that the deportation was announced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the lists on the streets of the people written up, the Germans got angry and impatient. </sentence><sentence id="3260">They enforced a curfew of seven days starting in September, I believe it was the 7. </sentence><sentence id="3261">We were not supposed to be out on the street for seven days and seven nights. </sentence><sentence id="3262">The Germans came into the ghetto with trucks, with dogs and with guns. </sentence><sentence id="3263">They went from street to street and from house to house, and the square area of the ghetto was not very large. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And it went house by house. </sentence><sentence id="3265">They came to our street. </sentence><sentence id="3266">We had a neighbor sit on the roof and look out. </sentence><sentence id="3267">And when they entered the courtyard, they shouted for everybody to assemble in the courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="3268">And then they went into the building and found those who had hidden. </sentence><sentence id="3269">They beat them and put them on the truck. </sentence><sentence id="3270">And then the looked at the remainder of those standing in the courtyard, probably 60 people, and within five minutes, they separated the old and the young from the more fit human beings. </sentence><sentence id="3271">My sister, although she was 11 years old, not 10, was taken. </sentence><sentence id="3272">I tried to go onto the truck with her. </sentence><sentence id="3273">The guns stopped me. </sentence><sentence id="3274">The truck drove off. </sentence><sentence id="3275">My neighbor's mother was taken -- many people out of the building. </sentence><sentence id="3276">He was a policeman. </sentence><sentence id="3277">He couldn't get his mother released. </sentence><sentence id="3278">We never found out where they were taken, what was done with them, where they supposedly were resettled, in what labor camp they might have been sent. </sentence><sentence id="3279">But eventually, a few packages of clothing came back into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3280">And supposedly -- I did not see it -- some of the clothing was blood-stained. </sentence><sentence id="3281">Actual notes or actual letters I don't believe were found. </sentence><sentence id="3282">Nobody could give us an answer. </sentence><sentence id="3283">We hoped that they were alive -- someplace, somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="3284">And the curfew was lifted after seven days, and life continued for the rest of us. </sentence><sentence id="3285">It was almost as if we had been hypnotized, as if we just -- we just went on. </sentence><sentence id="3286">We went to work. </sentence><sentence id="3287">We collected the soup. </sentence><sentence id="3288">We collected the food ration. </sentence><sentence id="3289">It continued. </sentence><sentence id="3290">We had been robbed not of our children, but of our feelings, of our compassion. </sentence><sentence id="3291">Some children were hidden, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="3292">How he could have asked to hand over the children, I did not understand at 16. </sentence><sentence id="3293">I don't understand it now. </sentence><sentence id="3294">Did he have a choice? </sentence><sentence id="3295">I would say so. </sentence><sentence id="3296">Czerniakow had a choice. </sentence><sentence id="3297">I mean, his life was not so precious that he could not have said no. </sentence><sentence id="3298">He could have refused to obey the orders. </sentence><sentence id="3299">He would have paid the price, but to ask this of the community is unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="3300">I was fired from the dress factory. </sentence><sentence id="3301">I don't know for what reason, probably incompetence. </sentence><sentence id="3302">I did not sew very well. </sentence><sentence id="3303">And I went back to the office on Rybna, 8 because I knew a woman there from Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="3304">And by then it was October, and it was cold, and we stood around the stove and I said, "TI need a job desperately." </sentence><sentence id="3305">And her boss, who sat a desk in the corner, came over. </sentence><sentence id="3306">He started talking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and Yiddish, and he said, "I'll give you a job." </sentence><sentence id="3307">I said, "Doing what?" </sentence><sentence id="3308">And he said, "We have received truckloads of forms to be completed for the Germans in Germany for their coal rations. </sentence><sentence id="3309">And the forms have to be figured and completed. </sentence><sentence id="3310">And you'll sit in the office. </sentence><sentence id="3311">I need 300 people. </sentence><sentence id="3312">You write down the names. </sentence><sentence id="3313">People will tell you they"!l work here. </sentence><sentence id="3314">You just get their addresses, and you just do it." </sentence><sentence id="3315">I said, "Okay, I'll do it. </sentence><sentence id="3316">A job is a job." </sentence><sentence id="3317">His boss was Henryk Neftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s. </sentence><sentence id="3318">A very fair man. </sentence><sentence id="3319">A very able man. </sentence><sentence id="3320">I had met his mother when I was running around with those passports a year earlier. </sentence><sentence id="3321">And he was much admired. </sentence><sentence id="3322">The strange thing was that he had Rumkowski's ear. </sentence><sentence id="3323">When he would go to Rumkowski, he might take some abuse, but in the end, he would argue. </sentence><sentence id="3324">And half the time, Rumkowski would listen. </sentence><sentence id="3325">So, he was much admired. </sentence><sentence id="3326">His girlfriend worked in one of the administrative offices. </sentence><sentence id="3327">Her name was Klatalka (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3328">And I worked in that office, I would say, until "43, end of 43. </sentence><sentence id="3329">And one day Bernard Fuchs decided --he was the head of the Department of Labor -- that too many people worked in that office, and he needed people in the straw shoe factory for the Russian front. </sentence><sentence id="3330">And the commission of several dignitaries came, among them Rumkowski. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And it was again a selection of who goes and who stays. </sentence><sentence id="3332">And I hid pretty much to the bitter end until I was called, because they had my name on the list. </sentence><sentence id="3333">And Rumkowski sat on a chair. </sentence><sentence id="3334">He had taken off his hat and his coat, and he had his cane in his right hand. </sentence><sentence id="3335">And for a minute, he reminded me of a fairy tale -- a king sitting on a throne. </sentence><sentence id="3336">He spoke to me in Yiddish and he asked me my name, whether I had family, where I had come from, and in the end he said, "Little German, you may stay, and you" ll hear from me." </sentence><sentence id="3337">He took a lot of people out of that office at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="3338">Bernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had drawn up previous deportation lists. </sentence><sentence id="3339">I had gone to his office when I was jobless and asked him for employment because he was born in Hannover, Germany, and he spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="3340">And after my third visit, he lost his temper, and he said that he had not jobs, that I was a pest, or the equivalent in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="3341">He opened the door and he yelled like a German, "Raus!" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3435">Q: And when did this happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3437">A: Before I got the job- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3439">Q: With Goetz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3441">A: -with Goetz, and then again after I lost the job with Goetz, twice. </sentence><sentence id="3442">And then there was a third time when I lost the job in the clothing factory. </sentence><sentence id="3443">I saw him throughout the ghetto, sometimes in a carriage, sometimes not. </sentence><sentence id="3444">He knew me because there were not many people who came from Hamburg who had been to Hannover, who could speak German. </sentence><sentence id="3445">I also went for an interview to Balutaring with his sister Dora Brooks. </sentence><sentence id="3446">She wouldn't hire me, no reason given. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3453">Q: She was the executive secretary to Rumkowski, so she had a very high position. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3455">A: She was more than that. </sentence><sentence id="3456">She was his ears and his mouth because Rumkowski could not speak to the Germans in any language. </sentence><sentence id="3457">She could speak. </sentence><sentence id="3458">She could speak Polish, and by then, with the same accent I had, and she could speak German. </sentence><sentence id="3459">I went to Walchovna (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3460">I went to a whole variety of women who were in factories. </sentence><sentence id="3461">And there were many that were capable, that were intelligent, but they wouldn't hire a woman. </sentence><sentence id="3462">That was competition -- a man, yes -- a woman, no. </sentence><sentence id="3463">So, I went back to work, and a few weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called me into his office and he said, "I'm transferring you to the Statistical Department on Plac Koscielny, 4." </sentence><sentence id="3464">I didn't want to leave because I'd become very friendly with Spiegel and I did not like the unknown. </sentence><sentence id="3465">But you didn't argue with Henryk Neftalin. </sentence><sentence id="3466">He was fair. </sentence><sentence id="3467">He was decent. </sentence><sentence id="3468">What his reasons were, I never knew. </sentence><sentence id="3469">They could have been several. </sentence><sentence id="3470">It could have been that he wanted me out of Rumkowski's reach. </sentence><sentence id="3471">It could have been the fact that I came to work one day with a very bloody face when I had been sent to the Kripo because somebody said I had a radio, and I never did have a radio. </sentence><sentence id="3472">And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody face, my bruised eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3473">He transferred me because in essence he was the actual head of the Statistical Department. </sentence><sentence id="3474">He had the first word and the last word. </sentence><sentence id="3475">It was a long way to work over the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="3476">And in winter it was hard to walk, so they unshoveled snow on the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="3477">You slid back rather than forward. </sentence><sentence id="3478">Hundreds of people cross the bridge every morning, and you were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing. </sentence><sentence id="3479">That was the greatest fear because they carried typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3480">The office... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3508">Q: I want to stop. </sentence><sentence id="3509">I don't like doing this, but I want to go back because you're now moving much too fast, and I really don't have much time. </sentence><sentence id="3510">So, I'll tell you what we're going to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3514">We're going to stop the tape. </sentence><sentence id="3515">And then, I'm going to come back and we'll go a little bit more slowly. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3516">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3517">End of Tape 3 Tape 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3521">Q: Lucille, I want to bring us back because you moved much too quickly for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3523">A: I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3525">Q: Don't be sorry, it's fine. </sentence><sentence id="3526">You said when Karin was taken away, you all -- and Karin is, well, she's going with children. </sentence><sentence id="3527">There's also 70,000 people, I think who's in these deportations during this couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="3528">Am I not right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3533">A: No, I don't think 70. </sentence><sentence id="3534">I think it was in May around 15 or 20, and then again in September, there were a lot of smaller deportations in between a thousand or 2,000. </sentence><sentence id="3535">The actual numbers I don't know, but the ghetto at any one time had roughly 160,000 people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3539">Q: But, it was a few thousand people over the course- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3541">A: Over the course, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3543">Q: You said that people went on, and what you lost in some ways was your feelings. </sentence><sentence id="3544">So, in order to go on, you clearly didn't forget Karin, but you couldn't respond to her going, I gather, in some way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3547">A: Well, I reached out for her. </sentence><sentence id="3548">I tried to go with her. </sentence><sentence id="3549">I was not allowed, but life in the overall ghetto went on. </sentence><sentence id="3550">People even went so far as to use, at least for a week or two, the ration card of a person who was deported. </sentence><sentence id="3551">So, there was no -- there was no feeling. </sentence><sentence id="3552">There was no -- there was a sadness, but there was not a deep desperation and there should have been, and that, I think two or three years of ghetto life killed that within us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3559">Q: Did you use Karin's ration card? </sentence><sentence id="3560">Did she have one even? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3563">A: Yes, she had one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3565">Q: She had one. </sentence><sentence id="3566">Did you use it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3569">A: No, I did not. </sentence><sentence id="3570">My neighbor asked whether she could pick up the bread on her card, and I said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="3571">And I handed it into the coupon department and let it go at that. </sentence><sentence id="3572">I just couldn't because I had read a story, and supposedly it was fiction of children looking across a barbed wire at the Fehk Etta (ph) bread store and there was one across our street on the other side, and they looked from the attic down into the bakery and they were talking about the bread and how good it smelled, and it went on for quite awhile, and then came the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="3573">And, just for the deportation, the father was so hungry that he stole a piece of the children's bread. </sentence><sentence id="3574">And the father was deported. </sentence><sentence id="3575">The mother and the two children hid and remained in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3576">The mother kept the card. </sentence><sentence id="3577">She collected the father's bread. </sentence><sentence id="3578">I don't know for how long. </sentence><sentence id="3579">She gave it to the children, and she says, "Children, eat your father's bread." </sentence><sentence id="3580">And that's the end of the story, and the story was written by Spiegel in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3581">It has been translated into English. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3595">Q: And you knew this story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3597">A: He read this story to me when he wrote the first draft. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3599">Q: And that was later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3601">A: That was after the -- it was 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3603">Q: So, what was it that made you not use the coupon? </sentence><sentence id="3604">Was there something immoral about it to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3607">A: It was like robbing a grave, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="3608">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3609">I don't know -- it wasn't mine to use. </sentence><sentence id="3610">It wasn't mine to give. </sentence><sentence id="3611">It was hers. </sentence><sentence id="3612">I can't give you the reason. </sentence><sentence id="3613">I do not know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3621">Q: So, she's taken away in September. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3623">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3625">Q: You work for Goetz ends when in October? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3627">A: No, it ended before deportation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3629">Q: Before deportation. </sentence><sentence id="3630">So, you're four to six weeks without a job before you get the job -- before Spiegel meets you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3633">A: No, I first go to the clothing factory in between and then I go back to Rybna,8 , and Spiegel gives me a job. </sentence><sentence id="3634">That was pretty much the end of deg42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3637">Q: So, you start working there, working on these forms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3639">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3641">Q: You're filling in forms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3643">A: The coal rations for the German population. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3645">Q: And, these coal rations from the Jews- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3647">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3649">Q: How does this work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3651">A: This is paperwork. </sentence><sentence id="3652">It has nothing to do with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3653">It's like an audit at the Internal Revenue. </sentence><sentence id="3654">He goes over the figures. </sentence><sentence id="3655">We got forms, let's say, from the city of Berlin, and Mr. Smith lives in an apartment with four other people. </sentence><sentence id="3656">He was entitled to a hundred kilo of coal, and we had to figure that out. </sentence><sentence id="3657">Four times 50 or four times 25 is 100. </sentence><sentence id="3658">Then there is Mr. Joe who has eight people living in his apartment. </sentence><sentence id="3659">Each person gets 25 kilos. </sentence><sentence id="3660">So, we had to come up with the figures, and there were thousands of these forms brought into the ghetto in containers, and we went through box after box doing the clerical work and having them shipped out of the ghetto again to Germany, so they could take the forms, give them to their people, and have them collect the coal. </sentence><sentence id="3661">All we did was clerical work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3673">Q: Isee. </sentence><sentence id="3674">So, this had to be a fairly quick turnaround, so people could get there... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3677">A: Yes, it had to be a few months, or it was for the following year. </sentence><sentence id="3678">That I cannot say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3681">Q: So, who are you actually working for? </sentence><sentence id="3682">Spiegel works for Neftalin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3685">A: I work for Spiegel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3687">Q: And, you work for Spiegel, and are there other people working for Spiegel, or just you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3689">A: The office had about three or four people, one of whom was Pushovsky (ph), one was -- the other one was Spiegel, I think there was one more man. </sentence><sentence id="3690">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="3691">But there were 300 people in the office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3695">Q: In the whole office? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3697">A: In the whole office doing nothing but these forms. </sentence><sentence id="3698">And while they did the forms, there were supervisors, but they all directly worked for Spiegel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3701">Q: So, what did you think of Spiegel when you first met him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3703">A: Well, he wore glasses. </sentence><sentence id="3704">He had slicked-back black hair. </sentence><sentence id="3705">He walked very deliberately, very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="3706">He always carried a briefcase. </sentence><sentence id="3707">He was very absent-minded, and he was always writing, in Yiddish, because I peeked and I couldn't read because he wrote very fast. </sentence><sentence id="3708">He was also quite sure of himself. </sentence><sentence id="3709">He had published already at the age of 22 in the Yiddish Bletter in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="3710">He had taught school for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="3711">What did I think of him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3721">Q: What did you notice him? </sentence><sentence id="3722">Did you know that he was a published person? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3725">A: Yes, but I did not pay much attention. </sentence><sentence id="3726">He was -- you would call him today a little stuffy, and he wore these little black horn-rimmed glasses or wire glasses -- medium height, medium built, wore a suit unpressed. </sentence><sentence id="3727">The shirts were a little rumpled. </sentence><sentence id="3728">I mean, it wasn't somebody who would particularly strike you in a crowd, not in a ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3733">Q: So, does he begin when you first start working there, to come over to you and ask you read or he's going to read to you? </sentence><sentence id="3734">How -- because you begin a relationship together, how does it begin for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3737">A: He asked me to stay after work, and work ended at eight or nine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3739">Q: Eight-oh-nine? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3757">A: Betczak like a bed, Betczak. </sentence><sentence id="3758">And, he would come and sweep around the offices and he would sit there at ten at night or whatever time it was, and Spiegel would read his drafts on which he worked most of the daytime although he wasn't supposed to, and -- in Yiddish -- and he told me what to think about them, whether they were good or not so good. </sentence><sentence id="3759">And I listened, and some of his poetry is very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="3760">And the short stories really took me very much by surprised. </sentence><sentence id="3761">They were fiction, but they were the story of the man who lost his horse to hunger, or the Germans killed an animal, or the father who stole bread from the children. </sentence><sentence id="3762">He wrote a book during the ghetto time that was called "Malches Ghetto" -- "Kingdom Ghetto", and it gives a story of the church on the Platske Chernya (ph), and the people who go in and who go out. </sentence><sentence id="3763">He had a facility to describe people, and the description ran several pages. </sentence><sentence id="3764">It reminded me of Thomas Mann and the Buddenbrooks. </sentence><sentence id="3765">It gave the background of the story, the smell, the atmosphere, the air, the grass, the sky. </sentence><sentence id="3766">It -- to me at age 17, it was very impressive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3777">Q: Why did he have to tell you what to think? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4243">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4244">Singer spent his day mainly on the street, or away from the office seeing people who had some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs. </sentence><sentence id="4245">I would pick up at the bottom of the bridge in the police station from Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics -- so many people died, so many people committed suicide, so many were deported. </sentence><sentence id="4246">When Singer came back into the office, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a tremendous amount of material, because the chronicle of the large ghetto is not all Singer's. </sentence><sentence id="4247">I think several hundred pages at least, and that's a forthcoming book now. </sentence><sentence id="4248">He was a journalist. </sentence><sentence id="4249">He had worked as a journalist in Prague. </sentence><sentence id="4250">He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was able to understand his writing except for one two-page -- I couldn't even call it a report. </sentence><sentence id="4251">It was more like a love letter to Rumkowski. </sentence><sentence id="4252">If you want to read the German version, I can get it for you. </sentence><sentence id="4253">It's available in Lodz and at the University in Giessen. </sentence><sentence id="4254">It does not fit his personality. </sentence><sentence id="4255">It does not fit his other reports. </sentence><sentence id="4256">It does not fit the man because he very well knew and realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating. </sentence><sentence id="4257">He followed orders. </sentence><sentence id="4258">Whether he followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he didn't have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of resistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated. </sentence><sentence id="4259">So, this last entry to Rumkowski could have only meant that he took it there and got some sort of a reward, which meant additional food, a loaf of bread, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4260">His daughter was my age and I met her through him, and his son was two or three years older, and he cultivated the girls whose father belonged to the police and to other important ghetto institutions. </sentence><sentence id="4261">He worked in the bakery as an electrician. </sentence><sentence id="4262">Strangely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated man and so was his wife, did not send either one of his kids to college, and he could have because Prague was not Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4263">Whether they would not have been college material, I really cannot judge. </sentence><sentence id="4264">But both had trades. </sentence><sentence id="4265">The daughter was a seamstress and the son an electrician. </sentence><sentence id="4266">The wife came from a German-speaking family in Prague, a very bright, very nice woman. </sentence><sentence id="4267">His sister was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="4268">Her husband had been arrested after Prague was occupied, and one did not know his whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the electrical component factory. </sentence><sentence id="4269">And then there were two elderly ladies living in the same household. </sentence><sentence id="4270">They had almost a small apartment on Zgierska Street. </sentence><sentence id="4271">It was very clean and when I could not keep my bread for eight or nine days, I'd give it to my friend, and she would bring me a portion to work everyday. </sentence><sentence id="4272">So, I trusted her with my bread. </sentence><sentence id="4273">What else can I say of the Singer? </sentence><sentence id="4274">The two old ladies, especially one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near Prague. </sentence><sentence id="4275">No children, very wealthy. </sentence><sentence id="4276">I think the husband died or was killed -- or he died in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="4277">In the ghetto, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr.Singer. </sentence><sentence id="4278">I was, about six years ago, at Sonoma State University, and the director of Holocaust Studies is John Steiner. </sentence><sentence id="4279">John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through Auschwitz in spite of the fact that he never knew he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4280">It turns out that one of the ladies living with Dr. Singer was his aunt. </sentence><sentence id="4281">He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="4282">So, I told him the story about the will, and he's now -- I mean, the will was lost in Auschwitz -- he's trying to regain the house near park, and there was also a bank account by the same aunt in Switzerland, but the name and the numbers have never appeared. </sentence><sentence id="4283">So, after 50 years, to come across this little old lady again is very strange. </sentence><sentence id="4284">I found it in a way strange only it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will. </sentence><sentence id="4285">On some level, he must have thought that he would survive the war, because otherwise, why would you do it? </sentence><sentence id="4286">His son had, at times, a radio. </sentence><sentence id="4287">It was in poor shape, it needed constant repair. </sentence><sentence id="4288">We only got the BBC and the progress of the war -- nothing about Warsaw, nothing about our ghetto, nothing about Auschwitz, no idea. </sentence><sentence id="4289">No mention was ever made by Dr.Singer of a place like Auschwitz, like Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="4290">No mention was made by Neftalin, by Spiegel. </sentence><sentence id="4291">It just was not mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="4292">So, it can be assumed that we really didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="4293">Maybe somebody knew, but I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4349">Q: And nobody mentioned Hamburg? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4351">A: No, that you saw from the letter which I got in "47 where it stated they were killed in Auschwitz, and it turned out they were killed in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="4352">So, that is much later information. </sentence><sentence id="4353">The work for Dr. Singer was effortless. </sentence><sentence id="4354">It was boring. </sentence><sentence id="4355">It was dull. </sentence><sentence id="4356">I was a clerk. </sentence><sentence id="4357">It was a large, dark office, and it was terribly lonely, whereas the previous office had people. </sentence><sentence id="4358">Until one day when I got a phone call, would I please appear in police headquarters outside the Balutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkowski, and he told me that I would work in the evening kitchen together with 40 other young women my age who had been for six months in the women's police corps, and they wore uniforms just like the men. </sentence><sentence id="4359">They were mostly young women who had finished matura (ph) either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in deg40, and they strutted around the ghetto in their police uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it was a police corps that lasted probably eight months. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4383">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4385">A: Yeah, and all of these went to work in the Kuechenuhr kueletini (ph) evening kitchen, which was used for a two-week period for deserving workers on a coupon which gave them an evening meal, a little vegetables, sometimes a little starch, and something that looked like a hamburger, but it was round. </sentence><sentence id="4386">What it contained, I really couldn't say. </sentence><sentence id="4387">I ripped mine up and I gave it to Spiegel when he picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="4388">Rumkowski knew about Spiegel and he threatened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4393">Q: Threatened you or threatened Spiegel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4395">A: Threatened me for seeing him. </sentence><sentence id="4396">He told me that he knew. </sentence><sentence id="4397">Who had carried the information, I don't know, but it was common in the ghetto to trade information, to talk to the administration about anything or to denounce people, to no particular gain other than maybe you got a little reward for it, but just to carry gossip. </sentence><sentence id="4398">The young policewomen were all waitresses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4403">Q: Let me stop you for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="4404">Is this the time when Spiegel stops seeing you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4407">A: No, that was before -- after that, he stopped seeing me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4409">Q: After he stopped seeing you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4411">A: End of deg43. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4413">Q: So, perhaps he stopped because he was frightened, or you didn't tell him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4415">A: I didn't tell him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4417">Q: Is it possible that Rumkowski went to Spiegel and said, "Stop"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4419">A: Anything is possible. </sentence><sentence id="4420">I doubt it, but it is possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4423">Q: And, how did you -- that's a question you can't answer. </sentence><sentence id="4424">All of these women who were in the women's police who came in and you're the only one who's in another -- was in another job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4427">A: I was in the office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4429">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4431">A: If we received 50 kilo of carrots, and we had to serve 400 meals, how much did each person get in terms of weight? </sentence><sentence id="4432">So many grams, and I had a little trouble with the arithmetic. </sentence><sentence id="4433">They kitchen was run by a man of the name of Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="4434">He was sort of grandfatherly and kind, and he ran the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="4435">He was the -- there were four of them. </sentence><sentence id="4436">He ran this particular one, and he brought in a young man who helped me with the figuring. </sentence><sentence id="4437">I couldn't manage it. </sentence><sentence id="4438">I could manage it now. </sentence><sentence id="4439">But in the afternoons, he was ordered to leave because this was done clandestine. </sentence><sentence id="4440">Rumkowski did not know, or if he knew, he did not let on, but I was a clerk for that kitchen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4451">Q: All right, I want to go back to being in Singer's office for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="4452">Did you learn anything? </sentence><sentence id="4453">I understand it was boring, but you didn't have colleagues on a regular basis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4457">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4459">Q: But did you learn things about the ghetto from being in that office that you would not have known otherwise or that you did not know before about how things were operating? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4461">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4462">You found out if a factory changed management. </sentence><sentence id="4463">You found if somebody was replaced by somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="4464">You found out if people were in the ghetto yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="4465">You heard a rumor, true or untrue, that Biebow tried to rape Dora Fuchs. </sentence><sentence id="4466">You heard -- you heard all sorts of rumors in that office, some of which you didn't dare put down on paper because there was always the chance of censorship by the Germans, and censorship by the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4467">There were sometimes stories about food rations to be and they never materialized or vice versa. </sentence><sentence id="4468">The information was accurate to the extent that you couldn't substantiate very much. </sentence><sentence id="4469">I mean, even when I picked up the daily statistics, so many died in the hospital, so many jumped out of a window, of course, no births -- there were hardly any births, even these statistics they were kept, but the question arises how accurate where they. </sentence><sentence id="4470">There were quite a few suicides especially from -- committed by people coming from the west -- some were doctors, some were lawyers, and they must have brought something along to make suicide possible. </sentence><sentence id="4471">There was a rumor that the ghetto had some doctors. </sentence><sentence id="4472">There was a lady by the name of Kronan Burke (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4473">There was Dr. Miller, who was Rumkowski's favorite doctor, but no medication. </sentence><sentence id="4474">There was a lady dentist who operated a drill with a foot pedal, like an old fashioned sewing machine, and you heard about them. </sentence><sentence id="4475">You heard, for instance, that if you were jaundiced or if you had hepatitis, atropine would help, an injection of atropine. </sentence><sentence id="4476">Whether this is true today, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="4477">Atropine could be somehow smuggled into the ghetto if you knew a German of the guard. </sentence><sentence id="4478">These things you heard in the office, but you could never vouch for honesty or credibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4498">Q: And did Singer write down more than ever went into the Chronicle? </sentence><sentence id="4499">He had many more -- because I'm sure when he went out to talk with the people, he must have taken down notes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4502">A: He took very brief notes, but then- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4504">Q: He would write... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4506">A: Then it got... They're all typewritten on an old-fashioned manual typewriter. </sentence><sentence id="4507">They have some errors. </sentence><sentence id="4508">All of his entries will be out in January in German, and if you'd like it, I'll get it for you. </sentence><sentence id="4509">His counterpart was Oskar Rosenfeld, also from Prague, and his -- he had not nearly as many entries. </sentence><sentence id="4510">He was much older. </sentence><sentence id="4511">He had a very young wife in England and he was very grandfatherly, very sweet, very kind -- a totally different style because when I was at the Justice Liebzig University, they gave me a stack of these reportages and they asked me to identify them and said, "Here is Singer's." </sentence><sentence id="4512">And I went through them. </sentence><sentence id="4513">I said, "No, this is not Singer. </sentence><sentence id="4514">This is Oskar Rosenfeld." </sentence><sentence id="4515">And it was correct -- totally different style. </sentence><sentence id="4516">I didn't know him as well as Singer because he worked in the office, but I didn't work for him. </sentence><sentence id="4517">His book supposedly was just published in English by Hanna Levy, either Frankfurt at the Bauer Institute in Frankfurt, or it came out in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="4518">I'm not sure which. </sentence><sentence id="4519">And Hanna Levy did the editing and it supposedly came out in English. </sentence><sentence id="4520">I have not seen it. </sentence><sentence id="4521">And I'm not as familiar with his entries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4539">Q: So, you didn't type these reports? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4541">A: Some I did type wherever there was a typewriter available, but there was only one and I was not the only one who had access to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4543">Q: So, when you say you were clerking, what would that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4545">A: I would transcribe some of Singer's notes in longhand. </sentence><sentence id="4546">I would file things. </sentence><sentence id="4547">I would give him the daily statistics. </sentence><sentence id="4548">I would do very menial work -- nothing of any consequence or substance, but I did read what he wrote because it was an interesting style. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4553">Q: So, you weren't completely, given the kind of job you were doing, you were not completely unhappy going to the kitchen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4555">A: No, because it meant an extra meal. </sentence><sentence id="4556">It was from five to seven in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="4557">People lined up and had a coupon, and, well, Rumkowski came almost every evening, and the apron of the waitress, if the bow in the back was not straight, he would hit her with a cane. </sentence><sentence id="4558">He carried a cane. </sentence><sentence id="4559">He threatened a couple of them with dismissal. </sentence><sentence id="4560">In the front sat two ladies who clipped the coupon which had to be counted every morning -- two ladies? </sentence><sentence id="4561">Two young women. </sentence><sentence id="4562">The cooking was done by a couple of lady chefs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4571">Q: Let's hold here. </sentence><sentence id="4572">We have to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4575"> End of Tape 4 Tape 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4578">Q: Lucille, we'll talking about the kitchen, and you were mentioning, before we were talking about the actual cooking, there were people at the -- women at the door clipping coupons. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4580">Where did people get the coupons? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4581">A: You got them in the factory, you got them in an office, if your boss decided that you deserved a bonus. </sentence><sentence id="4582">And of course it was -- there were never enough coupons to go around the ghetto, but it was an incentive or a gift for some of them. </sentence><sentence id="4583">There was a lot of favoritism involved as to who got them. </sentence><sentence id="4584">If you were well connected, you could be sure to get the coupon. </sentence><sentence id="4585">It was -- it was an original idea to reward a worker because it was said the straw shoe factory rewarded 12 workers, not bosses, but 12 workers, or the uniform factory rewarded 10 workers. </sentence><sentence id="4586">It was supposed to be an incentive to work hard, to try to top the quota, and in the end to please the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4593">Q: One dinner for one coupon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4595">A: Yes, one dinner for one coupon, but you got a week at a time. </sentence><sentence id="4596">You could come for seven days. </sentence><sentence id="4597">So, you got seven coupons. </sentence><sentence id="4598">It was one coupon and you cut off seven strips. </sentence><sentence id="4599">At one point, they tried to do it for two weeks, and then somebody else got a turn. </sentence><sentence id="4600">How it was decided, administered, as to who got them, or which factory -- that was done behind closed doors, I do not know, but there was a lot of protection involved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4607">Q: And your job was figuring out the mathematics of we have this much food and how much for each person? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4609">A: Well, we had this much food for the week, divide that by seven, and then divide by the number of clients or the number of diners who would come, and how much each person would consume in grams. </sentence><sentence id="4610">For instance, it would be 50 grams of meat which equals about an ounce. </sentence><sentence id="4611">It would be so much red beets, but the figuring was complicated. </sentence><sentence id="4612">There was no adding machine. </sentence><sentence id="4613">There was no calculator. </sentence><sentence id="4614">I had to take a pen and pencil and you had to convert the kilos to pounds and the pounds to grams, and in Poland they used the word "deca" which meant ten grams. </sentence><sentence id="4615">So, it was a little overwhelming for me. </sentence><sentence id="4616">I mean, I wasn't bad at math, but I wasn't that good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4626">Q: And who decided what the menu would be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4628">A: That depended -- well, the -- Mr. Mintzer was in charge of the kitchen, and it depended on the supply. </sentence><sentence id="4629">They would -- they would send -- they would come on a horse-drawn truck, sort of like a flatbed truck but horse-drawn, and they would either unload or sack or a crate or sometimes it was flour, sometimes it was carrots or beets or turnips, very rarely potatoes, sometimes meat, and from the looks of it, it was horsemeat because it was very dark red, and it was all served on one plate, in little portions, and the portions were pretty much equal, almost if you would take an ice cream scoop. </sentence><sentence id="4630">We were entitled the same meal an hour before our guests would appear with the rule that nothing was supposed to be taken out, but we did anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4634">Q: And how many people per evening usually? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4636">A: Well, the so-called dining room was filled up. </sentence><sentence id="4637">I would say probably 200. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4640">Q: That's a lot of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4642">A: 150-200, but not for a ghetto of 160,000 people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4644">Q: Was there a large kitchen, or was it a very makeshift kind of thing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4646">A: No, it was a large kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="4647">It had big kettles. </sentence><sentence id="4648">The cooks were ladies, and they were standing on a platform stirring ferociously at those kettles, and we would come in and look and they didn't like it, and in the back of the kitchen was a storage room, and the storage room had the supply. </sentence><sentence id="4649">The young woman who ran the storage room was somewhat older than we were, I guess, close to 30. </sentence><sentence id="4650">Her name was Meyerowitz, and she carried the key to the storage room around her neck, and you were not allowed to go over the threshold into that storage room. </sentence><sentence id="4651">She would reach -- she would weigh, count, whatever, and she would reach the food out, and I was a little friendly with her, and if I would come near the entrance she would say, "Stop, stand there and talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="4652">Don't go further." </sentence><sentence id="4653">Because I might touch something or take something. </sentence><sentence id="4654">She was very meticulous for reasons of her own. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4665">Q: And were you also the youngest person working in the kitchen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4667">A: No, there were two or three people younger than I. Most were older than I, but there was a young woman that -- three young women who were younger than I am, but not by much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4669">Q: Rumkowski came in every night -- to eat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4671">A: Almost every -- no. </sentence><sentence id="4672">No, he had decent food. </sentence><sentence id="4673">I mean, if you look at his prewar picture -- his rumpled shirt, his rumpled pants, his disheveled hair -- he was a poor man. </sentence><sentence id="4674">When he showed up in the ghetto, he was pressed and tailored, immaculate -- boots, he wore boots -- SS-type boots -- shined. </sentence><sentence id="4675">Lodz had very good tailors. </sentence><sentence id="4676">I think the best in all of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4677">His top coats, his jackets were out of Fifth Avenue -- unbelievable, elegant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4685">Q: So, he comes in and he's sort of a monster to people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4687">A: Well, he comes in -- he was very proud of his achievement, and I guess it was an achievement, but the people -- the young people who worked for him were petrified of him because he would beat them and if he was displeased, he would dismiss them, and that was a risk you took. </sentence><sentence id="4688">A couple of girls I knew were dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="4689">One of them managed through connections to come back. </sentence><sentence id="4690">It was a good job, but it was a risky job in some ways. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4709">Q: Now, I'm a little confused about timeframe when it comes to the various conversations you had with people about Rumkowski. </sentence><sentence id="4710">Spiegel says things to you -- that he's a pig or a pest, and that one has to be careful of him. </sentence><sentence id="4711">You meet other people Shlomo (ph), Branya, Luba. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5050">Q: Touching him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5052">A: Yes, and it was disgusting. </sentence><sentence id="5053">The fear was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="5054">Not only the fear of the beating, but the fear of his power. </sentence><sentence id="5055">The fear that he could decide over life and death, that he could deport, that he could denounce to the Germans, that he could do just about anything. </sentence><sentence id="5056">That fear was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="5057">He wanted to know about my family. </sentence><sentence id="5058">He wanted to know who was living in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="5059">He wanted to know if they were well-off. </sentence><sentence id="5060">He made me promise that after the war I would see to it that they would help him, both to get to Palestine and to give him money because I owed him that. </sentence><sentence id="5061">And he made one remark that struck me then, it strikes me now. " </sentence><sentence id="5062">If I can save a hundred human beings, it will have been worthwhile." </sentence><sentence id="5063">I tried to figure out the "it" in the sentence. </sentence><sentence id="5064">He spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="5065">What would have been worthwhile? </sentence><sentence id="5066">The death of so many others, the collaboration, the cooperation with the Germans, a hundred human beings out of 150,000? </sentence><sentence id="5067">It -- it shocked me. </sentence><sentence id="5068">That and the children, "Give me your children." </sentence><sentence id="5069">Those remarks I could neither forget nor forgive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5093">Q: He beat you several times? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5095">A: With a stick, over the shoulder, over the head. </sentence><sentence id="5096">He was not as steady on his feet as a normal 65 year old, mainly because he probably wore those crazy boots and it wasn't easy to walk with boots up to your knees. </sentence><sentence id="5097">You just know that when he was displeased he would beat people. </sentence><sentence id="5098">Whether those were the girls in the kitchen or anybody else, it really didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="5099">If you were lucky, you flinched and you hoped there were no further consequences. </sentence><sentence id="5100">But he was every bit as frightening as an SS --I found out later -- as an SS man in uniform. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5127">Q: You cried. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5129">A: Icried. </sentence><sentence id="5130">You didn't hear a sound. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5133">Q: Did he beat you more when you cried? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5135">A: No, he just -- he vented his anger or his frustration, and if I cried, so I cried. </sentence><sentence id="5136">That didn't bother him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5139">Q: Did he try to kiss you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5145">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5147">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="5148">Do you have any idea why, when you refused, he said, "You can't refuse." </sentence><sentence id="5149">He wouldn't have said, "You can't refuse me. </sentence><sentence id="5150">I'm going to move you into an apartment." </sentence><sentence id="5151">Because he clearly had the power to do so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5157">A: He had the power to do so. </sentence><sentence id="5158">My crying probably stalled for time, or gave me time, and the time was the food ran out and the kitchen had to be closed, and everybody in that kitchen was transferred to the leather factory, to the Saddlery. </sentence><sentence id="5159">So- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5163">Q: So, you don't know what he would have done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5165">A: No, but there was one woman about ten years older than I who took him up on the offer of a room on the other side of the kitchen, but she didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="5166">She was only stupid enough not to cover the windows, and she was dumb enough to talk. </sentence><sentence id="5167">But she was much older -- much, much older, at least ten years older. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5171">Q: So, clearly this was happening with a number of women- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5173">A: Right </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5175">Q: -in that kitchen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5177">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5179">Q: You were not the only one pointed out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5181">A: Yes, he also went into the storeroom where the provisions were kept and the door was locked. </sentence><sentence id="5182">That's all I know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5185">Q: So, how long were you working in this kitchen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5187">A: I think it lasted about three months, four months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5189">Q: And how often did he try to come and see you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5191">A: Every other day, at least. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5193">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5195">A: Yeah, because it was his accomplishment, his pride and joy, his -- his child, I mean, this brainstorm of having a kitchen for deserving workers. </sentence><sentence id="5196">I mean, what else could he give them?Money didn't mean a thing. </sentence><sentence id="5197">The only thing that meant anything was food. </sentence><sentence id="5198">So, he came just to make sure that everything was running properly, because there was a lot of theft, there was a lot of corruption, there was a lot of dishonesty, and we all knew. </sentence><sentence id="5199">It was unavoidable. </sentence><sentence id="5200">It was understandable. </sentence><sentence id="5201">So, for at least three months, he came at least every other day. </sentence><sentence id="5202">You never knew when he would come. </sentence><sentence id="5203">You could hear the horse's hooves outside, the clicking, and then, who else had a horse? </sentence><sentence id="5204">And, then in the hallway, you could hear his footsteps because he walked very unevenly and very noisily. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5216">Q: Approximately how many times did he come to see you in particular? </sentence><sentence id="5217">Do you remember how many? </sentence><sentence id="5218">A few times a week, once a week? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5222">A: Oh, it would be at least two or three times a week, at least twice a week. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5224">Q: Did you talk to Luba about this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5226">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="5227">She had an idea because she was much smarter than I was, and I did ask her about pregnancy, and she laughed. </sentence><sentence id="5228">She laughed so hard, and she said, "Don't you know how you get pregnant?" </sentence><sentence id="5229">And I really didn't know, and -- but, that really didn't change anything. </sentence><sentence id="5230">I went once to see Dr. Kronenburg, and she looked at me as if I was a little bit out of my mind, but she was kind, and she said, "Go back; don't worry." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5236">Q: So, did you explain to the doctor what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5238">A: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5240">Q: And she said you don't have to worry about pregnancy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5242">A: Don't have to worry, she said, "Besides, you're not menstruating. </sentence><sentence id="5243">Why are you worrying?" </sentence><sentence id="5244">And I said, "What does that have to do with it?" </sentence><sentence id="5245">It was very complicated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5250">Q: Did you menstruate at all during the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5252">A: Nobody did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5254">Q: Nobody did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5256">A: Nobody did, lack of food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5258">Q: Had you menstruated before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5260">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5262">Q: Of course, and you just stopped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5264">A: Itjust stopped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5266">Q: Was she, the doctor, shocked at what you told her about what Rumkowski was doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5268">A: I don't think she was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="5269">She was an older woman who probably had children my age. </sentence><sentence id="5270">She was well-known. </sentence><sentence id="5271">She was an MD. </sentence><sentence id="5272">She was not a fe/czer, because the ghetto had a lot of doctors that were -- like, what should I say -- first-aid man, or medical corpsman and they were called a felczer, from falsifying the word comes, but they were called doctors because there was a scarcity of doctors and hospitals otherwise, and she was too smart and too intelligent and probably slightly amused. </sentence><sentence id="5273">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5281">Q: Amused? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5283">A: Yes, that I would be so stupid, and she said, "It's all right, child, go home." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5285">Q: So, she didn't ask you anything about what this was doing to you or what- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5287">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5289">Q: - because this was not relevant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5291">A: No, it wasn't relevant. </sentence><sentence id="5292">You -- the ghetto did not have time, compassion, or patience for anyone's mental well-being. </sentence><sentence id="5293">That did not exist, and didn't exist during most of the war. </sentence><sentence id="5294">It didn't even exist in 1946 in New York. </sentence><sentence id="5295">So, this is human nature. </sentence><sentence id="5296">You just shrug, and you figure it out by yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5303">Q: And, even Luba laughed because of your thinking that you could pregnant from this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5305">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5307">Q: Did she say anything else to you about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5309">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5311">Q: About Rumkowski? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5313">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5315">Q: So, you didn't talk- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5317">A: She told me that she had known him since childhood, since the orphanage, but their relationship, their talk was so relaxed and so easy, it wasn't on the basis of "Sir." </sentence><sentence id="5318">It was on the basis of "you", and you don't call the president "you;" you call him "Mr. President." </sentence><sentence id="5319">Even in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="5320">So, it was fairly obvious that there was a connection, somehow, somewhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5325">Q: Did she in some sense after all these years, gain some power, now that she was a woman and not a girl, with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5327">A: Well, the power she gained was the additional food, the apartment, those were the obvious gains. </sentence><sentence id="5328">She managed all sorts of strange things. </sentence><sentence id="5329">She lived in a small room, a small apartment, and it was cold and you couldn't heat it, but you could get the element, which is the spiral that fits into a heater, for instance, and she strung it across the room from right to left, but you couldn't hook it up to meter because the Germans would have known. </sentence><sentence id="5330">So, she got in an electrician to hook it up above the meter, so it would not show the numbers on the individual room meters. </sentence><sentence id="5331">I mean, she knew things that nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="5332">She knew how to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5339">Q: Actually, what I meant was that in some way she had a certain kind of power with Rumkowski. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5341">A: She didn't use it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5343">Q: She didn't use it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5345">A: No, on the contrary, she was very relaxed and she was very sweet, very smiley. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5347">Q: To him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5349">A: Yeah, very outgoing, jovial, joking, because in the end, she got a reward. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5351">Q: So, when this is happening, that he's forcing you in essence to masturbate him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5353">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5355">Q: Where are you in your head? </sentence><sentence id="5356">Do you go somewhere? </sentence><sentence id="5357">Do you leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5361">A: Fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5363">Q: You're in fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5365">A: Fear, just fear, cold fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5367">Q: And it's the same thing each time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5369">A: Over and over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5371">Q: And it only stops because the kitchen is closed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5373">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5375">Q: You think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5377">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="5378">Maybe he would have found another toy, but the kitchen closed on Monday and on Tuesday we were working in the Saddlery, all of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5381">Q: Was that hard work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5383">A: Yes, it was sewing the metal frames that go around a shovel that a soldier carries on his belt to dig a trench, and those were sewn on a goat or a causa (ph), as you say in a Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="5384">That means you sit on a bench and in front of you is like a head with a vice, with a wooden vice, and you put the leather into -- the two pieces of leather into the wooden vice, you have an awl to punch the whole, and then you have a long string with two needles, one right, one left -- and you sew a double stitch like this, and it was piecework. </sentence><sentence id="5385">I mean, they counted it, and once in a while, there were ten strips to a unit. </sentence><sentence id="5386">Once in awhile, we were a strip short, and then you had to go to the foreman, who was a young man our age and you had to do a lot of explaining and a lot of excusing, and then you would get another strip, but they were counted out carefully because the Germans had shipped them carefully. </sentence><sentence id="5387">The reason my strips disappeared is I stole them. </sentence><sentence id="5388">I stole six strips because my shoes had no soles, and I put them in the top of my boots, and I walked through the inspection; it was like at the airport. </sentence><sentence id="5389">They would tap you from neck to the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="5390">Occasionally you had to undress, and I only told about it after I had all six out. </sentence><sentence id="5391">Nobody knew, and people thought I must have lost my mind, but I had no soles for the winter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5401">Q: And, then you get somebody to fix them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5403">A: I got a shoemaker to sole the shoes, and the reason he didn't talk is because he could keep half of the strips, and he could sell them for bread. </sentence><sentence id="5404">I think it's about the only time I stole. </sentence><sentence id="5405">That's why I never bought a pair of boots, never. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5409">Q: And you didn't buy a pair of boots because -- weren't these boots something that were made for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5411">A: The boots came from an old hatbox that my mother had, and when I had them made, I gave half the hatbox to the shoemaker. </sentence><sentence id="5412">And in Poland, there are two shoemakers; one who makes the uppers and one who makes the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="5413">One makes the uppers are the kupita (ph), and the bottom is the shaftsa (ph), and it's two procedures. </sentence><sentence id="5414">It's like a designer, designing the upper part, and then putting the sole on it. </sentence><sentence id="5415">And the reason I got them made was that I left them have the box, half the hatbox because it had a top and a bottom. </sentence><sentence id="5416">The side were sort of stiff, and -- but they only lasted one winter or maybe a winter and a half and I came through the soles, and I had frostbite, and they were pull up boots in sort of a nice brown leather, but much too soft for shoes. </sentence><sentence id="5417">They were for a hatbox, not for shoes. </sentence><sentence id="5418">But I had enough room below the knee to get a thin item into it like a strip of leather, and those I stole. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5427">Q: So, why is that you've never bought a pair of boots since then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5429">A: Because I remember those boots. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5431">Q: And never wanted another pair of boots? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5433">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="5434">I couldn't, because my mother used the box for hats before the war. </sentence><sentence id="5435">I never bought a pair of boots. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5439">Q: It's good you lived in California. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5441">A: Probably, but in California there were boots. </sentence><sentence id="5442">It's fashionable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5445">Q: That's true. </sentence><sentence id="5446">So, did these -- when they fixed the boots, it was okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5449">A: Yes, but the frostbite remained. </sentence><sentence id="5450">I saved the toes, but barely. </sentence><sentence id="5451">And once in awhile, they lose all circulation and they turn greenish-blue. </sentence><sentence id="5452">But I kept them. </sentence><sentence id="5453">I mean, I didn't lose any toes. </sentence><sentence id="5454">They thawed out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5461">Q: And how long were you working in the leather factory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5463">A: Until deportation out of the ghetto in fall of deg44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5465">Q: And you get there a few months before. </sentence><sentence id="5466">You worked there a few months or longer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5469">A: Yes, I worked there a few months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5471">Q: And, Rumkowski doesn't follow you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5473">A: No, never -- never saw him again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5475">Q: And, do you ever talk to anyone else before you leave the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5477">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5479">Q: Does it in some way leave your mind or does it wear on you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5481">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="5482">If you went through the war, nothing leaves your mind. </sentence><sentence id="5483">It's filed away under Z or Y. You don't think of it every minute or every day, but once in awhile, something comes back. </sentence><sentence id="5484">I was at the airport in Munich in September, and it was of course after New York, and there the Germans stood in their uniforms and their black boots, and one of them started yelling, "You can't use this door. </sentence><sentence id="5485">Use that door." </sentence><sentence id="5486">And normally I don't understand German, I just understand English, and it brought back, ""What are you, Gestapo?" </sentence><sentence id="5487">I just -- it just came back. </sentence><sentence id="5488">I didn't do it on purpose. </sentence><sentence id="5489">There are flashbacks when I'm under stress, but not otherwise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5499">Q: And when you wrote the first part of your autobiography, From Ashes to Life, there's a hint of this -- what happened with Rumkowski. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5501">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5503">Q: Why did it take you a few years more to decide that you would write about this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5505">A: Because it's difficult to admit this. </sentence><sentence id="5506">The times have changed. </sentence><sentence id="5507">We hear now of abuse of children. </sentence><sentence id="5508">We hear now of abuse of wives. </sentence><sentence id="5509">Twenty years ago, we didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="5510">It's very painful to go public with something you're not proud of. </sentence><sentence id="5511">What should I have done? </sentence><sentence id="5512">Maybe I should have run away. </sentence><sentence id="5513">Maybe I should have slapped him. </sentence><sentence id="5514">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="5515">Maybe I should have done something. </sentence><sentence id="5516">It's difficult to say, and that's why I didn't write it. </sentence><sentence id="5517">The other reason I didn't write it is because my mother used to say, "If you can't say something good about a human being, don't say it." </sentence><sentence id="5518">And I agonized with that for years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5533">Q: Do you think that in some ways it helps people to understand something about Rumkowski that they couldn't understand otherwise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5535">A: I don't know whether people now really can understand our past. </sentence><sentence id="5536">I think you have to have lived through it to understand it emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="5537">Intellectually, maybe -- I can't expect my children to understand the past or what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="5538">It's not possible. </sentence><sentence id="5539">The Holocaust has become a matter of scholarly research, of history, and it is viewed differently than it is viewed by those who were there. </sentence><sentence id="5540">It is unavoidable, and it will change more in 20 years when we are gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5547">Q: For me, if I can just say this, in my innocence, I would have thought that someone who took care of children in an orphanage was a different kind of person. </sentence><sentence id="5548">Even knowing all I know about child abuse, and knowing this makes it much more understandable how he becomes such a dictator within the context of Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="5549">Because it is a very odd move, it would appear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5553">A: Yeah, but look at the people who work as nurses in a hospital and kill people by injection. </sentence><sentence id="5554">Wouldn't you expect that their training, the intellect -- after all, they went to college -- and their medical knowledge, to do just the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="5555">And what is it in human nature that makes us inhuman? </sentence><sentence id="5556">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5562">Q: Maybe being human. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5564">A: Maybe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5566">Q: Do people believe you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5568">A: People believe me, except for Germany, where I was told, "We are having a problem with the subject of all the Jewish elders." </sentence><sentence id="5569">And I cannot understand why. </sentence><sentence id="5570">As I explained to them, politely at first, "If you had not invaded Poland, if you had not created the ghettos, if you had not kept us prison within the ghettos, we would have had no Jewish elders. </sentence><sentence id="5571">So, you shouldn't have a problem because these are facts." </sentence><sentence id="5572">If you question the honesty, I can only say, "Were you there?" </sentence><sentence id="5573">If you were not there, it's easy to talk. </sentence><sentence id="5574">So, that's the only thing I encountered, in Germany, not in this country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5582">Q: Not even with scholars? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5584">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5586">Q: They accept what you say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5588">A: They would like to see evidence. </sentence><sentence id="5589">They know of other quotes in other books, of other paragraphs. </sentence><sentence id="5590">They know of the dismissed complaint, which happened in the mid "30s. </sentence><sentence id="5591">It is not something that appeared out of nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="5592">The indications were there. </sentence><sentence id="5593">The knowledge was there, but in the "30s, for a Jewish community to admit something like this is overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="5594">You couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="5595">The publicity would have been devastating, and it wasn't done. </sentence><sentence id="5596">I mean, there were a lot of taboos in the "30s, and lots of things that were never mentioned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5606">Q: I'm trying to figure out where to go right now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5608">A: All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5610">Q: Because it's late, and I know that you're after the deportation from Lodz, you were a couple of weeks in Auschwitz, and then you moved to Hamburg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5612">A: Dessauer Ufer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5614">Q: Right, to do heavy construction? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5616">A: Yes, which was a camp, and out-, a sub-camp of Neuengamme, and from there they moved us to Sasel, to build temporary housing for the Germans for the bombed out Germans, and from there to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5618">Q: And, you were in Bergen-Belsen in "45? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5620">A: Yes, March "45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5622">Q: So, you're there for about a month before the British come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5624">A: Just about, and I wouldn't have made it much longer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5626">Q: It was horrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5628">A: The dead were not buried. </sentence><sentence id="5629">The dead were lying on the walkways. </sentence><sentence id="5630">Typhus was rampant. </sentence><sentence id="5631">The dead were not even thrown into the pits. </sentence><sentence id="5632">They were decaying. </sentence><sentence id="5633">People died by the hundreds. </sentence><sentence id="5634">The Germans did not enter the camp any longer. </sentence><sentence id="5635">They remained on the other side of the barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="5636">The camp was guarded from watchtowers by Hungarian -- by soldiers in Hungarian uniforms who were vicious, who shot a great deal, and I think another three to four weeks and Bergen-Belsen would have been empty. </sentence><sentence id="5637">Nobody would have survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5648">Q: And were you ill by this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5650">A: [had typhus and just before, and my friend who was killed in Sweden at least gave me some water. </sentence><sentence id="5651">I had jaundice in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="5652">I had liver problems in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="5653">I had kidney trouble, and a few other little things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5658">Q: So, did you think that it could worse after leaving Lodz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5660">A: No, I didn't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5662">Q: But it did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5664">A: Yes and no, because Lodz lasted three full years and the horror was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="5665">Bergen- Belsen was as horrible, maybe more so, but of shorter duration. </sentence><sentence id="5666">So, the impact for me was the ghetto and not Bergen-Belsen because by Bergen-Belsen, you really didn't care anymore. </sentence><sentence id="5667">There was not enough energy left to care. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5672">Q: When you're deported from Lodz, do you know what's going on in the war? </sentence><sentence id="5673">Have you heard any-? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5676">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5678">Q: So, you know nothing. </sentence><sentence id="5679">You were so- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5682">A: We were in cattle cars and looking through the slits above. </sentence><sentence id="5683">You had to stand on somebody's shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="5684">You saw troop trains on adjacent tracks. </sentence><sentence id="5685">You saw other trains with men in striped gray and blue uniforms that were shouting something at us, which you of course could not hear. </sentence><sentence id="5686">I sat in a corner together with Dr. Singer, his sister, his wife and his two children. </sentence><sentence id="5687">The last time I saw him was in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="5688">How he died in Auschwitz, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="5689">Somebody in Germany claimed he was shot. </sentence><sentence id="5690">I rather doubt it. </sentence><sentence id="5691">I think he was very gaunt looking and he looked much older than his age. </sentence><sentence id="5692">I think he just went to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="5693">I spent the whole rest of the war with his daughter partly with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="5694">His wife died right after liberation of Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="5695">His sister survived and died in London. </sentence><sentence id="5696">It's really immaterial how he died. </sentence><sentence id="5697">He didn't make it out of Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5714">Q: But all during that period, from end of August, September when you arrived in Auschwitz in September of "44 until April of "45, you were not sure what was going on -- who's winning, who's losing, how it's going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5716">A: We heard some distant air raids in and around the city of Hamburg, but it was not the major attack of "43. </sentence><sentence id="5717">We heard rumors because adjacent to us were some Italian prisoners of war and in Neuengamme were French prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="5718">We heard rumors, but we had heard rumors for five years. </sentence><sentence id="5719">We had no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5724">Q: I know that we can go on for a few more hours, which we will not do now. </sentence><sentence id="5725">But what I would like to do, and maybe well just take one more tape -- maybe we'll stop now. </sentence><sentence id="5726">I" tell you what. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5730">What I think I would like to do because I would like to end this on a very sweet, romantic note. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5731">A: All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5747">A: The deportation was by street. </sentence><sentence id="5748">The streets were posted which were off limits as part of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="5749">My street was very early on the list. </sentence><sentence id="5750">That meant if you did not vacate or if the Jews did not vacate that street, the Germans would take us out or shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="5751">I'm not sure which. </sentence><sentence id="5752">So, you took whatever you could carry, and you vacated your rooms or room, and you could walk to the other side of the bridge if you knew somebody there and stay there for awhile if they would let you in, or you could go voluntarily to the railroad siding. </sentence><sentence id="5753">I started walking and I knocked on Luba's door because she was on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="5754">Her boyfriend answered the door. </sentence><sentence id="5755">I told him who I was, and he said in Polish and not very politely, "Get lost." </sentence><sentence id="5756">He didn't open the door. </sentence><sentence id="5757">I knocked on another door. </sentence><sentence id="5758">A friend -- a coworker who was living with her elderly mother and whose boyfriend had died Warsaw of typhus, probably about 1940, but they shared the apartment with the captain of the Sonder police and his wife and I think a child, and when I knocked there, the captain from the other side of the door told me, "You either leave or...". </sentence><sentence id="5759">So, I had no choice left but walk, and it was very warm, to the railroad siding in Marysin, and there were quite a lot of people milling around with their little bundles or suitcases. </sentence><sentence id="5760">I had a little suitcase and my father's briefcase, and the briefcase held documents -- papers, passports, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="5761">And I saw to the left of me Oskar Singer and his family, and they said, "Come on over. </sentence><sentence id="5762">We'll go together." </sentence><sentence id="5763">We stood there probably for a couple of hours in the heat. </sentence><sentence id="5764">The Germans put up the ramp to the cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="5765">We each received a piece of bread, a half a loaf of bread, some received a whole bread, and some received some sort of a sausage, but we did not -- nothing to drink. </sentence><sentence id="5766">We entered the cattle car, and I sat with Oskar's family in one corner. </sentence><sentence id="5767">There were the two old ladies, Oskar and his wife, his two children, his sister, and I. And, when we asked him, "Where are we going?" </sentence><sentence id="5768">He shrugged his shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="5769">He said, "Probably west for labor." </sentence><sentence id="5770">That was the best guess. </sentence><sentence id="5771">The cattle cars were closed from the outside, and they moved in stops and starts because there were other trains on the same siding that were given preference. </sentence><sentence id="5772">Either they were prisoners from other areas or they were troop movements. </sentence><sentence id="5773">We were never sure. </sentence><sentence id="5774">We tried to yell over to a different car, but of course that doesn't work. </sentence><sentence id="5775">We sat in these hot cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="5776">Some people cried. </sentence><sentence id="5777">Some people fainted. </sentence><sentence id="5778">There was a bucket in the corner. </sentence><sentence id="5779">The bucket soon overflowed. </sentence><sentence id="5780">You couldn't lie down. </sentence><sentence id="5781">You could barely sit. </sentence><sentence id="5782">And there was really no energy to think, "What next? </sentence><sentence id="5783">Where next?" </sentence><sentence id="5784">At one point, somebody spoke of jumping out of the car, but the doors never opened. </sentence><sentence id="5785">There was no jumping. </sentence><sentence id="5786">The next time the door opened was four in the morning two days later with a concrete platform, brightly lit and dogs barking, and SS shouting commands. </sentence><sentence id="5787">We scrambled out of the car, and we stood. </sentence><sentence id="5788">They shouted orders, "Men to the left. </sentence><sentence id="5789">Women to the right." </sentence><sentence id="5790">And I stood with the women, with the single women. </sentence><sentence id="5791">Oskar and his son went to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="5792">And they were soon marched off into the distance. </sentence><sentence id="5793">We don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="5794">We don't how they were separated again, because at this point there was no separation between young and old. </sentence><sentence id="5795">We lined up, and I held the briefcase. </sentence><sentence id="5796">I held onto that briefcase with the papers. </sentence><sentence id="5797">Having grown up in Germany, papers are very important. </sentence><sentence id="5798">And the command was shouted, "Drop your belongings." </sentence><sentence id="5799">Which meant a knapsack, a bag, whatever you had, but I wouldn't let go of the briefcase, and an SS walked towards my friend, Dr. Singer's daughter, and towards me and he shouted again and she took the briefcase and tore it out of my hand, and he shouted back, ""You saved yourself a beating." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5854">Q: So, who tore it out of your hand -- Singer's daughter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5856">A: His daughter made me drop it. </sentence><sentence id="5857">She just tore it and dropped it. </sentence><sentence id="5858">She probably saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="5859">A little further down the road, the separated the old from the young. </sentence><sentence id="5860">In back stood a woman who lived also on Pawia Street, and that's another story, with a four year old child, a very ugly child and I've never really seen an ugly child. </sentence><sentence id="5861">The child was locked up while the parents went to work in the daytime. </sentence><sentence id="5862">The child whined. </sentence><sentence id="5863">The child was hidden behind a chimney during the selection, during the curfew for hours alone, and in Auschwitz, she stood behind us. </sentence><sentence id="5864">She was ordered to let the child go because she was probably in her "30s, and she wouldn't let the child go, and the SS man hit them between the two hands holding onto each other, and they didn't let go. </sentence><sentence id="5865">The child screamed terribly, but they wouldn't let go, and his last remarks were, "You may both go to the gas chamber." </sentence><sentence id="5866">And they were marched off with the old people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5885">A: Nothing, what's a gas chamber? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5887">Q: It didn't make any sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5889">A: No, it didn't make any sense. </sentence><sentence id="5890">By evening it did, when I saw the smoke and when the grapevine carried the words forward. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5893">Q: But not then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5895">A: No, and one was so bewildered by this whole scene that one didn't think. </sentence><sentence id="5896">We heard that there was a family camp in Auschwitz which we never saw. </sentence><sentence id="5897">We heard that there were gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="5898">We never saw them. </sentence><sentence id="5899">We did see Hungarian women. </sentence><sentence id="5900">There was a young man in a striped uniform with an armband ___, red, and he spoke Polish to us and he said, "Where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="5901">And we said, "From Lodz." </sentence><sentence id="5902">And we asked him, "Where are we?" </sentence><sentence id="5903">And he said, "Auschwitz." </sentence><sentence id="5904">And, my friend asked, "What's Auschwitz?" </sentence><sentence id="5905">He said, "You mean to say you don't know?" " </sentence><sentence id="5906">No, never heard of it." </sentence><sentence id="5907">He said, "I've been here a year and a half, two years." </sentence><sentence id="5908">He didn't come from Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="5909">He came from someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="5910">He couldn't understand, but he did ask us whether we knew his sister who might have been in our transport. </sentence><sentence id="5911">And there was a woman who recognized a mother who had been there a while, and she brought extra food, but that was already the next day. </sentence><sentence id="5912">From there, they marched us those that were fit-looking or not elderly or not children anymore, into a barracks. </sentence><sentence id="5913">We were asked to undress, drop all jewelry, fold the clothing neatly, and then they took us to another barracks and they shaved our hair, and Dr. Singer's daughter asked, ""Couldn't we rather have a number?" </sentence><sentence id="5914">and, the answer was, "Here you take what you get. </sentence><sentence id="5915">You don't ask for anything." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5938">Q: Where did she get the idea to ask for a number? </sentence><sentence id="5939">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5942">A: She saw some women kappa with numbers who did the actual shaving under SS orders. </sentence><sentence id="5943">And as we were walked out of that barracks, the upper half of the door was glass and I saw my head minus hair and two big ears and it looked like an egg and I started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="5944">It looked so horrible that today I'm asking myself, "How could I have been so stupid and so vain?" </sentence><sentence id="5945">But I was. </sentence><sentence id="5946">We went into something called showers, into another barracks, and they were one adjacent to the other -- without shoes, without clothing, and by then the grapevine had said something about gas and we looked at the showerheads and we didn't know what a gas chamber would look like and whether gas would come out of these things on the ceiling, and the little wetness dribbled down, very little, and we were pushed forward and we were each thrown one piece of clothing, whether it was a dress or a rag or a house robe, one piece, nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="5947">One woman in our group was thrown a pair of Dutch wooden shoes, the rest of us were barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="5948">It was hot in Auschwitz -- being called out in the morning, it was freezing cold. </sentence><sentence id="5949">Being called out in the afternoon, it was so hot that the rims of my ears were burning, my scalp was peeling. </sentence><sentence id="5950">That's how hot it was. </sentence><sentence id="5951">We were given a slice of bread a day and some brown liquid to drink, and in the evening there was supposed to be a soup but we were given no utensils. </sentence><sentence id="5952">So, Alice, who had been in the ghetto, who had come from Vienna, took off her wooden clogs and we each took one of them, filled them with soup, drank the soup, and handed it to the next in line, but we guarded the shoes like you would guard Fort Knox. </sentence><sentence id="5953">We were afraid somebody would steal them and run. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5966">Q: So, none of you got shoes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5968">A: No, there were close to 500 of us in that barracks, and the barracks -- there were no cots. </sentence><sentence id="5969">The floors were concrete floors and they were divided into oblong squares, oblong sections, and each section had to have five human beings, but there wasn't room for five. </sentence><sentence id="5970">So, at night, we would -- one would sit against the barracks wall, spread the legs and the next one would move in, until all five of us could sit that way, and in order to sleep, you would lean against the neck or the chest of the person in back of you. </sentence><sentence id="5971">The corner -- the center of the barracks had a raised platform, and the barracks had a couple who had been in Auschwitz quite a while, she had hair. </sentence><sentence id="5972">She was Jewish by the looks of her. </sentence><sentence id="5973">I don't know where she came from originally, not from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="5974">And she had a cubicle in the corner that was sort of parceled off -- it was sort of hidden away with a string that was attached to the right and left of the wall. </sentence><sentence id="5975">It was a dirty old blanket, and occasionally we'd see an SS man come to visit. </sentence><sentence id="5976">She screamed a lot. </sentence><sentence id="5977">She beat us, if we weren't fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="5978">I don't think she killed anybody. </sentence><sentence id="5979">Her name was Maja. </sentence><sentence id="5980">She might have been from Romania. </sentence><sentence id="5981">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="5982">She did not come with us, though she told us after a couple of weeks that there would be an inspection, to undress, take off the rag. </sentence><sentence id="5983">There would be an SS inspection team in the center of the counting area. </sentence><sentence id="5984">We should put the dress over the right arm, and walked passed the three SS man as fast as possible, and one of them motioned with a stick or a riding whip, a leather whip, right left, right left. </sentence><sentence id="5985">We later found out that one of them was Dr. Mengele, which we did not know. </sentence><sentence id="5986">We had never heard of him, and it had no meaning to us until it was explained probably several years later, or a year later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6006">Q: You mean that someone explained to you a year later that it was Mengele? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6008">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6009">No, they said that one of them was Dr. Mengele, but we did not know who he was or what he was, and we were given another rag and a pair of random shoes. </sentence><sentence id="6010">I got a size eight shoes; I wear a six. </sentence><sentence id="6011">And we were put into cattle cars, and when they stopped two or three days later, I stood on Dr. Singer's daughter's shoulders and I looked out through the little slit in the cattle car, and I said, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="6012">We're near Hamburg." </sentence><sentence id="6013">And then she went up and she looked and she said, "Nah, just green landscapes; nothing Hamburg here. </sentence><sentence id="6014">You've lost your mind. </sentence><sentence id="6015">It's been hot too long." </sentence><sentence id="6016">And the cattle car opens up, and we were housed in a warehouse of the outer harbor that housed Czech women on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="6017">It housed some men from various occupied countries, and they were all used for forced labor in the Deutschebef Blomenforce (ph), the defense industry shipyards, cleaning up the bomb damage in and around Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="6018">And even Dessauer Ufer was not a concept because it was the address of a harbor area which to me had no meaning. </sentence><sentence id="6019">It was not residential. </sentence><sentence id="6020">But when they started us by truck or mainly in the subways in a corner, taking us to the worksites, and we had on these rags and across the rag was a yellow painted-on stripe, and underneath the fabric was cut out so you couldn't run away -- no stars, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="6021">Some had a purple triangle, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="6022">That I realized that indeed it was the surrounding of Hamburg, and for a minute I thought, "Since I know the area, I could get away." </sentence><sentence id="6023">But how? </sentence><sentence id="6024">To whom? </sentence><sentence id="6025">Where?Food? </sentence><sentence id="6026">And then I realized that this was ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="6027">So, they then transferred us to another camp and in a now very fashionable area in Wedel where the mayor of the city lives, and there is one of these temporary houses left as a memorial, and we were guarded by 42 SS men and women. </sentence><sentence id="6028">They needed people in the office to keep records of the SS personnel and of the people in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="6029">There was a young lawyer from Poland, Sophie Kalishinska (ph) and I, we spoke German, who got sent to the office. </sentence><sentence id="6030">We had the disadvantage that the commander of the camp came from Southern Germany and used to be a gardener in civilian life, was vicious. </sentence><sentence id="6031">He would come in and he would kick us with his boots. </sentence><sentence id="6032">We had bloody legs and bloody arms, but for a while we didn't go out to work in the rain, but we took a daily beating. </sentence><sentence id="6033">The SS women had no compassion, no understanding. </sentence><sentence id="6034">There was no typewriter. </sentence><sentence id="6035">Everything was written manually with a pencil, not with ink. </sentence><sentence id="6036">I do not know why. </sentence><sentence id="6037">Most of these SS people had been drafted late in the war; they had been civil service employees before the war. </sentence><sentence id="6038">For the most part, they were uneducated. </sentence><sentence id="6039">The women were vicious, some of them. </sentence><sentence id="6040">The men -- some were vicious, some were not so bad. </sentence><sentence id="6041">They brought in three women from Prague to be in charge of the camp, to be kapos. </sentence><sentence id="6042">They couldn't speak Polish, but they managed German, and the story of these three women is another story. </sentence><sentence id="6043">They brought in one woman who was tiny, it's also another story. </sentence><sentence id="6044">We couldn't tell how old she was. </sentence><sentence id="6045">She probably was in her late "30s, but she ran around like a frightened mouse, and rumor had it that she was an MD by training. </sentence><sentence id="6046">She came from Romania, and she was in charge of the hospital room, but nobody dared ever use it. </sentence><sentence id="6047">It was used once for an abortion for a girl who became pregnant on the worksite, and Dr. Gisa and I met in the latrines where we would talk a few minutes, and then she would go her way and I would go my way. </sentence><sentence id="6048">She had worked for Mengele in Auschwitz, and she did the abortions at night so the women could live and the babies died. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6099">A: Yes, she was in the same camp, and there were 500 of us. </sentence><sentence id="6100">She came to New York, and I saw her one more time after the war. </sentence><sentence id="6101">I know she went to Israel, and I know she died. </sentence><sentence id="6102">The camp was not the worst possible place. </sentence><sentence id="6103">One of the SS women took the young woman who cleaned the SS barracks and me in a truck to Hamburg to pick-up provisions. </sentence><sentence id="6104">We saw the bombed city, and she stopped at a building in front of the building that used to be upper-middle class neighborhood apartments -- wrought iron balconies and a lot of stucco work, very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="6105">And she told us curtly to get out of the truck, moved us towards the entrance, all the way back and down into the basement, and she knocked on the door and the door opened and it was her mother. </sentence><sentence id="6106">And the mother apologized for not having food, and the young woman who cleaned the barracks would come from Lodz with us. </sentence><sentence id="6107">She was very small, very tiny, but very friendly and very obliging. </sentence><sentence id="6108">She told her to lie down on the couch and she covered her up and she gave me a chair to sit on, but not a word was spoken. </sentence><sentence id="6109">We had an hour of rest and nobody spoke. </sentence><sentence id="6110">I mean she spoke to her mother, but we didn't speak and she didn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="6111">We went back to camp. </sentence><sentence id="6112">We didn't tell, and we couldn't quite figure out what the story was. </sentence><sentence id="6113">I think that was the only kind gesture on the part of a German that I can recall. </sentence><sentence id="6114">When they evacuated Sasel and put the gypsies there, they took us to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="6115">Except for the overcrowded barracks and the dead bodies, I only remember two mountains of shoes at the gate, just empty shoes -- old and new and worn, huge mountains, and what crossed my mind was, "Where are the feet?" </sentence><sentence id="6116">But it didn't matter anymore. </sentence><sentence id="6117">After Bergen-Belsen was taken over by the British, I worked as an interpreter and translator. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6140">A: It was hopeless. </sentence><sentence id="6141">I mean, we saw the dead bodies. </sentence><sentence id="6142">We saw the typhus that was ravaging the -- we only saw the women. </sentence><sentence id="6143">We did not see the men. </sentence><sentence id="6144">There was no possibility you could live another month in Bergen-Belsen, and food wasn't important anymore -- not the soup, not the bread, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="6145">And one day we saw the Germans with white bands on their arms sort of tight, white rags. </sentence><sentence id="6146">We couldn't figure out why, and another few days passed and then on April 15", the British stumbled upon the camp advancing towards the Elbe River to cut off the Russians, and they managed, but they found us, as well, and they were not prepared for what they found. </sentence><sentence id="6147">I worked for them almost from the first day, although I was sick a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="6148">I had a very good boss. </sentence><sentence id="6149">He was a major. </sentence></p></dialogue>
