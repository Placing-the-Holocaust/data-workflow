<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="816">Let's turn to the edelweiss pirates. </sentence><sentence id="817">Can you tell me about them, how they were formed, how that worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: The edelweiss pirates -- well, edelweiss is the flower that only grows up in the high mountains of the Alps. </sentence><sentence id="822">It's a pretty flower and it represents bravery, strength. </sentence><sentence id="823">My brother tried to pick edelweiss for his mother and fell to his death and they found him with edelweiss in his hands, so edelweiss in my family was something very special. </sentence><sentence id="824">A group in Berlin started the Edelweisspriaten, how did you hear about them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="825">A: News got around they were persecuted, as you would hear about saboteur and committed sabotage and so on, and that triggered an interest in we could do something like that. </sentence><sentence id="826">And there was enough hatred, disrespect for our leaders, and I'm talking about our immediate leaders, that means companions who now became lieutenants and captains and we had to respect and salute them and listen to them and obey them, and that was definitely against my nature. </sentence><sentence id="827">And I found quite a few comrades who, for adventurous reasons, for one reason or the other sided with me and said yeah, let's have some fun. </sentence><sentence id="828">So I have to emphasize that I was a little too young, even though after the war, we were considered political prisoners, but really, there was no real ideological reason because I didn't understand national socialism as I would understand it today. </sentence><sentence id="829">It was more of a movement based upon rebellious nature, protest against blind obedience, this sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="830">So we formed a chapter in Dusseldorf and hoped that eventually we would establish contact with the Edelweisspiraten in Berlin, but we did not. </sentence><sentence id="831">So then we spent quite a bit of time thinking of what we could do to make their, in quote, their life more difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="839">Q: Who is the their? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="885">Q: So does that mean you dropped out of the Hitler Youth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: Dropped out? </sentence><sentence id="888">That would have been impossible because it was obligatory to join. </sentence><sentence id="889">You had to have a qualified reason, like maybe losing one leg or something like that, that you couldn't do it, but as long as you were healthy and you didn't have Jewish blood for five generations, then you had to join. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: So how did that work, being a part of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against them at the same time? </sentence><sentence id="894">How did it work being part of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against them at the same time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Ha. </sentence><sentence id="898">Well of course we tried to be as clandestine as possible, so on the surface, we were just very loyal members of the Hitler Youth and our movement was rather underground. </sentence><sentence id="899">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="900">So it was so it was what in Germany you call Schikane, based upon our dislike for authority. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="956">A: Maybe -- maybe -- I don't know, maybe I should think a little more about what I did and how I did it, but maybe one of the things was that we did not enjoy the procedure of the Hitler Youth being helpful in the prosecution of Jews, which they were, and I had these friends, they didn't do any harm to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="957">They were nice kids and so on, and so we were very much interested in helping the underdog. </sentence><sentence id="958">So we considered the Jews underdogs. </sentence><sentence id="959">And so this one guy, when we knew they were being evacuated and sent to places, well, we didn't want him to go. </sentence><sentence id="960">I didn't know his parents, and so I just thought one day if you don't want to go, you can stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="961">And so he stayed with me for, oh, I don't know, I would say probably six months or eight months. </sentence><sentence id="962">And it was not broadcast in my family that he's a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="963">It was just he's a young man who needs a little help and can he stay with us? </sentence><sentence id="964">Yeah, he can sleep in my brother's bed, you see. </sentence><sentence id="965">And so in the apartment housing which we lived in, there were a total of six parties, +. </sentence><sentence id="966">So they didn't know that he was a Jewish boy. </sentence><sentence id="967">It was not broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="968">He was just a friend. </sentence><sentence id="969">And so when I was arrested, then -- I believe that when I had a visit with -- from my mother, the question came out of what are we going to do with Hans Dieter (ph)? </sentence><sentence id="970">I said call Eddie Violent he's going to take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="971">So he took over. </sentence><sentence id="972">That was just one block from our house, and his situation was a little nicer because he lived a house. </sentence><sentence id="973">The house was his. </sentence><sentence id="974">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="975">So he had a little more freedom and who walked in his house. </sentence><sentence id="976">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="977">And he stayed with him for the rest of the war. </sentence><sentence id="978">What happened with him afterwards, I do not know, and I asked Eddie and he didn't know -- oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="979">He told me one day, he said guess what? </sentence><sentence id="980">You you remember Hans? </sentence><sentence id="981">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="982">He died. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1053">Q: Was there anything else that you did because it was against policy of the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1055">A: I think what was more than anything was that you could not argue. </sentence><sentence id="1056">You could not discuss. </sentence><sentence id="1057">You had to accept whatever was said as the final truth, and I liked the idea of asking why and how and you couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1058">So that was a little against my nature of just accepting things blindly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
