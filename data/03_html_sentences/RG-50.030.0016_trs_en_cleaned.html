<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Only because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="123">Especially when religious classes took place. </sentence><sentence id="124">Jewish children  had to step out into the hallway for that hour. </sentence><sentence id="125">And when the religion class was over, all the boys just walked up and say "You killed Jesus," and start to beat up on us. </sentence><sentence id="126">So since my mother had a candy store, I used to manage, for that day, to have some candies in pocket and bribe them, or a few pennies. </sentence><sentence id="127">But that was not the case always, so I always found an excuse to my mother when there was a religious class, I said I don't feel good, or there was a day off when the teacher is sick. </sentence><sentence id="128">I just didn't want to go to school because I couldn't bear being beaten up all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: And what next signs did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: The reaction was exciting because we didn't know about war. </sentence><sentence id="199">And matter of fact, the feeling of war existed prior to start of the war, like being in the camp*; we had a big place where we played in sand, building airplanes, building boats, building different things. </sentence><sentence id="200">That summer we told everybody not to play, we are going to play war, like we made Polish Army and German Army. </sentence><sentence id="201">Me and other boy, we had a Polish army, and there was another boy by the name Mojzesz was the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="202">I was called Froim in the orphanage, I was also called Malydeg Icek. </sentence><sentence id="203">Icek is my brother, I'm the small Icek. </sentence><sentence id="204">So there was the army of Moses and the Army of Ariel and Froim -- Ariel was the second general. </sentence><sentence id="205">And we prepared bunkers and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="206">And for bullets we would save chestnuts, and when the war broke out, we start throwing chestnuts. </sentence><sentence id="207">When we got hit three times, had to be carried out, so that was the feeling that naturally Poland lost, and Germany won. </sentence><sentence id="208">So then after the war -- when the war started, naturally our building was one of the first to get burned down because they had announced that Solna number eight, where we have a room, is a point of refreshments for soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="209">A little bit later a bomb came down; an airplane was just cruising about, and they couldn't stop the fire or anything, and the building went down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Where were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Do you remember what you were thinking, or were you terrified? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Not terrified; kind of excited. </sentence><sentence id="239">Because the notion was that Jewish people and the German were getting along because, basically more or less understood the language, could communicate more or less. </sentence><sentence id="240">So we believed it wouldn't be too bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: So you didn't have much information in terms of what was happening in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Not at all, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="247">Not interested, only to satisfy them, our hunger, because when the war broke out, right away everything was -- all the stores were closed. </sentence><sentence id="248">There was no food available. </sentence><sentence id="249">And even in the orphanage, you know, it became rations like, you know. </sentence><sentence id="250">Food was available; Dr. Korczak saw to it that we get food, but -- it appeared on the blackboard: Two slices of bread, or three slices of bread; as much as we can. </sentence><sentence id="251">And I will never forget, Dr. Korczak used to stand over us in good times. </sentence><sentence id="252">I remember good times and I remember bad times. </sentence><sentence id="253">In the good times he used to go behind the children and make sure they eat. </sentence><sentence id="254">And as a joke, if somebody was holding a piece of bread, he used to pull it out, grab it and put it in his mouth. </sentence><sentence id="255">Now I also remember when it appeared two slices each, also for Dr. Korczak two slices, but he never ate his two slices, he gave to another child. </sentence><sentence id="256">Every day he gave his bread to somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="257">And we stupid children, we took it. </sentence><sentence id="258">We never realize that the man grows thinner and thinner and thinner; that kind of man he was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: So you hadn't heard anything about Kristallnacht or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
