class="Question"><p><sentence id="2638">Q: Well tell me more about your work with the Holocaust Education Trust. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2639">A: Well, the Holocaust Education Trust is -- was formed, oh about 10 years ago by -- it started by a rabbi, not Holocaust Education Trust, but he decided -- a local rabbi, Barry Markus, in London, and he took a group of people to Auschwitz for the day and then somehow they got together with a group of other people and they decided to form a Holocaust Education Trust, which is a working people, it's not a -- they work there full time, and what they do, they also teach teachers about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2640">Teachers that have retired, or they want to be in teaching profession any more, and they devote their time for that. </sentence><sentence id="2641">They do it -- they get paid for it, naturally, otherwise they couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And they do seminars for young people. </sentence><sentence id="2643">But the Holocaust Education Trust is mainly interest in taking young people to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Now that, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2645"> after that rabbi, Rabbi Barry Markus did that, they decided they would be able -- they can afford to take two groups of children, around 200 people -- there would be like 160 children. </sentence><sentence id="2646">There" 11 be teachers from each school. </sentence><sentence id="2647">Because it's not as a school, it's about 80 schools. </sentence><sentence id="2648">They take two students from a school, you see, local, in London, plus teachers, plus journalists. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And they take them just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come back late. </sentence><sentence id="2650">And they go to Auschwitz, they go to birk -- to Krakow, Auschwitz and Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2651">The main thing is Auschwitz and Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2652">And they come back and they've got the bef -- but, so what I do, or people like me, we come and talk to them, because they know very little about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2653">They know very little about the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="2654">But now it's a thing that they've got to learn in school, it's -- it's a must, it's not whether they want or not. </sentence><sentence id="2655">But how much is not -- doesn't come into it because how much they can just learn one hour in three months about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2656">So they go -- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Trust does is they bring them -- they get them together, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="2657">Then they get another seminar, then they go to Auschwitz and when they come back they go to write about it, what they thought of it, what they -- the whole thing and they've got to send it in to the Holocaust Education Trust, and a panel sits then pick four schools of two children each and they got to come back to the Houses of Parliament or to the House of Lords, here in -- and start presenting their stories, what they think, they're int -- they're interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some of the survivors are also there, a few of us. </sentence><sentence id="2658">And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2659">So what they have to do, they've got to go to other local schools and tell them all what they saw, what they heard. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And being young people I am very much involved in it because I lungya -- I like young people, and I think it's very, very imporstant they should know what happened, because -- and they are lovely students, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="2661">I've never had any problems, you know? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2662"> It's as quiet as anything, you know, and I talk to them for about an hour or so and they ask questions and -- you know, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2663">Q: What kind of questions do they ask? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2664">A: Well, all different. </sentence><sentence id="2665">Some are a bit silly ones, you know, like naturally young people, they want to know whether I met Hitler, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2666">I haven't been invited to tea by Hitler, but -- but that th -- one of the main question, it's always asked is, do I hate the German people. </sentence><sentence id="2667">And they cannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people. </sentence><sentence id="2668">Why should I hate people for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today. </sentence><sentence id="2669">You know, they're grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And most German people are the same as any other people. </sentence><sentence id="2671">Why should I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2672">Do I ask me -- do I forgive them? </sentence><sentence id="2673">Now the people that did it, I haven't got the right to forgive. </sentence><sentence id="2674">If there is a God, God can forgive them. </sentence><sentence id="2675">The others are the people that died can forgive. </sentence><sentence id="2676">I certainly haven't got the right to forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg of you, when I talk to them, do not hate. </sentence><sentence id="2677">Because this is not an answer, to hate. </sentence><sentence id="2678">You are the one that will suffer if you hate. </sentence><sentence id="2679">So no, I -- I love the questions. </sentence><sentence id="2680">Some, like I said, are silly, but some are very [indecipherable] how they -- the usual thing, how did you survive? </sentence><sentence id="2681">I wish I could tell them. </sentence><sentence id="2682">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2683">It's one of those things. </sentence><sentence id="2684">People that are -- there are some students that are religio -- religious and they, do you think God wanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so that you can tell the story? </sentence><sentence id="2685">I said maybe, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2686">But I feel it's very important it should be told. </sentence><sentence id="2687">We've got to have awareness of what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2712">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2714">A: Because you know, in another few years there won't be -- the only thing you'll be able to do is to read about us, what happened to the people in Europe between 1933 and 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2715">There won't be anybody, you know, to substantiate the story. </sentence><sentence id="2716">So people say well, is it true, is it not, and you can be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="2717">I have been to Auschwitz, I have seen with my own eyes. </sentence><sentence id="2718">And I feel that's important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2725">Q: Thank you very much for sharing your story with the Holocaust Museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2727">A: Well, it was -- it was really -- I don't know whether pleasure's the right word, but it was certainly my duty. </sentence><sentence id="2728">The more people I tell it to, the more I am satisfied and I am happy about it with -- especially with the feedback I get, which makes me very happy that people do listen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
