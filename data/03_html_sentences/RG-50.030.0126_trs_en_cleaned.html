<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Carla Lessing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in Rotterdam, Holland uh on November 4th, 1929. ( </sentence><sentence id="10">laughter) I have to think about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me about your parents, your early childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: OK. </sentence><sentence id="16">Uh, let me tell you first about my father's family. </sentence><sentence id="17">They are Heijmans and most of the family uh lived in the eastern part of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="18">My father's father was Dutch and my father's mother was a German Jew and her name was Rosalie, and my father's father was Jacob. </sentence><sentence id="19">Uh they had three children. </sentence><sentence id="20">Uh I think my father was the oldest, then my aunt who died in Auschwitz, and a younger brother who died of diabetes in 1922, "24 - I don't know exactly and his name was Herman. </sentence><sentence id="21">Uh my father met my mother in Germany and my mother is, was a German Jew. </sentence><sentence id="22">She grew up in the western part of Germany and she was one of three. </sentence><sentence id="23">Uh she was the middle child. </sentence><sentence id="24">Her older brother, Rudie, immigrated to Israel! </sentence><sentence id="25">in 1935. </sentence><sentence id="26">Uh my mother married my father in 1925 and moved to Holland. </sentence><sentence id="27">Uh my youngest brother, her youngest...my youngest uncle, her youngest brother, immigrated in 1934 or "S to Holland and he uh studied in Germany, so there's a lot of German in my family. </sentence><sentence id="28">Uh...my parents settled in Rotterdam uh when they got married in 1925. </sentence><sentence id="29">My brother, Herman, uh who is now called Johanem (ph) who lives in Israel, was born in August 1926 and I was born in November 1929 also in Rotterdam. </sentence><sentence id="30">In 1930 they moved to the Hague to get away from my mother's in- laws who were very intrusive. </sentence><sentence id="31">My father's sister had already moved away from Rotterdam because of the same reason and they moved in a little suburb near the Hague. </sentence><sentence id="32">Uh now the story about my parents" financial problems are very vague because nobody told me and my father died in...actually he committed suicide in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="33">Before he died, they moved from a big house in the Hague to a very small apartment or small apartment and I was sent to my grandparents in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="34">My grandparents lived in Germany in Gelsenkirchen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="35">My brother who was going to school at that time stayed with my parents and later on with my mother and I was sent away because moving and the problems so I, I was in Germany in 1935 and 1936 as a youngster before I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="36">So there is a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="37">At that time already Jews were very careful. </sentence><sentence id="38">I was a little girl and when I was on the street, my grandparents would say, don't speak too loudly, uh don't hop, don't skip, uh uh don't make yourself noticed because there were all the Nazis around us and so at a very early age I was already aware that I was different, that I was Jewish, I shouldn't be noticed, should be quiet.(Cough) Also my grandparents did all kinds of things to be Jews. </sentence><sentence id="39">I mean they were not  really religious but they would go to the synagogue because they felt as a Jew you needed to stay together. </sentence><sentence id="40">So I had to go to the synagogue on the sabath_ and uh participate. </sentence><sentence id="41">So I went back to Holland probably in April, May of 1936. </sentence><sentence id="42">I spoke German at that time because I, my grandparents spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="43">I came back and my mother sent me to school, kindergarten uh for me to quickly pick up the Dutch and I went to kindergarten and then to first grade. </sentence><sentence id="44">I then came to a new apartment because I had moved...when I left for Germany I had lived in a big house and I came to an apartment, and my father wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="45">So...and my mother was a widow and uh had a very hard time making money and so we were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="46">Uh my mother and my brother and I did go back and forth to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="47">For my school vacations I would go to Germany so my mother had some free time I guess. </sentence><sentence id="48">And so in 1936, in 1937, in 1938 I spent my vacations in Germany with my grandparents, and kind of was aware of what was happening then. </sentence><sentence id="49">So...and my mother would be taking jewelry from Germany to Holland when she would bring us and she would hang herself up with jewelry from my grandparents and from other families and so there was already kind of a preparation for, you know, saving some money or some jewels or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="50">Also some of my grandmother's family uh were immigrating to the United States and they came to Holland, so we had families coming through before they boarded the boat in Rotterdam to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="51">So we were kind of prepared for all this. </sentence><sentence id="52">Uh I was...go back to my school days...I was one of two in my class who was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="53">There was another boy who was Jewish, and the Dutch were very good at uh respecting the Jews so when the Princess Beatrice was born and all the Dutch school children gotuh (ph) __(ph) with some orange sprinkles on it, they got for the Jewish children kosher __ (ph) with butter on it. </sentence><sentence id="54">So they were very, you know, we were very well respected. </sentence><sentence id="55">Uh I had around the corner where I lived was my . </sentence><sentence id="56">She was my best friend  bike. </sentence><sentence id="57">Small things all the time were, were asked to bring into the offices and give them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="58">Uh now since we were very poor and I had gotten a bike from, a second-hand bike from friends of ours and my brother had a bike and so we took the bikes but my bike was a small bike, small-sized bike and they didn't want it, so I came back with a bike, but since none of my Jewish friends had bikes, I couldn't ride my bike, so uh my mother was already a little cleaver because she had seen what happened in Germany, uh was hiding some of gold rings and some things already. </sentence><sentence id="59">Now, to back-track a little bit... my grandparents were in Germany in the Kristallnacht and they got out, I believe in July or August of 1939, and they settled with my uncle in the western part of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh they came with maybe eight guildens and they were very well-to-do German Jews in in in and uh they had, they gave ever....they had to give everything away and they came with no money. </sentence><sentence id="61">Uh so they came to Holland and they lived with my youngest uncle who took care of them the rest of their lives. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh at the end of 1941, we heard we couldn't go back to the schools again and that they would organize a Jewish school maybe three-quarters of an hour away from us in and that we had to sign up there. </sentence><sentence id="63">So all the Jewish kids in the neighborhood like my  and black eyes and looked very Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="64">My brother, he was blond at that time and he did look less Jewish, but we were different. </sentence><sentence id="65">Now what was also different is that my mother was a German Jew and she uh had a very strong German accent. </sentence><sentence id="66">She also had a whole lot of contact with German Jews who had fled Germany in 1939 and uh "38 and uh so she knew a whole lot of stories what had gone on uh in Germany and we were kind of aware because these people were terrible displaced, these German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="67">Uh what happened in kind of...L...I got...in June, July, we kind of were informed that the first people in the Hague would be shipped and these were the young men, sixteen years and older uh to work camps. </sentence><sentence id="68">Now my mother had a friend uh who told her that there was a Catholic priest who would help her find a place for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="69">My mother had said we don't...we don't go to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="70">That's too far away. </sentence><sentence id="71">Uh and she kind of had made up her mind that's too far away. </sentence><sentence id="72">You don't go with your whole family too far away. </sentence><sentence id="73">I mean you don't...you just don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="74">And since she had already a little bit experience how to defy the Germans like, you know, getting money and jewelry out of Germany, she knew kind of how to do things. </sentence><sentence id="75">I think she was not as afraid as most of them. </sentence><sentence id="76">Anyway, the Catholic priest came to our house and that was very unusual because we had never had contact with any Catholic priest and he was uh from St., from St.Francis...St. Fransican I guess...he was in kind of in garb. </sentence><sentence id="77">He didn't have a suit on and he was in sandals so he was quite different and he was...and I don't know if he was an older man or a younger man, but he was a very, very lively man and made us feel very much at ease and he said that he had a woman in the Hague who would take my brother. </sentence><sentence id="78">And he told us that this woman wanted to do some good because she had sinned so much in her life that...and was very fearful that she would go to hell and that by rescuing or taking in a Jewish man, maybe she would go to heaven. </sentence><sentence id="79">So that was the very beginning from our uh we planning to go in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="80">Now uh what happened was very, very quickly is that we thought that my brother was going to be called up to go but very quickly afterwards we found out that my mother and myself would go...had to go to. </sentence><sentence id="81">Now what they did was, in the Hague certainly, uh you would get an announcement in the mail or with your name on it and you were supposed to go at twelve midnight to the trolley car. </sentence><sentence id="82">Trolley car would take you to the train in the Hague and the train, trains would take you to Restabourk (ph), the Dutch concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="83">That was apparently the gathering point. </sentence><sentence id="84">That was the instructions. </sentence><sentence id="85">Uh so my brother had kind of a place where he could go and so when we heard that we might need to go too, my mother contacted the Catholic priest again and said, you know, we have to go too. </sentence><sentence id="86">We can't, you know, look, we almost, we almost have to go. </sentence><sentence id="87">So he went to the woman and said could the mother and the sister come too, and she kind of agreed. </sentence><sentence id="88">So we had a place to go. </sentence><sentence id="89">Now we had to go from our house and walk to the place where we went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="90">You're not supposed to walk after eight o'clock in the dark at night anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="91">So...and I don't know exactly how this was all done but I remember that I walked out of the house with my star on, and I was instructed at some point to take my little vest off and throw it into the uh gut...not in the gutter...it's in the uh...sewer. </sentence><sentence id="92">And for me that was just more fun....it's almost like you shed your identity. </sentence><sentence id="93">And and I don't know if I walked alone or with my mother and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="94">I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="95">I kind of...I don't know what we took. </sentence><sentence id="96">I...I was asked if I took any toys or any books. </sentence><sentence id="97">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="98">I think we went with a little bit of stuff and we went to the place where we were into hiding, went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="99">Uh it appeared that my mother had already taken some paintings and her silver and her chinawear and some other stuff...had  already...it had already disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="100">She had already taken care of it...it went into some place, hiding with some friends. </sentence><sentence id="101">So we, my mother, my brother and I went to this first hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was in August of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="103">Uh we had to go one flight up and there was a very small apartment. </sentence><sentence id="104">It was a tiny little bedroom, a living room, another room and a closed-in porch, a tiny little kitchen and a bathroom, and then the next...it was...it was in...uh the person who lived upstairs went on the same staircase, uh the same hallway up to the next story. </sentence><sentence id="105">We got the back room with the little porch. </sentence><sentence id="106">It was closed-in porch, and everything was dark and heavily upholstered and curtains were drawn and there were kind of two beds and a table and I don't know what...and there we were. </sentence><sentence id="107">And we were told that we had to whisper and we were told that we could not go to the bathroom as we wanted because the person upstairs would hear the flushing and there was three more people in the household of Mrs. Noen and her son or and...she had a foster son (ph) so we had to be very quiet and uh actually do  happened was a couple of months after we had left, the Germans found out that she had stored stuff and came into the apartments, you know, looked over, you know, looked through all the apartments, the apartment where we had been hiding and upstairs and so actually that whole plan of this son to free his mother from all this anxiety was to our advantage because we would have been caught and we would not be here. </sentence><sentence id="108">We uh we went to Delft to this family and this man took us to his family and we found out that this was a family, a father, mother and seven children, and we all...the youngest child was two, and the oldest child was like eighteen. </sentence><sentence id="109">And the house, you cannot believe how small the house was and he had promised that he would take us in for a while and we got some room and there was no way that we could escape ever. </sentence><sentence id="110">I mean it was all very small and all, all very tight. </sentence><sentence id="111">The houses were built very close together and we could not escape to the roof or to the basement. </sentence><sentence id="112">There was no escape here also. </sentence><sentence id="113">We were there and we could not go too near the windows. </sentence><sentence id="114">We could not flush the toilets. </sentence><sentence id="115">We could not walk really because downstairs they had a barber shop and she had a beauty parlor downstairs, so we were not supposed to be really there so we couldn't do anything uh so you had to kind of walk on your stocking feet and you couldn't really go to the bathroom because it was too much flushing. </sentence><sentence id="116">Uh it would all be suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="117">We could not be near the window because the streets in Delft are very narrow and the people across the street could just see you. </sentence><sentence id="118">Just, you know, so that was also not the best place to hide. </sentence><sentence id="119">Uh the man who hid us, Mr. Faheine (ph), was an extraordinary man because on Sundays, three more Jewish men came, would come to visit. </sentence><sentence id="120">They were hiding somewhere in Delft and he would kind of bring them in and have a Sunday meal and then there was some uh...and you know, it was all very small but he kind of wanted to help these people. </sentence><sentence id="121">Uh we didn't know these people, but you know, they were...other people were hiding them. </sentence><sentence id="122">Now one of these three men we found out while we were there that he was caught uh traveling and was shot. </sentence><sentence id="123">Uh the other two men we don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh the seven children never let anybody know that we were there. </sentence><sentence id="125">Now they went to school, right, they went...and I don't think they were told, you know, specifically that they don't tell anyone that, you know, we have people in hiding here. </sentence><sentence id="126">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="127">They kind of knew. </sentence><sentence id="128">Uh...I'm trying to think a little bit what happened there...all kinds of things happened uh uh while we were there. </sentence><sentence id="129">Now this was from like say December of...December "42 until May "45 we were there, so during that time uh things happened in Delft such as uh...I don't think I can recall logically, but uh the Germans were looking for blankets, right? </sentence><sentence id="130">They needed blankets for I don't know for what and so we heard that they would come to the house, to the house, right, and search the house for blankets. </sentence><sentence id="131">Now as soon as something like that came through we had to go somewhere, or they would, we would hear that all men over sixteen would have to go to workcamps and so in that family my brother was over sixteen and two more were over sixteen years old so they would...we had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="132">All the time something like that would happen and we had to find a solution and not be with...this family had to find a solution for us, so one time we stayed for three days in a Catholic church. </sentence><sentence id="133">The Catholic church was around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="134">Early in the morning we would walk to the Catholic church, sit through the mass, stay in a in a room. </sentence><sentence id="135">Every Mass that was we went to. </sentence><sentence id="136">We had pennies, you know, to put in and and that was for us kind of, you know, it was like a beautiful show because it was music and colorful and and...and it was spacious and uh we felt we would not be caught there. </sentence><sentence id="137">For some reason that was neutral ground and we wouldn't be caught there. </sentence><sentence id="138"> One time...I forgot what the reason was...we had to also leave that house and we would, and II forgot what the reason was...we had to stay with people uh also two blocks away. </sentence><sentence id="139">Now what we did during the time that we were hiding, we would knit a lot. </sentence><sentence id="140">My mother would knit socks for the whole family and so while we had to leave the house and went two blocks away to another family, she took her knitting along but very close to the house she lost the yarn, so we walked and the yarn unwound and, you know, the whole path with the yarn behind her (laughter) and we found it very funny. </sentence><sentence id="141">Anyway we...she...I don't  no books in the house really, so we...I guess we played Monopoly. </sentence><sentence id="142">We read a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="143">We uh...I don't know, I can't...we did...my mother and I would peel potatoes, you know, and and clean vegetables and do some cooking and do darning and so on. </sentence><sentence id="144">My brother had it much more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="145">Uh there was very little food. </sentence><sentence id="146">Uh we uh...my hiding father as we called him, would would get some food from the farmers because we were on the uh market right there and since he was a barber the farmers would come for a shave, and he would do some dealing with them, so he would get some vegetables and some fresh potatoes and we would get some food. </sentence><sentence id="147">Also he was really remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="148">He loved to uh get...defy the authority. </sentence><sentence id="149">I mean that was his whole task there. </sentence><sentence id="150">I mean he loved it, so we had uh ration cards, but he had for everybody two, so we had...there were twelve fam...twelve people in the house. </sentence><sentence id="151">He had twenty-four. </sentence><sentence id="152">So he, we had a little bit of more food than usual but still there was hardly any food in the house and so there was a whole lot of tension about food in the house because you cook for twelve people and and uh divide it up. </sentence><sentence id="153">It was very difficult and especially for the hiding mother because she had her own children and us and it was horrendous and they were all growing people, you know...they were all, like I said, from two to eighteen and I was like thirteen, fourteen. </sentence><sentence id="154">My brother was sixteen, seventeen. </sentence><sentence id="155">I mean you could eat enormous amount of food. </sentence><sentence id="156">There was a lot of tension around food. </sentence><sentence id="157">Uh what happened...I think in 1944...uh the hiding mother's youngest sister was pregnant and she needed some help and she asked me or my mother or somebody if I could help her. </sentence><sentence id="158">That meant that I had to go from the place where I was hiding to her house and uh for me again it was something different, but I think you, you kind of learn to take a deep breathe and you walk and you hope nothing will happen, so I had to walk from the place I was hiding to her house, and then I slept overnight. </sentence><sentence id="159">I don't know how long it was, but I walked on the street there. </sentence><sentence id="160">I hadn't walked on the street for a long time all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh I stayed there and I don't know how long - maybe a few weeks or a few months and helped her, which was was a welcomed changed but there was also this fear that maybe my mother and my brother would be caught or that I would be caught, so...] mean...it was very very tense is all I can say and very fearful. </sentence><sentence id="162">I was always very fearful. </sentence><sentence id="163">The worst fear that I had, and I can't tell for my mother and my brother, that at night when there would be trucks coming through the streets, you would just lay in bed and you would just wait and you always anticipated that that truck would stop in front of the house you were hiding in. </sentence><sentence id="164">The Germans would come out, bang on the door and would get us, find us, and so trucks were like you would just lying in bed and if you heard some noise you kind of hold it, and since we had no place to flee...most people, some people had, in their hiding place, had another hiding place where they thought they would be safer. </sentence><sentence id="165">We had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="166">Absolutely nothing to run to or to hide in. </sentence><sentence id="167">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="168">So we were exposed and everything. </sentence><sentence id="169">Uh this didn't happen, you know. </sentence><sentence id="170">But there were many instances that the Germans would come in the barber shop and would ask for a shave and the man who hid us would have to shave the German soldiers and we would be upstairs and we would never know if they wanted to go to the bathroom or not, you know, because the bathroom was upstairs, so uh I can't really tell you exactly how frightened we were. </sentence><sentence id="171">I can't also tell you what we did because it's like one day was like the other and also you didn't really want to think because you would hear things. </sentence><sentence id="172">We would get some bits of information and uh they were all, like, you know, this man was caught and this man was caught and this family was caught. </sentence><sentence id="173">You would hear that and we didn't really want to believe it because we hoped it  wasn't true and we would maybe be next. </sentence><sentence id="174">We did have false identity cards. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh we got them through another contact uh and again this was made uh so that we would...somehow we always felt guilty that somebody did something for us. </sentence><sentence id="176">What happened is people would come to us and they had in their rain...raincoats all the paraphernalia to make false identity cards. </sentence><sentence id="177">Now uh they would come to us and they would go on the train, and if they would be caught they would leave the raincoats there, but anyway they came to our house where we were hiding and would...gave us the...they did the whole thing with the stamping and the fingerprints and the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="178">But it was always what if they were caught. </sentence><sentence id="179">It would be because of us, because they came to us to give us identity cards, and this really was like constantly that we would feel so guilty that people were helping us. </sentence><sentence id="180">And that their lives was at...their lives were just uh in danger just like us and and everyone of them who knew about us, their life was in danger. </sentence><sentence id="181">Uh I remember that we didn't have any fuel and I was to go with one of the...two of the children go to the road where there were little pieces of coal in the in the road deck (ph) and we would go there and I was asked also to go because...well, I would dress up like any little Dutch girl with a kerchief on and wooden shoes and we would go to the roadway and find little pieces of coal so we could have some fuel for a very little stove, so I could get out. </sentence><sentence id="182">My brother never got out because he was of the age that uh like, you know, they needed him in in the work camps. </sentence><sentence id="183">Now one of the things that was...I'm glad that I remembered it...one of the most awful things happened in this family was that their oldest son was called up to go to a work camp. </sentence><sentence id="184">And there we were. </sentence><sentence id="185">We were hiding with them, and he had to make a decision to go or not to go. </sentence><sentence id="186">What meant was if he wasn't going to go, we had to leave because if he was going to go in hiding they were going to look for him and if he was going to go to Germany to work camp, we would be...they were not going to look for him, so we would be more or less safe. </sentence><sentence id="187">This man was a very religious Catholic and he decided that he was going to go to the work camp. </sentence><sentence id="188">And I don't know what date that was. </sentence><sentence id="189">So he went and we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="190">And we had no dealing at all in his decision making but again we felt like he did it for us, because if he had decided not to go, we had to find another place and that was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="191">So he went and they didn't get very much mail from him, so there was this constant kind of hanging over us - if he would die, he would die for us and and so we, you know, you put this all together...denial is a wonderful thing...so we kind of lived with it and everybody else was there. </sentence><sentence id="192">Their daughter had married in the end of 1944, but all the other five children were there, so the daughter was married, he was in a work camp in Germany and the five children were there. </sentence><sentence id="193">But he wasn't there, so we were daily reminded...Walter was his name...wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="194">He did come back from the work camp, but I always felt for years and years that guilt that I had sent him to a work camp and we did some corresponding and he said that part of his decision was adventure, but he suffered. </sentence><sentence id="195">Actually he never did very well after he came back. </sentence><sentence id="196">He was like always extremely nervous and he retired early. </sentence><sentence id="197">Now we don't know if it was due to his experience in the work camp and just like we don't know what our...if our our problems are because of the Holocaust or just maybe just, you know, problems. </sentence><sentence id="198">But I think his experiences in the work camp were horrendous and uh he he did come back, so that was...but the guilt of having...for him to make a decision to go to Germany never left me, up until we corresponded, which was only a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="199">Uh of course the whole thing with uh...we thought that autumn, that we would be liberated in September of 1944 and we weren't and we had had such big hopes that we would be  0 liberated and we had to go through the whole winter which was the hunger winter in Holland...there was no food...and I think we were all pretty depressed. </sentence><sentence id="200">Uh we would ask how long...when will it be over, and he would say, the hiding father would say to me, and another day would go by...how long is it going to take and he would say soon, so we kind of...you know...anyway the uh we were liberated in May the Sth. </sentence><sentence id="201">That winter was the most horrendous winter because people died of hunger. </sentence><sentence id="202">Uh we just made it. </sentence><sentence id="203">There was food until the last day and then the food was over (ph). </sentence><sentence id="204">Now I remember that I did not want to believe everyone that we were liberated because I did not want to be
