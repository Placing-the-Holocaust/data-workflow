<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: So you left Lucien(ph) at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yeah and we heard about the Italians protecting the Jews and so we went, we crossed France all over and we went to Nice. </sentence><sentence id="256">We went to Nice and there were the Italians and it was another atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="257">We stayed in a hotel there for awhile and then we move in , which was also in Italian zone, up in the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="258">The northern Alps, northern Alps. </sentence><sentence id="259">Oh, it was also , so we found an hotel to stay at and we went in a house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Let me ask you, this may seem a strange question, but do you remember any happy times with your family during all of this travel, with all of these children and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: Well, the happy times were the time I was in Lucien and I had my Bar Mitzvah and I had that women Raseen(ph), Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) and teaching us Zionism and Jewish history and putting actually strength in our young minds. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I had friends, I had many, I had many Jewish friends, because we were many Jews that were there, running away and Lucien was also a nice place, it was the mountain we went. </sentence><sentence id="269">We went on hikes, there was snow in the winter, we... But I remember an    event that never left me, it must have been the summer 1942 when we went out of sports, playing soccer and when we finished and it was outside town a little bit, was a, a , a few guys, a few children that wanted to see how I was circumcised, had heard that in church or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="270">And and they wanted to see, how does it look to have your male part circumcised and they took me by the arm, on the ground and so forth, took off my pants. </sentence><sentence id="271">And this I will never forget and never forgive them. </sentence><sentence id="272">It was part of the anti-Semite atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="273">I wouldn't say that everybody was antagonistic toward the Jews, but many were and there was also the religious influence and the religious schools, Catholic schools and so forth, it was really a hotbed of anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="274">On the other hand you have the, the secular school and the teachers, which other time, mostly came from the Socialism, Socialist background. </sentence><sentence id="275">I wish they were more sympathetic to the Jews, but not as bad as people reared in the religion, religious, in the Catholic religion and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="276">A lot of people say that the French, you had the big round up in Paris on the 16th of July, where there was a change of mind for. </sentence><sentence id="277">Well, maybe, but as far as I'm concerned, that, the change of sentiment didn't come from the, from the, that : It really switched around six months later, first when the German lost the battle of and went into retreat in Africa and then, couple months later, Stalingrad, that was the turn and in many people's mind, there was this possibility that Germany will lose the war. </sentence><sentence id="278">So that's what I feel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: So tell me you're, you're in the Italian zone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: First we arrive in Nice, we stayed about a month in Nice and then we went to__._I went back to school, in the school there. </sentence><sentence id="299">In the atmosphere was different because the people over there hated the Italians very much, you know, despised the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="300">Actually, I'd become friendly with the Italian soldiers, I remember they used to have a picnic on the, on the grass in a little meadow when I was coming back from school and time they called me up and they were listening to the radio, English radio, BBC and they would give it to me and talk to me and friendly attitude. </sentence><sentence id="301">And we knew that the French to arrest anybody and... But the atmosphere was    different that the people of Savoire(ph) were more, I would call today rightist or, and they hated the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="302">So much that I'm sure that when the German came, they were glad that the German took over from the Italian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
