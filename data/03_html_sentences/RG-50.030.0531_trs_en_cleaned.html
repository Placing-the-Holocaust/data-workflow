<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1093">Q: And when the person actually had to get off the truck? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1095">A: Truck. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Then there'd be somebody else who'd be put in their place, which was real dramatic cause they'd -- they'd say they cut [indecipherable] 150 people and stop there, the next 10 people in line would be sent back to the barracks, or be kept there until the trucks left, if they didn't have to change. </sentence><sentence id="1097">So it's -- it was dra -- always dramatic and tragic time, cause you hate to see anybody -- anybody be taken away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
