<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Do you remember a moment where you started feeling unease, or fear, or did it just build gradually? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: It built gradually, and I -- I think it gradually -- and the -- the -- the heightened moment of fear was about a week or two weeks prior to Kristallnacht, when as I said, we went to -- we, my father and I, went to services generally every Friday evening. </sentence><sentence id="249">And on this particular Friday evening, uniformed members of brown shirts, black shirts, call it whatever you want, uniformed Nazis, came into the front door of our synagogue, and threatened -- threatened the congregation, threatened our rabbi, and our rabbi was magnificent in defending us verbally, and ultimately the Nazis retreated. </sentence><sentence id="250">And at that moment, as I said, when we walked home I told my   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with John Lang deg October 15, 2010 father I was afraid for my life. </sentence><sentence id="251">Then two weeks later, you know, we experienced Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
