<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: So it was more religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: It was mainly Zionist oriented and graduate students went to Palestine after finishing this school. </sentence><sentence id="4">In fact, there was a reunion of survivors of that school in Israel in 1966, 1967 I think and I happened to be there for the Bar Mitzvah of my second son, Matthew and we found out that there were about half a dozen survivors, all of them living in Israel except me, so they made it. </sentence><sentence id="5">They joked around and they said " Topas remained the only Zionist among us". </sentence><sentence id="6">Because I was living in America and they were there and they served in the Israeli army, one of them achieved a very high rank in the army. </sentence><sentence id="7">And only one of the fellows that graduated the farming school remained a farmer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Did you dream of going to Palestine during that year you were at the school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="16">I had my sites set for Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="17">It was something very attractive to us, to be in a land that historically we take our roots from and for a couple of millennium there was a continuous history of the Jewish people and since we are persona non grata in Poland, in most of the countries of the world in general, then Palestine loomed very largely in our consideration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: Were there any other reasons why you ended up going to this particular school, do you recall what it was like to be Jewish and to go to public schools for higher education at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: I have never been exposed to, I have been only once in public school for a very brief period, one year that my mother sent me to public school. </sentence><sentence id="24">I don't remember the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="25">But other than that, I was always going, for instance, the primary school that I went to, the prep school so to speak was a Hebrew academy, one of the most modern of it's kind and had a religious orientation. </sentence><sentence id="26">Modern. </sentence><sentence id="27">Then I went to gymnasium henu which the Hebrew word denotes upbringing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="28">Then I went to this Tarbot School and I think the reason they sent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: How would you describe the religious life with your family when you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself. </sentence><sentence id="38">To that extent that my grandparents were assimilated on my father's side, not my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="39">But since the grandparents on my mother's side lived in a distance away from us in Forst we didn't have much contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="40">But in Warsaw, we virtually lived with our grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="41">We were living in the same apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="42">My grandparents were assimilated; they did not observe the Jewish holidays according to the law, meaning our stores were open on Saturday; although holidays like Passover and others were observed, they were observed to the extent they didn't interfere with business. </sentence><sentence id="43">And my father was a very strong opponent of assimilation himself and he sort of fashioned himself or fancied himself as a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="44">So in 1920 during the Bolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at the age of 16, probably not telling exactly the truth about his age. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was so bent to have a part of it you know in defense of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="46">But as he matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit of difference to the anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="47">All the Jews are the same. </sentence><sentence id="48">So he was a thinking individual. </sentence><sentence id="49">One of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me was going to courts and listening to trials because he liked the idea of logic expressed and the questions of law, questions of morality, questions of right and wrong, very interested, good and evil. </sentence><sentence id="50">So eventually, eventually, he became aware that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a means of   acceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure and he felt it was a bankrupt. </sentence><sentence id="51">Although many people at the time majority disagreed with him and he was a maverick in his belief. </sentence><sentence id="52">So at time already when I had reached the age of 7, he became religious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: So by the time you were seven he had concluded that assimilation was </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: He might have concluded earlier but this was when he had made the move. </sentence><sentence id="73">And our house became kosher and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="74">Because in my childhood we had a Christmas tree and we were well-to-do so it was fashionable at that time to hire German governesses because they were so clean and disciplined and so forth and I remember kneeling and clasping my hands to say a prayer in German. </sentence><sentence id="75">This was in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="76">But this radically has changed. </sentence><sentence id="77">For my father became religious and began to realize that the values that are contained in our tradition now, Torah and our bible, are the values that are endurable, they are tested and that society, it is to benefit not only to the Jews but to mankind to live by a law when morality is supreme, not other things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Did you notice this when you were seven? </sentence><sentence id="85">This must have come as a major change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: It was a major change. </sentence><sentence id="89">In fact, I remember exactly the time when my father made me aware that Iam a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="90">Because I was sheltered you know in my life in Warsaw and in schools and I was not exposed to the, I never found myself in a situation where I was exposed to anti- Semitism nor did I understand what it really meant. </sentence><sentence id="91">We lived in Poland so I was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="92">That's the way I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="93">But one time when we were in our country in the summer, I might have been then seven, that I recall that towards evening my father called me to the bedroom and he told me to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="94">I want to talk to you and he told me very briefly that we are Jewish and that we were enslaved in Egypt because this is the core of our belief and of the historical, factual tenets of our belief and that we were taken out of Egypt to become a free people., </sentence><sentence id="95">to become a people to be a light to the nations. </sentence><sentence id="96">He said a few things that were just beyond me perhaps but then I came to learn this and I was taken out of the school I was going to and I was sent to a more religious oriented school. </sentence><sentence id="97">And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we were alienated from our larger family circle because of my father's change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Your youngest brother then, he would have grown up from day one in a very religious household. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: You are very observant. </sentence><sentence id="111">That is exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="112">When I gave you the names, | told you that my name was Yusick because I was born in the era when my father was in the mood of giving Polish names and my brother's name was given originally in Stanislav although his Hebrew name that was given at his circumcision was Szymon just as mine was Benjamin Josef for Joseph Benjamin. </sentence><sentence id="113">But when my third brother was born, it was already in the era when my father's orientation was completely changed, the name that was given to him was Meir, after my grandfather's father. </sentence><sentence id="114">He was brought in completely different atmosphere from birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Would you describe your father as a strict father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: I think that I would have to say yes, as a strict father. </sentence><sentence id="123">Although he could have been quite relaxed, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he was strict. </sentence><sentence id="124">He believed that the key word we have to focus our attention is righteousness. </sentence><sentence id="125">To him, this is all and all -- to be right, to be moral, to be truthful. </sentence><sentence id="126">He felt that our civilization as we know it stands or falls with our ability to comprehend that. </sentence><sentence id="127">That this is significant. </sentence><sentence id="128">Of course, today, this is all turned upside down by   the new social science engineering which says everything goes and everybody can have his own style and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: How would you describe your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: My mother came from a religious home but she was somewhat of a rebel. </sentence><sentence id="140">Perhaps not consciously so but it was simply a question of economics. </sentence><sentence id="141">She was born as one of four sisters to a family where the head of the household, meaning her father, my grandfather, Hersh Aram, was a hat maker. </sentence><sentence id="142">And he was a working person and he was also Talmudist, studist. </sentence><sentence id="143">When he was not working he was spending his time in a house of study, in a religious house of study. </sentence><sentence id="144">Now, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, she didn't see future in following this tradition. </sentence><sentence id="145">Because they didn't have big dowries. </sentence><sentence id="146">At that time, dowries had to be given with daughters to anybody who was worth his weight in salt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: And you had a grandfather with four daughters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in lineage. </sentence><sentence id="158">Three of the four daughters went into the professions because they have seen they have to establish some economic independence. </sentence><sentence id="159">There was just no future for them in the town. </sentence><sentence id="160">Excuse me, in the town. </sentence><sentence id="161">It is still a town. </sentence><sentence id="162">It is now even more significant. </sentence><sentence id="163">I guess Poland calls it the capital of petro chemicals in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I revisited the town when I was there in 1989 and I found the apartment where my grandparents lived and possibly where they brought up these four daughters. </sentence><sentence id="165">Now, this, in the United States would be way below poverty level because the whole apartment consisted of one room and a kitchen and six people lived there. </sentence><sentence id="166">It is just hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I remember visiting there on Passover and my father would take us there and they were always immaculately clean. </sentence><sentence id="168">Everything was so perfect -- they didn't have running water. </sentence><sentence id="169">They didn't have a bathroom, no plumbing there. </sentence><sentence id="170">It was just a bewilderment when we first came to visit. </sentence><sentence id="171">My father already became religious at that time because before, we didn't go there. </sentence><sentence id="172">And it was contrast of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitan Warsaw with floors that were polished to a mirror shine with two maids in my grandma's home and plumbing and a bidet in the bathroom and all the conveniences and amenities of modern living. </sentence><sentence id="173">Whereas in Proust, it was backwards, only by contrast and they had to live there very frugally. </sentence><sentence id="174">So my mother must have realized early in her life that her future lie with her ability to support herself and to make something of herself, other than just being a woman and going through the biological process. </sentence><sentence id="175">Her older sister Franya, you" ll find out in my book, they're in furniture, you" ll find out that she had two boys and she was married to a painting contractor but she herself was a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="176">My mother was going for law but she married a wealthy husband, a well- to-do husband, a merchant, a businessman and Idacha the younger sister became a CPA, you know a public accountant. </sentence><sentence id="177">I don't know if she was certified, if such a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: A notary? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: She was definitely a notary and she was also a bookkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="202">And the youngest one was with the family. </sentence><sentence id="203">I don't think she went in to a profession; she remained at home and never married. </sentence><sentence id="204">They all perished in the Holocaust, except my grandfather who died a few years before the war. </sentence><sentence id="205">The youngest daughter's name was Razel. </sentence><sentence id="206">So this was the background. </sentence><sentence id="207">When my mother came to Warsaw, she in the university in the school of law. </sentence><sentence id="208">In other words, you must realize that I believe that only 5 or 3% of the Jews could be admitted to any state institution. </sentence><sentence id="209">She had first to get through high school, an eight year course. </sentence><sentence id="210">As she said in her own  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection application here the document that I obtained from the archives, she says on her basis of her entry examination she was admitted to the state's gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="211">She covered a course of 8+ course in 7 or 8 years, perhaps in 7 years. </sentence><sentence id="212">And then she was admitted to University of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="213">Before, they had this clause about bench clause and father restrictions but there were still restrictions about how many Jews could be admitted. </sentence><sentence id="214">And she had two handicaps -- being Jewish and being a woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: And being from a small town, by Warsaw standards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: By Warsaw standards. </sentence><sentence id="234">So in order to support herself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the Topas boys. </sentence><sentence id="235">So she was a tutor to my father and his brother Itzak and his youngest brother which was my uncle Ben. </sentence><sentence id="236">And this is how people fell in love with the tutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Not everyone has such a beautiful tutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="243"> A; Well, the results were predictable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Your father was smitten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: He must have been. </sentence><sentence id="248">And he married very young. </sentence><sentence id="249">My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19 when they married. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Did your grandparents have any say in this matter? </sentence><sentence id="254">It must have not been the planned marriage of their dreams. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: Indeed, it was not. </sentence><sentence id="258">As I understand it in retrospect, they were very much opposed to it, because in Europe it was not like in the United States where you have misalliances between rich and poor and between professional and non-professional. </sentence><sentence id="259">There was a class-consciousness, even among Jews so that it was unlikely that a person from a well-to-do family would marry someone from a very poor family by contrast. </sentence><sentence id="260">And my grandparents were opposing too on the ground that the fact that they wanted someone from a more prestigious family than some obscure town in Poland and they didn't like the idea that my mother was older than he. </sentence><sentence id="261">Four years older. </sentence><sentence id="262">They didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="263">But apparently they were overruled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: By your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Probably by my father. </sentence><sentence id="274">He wanted to have his way. </sentence><sentence id="275">My mother was never very happy living in such close proximity to my father's family because she realized the objection and she realized she was married over these objections. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Interesting. </sentence><sentence id="280">How about your father's brothers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: My father's brothers were not affected by this religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which was the second in line was a very handsome bachelor as you can see from the existing photographs, who was a bachelor for a long time and didn't get married until probably maybe a year or two before the outbreak of WWII and his position in the company was that he had the job of administrator of the properties that my grandparents possessed, owned, and he was also the head bookkeeper in the company that fabricated shoes, Topaz Shoe Company. </sentence><sentence id="284">But I have very fond memories of my uncle the bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="285">Bachelors have money. </sentence><sentence id="286">Married people have  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection responsibilities and bills. </sentence><sentence id="287">And he lived with the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="288">So my brother Szymon and I and my cousin Lela, which was the daughter of my father's sister Bella Necovyak who lived with them there, we would come on Sunday morning when my dear uncle Neteck was still sleeping in his room from the Saturday night outing trying to recover, we would be waiting for him to wake up sort of helping the process and then we would mooch from him movie money for the matinee to go and see the movie. </sentence><sentence id="289">And we would scan the daily paper to tell him what are the choices and he would open one eye and say are you here already. </sentence><sentence id="290">And he knew to buy his peace he had top give us some movie money and then we would ask him for transportation for the streetcars. </sentence><sentence id="291">Sometimes he would say, "It's such a beautiful day, why don't you go to the park?" " </sentence><sentence id="292">Why do you always have to go to the movie?" </sentence><sentence id="293">That is one of my fond memories that he was very generous that way. </sentence><sentence id="294">I also remember that he bought me my first two -wheeler. </sentence><sentence id="295">My parents probably couldn't afford it, even though they were well off but they had expenses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: And kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: And kids. </sentence><sentence id="314">That means the same. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: Now I remember that your brother, from your description, he had to have been a hell of a nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="318">I don't know whether he was a great student. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: Who is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: Your uncle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Neteck? </sentence><sentence id="326">I don't think that he distinguished himself particularly. </sentence><sentence id="327">He graduated high school. </sentence><sentence id="328">He might have taken a course in bookkeeping and administration, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="329">But the one who distinguished himself scholastically was the youngest son, Benack. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was distinguished in many sports too, that's why we remember him. </sentence><sentence id="331">The newspaper clippings would tell us about his prowess as a soccer player on a team called Hapoyal which was one of the first line teams in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="332">It was a Jewish team. </sentence><sentence id="333">Hapoyal means the worker. </sentence><sentence id="334">That didn't sit well with my grandparents who first of all were opposed to any socialist ideas and my grandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to be engaged in sports of any kind and incur an injury or something like this and I understand he incurred an injury and he had blood infection. </sentence><sentence id="335">But I remember that when he graduated high school and I was still then very young, he didn't want to go or perhaps he couldn't get admission although he was a very good student, to the University of Warsaw and he wanted to go for chemical engineering. </sentence><sentence id="336">So he went to the Polytechnic in Prague in Czechoslovakia, and became an excellent chemist in his field. </sentence><sentence id="337">He survived the war and when he came to America he couldn't get any employment. </sentence><sentence id="338">But eventually he got a job with Dutch copper and later on with Merck Pharmaceuticals when he distinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became a director of research and went to Marshall Rectify in Los Angeles and he told me one time that the rectifier that weighs about a ton made by General Electric was made by him that weighs as much as a book of matches. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: We were talking about your uncle Benack, the chemical engineer. </sentence><sentence id="354">You were saying that he went to Czechoslovakia to study. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: In the German Polytechnic there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: In the 1930's? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: In the 1930's, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: Just before the Nazis came to Czechoslovakia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="365"> \ </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: He graduated before the Sudenland, before the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="367">He must have graduated around circa 1937. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: What was he planning to do? </sentence><sentence id="371">When he finished graduating, what would he have done in Poland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: Well, in fact he did graduate and he got a job with a sub clinical lab in Poland so he was gainfully employed as a chemical engineer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: In Warsaw? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="378">A: In Warsaw. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="379"> Q; And what were you hoping to become: I remember you were interested in history and also you had an inclination toward animal husbandry after that first experience at the college in southeastern Poland. </sentence><sentence id="380">What was on your mind to be? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A: Well, once I got my feet wet in this agricultural school that my parents sent me, I really became fired with enthusiasm for being a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="382">I thought it was a great life, I thought it was a meaningful life because being close to the soil, you are close to nature and it is a very healthy life and since there is some ideological being associated with it because of Jews, basically we are a nation of farmers and freeholders. </sentence><sentence id="383">If you study ancient history, you'll find out that in it's classical period, the kingdom of David and the kingdom of Solomon when the fortunes of the Jews were at it's highest peak, most people were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="384">There were some , but they didn't have a class of merchants. </sentence><sentence id="385">In fact in Israel, when they spoke of merchants, they spoke of Canaanites. </sentence><sentence id="386">The Canaanite merchants, they used to come to temple grounds and sell trinkets or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="387">I am told there was a slogan, a motto that was displayed at the main road leading to the school buildings as you would approach the field because we had a 50 acre farm there and the name was, said in Hebrew . </sentence><sentence id="388">That means for us to return to the plow as we have moved from the plow to the scale, meaning to merchants. </sentence><sentence id="389">Because the Jews were forced in medieval times and even in earlier times in exile, they forced out of so many avenues of life, they couldn't own land, so they wound up as businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="390">So the stereotype of a Jew as a businessman which emerged in Europe was not the true echoes of the Jewish people as it was then. </sentence><sentence id="391">At the time of Moses, that came not out of propensity of the people for that particular subject but because of necessity. </sentence><sentence id="392">So I felt that we are going to turn the clock of history and we will straighten this out and we will become farmers again. </sentence><sentence id="393">Idealistic I was fired with enthusiasm, not on a single argument, but on all these that I have mentioned by others but that I cannot think of now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: So this reversal of medieval, social engineering so to speak. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="409">A: Yeah, medieval, social engineering. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="411">Q: I remember earlier you described the family reunion. </sentence><sentence id="412">The relatives from America and the differences in the way in which children behaved and also the language. </sentence><sentence id="413">What were the languages used in your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Well, my grandparents spoke to them in Yiddish because this was the language that was always used as a back up language. </sentence><sentence id="418">Also used so that we wouldn't understand it -- they wanted to say something to each other. </sentence><sentence id="419">My parents were also fluent in Yiddish so that I think this is the language they used. </sentence><sentence id="420">They might have reverted to Polish because, still, my grandmother's sister and her husband came from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="421">They emigrated only after World War I there. </sentence><sentence id="422">They still remembered the language so they could speak Polish but their daughter, Jean, was a very beautiful girl -- she was actually my brother's age. </sentence><sentence id="423">I remember they went for a walk in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="424">They got lost and finally we got a call from the police station that they found them in the park. </sentence><sentence id="425">They were lost and they came to the police station. </sentence><sentence id="426">Someone from the adults took a taxi and brought them back. </sentence><sentence id="427">She couldn't speak Polish but she knew a little Yiddish that she picked up from her parents and we just didn't know -- we communicated by body language. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="439">Q: Which languages did you normally speak? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="441">A: Polish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: Polish. </sentence><sentence id="444">I imagine you studied Hebrew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: Hebrew, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: I remember a little bit of German earlier on. </sentence><sentence id="450">Did you study German too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: I took German as my -- there was a choice given in gymnasium, usually in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="454">It was either French or German. </sentence><sentence id="455">There was a choice. </sentence><sentence id="456">That's besides Hebrew and, of course, besides Polish. </sentence><sentence id="457">Sometimes they would give you an option of English. </sentence><sentence id="458">We didn't have this option. </sentence><sentence id="459">But I learned English anyway through a tutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: So your household, would you describe it as being a Polish- speaking household? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: Basically it was a Polish- speaking household. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: That didn't change your father underwent his 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="473"> A; This didn't change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: Now, your uncles that we mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="476">They did not experience the same religious conversion that your father did: </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="485">Q: We've mentioned the shoe store. </sentence><sentence id="486">Perhaps we should describe how the store was founded and by </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="489">   whom? </sentence><sentence id="490">I know the name of the store was The I. Jacob Topas Store. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="492">But I think the founders of the whole Topas Enterprises were actually my grandfather, Jacob Topas and my grandmother Etta Sara Topas. </sentence><sentence id="493">It's hard for me to determine after such a long time something that I was not private to, just exactly who had greater share in the dynamics of the expansion of this. </sentence><sentence id="494">But it started from a very modest beginning. </sentence><sentence id="495">Because after marriage, my grandmother tried to develop the talent that my grandfather possessed. </sentence><sentence id="496">He was a person who modeled ladies" shoes. </sentence><sentence id="497">He had a flair for this so she exploited him to the extent that she wanted to set up a store that would manufacture handmade, custom-made shoes that would have his imprint on it, his model. </sentence><sentence id="498">I think this is the way it originated. </sentence><sentence id="499">First, I think that they had a place on Pyskas Street but by the time I was born they already had a flourishing store in Warsaw, in the same building where we had also an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="500">Later on they opened two more stores in Warsaw, one on Noves and one on Mar which was the main thoroughfare of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="501">But eventually, towards the time close before the outbreak of war, only the main store remained functional. </sentence><sentence id="502">Because they found out that they don't need three stores in Warsaw, that people will come to this store. </sentence><sentence id="503">Because it was unique, because of the hand-made shoes. </sentence><sentence id="504">This shoe store catered to the intelligentsia and to the theater circles; people who could pay a good price for a good pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="505">They were not inexpensive. </sentence><sentence id="506">Then we also opened a store in Katovitz before the outbreak of the war. </sentence><sentence id="507">My father ran that for a while but the Polish government forced him out by saying that they are not going to allow anybody to set up a store who was not a citizen as of 1920 or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="508">Some restrictive measure that were calculated against Jews, So we had to liquidate that store also about six months before the outbreak of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="527">Q: That's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="528">So the anti-Semitism of the Polish government was --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: Was also economic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="533">Q: Economic, yes. </sentence><sentence id="534">And of course, there was no Polish state before 1918, 1919? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: I really don't know what they used as a cutoff date as to who is allowed to have a store or not to have a store. </sentence><sentence id="538">Because initially we had representation there, someone that had stores of shoes already and was just buying our shoes because there was a demand for them. </sentence><sentence id="539">The demand was so great that we decided, I mean my parents and grandparents, decided that perhaps they should open a store there where they can also benefit from these sales to a greater extent than wholesaling it. </sentence><sentence id="540">So they went ahead and did it. </sentence><sentence id="541">But this didn't sit well probably with the merchants -- shoe merchants in the city and they put pressure on the officialdom to out stop us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="547">Q: Were there any other changes regarding your father's companies" business situation? </sentence><sentence id="548">I know there were other laws being introduced in the late thirties at this time regarding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="549">Did you know of any ---? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: There is one event in the history of our business that I only know second hand from my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="554">He was closer to the center of action there than to know it. </sentence><sentence id="555">He claimed that the Polish government had a war debt. </sentence><sentence id="556">I think probably 1920--1919, 1920, war with Russian Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="557">That the Jews were disproportionately, very heavily assessed to pay this. </sentence><sentence id="558">He told me that my grandfather, in the course of several years, had to pay something which would be in American pre-dollar value, a quarter of a million dollars but in Polish currency was close to a million zlotys which was a unit of Polish currency was defined. </sentence><sentence id="559">The ratio between one was like   five zloty to a dollar. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: Was there any chance that perhaps one of the stores was liquidated in order to help to pay this off? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A: This is quite conceivable. </sentence><sentence id="571">It might have been because I know that some real estate was sold in order to meet that --- those demands. </sentence><sentence id="572">Because my grandparents owned land in the country where we had our villa. ( </sentence><sentence id="573">End of Side A, Tape 1) I was mentioning the properties which my grandparents owned. </sentence><sentence id="574">They also, as I understand, had a building in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="575">This dates to the time that Poland was occupied; the occupation of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="576">They also had an apartment house in Danzig. </sentence><sentence id="577">But by the time I was born, all these properties were liquidated or sold, possibly to meet the demands of the Polish government. </sentence><sentence id="578">You know, the assessment as to how much of the debt is taxable to us. </sentence><sentence id="579">Poland had a peculiar labor law. </sentence><sentence id="580">It permitted occupation strike which meant -- in actual experience this is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="581">Our shoes were hand made. </sentence><sentence id="582">Most of the shoemakers which were employees were kind of the cottage-industry type meaning one who was the master craftsman employed journeymen and helpers, apprentices in his own household. </sentence><sentence id="583">He would come to our office and get the materials and the models and so forth and he would bring the ready-made products and was paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="584">He was paid in advance and he was paid when he finished it. </sentence><sentence id="585">If there were some corrections to be made, he would have to do that too. </sentence><sentence id="586">So they were individual shoemakers, perhaps a hundred or so that were making the shoes for our company. </sentence><sentence id="587">Now they became members of a union. </sentence><sentence id="588">| remember distinctly that a few years before the war, there was a strike but they called it in Poland an occupation strike, which meant that they were permitted to come into the stores and occupy the seats that normally are reserved for the customers. </sentence><sentence id="589">Bur the strike provided that they had to leave enough seats so that business can continue. </sentence><sentence id="590">Because I cannot conceive of a customer feeling comfortable in a store where there is a hostile strike. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: A labor conflict? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: Conflict, right. </sentence><sentence id="616">So I recall that strike and I remember an incident there that was largely discussed and talked about later. </sentence><sentence id="617">That one of the strikers, a heavy big guy, not only did he sit on the chairs but he stretched himself across several chairs to occupy. </sentence><sentence id="618">My father took him and forcibly threw him out the store. </sentence><sentence id="619">But the thing that struck me later is that I don't recall that any of the non-Jewish firms were ever affected by such a strike. </sentence><sentence id="620">This strike was eventually resolved and everything then returned to normal, but it was one of those things that the Jews were not the first-class citizens in Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="627">Q: Even if they were well off? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="629">A: Even if they were well off, I would imagine. </sentence><sentence id="630">Because a Jew always has to prove himself as a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="631">For instance, when the threat of war loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to show their loyalty, especially against Germany so there is in a book called Image Before My Eyes by Lucien Dobritsky, there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to the Polish air force as a show of patriotism. </sentence><sentence id="632">But it didn't help. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="637">Q: As if anyone could have suspected or expected Jews to be in favor of Germany in such a war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="639">A: But they said -- the Polish parliament, which was only debating since the death of Puchentsky, was only debating I should say since 1935, was only debating the Jewish problem and attributed   all the economic reverses or problems to the Jewish question of being a large majority there. </sentence><sentence id="640">Although the largest majority were really Ukrainians, minority I mean. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="644">Q: Minorities, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="646">A: Were Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="647">But this was most of -- the Jews disturbed them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="650">Q: So the Jewish problem was the greater one than the German problem? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="652">A: Because they made it so. </sentence><sentence id="653">This was what was debated. </sentence><sentence id="654">When a Jewish member of their parliament, their Same as they called it, came out and he said that we should confront; we should unite and should confront a common enemy; so the response was that these are two separate questions. </sentence><sentence id="655">That the Jewish question and the German question have nothing to do with the Jewish problem. </sentence><sentence id="656">That's the way -- that was the answer </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: The workers, the people who made the shoes, were they non-Jewish or Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="664">A: Non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="665">In that -- shoemakers were all non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="666">Now there are people which are doing the tops and they were mostly Jewish because this is something that trade that falls within the sphere of Jewish interest for some reason or another. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="670">Q: The customers would be of all faiths? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="672">A: Yes, very heavily Christian. </sentence><sentence id="673">Because the product was known and you still can find people today that are of my age who live in Warsaw; they all remember the shoe store in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="674">Because it was a known firm, it was a known name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="678">Q: Now, 1938, which was the last year you were in Warsaw before the war; that was also the year when the Germans were expelling Polish Jews back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="679">Do you have any recollection of any of that? </sentence><sentence id="680">Did you witness any? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: Yes, we seen people with bundles that were sometimes seen on the street. </sentence><sentence id="685">My father would point out to me and say these are refugees from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="686">Also we seen photographs in the newspaper, pictures in the newspaper of the rioting. </sentence><sentence id="687">The stories that were behind them; where they were stripped of German citizenship and the Polish government declared quickly that they stripped them also of the Polish citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="688">So they were people without citizenship; it was very sad; it was a foretaste of things to come to an unimaginable proportion and degree. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="694">Q: Earlier we were talking about patriotism, the Polish patriotism of your father. </sentence><sentence id="695">I recall when we were looking at the photographs, that you mentioned other family members who were involved in various patriotic efforts; either when Poland was just becoming independent. </sentence><sentence id="696">I'm referring to the war against the Soviet Union in 1920. </sentence><sentence id="697">Then I remember too, there is someone who is in the Russian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="702">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="703">Poland, as you know, was occupied and didn't regain its independence until 1918 and prior to this, it was partitioned and occupied by three major powers which was Germany, Austrian-Hungarian empire and Russia. </sentence><sentence id="704">Warsaw was mainly under the Russian influence and Russian zone, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="705">The Russian government tried to -- they had a very strong intensive program of reciprocation, so the language in high schools was Russian and Russian was the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection language that you had to do business in Poland, in official Poland. </sentence><sentence id="706">Also when people were drafted into the army, they went to the Imperial Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="707">Now my grandfather, probably still a bachelor, was drafted into the Czar's army and was sent to Manchuria during the Russo- Japanese war. </sentence><sentence id="708">I remember him telling me stories of how cheap life was, of how many times they executed Chinese. </sentence><sentence id="709">The Russians were executing Chinese and they were frightened of the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="710">The Russians might have cast the fear among the Chinese; they didn't do so well with the Japanese because we know that the outcome of the war was not favorable to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="711">But he served with them. </sentence><sentence id="712">I don't know, I couldn't tell you just how long. </sentence><sentence id="713">I know he was with his friend who became his brother-in-law later because they married two sisters when they came back from the war, back to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="714">My future grandfather, Jacob Topas married my grandmother Esther Topas. </sentence><sentence id="715">So this was one experience of the military. </sentence><sentence id="716">I don't think my grandfather volunteered but my father did volunteer to the militia as I mentioned before, during the Bolshevik invasion and was very patriotic that way. </sentence><sentence id="717">In fact my father served in the Polish army later on already because there was a conscription, also Metek served in the Polish army for a short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="718">My father was a non-commissioned officer in the Polish army and after serving it, probably at a time when I was born, he also had to go periodically. </sentence><sentence id="719">He was recalled for maneuvers and for a few weeks of what they called exercises, military exercises. </sentence><sentence id="720">My father believed that we, the Jewish people, should be loyal regardless of anti-Semitism regardless of the inequities that existed in the social sphere of life, the economic discrimination --that we still owe allegiance to the country that we live in. </sentence><sentence id="721">In that respect, there was no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="722">He was also a realist and he knew that we have to get out of Poland because we are an endangered species there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: My recollection is that even your mother was involved -- in describing her experiences at the University of Warsaw and then the tutoring work that she did. </sentence><sentence id="747">There was a document that you showed me earlier ---. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="751">That document showed that after graduating high school in 1918, 1919, she, during vacation time, did volunteer work in what they called Polish soldier home, which is apparently, I would imagine it's a convalescent home for soldiers that were injured in that 1919-1920 war. </sentence><sentence id="752">So she was briefly employed there or volunteered her services. </sentence><sentence id="753">She introduced that certificate and other certificates similar where she worked as a teacher in a school sort of to support her application for law school in the Warsaw University. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="758">Q: This was in 1920 when she was helping, helping to care for the Polish soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="760">A: Soldiers, I think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="762">Q: Which would have been the middle of that war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="766">Q: Yet, one of your family members was considered not to be a citizen of Poland? </sentence><sentence id="767">Or not a citizen of Poland early enough? </sentence><sentence id="768">I remember when you were talking about your store and --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="772">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="773">This was not a citizen of Poland but a citizen of the city. </sentence><sentence id="774">This is kind of a discrimination, sort of compartment -- put in different compartments. </sentence><sentence id="775">You can be in this compartment but you cannot be in the other compartment. </sentence><sentence id="776">What it meant is that our family opened a branch of our store -- I think they opened it probably in 1938 ---. </sentence><sentence id="777">After six months of   existence, the Polish government of the city of Kapolt ordered them out because they claimed that they were not citizens of the city, or dwellers or residents of the city at some undetermined time which would otherwise by implication permit it. </sentence><sentence id="778">Justify them being there, prusterick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Of course, Katavista was near the German frontier and I imagine they were more paranoid than usual of all the border area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: I think that basically they couldn't possibly -- they couldn't question my father's credentials since he was a reserve non-commissioned officer, volunteer in a war against Russia. </sentence><sentence id="790">It was simply a question of economic discrimination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="793">Q: Economic anti-Semitism regardless of patriotism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="795">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="797">Q: Now meanwhile you were off to the east, studying to be a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="798">I imagine you had mixed feelings. </sentence><sentence id="799">You obviously liked being near animals. </sentence><sentence id="800">You wanted to be a farmer and yet you were far away from home. </sentence><sentence id="801">You had left the big city and now you're in the sticks. </sentence><sentence id="802">I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="803">For Poland that was the sticks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: You're going to make me say things which are in my book, really. </sentence><sentence id="812">I am firm about that but you are very perceptive in understanding that someone who came from a big city suddenly changes his environment to a very raw surroundings in a sense -- that we had to haul our own water, even in our dormitory and we were always exposed to the elements. </sentence><sentence id="813">The creature comforts that our home provided were very remote there. </sentence><sentence id="814">It was not easy to get assimilated there. </sentence><sentence id="815">I remember from the first class -- there were maybe thirty students that started the course. </sentence><sentence id="816">By the time of the fall harvest, of the potato harvest, it was reduced to about twenty. </sentence><sentence id="817">Because the others quit, just packed up and went home because it was just too tough for them. </sentence><sentence id="818">But with me, it was very tough and I was always on the verge of quitting during the harvest. </sentence><sentence id="819">But I said -- I felt that it was an embarrassment to come home and say that I failed. </sentence><sentence id="820">So I said, let me see if I can hold out at least another week because it doesn't look good to come after the first week. </sentence><sentence id="821">So by several such resolutions, I extended my stay beyond the harvest time. </sentence><sentence id="822">Eventually I got to like the school and I took pride in being able to work there and being knowledgeable about crops and about animals and animal life. </sentence><sentence id="823">Anything that relates to this type of life interested me. </sentence><sentence id="824">I had a genuine interest in it that was developed by a very dynamic teacher and director of the school, a fellow named Yachim Scholinsky who still lives in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="825">A very dynamic person who made study an excitement. </sentence><sentence id="826">He put excitement in it which you don't normally find in classrooms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="843">Q: Where were you when the war broke out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="845">A: When the war broke out, I was in that school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: Almost harvest time again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="849">A: Well, it was past the harvest time because the war broke out on September 1, as you know, and the harvest usually starts in the middle of June and continues up to this point. </sentence><sentence id="850">Hitler did very well by waiting for the Poles to gather for him, all the harvest and put them in barns where they   can easily have it picked up for their own use and for the army's use, there was feeding off Poland, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="854">Q: Were you surprised by the outbreak of war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="856">A: Yes, I was surprised by the reality of it not about what you read in the papers. </sentence><sentence id="857">Because the movies and the papers, they create a different image and illusion of what things really are until you are really directly affected by them. </sentence><sentence id="858">The outbreak of the war was excitement and sort of loss of interest for school subjects. </sentence><sentence id="859">The school authorities suspended classes and they had dismissed all the students to go to their respective hometowns except for the contingent from Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="860">Because they said Warsaw is under bombardment and for our own safety, we will remain in school. </sentence><sentence id="861">Because our school, I think the war broke out on Friday morning, I think on Sunday our buildings were already occupied by the Polish army because they were quartered there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="868">Q: In what other ways does the war affect you? </sentence><sentence id="869">School is closed, Polish army takes over the school, your home is besieged by German forces --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="872">A: Not yet, at the very beginning, but it was under heavy pressure and bombardment because Warsaw -- there was a mass bombing raid on Warsaw before the war was declared. </sentence><sentence id="873">This was done on September 1*" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="876">Q: And those continued, the bombing attacks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="878">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="879">Sometimes I think, I don't know if the war was declared, maybe at night or at 10 a.m. but it was already much later, hours already into the race where most of the Polish air force already was wiped out on the airfields before they got up in the air. </sentence><sentence id="880">So they definitely were taken by surprise -- those that shouldn't have been taken by surprise. </sentence><sentence id="881">We heard on the radio Friday morning at breakfast time, we heard about the attack on Warsaw and about the war. </sentence><sentence id="882">Of course, there were mixed emotions. </sentence><sentence id="883">There was a lot of excitement but there was also great concern. </sentence><sentence id="884">What does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="885">What does it portend? </sentence><sentence id="886">But the authorities were very reassuring. </sentence><sentence id="887">They said the war will soon be over and everybody will go home. </sentence><sentence id="888">I don't know whether by this they meant that Poland will win the war or there would be an armistice and the newscasters were very bombastic and enthusiastic in their reports. </sentence><sentence id="889">Of course, we didn't know, we didn't have the idea, the ability to be critical. </sentence><sentence id="890">We had no critical ability to be able to sort of digest the essence and what truth is in it. </sentence><sentence id="891">You would hear -- a broadcaster would say like this : The Polish cavalry is fighting in East Prussia like wild lions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="906">Q: You had never seen a wild lion before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: But that was a kind of metaphor meaning that they are fierce fighters and also that they are -- the Polish army is advancing on Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="909">I mean this was like on the first or second day of the war. </sentence><sentence id="910">When England and France joined the war on the third day and we could hear the English national anthem and the Marseilles played over the radio, there was literally -- the newspapers were hysterical. </sentence><sentence id="911">They felt that the war is going to be finished in a matter of -- in a short time. </sentence><sentence id="912">Nobody really predicted any specific time but the feeling was that it was just a question of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="918">Q: That Poland would win? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="920">A: That Poland, together with England and France would win. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="922">Q: When did you realize that Germany would win this one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="924">A: When they told me that -- and I was in the city of Lublin -- that the Germans would be here in one hour. </sentence><sentence id="925">In a city and Lublin was under bombardment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="928">Q: It's way to the east. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="930">A: It's past Warsaw, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: What about the Russian invasion? </sentence><sentence id="933">Did that come as a surprise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: It was anti-climatic but it came also as a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="937">Perhaps to many people it was a welcome surprise because out of the two evils, many people thought that if they went to the Russian zone -- in the beginning it was very easy when they divide because the border was not firm -- there was an influx of people both ways and they were not yet -- they didn't have yet a strict instruction, how to handle the border movement across the border. </sentence><sentence id="938">So that anybody that thought, believed that he was better off being on the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of people made that choice and then they went. </sentence><sentence id="939">They made a wise choice because they had a greater chance of survival in Russia even those who were sent to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="940">They were displaced, they still had a better chance of survival because there was no deliberate effort by Stalin to destroy the people, no matter what nationality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="946">Q: Unless they were Kolaks or or bourgeois or of production. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="948">A: Or Polish officers in Katin. </sentence><sentence id="949">That's an interesting aspect of the Polish officers in Katin that many people don't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="950">A lot of Jewish officers were among these Polish officers and they were killed including the chief chaplain of the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="951">The Jewish chaplain of the Polish army. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="965">A: I didn't really know what was happening to my family. </sentence><sentence id="966">I could not establish contact. </sentence><sentence id="967">I don't know whether the telephone lines were still functioning in the few days of the war but I know that I managed to send a telegram to my mother asking her to send me money for a ticket to go back to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="968">I don't know whether she send me the money in time or whether the authorities gave us the money to buy the tickets because eventually they relented and they told us that we can return to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="969">I think there were about five or six of us that immediately began to pack and go. </sentence><sentence id="970">I remember a very interesting incident. </sentence><sentence id="971">When I was in the post office  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection standing in line to send a telegram, there was a line -- the post office also had the national savings bank of Poland which was called PKO, -- that means Polish Fund of, Saving Fund, which was government fund and people were using savings books. </sentence><sentence id="972">So there were two Polish women standing in line talking to each other and very patriotically that they still have confidence in the Polish government and that they are depositing. </sentence><sentence id="973">They were depositing, </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1003">A: I gladly paid for it because I had sufficient funds to pay for it. </sentence><sentence id="1004">The irony of it was that we never got near Warsaw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1007">Q: Well, you didn't know it was surrounded, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1009">A: Of course. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Not only was it surrounded because the train traveled for about 40 or 50 kilometers and the railroad tracks were going skyward. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1013">Q: The aerial bombardment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1015">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1016">There was no further railroad transportation --from there on, we were on foot. </sentence><sentence id="1017">We never got any further than Lublin, the city of Lublin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1021">Q: In retrospect, retrospective knowledge, what were your family experiencing in Warsaw during these months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1023">A: You mean, actually weeks of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1025">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1027">A: What was not known to me and I found out later by miraculously meeting with my father in Lublin is that the Polish government -- there is a controversy about it by historians. </sentence><sentence id="1028">Some claim that the Germans, on Polish language gave the order in Polish to the Warsaw population that all able bodied men of military age should march east for mobilization where they going to make a defense deeper in Poland, in the country. </sentence><sentence id="1029">This was given on the night, I think, of the sixth or seventh of September. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Then my father and his two brothers were of military age and the followed these orders. </sentence><sentence id="1031">They marched east of the Vistula River and they marched east without any specific destination but they continued to march east where they were being strafed by the Stuka planes. </sentence><sentence id="1032">But this order, a few hours later was countermanded. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I think the name of the officer that gave the order, countermanded it, was Romanowski. </sentence><sentence id="1034">By that time, it was already too late. </sentence><sentence id="1035">Because I think the afterthought was they wanted to defend Warsaw and all the manpower that would have done the defense left Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1036">So my father and his two brothers   were actually on the road with thousands upon thousands of men and easy targets for the German Luftwaffe to strafe and to kill. </sentence><sentence id="1037">The casualties were tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="1038">Eventually my father lost contact with his two brothers in the confusion that ensued and he got as far as Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="1039">I found him on the evening of Rosh Hashanah, New Year's, in the synagogue where I went to pray. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I lived there too and I seen my father there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1056">Q: So it was a chance encounter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1058">A: Yes, it was unbelievable because there were thousands upon thousands of refugees that converged on Lublin and flooded the town way beyond its normal population. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1060">Q: Were the rest of the family back in Warsaw, were they affected at all by the bombardment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1062">Were there any ---? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1063">A: Yes, the building that we lived in, the artillery destroyed part of the roof of the building. </sentence><sentence id="1064">One of the bombs struck the courtyard and killed a couple of people who were in a doorway, didn't go to the shelter. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I was also told that there was a maid in our building, in one of the store that were in the building -- there was a drugstore by the name of Prusak. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Prusak was a very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="1067">I think it was a family store. </sentence><sentence id="1068">He was the son of the owners and used to give candles and other things to kids when they came in with parents. </sentence><sentence id="1069">He, somehow, got set on fire by a firebomb and became like a human torch and was burned alive during the bombardment. </sentence><sentence id="1070">They had no water because all the facilities were disrupted so people literally had to travel to the Vistula River with buckets to bring water. </sentence><sentence id="1071">The utilities were not restored until the Germans took the city at the end of September. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1081">Q: So your brothers, your mother, your grandparents --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1083">A: My grandfather, not grandparents because grandma left for United States on the last ship before the outbreak of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1085">Q: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="1086">So grandpa is there and what was the plan? </sentence><sentence id="1087">When your grandmother left to go to America, what was the plan? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1091">A: The plan was that she is able to help us in some way. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Possibly to see if she can send us affidavits so we all can go. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Because she went on a tourist visa and ostensibly to see the World's Fair. </sentence><sentence id="1094">But in reality, she had a sister living there that visited us a few years earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1095">They were bakers here. </sentence><sentence id="1096">So she went to see this sister. </sentence><sentence id="1097">My father and the family here hoped that she would be able to help because by that time it was already too late. </sentence><sentence id="1098">My grandmother was granted a visa and, of course, after obtaining the visa, she had to buy the ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1099">The name of the shipping company in Poland is called Orbees to this day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1109">Q: The same company? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1111">A: My father later told me that there was such a melee in the office of wives of important Polish diplomats and government officials, they were asking to get a ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1112">They had no problems with visas and so forth but they were sold out. </sentence><sentence id="1113">They would say that they would sleep on the deck of a ship if there were no more cabins. </sentence><sentence id="1114">You know, they couldn't get it; they knew already what was coming. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1119">Q: This was on the Puzutski the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1121">A: Yes, Puzutski. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1123">Q: Interesting that some of these people had less confidence in Poland's ability to withstand the German attack. </sentence><sentence id="1124">You mentioned a family of diplomats and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1127">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1129">Q: So your grandmother was able to help you from America? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1131">A: Yes, well this happened sometimes later. </sentence><sentence id="1132">It was not-- after the order was restored in the occupied Poland and they allowed return to Warsaw; we left probably already in October sometime, in later part of October; by horse and wagon rather than by train to come back to occupied Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1133">My father immediately proceeded, engaged people to repair the building, the roof in the building and to restore it because otherwise we wouldn't have shelter. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And it was actually in the later fall, perhaps in November of that year, we didn't get packages. </sentence><sentence id="1135">We got affidavits for the whole family to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1136">My father studied these affidavits and debated whether he should go to German authorities to obtain permission to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I don't know what specific reasons were given but he never made use of these affidavits because the fear was that there were already some other people that have American relatives reported and they were imprisoned. </sentence><sentence id="1138">This was very strange because American was not at war with Germany at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So we never made use -----there was great excitement and expectation, the great expectation -- but it sort of was left in abeyance. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Bur later on, of course, we didn't feel it so badly at that time but soon famine came and Russian and all this. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And things got progressively well. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Then the packages began to come from America, from my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="1143">She used to send an average of six packages a day. </sentence><sentence id="1144">In the course of two days every member of the family would get a package. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1159">Q: And you would be able to correspond with her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1161">A: We could correspond with her. </sentence><sentence id="1162">The mail was going, it was censored, we had to be careful what we are saying. </sentence><sentence id="1163">We couldn't make any complaints. </sentence><sentence id="1164">We understood this, that we have to be brief in expressing. </sentence><sentence id="1165">We had to sort of let her read between the lines. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1171">Q: How long did these packages continue to come? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1173">A: The packages came until the breakdown of the postal system in the Warsaw Ghetto, meaning until the Germans put an end to it which was a few months before the deportation to Treblinka, the big action as they call it, the Grossactuen which would put it in May of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1174">The packages became sporadic, eventually there was a cut off point but they were our lifesavers because the famine in 1941 became very severe. </sentence><sentence id="1175">If you read the notes, the Ringlem notes of the Warsaw Ghetto, you" ll find out that people were dying at the rate of 400, 500 a day. </sentence><sentence id="1176">It was twice as much already in "42. </sentence><sentence id="1177">These packages were a thing that made a difference between us living or dying of hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1178">Because we had no other resources that I knew of at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1179">We had some hidden shoes but it was very dangerous to sell them even in a clandestine fashion. </sentence><sentence id="1180">The rations were not enough to sustain life. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I remember during the time of famine in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1941 that the children would just go in groups on the streets, after the curfew; I think the curfew was 8 p.m. But it was not dark yet during the summer months so they would walk on the streets   barefoot with the swollen legs and beg for alms and beg for food. </sentence><sentence id="1182">One of the standard lines they would say, Yan which means I don't want to surrender my ration card. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Surrender meaning dying, so they were begging for bread. </sentence><sentence id="1184">My parents would always do something, however inconsequential this would have been to withstand this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1198">Q: What did your grandmother send? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1200">A: The packages that we would get, I have a feeling, were not something that she, herself, prepared. </sentence><sentence id="1201">There must have been an agency that handled and she just paid them for it. </sentence><sentence id="1202">But it had canned goods like sardines, it had coconut butter, a can of coconut butter which was very useful because my brother, my youngest brother Meir, had a touch of tuberculosis and he was spitting with blood so he needed that. </sentence><sentence id="1203">They would send us Salem Lipton Tea, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1204">Lipton Tea was worth its weight in gold because you could get -- coffee and tea was at a premium, above other commodities except maybe for bread. </sentence><sentence id="1205">So some of these things we used and some of them were sold in order to buy bread. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1212">Q: So she helped feed you and she essentially gave you the wherewithal to supplement? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1214">A: She gave us a lease on life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1216">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1217">And everyone received a package? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1220">A: Well, everyone received a package by families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1222">Q: Who would she address it to? </sentence><sentence id="1223">To your -----? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1226">A: Different names of our family members. </sentence><sentence id="1227">But we understood who was -- it was for Shimatopas, it meant it was for our family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: For everyone, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1231">What happened to the shoe store under the occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1234">A: Well, in 1939 I believe, in November, late October or November, the Germans had arrived and confiscated all the shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1235">It was quite -- the shoe store was closed already and they came in. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I remember when they were standing; they rang the bell in my grandfather's apartment which was one flight above the shoe store in the same apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="1237">It was a four-story apartment building with a courtyard in the center and apartments surrounding it. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I remember the chief gendarme said, Is das de grochen 2 , Isaac Yacob Topas? </sentence><sentence id="1239">So when it was answered in the affirmative, then they graciously told him that he could keep something like 20 or 30 pair of shoes, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1240">They gave him a receipt for it and they said the rest will be confiscated and he will have to help to load up the trucks, himself. </sentence><sentence id="1241">He and my father and people that were caught on the street to help out with this, so there was kind of a, like a bucket brigade carrying the shoes to those trucks that were being loaded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1250">Q: Do you remember when this was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1252">A: I would have to look in my book for exact date but it was either in -- the closest I can think, November, more likely November 1939. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1254">Q: So the Germans knew who your grandfather was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1256">A: Well, they had information about shoe stores and businesses and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1258">Q: I was trying to imagine when we were talking about the affidavits earlier, the reasons why he wouldn't pursue that and I thought to myself, well perhaps he didn't want to call attention to himself, especially since other people were being arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1259">---presenting yourselves to the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1262">A: Well, I have a feeling, because this happened later, even more so. </sentence><sentence id="1263">That anyone, this was probably among the Jews more prevailing this, that reported to the German authorities and showed they had affidavits and wanted to leave for America, the Germans could let them go, they could tell them to go home, or they could put them in prison. </sentence><sentence id="1264">We knew in Poviac which was the most wholesome prison in Warsaw that they had some Jewish families that had American --. </sentence><sentence id="1265">We didn't even want to let them know that we had American relationships although the packages would have indicated this. </sentence><sentence id="1266">But they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Food packages is this kind of thing, that it doesn't have any political significance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1274">Q: But it's curious that the Germans were consciously trying to starve the ghetto of Warsaw and yet they allowed the food packages to come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1276">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Because it was a drop in the bucket. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Maybe they would feel differently if it was a real organized Jewish effort in America to send packages by the thousands to cover most of the people in the city. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Then they would say that it would be counter to their policy of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1280">In fact, my grandmother's sister with whom she lodged at the beginning after she arrived in America, there was a limit on what she could take. </sentence><sentence id="1281">She couldn't take currency, just a few hundred dollars, from Poland when she came over to visit. </sentence><sentence id="1282">But she had some jewelry and she was using that to cash in the jewelry to send us these packages. </sentence><sentence id="1283">But that was not enough and she had to go and sought a job and found -- became a nurse, kind of a live-in nurse with a paralyzed woman so the income from this, from working as a nurse, she would use to send us these packages. </sentence><sentence id="1284">She is a big heroine in our family. </sentence><sentence id="1285">She did this and her sister, I found out when I came to the United States, was trying to dissuade her and would say, Itala, that was her name she was called by. </sentence><sentence id="1286">What are you doing? </sentence><sentence id="1287">What are you knocking yourself out? </sentence><sentence id="1288">They are not going to get these packages. </sentence><sentence id="1289">The Germans are going to confiscate all these packages. </sentence><sentence id="1290">Therefore you are doing it in vain. </sentence><sentence id="1291">My grandmother, and this was a very persuasive argument because it is always easier not to do something than to do something, kind of a law of gravity, if she listened to her, we would have perished sooner. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I probably wouldn't get the point where I can start my concentration camp career. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1310">Q: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1312">A: I wouldn't get that far. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1314">Q: You may not have survived the ghetto either. </sentence><sentence id="1315">I mean there were all kinds of ways of not surviving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1318">A: Absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1320">Q: Do you recall any other -- I can remember you had an introduction to farming and no doubt you were able to put some of that training to use in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1322">A: Well, the training of the farming stood me well in several ways. </sentence><sentence id="1323">First of all in that school, it was a bodybuilding process. </sentence><sentence id="1324">The hard work. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I became, I was what you call a strong fellow, a young man. </sentence><sentence id="1326">Secondly, it gave me the knowledge of agriculture and ability to work on a farm. </sentence><sentence id="1327">In the Warsaw Ghetto there was an organization called Toporol, T-o-p-o-1-o-l, which stood for , Means a society supporting agricultural work. </sentence><sentence id="1328">That opened courses in the Warsaw Ghetto for people interested in this and I took those courses. </sentence><sentence id="1329">This way I became affiliated with this organization.(End of Tape 1.) </sentence><sentence id="1330">In the summer of 1941, perhaps even in the late spring of 1941, the Toporol organization, that organization that was dedicated to the agricultural work, sees an opportunity of utilizing all empty and vacant lots of buildings or just squares -- to utilize them in growing vegetables for the starving ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Of course, it was a puny effort in comparison to the need where you have half a million people, nearly half a million people, starving in the walls of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1332">But nevertheless, the effort was necessary even if the produce that came from all this work was distributed to the students that were working on it. </sentence><sentence id="1333">Because it was not that much that they could -- it would be very difficult for them anyhow to get it past that point. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I was at a time, already sixteen years old and I was made, appointed, one of the instructors. </sentence><sentence id="1335">I remember there was a large plot, yard in the street, Leshner Street, not far from where we lived where I had two groups of students that were coming. </sentence><sentence id="1336">One for two hours and then the next one for two hours and I was showing them how -- we were working those lots and I was showing them how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1337">They were very eager kids, even some of them were, of course, undernourished. </sentence><sentence id="1338">They were very enthusiastically interested in the work and doing this work. </sentence><sentence id="1339">In fact, one of the girls that was in the group, not in my group but in the group of another instructor who was sick and I was sent there as a replacement one time to fill in, remembered me long after the war and sent me a letter to this effect, which became an appendix to my book. </sentence><sentence id="1340">She is trying to find out whether I am the same person who acted as an instructor at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1341">These kids were very eager and we were planting lettuce, radishes, tomatoes, I remember, cabbage, very basic things in a kind of garden farming or tract farming as they call it. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I was also assigned on a Gensha Street prison and I also remember working at a cemetery on Gensha Street and there was a very stark contrast between what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="1343">We were pruning tomato plants for the living, while perhaps a 100 feet from us or less, there were people being buried in mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Usually the method that was used, they were using a chute from the back of a wagon into those graves. </sentence><sentence id="1345">The work was going on all day. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Those people were being -- the dead were being collected. </sentence><sentence id="1347">By that time the famine was very severe. </sentence><sentence id="1348">I was occupied with this job, which sometimes the reward was to the students and the instructors that they could pick up some of the crops of their own handiwork, own labor and I think that the instructors were also getting, weekly, a loaf of bread. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1378">Q: Were you an instructor as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1380">A: Yeah, I was an instructor. </sentence><sentence id="1381">That was what we were getting above the students, the people that were coming in these groups. </sentence><sentence id="1382">In the end of June of the same summer, a call went out from this organization for able bodied men, whom they have on their roster already, to report for volunteer work in the states around the Lublin district to help with the harvest. </sentence><sentence id="1383">My parents very quickly consented to me to go. </sentence><sentence id="1384">They would have one less mouth to feed and the conditions in ghettos were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1385">By that time, my brother Szymon also already had a touch of tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="1386">He was spitting blood. </sentence><sentence id="1387">This is even with the help of the packages we were getting from America. </sentence><sentence id="1388">It was just not enough. </sentence><sentence id="1389">We were shipped to the district of Lublin and we worked there. </sentence><sentence id="1390">We were quartered there and worked there. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Even after the harvest I managed to  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection stay there until February of the following year. </sentence><sentence id="1392">This was a very significant factor in my own personal survival from the standpoint that I was able to eat normally during that period of time and live in a healthy environment of the country, quite a contrast. </sentence><sentence id="1393">In fact after I had been a month on those estates, I thought to bring my brother Szymon there, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1394">There was a small post office and I managed to make a phone call to a store that was opposite to our apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="1395">My father came to the phone and I told him about this. </sentence><sentence id="1396">He said that my brother Szymon didn't look like a Jew and he could pass for an Aryan easily -- that he should come and join me, that he should send him out of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1397">He came and he stayed for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Of course there was a problem there. </sentence><sentence id="1399">He got homesick and eventually he left and went back home to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1422">Q: Because he was homesick? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1493">A: Yes, I think within a day or two we already knew what Treblinka meant. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Many people didn't want to believe it, we believed it. </sentence><sentence id="1495">In these circumstances-- by that time my brother and I were already in a Luftwaffe camp, my brother Szymon. </sentence><sentence id="1496">In other words, he -- we both report as volunteers to go to Luftwaffe camp yet before this action was launched. </sentence><sentence id="1497">This was kind if a transition from the agricultural work into the Luftwaffe camp and this was a forced labor column. </sentence><sentence id="1498">We were not quartered there; we were still living with our family and were just coming to a point at the Warsaw Ghetto gate where two Luftwaffe guards would take us to our job. </sentence><sentence id="1499">Sometimes they used streetcars for part of the trip. </sentence><sentence id="1500">There was a place called Bilanie; there was a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment, paints, and maintenance things for aircraft when we were supposed to work. </sentence><sentence id="1501">But initially they got us cleaning bricks in bombed-out houses. </sentence><sentence id="1502">I don't know why but I said to myself, we are back in the brickfields, we are back in the brickfields. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Symbolically we were reduced to the status of our ancestors in Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="1504">But this still was, comparatively, benign to what was in store for us in this forced labor column. </sentence><sentence id="1505">When the action was launched, as I mentioned before, on the second and third day, there were no volunteers to go to the umschlagplatz. </sentence><sentence id="1506">So the Germans began isolating and putting a dragnet on certain sections of -- block by block of the city and emptied the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1507">They also would come in, when the Germans came to conduct this with their trucks and wagons, sometimes, they usually marched people, those that could march. </sentence><sentence id="1508">Those who were already immobile, they were handicapped or they were so starved that they couldn't walk, they threw them in the wagons and they took them that way. </sentence><sentence id="1509">They could come in and announce that they would respect all the passes because the people were working for German industry; they were working maybe for the ghetto government, like the Judenrat; they were working for the city ornundines which was the police; maybe they were working for the hospital; they would be all exempt. </sentence><sentence id="1510">So they were ---. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1531">A: They had an assorted degree of authority that in the beginning, they respected them all. </sentence><sentence id="1532">As the time went on, they were less and less respected. </sentence><sentence id="1533">I didn't have any pass so that if I was caught, I probably would have been shipped out to Treblinka too because we were simply assembling every morning before the action started, however, early in the morning to go out and were brought at the end of the day, to the point, to the gate and then we were on our own to get home.. But after this action went into effect and was already in effect for a week or two, once we came to work, the captain said when you come tomorrow to work, bring your things with you because you're going to be here, interned for your own protection. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Then he looked at the faces; he passed all of us in review. </sentence><sentence id="1535">The whole group of about two hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="1536">He looked at my brother and he said he cannot come tomorrow, he's too young. </sentence><sentence id="1537">He also, maybe, exempted another kid and that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="1538">When we came home, the ghetto was in such a state of terror besides this, that the German SS men were riding in rickshaws. </sentence><sentence id="1539">You know what the rickshaws were? </sentence><sentence id="1540">They were those bicycle-pedaled three-wheelers where the passengers are sitting in the front and the bicycle-peddler in the back. </sentence><sentence id="1541">They would ride in the bicycle-pedaled  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection rickshaw and they would be firing at the windows at the people and the crowds wherever they see them.. So we were literally dodging bullets when we were coming back from our work. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Of course, after that incident, after we were told that we're going to be interned there, I realized that I'm going to have to part from my family. </sentence><sentence id="1543">The morning after this, when I got up in the morning, my father was still praying. </sentence><sentence id="1544">I said goodbye to my mother and she was packing some of my things that I was going to take with me. </sentence><sentence id="1545">I said goodbye to my sweet brother Meir, my youngest brother, Meir, and to Szymon. </sentence><sentence id="1546">Then my father gave me a blessing; it was the first time I'd seen him cry in my life because he was a very steady influence. </sentence><sentence id="1547">He was a very self- possessed individual and confident that somehow we're going to get through this whole ordeal and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1548">I don't know what was going on in his mind but if I did not realize it, he must have realized that we are parting for good. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1585">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="1586">I also had faith that evil cannot vanquish good. </sentence><sentence id="1587">So in the long run, I don't think that there was any doubt even by those who perished that Germany will be defeated and that they're going to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="1588">The question is when. </sentence><sentence id="1589">But there was no doubt that Hitler will lose that war and that the Allies will prevail and win. </sentence><sentence id="1590">But meanwhile, we were in their grasp so such optimism has a limited value and effect on your well-being. </sentence><sentence id="1591">Of course when I took my last glance at my father, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1592">I haven't seen him again nor my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1593">I went to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1594">We learned that in October, Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgment, was the last day of the shipments to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="1595">In fact, the Jewish police had the honor of being put in the last transport to Treblinka because they were promised that if they cooperate in the round-up of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, that they and their families would be spared. </sentence><sentence id="1596">So they and their families on the Judgment Day were spared until that point but then they were also shipped. </sentence><sentence id="1597">I guess there was some poetic justice in that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="2210">Did he leave? </sentence><sentence id="2211">She said, well maybe he stayed here a day or two, a few days and then he left. </sentence><sentence id="2212">I said did you hear anything about him?

</sentence><sentence id="2798">No, because it happened so quickly and it came as a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="2799">Before we got scared enough, become numb. </sentence><sentence id="2800">It was all over. </sentence><sentence id="2801">I was also, a gun was pointed at me in Lublin on a railroad station by a drunk, an SS officer. </sentence><sentence id="2802">This ended up without me being shot. </sentence><sentence id="2803">But here we're traveling on this train and there's time on our hands and we were able to think. </sentence><sentence id="2804">Then it got dark and darker. </sentence><sentence id="2805">Finally the train slowed down and it was already beyond, not quite so dark that you couldn't see but it was already further along than the dust, the hour of twilight when you can still see things relatively well. </sentence><sentence id="2806">The train -- there was also another incident. </sentence><sentence id="2807">During the ride on the train, a Polish peasant stood when the train was very slowly moving after many stops that it made to give priority to other trains. </sentence><sentence id="2808">He seen our train and he crossed himself. </sentence><sentence id="2809">So I said why would he do this unless we are a cargo assigned to extermination. </sentence><sentence id="2810">I say after all, going to a labor camp still leaves -- there is room for hope.(End of Tape 11.) </sentence><sentence id="2811">The movement of the train, very slow movement, when the train is --when they are moving sections of the train on the final terminal; there's more literally, this is literally what terminal is the right word to use, the train was moving very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="2812">You have the descending darkness, you see that we are being pushed through a tall masonry wall. </sentence><sentence id="2813">It suddenly, it gave me the foreboding that we are being brought into the extermination point, because we were not given any rations for the trip; people were packed like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="2814">If you want to get work out of slaves, you have to give them living room, you have to treat them with a modicum of satisfying the basic needs of subsistence to live on. </sentence><sentence id="2815">No water, nothing given for us to urinate or to tend to all other needs that are basic needs and suddenly this descending darkness and the train slowly -- the train -- like we were going through the gates of hell. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2865">Q: That's exactly what I was imagining. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2867">A: And the train came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="2868">When the train was traveling, we couldn't hear nothing because you just hear the noise of the railroad tracks and the rails and the wind and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2869">But when the train stopped, you could hear the screams of the women and children in other boxcars where they had women and children, where they were packed very heavily. </sentence><sentence id="2870">Because the heat was unbearable and they had no room to urinate, they had no room for anything. </sentence><sentence id="2871">There was crying and lamenting and it all suggested a premonition of impending death by some means that we don't know yet; whether it will be gas chambers or they have something else in store for us. </sentence><sentence id="2872">Then on the platforms, which on the right and a platform on the left which separated us from the other section of the train, there were big floodlights and there were guards that were standing on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="2873">Were just maybe two or three guards. </sentence><sentence id="2874">All of a sudden you hear the sound of a rolling door open and a man, stripped down to his trunks, runs out of this heat. </sentence><sentence id="2875">He just runs and the Germans, the German guards, they begin to hunt him like a rabbit. </sentence><sentence id="2876">He says, Ich , [have him! </sentence><sentence id="2877">He says , halt. </sentence><sentence id="2878">This and so forth, then you hear two shots and you see this guy collapsing underneath one of those floodlights. </sentence><sentence id="2879">By that time the temperature must have dropped, this was in May, and you could see like a steam coming out from his mouth, the blood was running out of his neck. </sentence><sentence id="2880">He was laying there, a human being. </sentence><sentence id="2881">All he wanted was a little air and he was shot for that. </sentence><sentence id="2882">When I seen this, this scene itself was a - -I seen people killed before by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2883">I have seen them in the Warsaw Ghetto but I have never seen this, when you put all these elements together, under such circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="2884">Then the immediate logical conclusion is that we are not coming into any labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="2885">If you begin to add all these things and as the morning began to dawn, there was a rabbi in our boxcar. </sentence><sentence id="2886">We have a prayer that is said before death; it is called confession before death, people say it. </sentence><sentence id="2887">He began to say the confession and he had a younger brother, Hanok was his name. </sentence><sentence id="2888">That guy  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection began to cry that he is only twenty years old. </sentence><sentence id="2889">This crying and praying became very unnerving to us although a man has a right to say what he wants before he dies. </sentence><sentence id="2890">We were still not convinced that this is the end of the line. </sentence><sentence id="2891">Nevertheless somebody asked them that they should stop this sobbing business and all this, wait to see what happens in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="2892">In the morning, when they open the boxcars, there came a Jewish crew that was working and the Germans and the dogs, the whole circus. </sentence><sentence id="2893">They began to open the doors of the car and they begin to pile out the dead bodies from the boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="2894">Ours was the only boxcar that didn't have any dead bodies but from all other cars, they were putting the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2895">The Jewish crew went in and they were putting the bodies by stacking them in pyres, one on top of the other in squares. </sentence><sentence id="2896">I seen young women, young men, it was just a frightening sight when you see so much death around you. </sentence><sentence id="2897">We were bewildered -- there were two hand grenades laying on the bottom of our floor. </sentence><sentence id="2898">In other words, one of the -- some of our men had hand grenades and they were prepared to make a fight for it, if we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="2899">If we escaped and went to the woods, we would have something; I mean that was the intention. </sentence><sentence id="2900">I remember when we empty the car, the SS men take a look in the car; they seen the hand grenades and they ignored it. </sentence><sentence id="2901">This was the final indication that we are slated for death because if we are not, they would certainly not allow something like this to go unpunished. </sentence><sentence id="2902">They would want a guilty party and they would make an execution; they would try to show how they deal with something like this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2941">Q: You're all guilty already? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2943">A: It doesn't matter because we---. </sentence><sentence id="2944">Then we were put in a, those that survived the trip were put in a column five abreast. </sentence><sentence id="2945">The column was standing there and forming. </sentence><sentence id="2946">While they were forming and we seen that the crew---. </sentence><sentence id="2947">Another thing is the cleaning crew that was working there, the Jews who were part of the crew of this camp, they wouldn't speak to us. </sentence><sentence id="2948">If we ask them, where are we? </sentence><sentence id="2949">What is awaiting us? </sentence><sentence id="2950">They didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2951">So you got the impression like you were on an operating table; you are in a hospital and you see the nurses in white aprons looking at you as though you were dead already. </sentence><sentence id="2952">We didn't know that they were not allowed to speak to us, we didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="2953">Then the column began to form and there were about a dozen of SS men on each side of the column, guards with rifles. </sentence><sentence id="2954">They were going to escort us wherever we were going to go. </sentence><sentence id="2955">We begin the procession, slowly. </sentence><sentence id="2956">When I was walking, I was bewildered, what was happening there? </sentence><sentence id="2957">My thoughts were very incoherent, in a situation like this. </sentence><sentence id="2958">The SS man that was on my left, that was next to me, I record this in the book, he said to me, Veir albist du?, </sentence><sentence id="2959">how old are you? </sentence><sentence id="2960">I said, Ich bin I told him I was 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2961">He answered me I , "m nineteen.. He says , it's a pity that you have to die. </sentence><sentence id="2962">He said it to me, he meant it; he had no---. </sentence><sentence id="2963">That was -- this is the way he felt apparently. </sentence><sentence id="2964">We were eventually separated from those that went to the gas chambers; but this moment, these moments in my life, including this question and answer and the pile-up of bodies in the morning and a beautiful morning to be surrounded by death, this arrival; this is probably the worst that I had to face. </sentence><sentence id="2965">Because after that I became already immune to these -- not immune but I began to realize that sooner or later they're going to get us. </sentence><sentence id="2966">That there's a very slim chance of survival. </sentence><sentence id="2967">So I was not going to get again -- I would not panic anymore in a situation that was awaiting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2993">Q: You think the worst and then you survive, then it's almost a bonus? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2995">A: Well, for some people who survived that particular moment was not the best thing because they perished later and they just suffered more. </sentence><sentence id="2996">But this was such a terrifying thing, this whole thing, the arrival, the descending darkness, the crying of the women, the pitiful crying of the children, and then the killing of that man who just run for a breath of fresh air, the prayers of the rabbi who survived, he lives in Pittsburgh. </sentence><sentence id="2997">I met him in Israel one time unexpectedly, and his brother survived. </sentence><sentence id="2998">All these things are just terrifying more than anything else that I have experienced before or since. </sentence><sentence id="2999">Although I had many close calls after, I was with a flogged person; it didn't affect me as badly as this. </sentence><sentence id="3000">I'm not going to tell you how we got out of this situation because then nobody's going to buy my book. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3030">Q: I don't think it would have been at this point in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3031">It would have been somewhere else, like a work area at the labor section. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3034">A: Could be because we were not, unbeknown to us, we were not in the camp proper. </sentence><sentence id="3035">We were in the entrance camp and the reason they had the guards because they had to march us yet through a street which I think is called Helmska B because it leads to hell. </sentence><sentence id="3036">That would take us to Majdanek and to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="3037">This was our fate. </sentence><sentence id="3038">I studied the records of it from a book that was written of Majdanek, by a Polish writer. </sentence><sentence id="3039">It's not translated into English yet. </sentence><sentence id="3040">I bought it in Poland when I was there. </sentence><sentence id="3041">It said in that period of time, there were no registrations, everybody was going -- especially from the Warsaw Ghetto -- everybody was going straight into the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="3042">Actually I was twice in Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="3043">At this time when we were sent to Budzyn and when we were shipped to Budzyn en route to Plaszow, we detoured in Majdanek so I was their guest again. </sentence><sentence id="3044">I omitted telling you -- it occurred to me that I omitted telling you -- something about my uncle Meynek. </sentence><sentence id="3045">As you know, we came to Budzyn from this transport in second week of May. </sentence><sentence id="3046">That would put it about May 13 or thereabout. </sentence><sentence id="3047">When we arrived there, we found out that there was already one group of Warsaw survivors, Warsaw Ghetto uprising survivors who arrived there a week earlier. </sentence><sentence id="3048">One of the survivors, I believe his name was Kaufmann, a young fellow my age, recognized me and he said I got something to tell you about your Uncle Meynek. </sentence><sentence id="3049">He was in our transport with his wife, that would be Irka on the umschlagplatz after the crushing of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, they were herded on the umschlagplatz into boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="3050">While he was in the boxcar with his wife, he was trying to bribe a Ukrainian guard, either to let him go which seems very unlikely; it seemed very unlikely that he would have asked him for it. </sentence><sentence id="3051">Or he might have asked him for water because they were selling water for something like 500 zlotys a glass if they got the money. </sentence><sentence id="3052">However, the Ukrainian guard after taking the money, shot my uncle and his wife, Irka, pulled off his riding boots from  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection his legs, feet, and this is how my uncle came to an end. </sentence><sentence id="3053">I believe he was born 1907, he would have -- this was in May of 1943, he would have been 36 years old. </sentence><sentence id="3054">This is the story of our family. </sentence><sentence id="3055">We had very few survivors. </sentence><sentence id="3056">That would be my Uncle Ben survived, my Aunt Rose survived because she was on Aryan papers and she was able to hide her identity and the only other survivor was myself and my grandmother who left Poland on the last ship that reached the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3057">My father died in Majdanek, now we know, my mother and my youngest brother, Meir at Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="3058">Szymon still remains as enigma, as to what happened to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3088">A: Yes, it's hard to imagine that this late, we would not have been able to establish contact. </sentence><sentence id="3089">Since even if he lived in Spain, he would know that most survivors went either to Israel or the United States or Canada and he would have tried to exhaust these things. </sentence><sentence id="3090">There were no enquiries for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
