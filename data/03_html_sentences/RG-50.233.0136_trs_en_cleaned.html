<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: So it was more religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: It was mainly Zionist oriented and graduate students went to Palestine after finishing this school. </sentence><sentence id="4">In fact, there was a reunion of survivors of that school in Israel in 1966, 1967 I think and I happened to be there for the Bar Mitzvah of my second son, Matthew and we found out that there were about half a dozen survivors, all of them living in Israel except me, so they made it. </sentence><sentence id="5">They joked around and they said " Topas remained the only Zionist among us". </sentence><sentence id="6">Because I was living in America and they were there and they served in the Israeli army, one of them achieved a very high rank in the army. </sentence><sentence id="7">And only one of the fellows that graduated the farming school remained a farmer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Did you dream of going to Palestine during that year you were at the school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="16">I had my sites set for Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="17">It was something very attractive to us, to be in a land that historically we take our roots from and for a couple of millennium there was a continuous history of the Jewish people and since we are persona non grata in Poland, in most of the countries of the world in general, then Palestine loomed very largely in our consideration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: Were there any other reasons why you ended up going to this particular school, do you recall what it was like to be Jewish and to go to public schools for higher education at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: I have never been exposed to, I have been only once in public school for a very brief period, one year that my mother sent me to public school. </sentence><sentence id="24">I don't remember the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="25">But other than that, I was always going, for instance, the primary school that I went to, the prep school so to speak was a Hebrew academy, one of the most modern of it's kind and had a religious orientation. </sentence><sentence id="26">Modern. </sentence><sentence id="27">Then I went to gymnasium henu which the Hebrew word denotes upbringing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="28">Then I went to this Tarbot School and I think the reason they sent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: How would you describe the religious life with your family when you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself. </sentence><sentence id="38">To that extent that my grandparents were assimilated on my father's side, not my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="39">But since the grandparents on my mother's side lived in a distance away from us in Forst we didn't have much contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="40">But in Warsaw, we virtually lived with our grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="41">We were living in the same apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="42">My grandparents were assimilated; they did not observe the Jewish holidays according to the law, meaning our stores were open on Saturday; although holidays like Passover and others were observed, they were observed to the extent they didn't interfere with business. </sentence><sentence id="43">And my father was a very strong opponent of assimilation himself and he sort of fashioned himself or fancied himself as a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="44">So in 1920 during the Bolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at the age of 16, probably not telling exactly the truth about his age. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was so bent to have a part of it you know in defense of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="46">But as he matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit of difference to the anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="47">All the Jews are the same. </sentence><sentence id="48">So he was a thinking individual. </sentence><sentence id="49">One of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me was going to courts and listening to trials because he liked the idea of logic expressed and the questions of law, questions of morality, questions of right and wrong, very interested, good and evil. </sentence><sentence id="50">So eventually, eventually, he became aware that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a means of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="51">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="52"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection acceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure and he felt it was a bankrupt. </sentence><sentence id="53">Although many people at the time majority disagreed with him and he was a maverick in his belief. </sentence><sentence id="54">So at time already when I had reached the age of 7, he became religious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: So by the time you were seven he had concluded that assimilation was </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: He might have concluded earlier but this was when he had made the move. </sentence><sentence id="77">And our house became kosher and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="78">Because in my childhood we had a Christmas tree and we were well-to-do so it was fashionable at that time to hire German governesses because they were so clean and disciplined and so forth and I remember kneeling and clasping my hands to say a prayer in German. </sentence><sentence id="79">This was in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="80">But this radically has changed. </sentence><sentence id="81">For my father became religious and began to realize that the values that are contained in our tradition now, Torah and our bible, are the values that are endurable, they are tested and that society, it is to benefit not only to the Jews but to mankind to live by a law when morality is supreme, not other things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did you notice this when you were seven? </sentence><sentence id="89">This must have come as a major change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: It was a major change. </sentence><sentence id="93">In fact, I remember exactly the time when my father made me aware that Iam a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="94">Because I was sheltered you know in my life in Warsaw and in schools and I was not exposed to the, I never found myself in a situation where I was exposed to anti- Semitism nor did I understand what it really meant. </sentence><sentence id="95">We lived in Poland so I was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="96">That's the way I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="97">But one time when we were in our country in the summer, I might have been then seven, that I recall that towards evening my father called me to the bedroom and he told me to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="98">I want to talk to you and he told me very briefly that we are Jewish and that we were enslaved in Egypt because this is the core of our belief and of the historical, factual tenets of our belief and that we were taken out of Egypt to become a free people., </sentence><sentence id="99">to become a people to be a light to the nations. </sentence><sentence id="100">He said a few things that were just beyond me perhaps but then I came to learn this and I was taken out of the school I was going to and I was sent to a more religious oriented school. </sentence><sentence id="101">And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we were alienated from our larger family circle because of my father's change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Your youngest brother then, he would have grown up from day one in a very religious household. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: You are very observant. </sentence><sentence id="115">That is exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="116">When I gave you the names, | told you that my name was Yusick because I was born in the era when my father was in the mood of giving Polish names and my brother's name was given originally in Stanislav although his Hebrew name that was given at his circumcision was Szymon just as mine was Benjamin Josef for Joseph Benjamin. </sentence><sentence id="117">But when my third brother was born, it was already in the era when my father's orientation was completely changed, the name that was given to him was Meir, after my grandfather's father. </sentence><sentence id="118">He was brought in completely different atmosphere from birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Would you describe your father as a strict father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: I think that I would have to say yes, as a strict father. </sentence><sentence id="127">Although he could have been quite relaxed, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he was strict. </sentence><sentence id="128">He believed that the key word we have to focus our attention is righteousness. </sentence><sentence id="129">To him, this is all and all -- to be right, to be moral, to be truthful. </sentence><sentence id="130">He felt that our civilization as we know it stands or falls with our ability to comprehend that. </sentence><sentence id="131">That this is significant. </sentence><sentence id="132">Of course, today, this is all turned upside down by This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="133">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="134"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the new social science engineering which says everything goes and everybody can have his own style and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: How would you describe your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: My mother came from a religious home but she was somewhat of a rebel. </sentence><sentence id="148">Perhaps not consciously so but it was simply a question of economics. </sentence><sentence id="149">She was born as one of four sisters to a family where the head of the household, meaning her father, my grandfather, Hersh Aram, was a hat maker. </sentence><sentence id="150">And he was a working person and he was also Talmudist, studist. </sentence><sentence id="151">When he was not working he was spending his time in a house of study, in a religious house of study. </sentence><sentence id="152">Now, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, she didn't see future in following this tradition. </sentence><sentence id="153">Because they didn't have big dowries. </sentence><sentence id="154">At that time, dowries had to be given with daughters to anybody who was worth his weight in salt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: And you had a grandfather with four daughters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in lineage. </sentence><sentence id="166">Three of the four daughters went into the professions because they have seen they have to establish some economic independence. </sentence><sentence id="167">There was just no future for them in the town. </sentence><sentence id="168">Excuse me, in the town. </sentence><sentence id="169">It is still a town. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is now even more significant. </sentence><sentence id="171">I guess Poland calls it the capital of petro chemicals in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="172">And I revisited the town when I was there in 1989 and I found the apartment where my grandparents lived and possibly where they brought up these four daughters. </sentence><sentence id="173">Now, this, in the United States would be way below poverty level because the whole apartment consisted of one room and a kitchen and six people lived there. </sentence><sentence id="174">It is just hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="175">And I remember visiting there on Passover and my father would take us there and they were always immaculately clean. </sentence><sentence id="176">Everything was so perfect -- they didn't have running water. </sentence><sentence id="177">They didn't have a bathroom, no plumbing there. </sentence><sentence id="178">It was just a bewilderment when we first came to visit. </sentence><sentence id="179">My father already became religious at that time because before, we didn't go there. </sentence><sentence id="180">And it was contrast of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitan Warsaw with floors that were polished to a mirror shine with two maids in my grandma's home and plumbing and a bidet in the bathroom and all the conveniences and amenities of modern living. </sentence><sentence id="181">Whereas in Proust, it was backwards, only by contrast and they had to live there very frugally. </sentence><sentence id="182">So my mother must have realized early in her life that her future lie with her ability to support herself and to make something of herself, other than just being a woman and going through the biological process. </sentence><sentence id="183">Her older sister Franya, you" ll find out in my book, they're in furniture, you" ll find out that she had two boys and she was married to a painting contractor but she herself was a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="184">My mother was going for law but she married a wealthy husband, a well- to-do husband, a merchant, a businessman and Idacha the younger sister became a CPA, you know a public accountant. </sentence><sentence id="185">I don't know if she was certified, if such a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: A notary? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: She was definitely a notary and she was also a bookkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="210">And the youngest one was with the family. </sentence><sentence id="211">I don't think she went in to a profession; she remained at home and never married. </sentence><sentence id="212">They all perished in the Holocaust, except my grandfather who died a few years before the war. </sentence><sentence id="213">The youngest daughter's name was Razel. </sentence><sentence id="214">So this was the background. </sentence><sentence id="215">When my mother came to Warsaw, she in the university in the school of law. </sentence><sentence id="216">In other words, you must  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection application here the document that I obtained from the archives, she says on her basis of her entry examination she was admitted to the state's gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="217">She covered a course of 8+ course in 7 or 8 years, perhaps in 7 years. </sentence><sentence id="218">And then she was admitted to University of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="219">Before, they had this clause about bench clause and father restrictions but there were still restrictions about how many Jews could be admitted. </sentence><sentence id="220">And she had two handicaps -- being Jewish and being a woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: And being from a small town, by Warsaw standards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: By Warsaw standards. </sentence><sentence id="237">So in order to support herself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the Topas boys. </sentence><sentence id="238">So she was a tutor to my father and his brother Itzak and his youngest brother which was my uncle Ben. </sentence><sentence id="239">And this is how people fell in love with the tutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Not everyone has such a beautiful tutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="246"> A; Well, the results were predictable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Your father was smitten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: He must have been. </sentence><sentence id="251">And he married very young. </sentence><sentence id="252">My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19 when they married. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: Did your grandparents have any say in this matter? </sentence><sentence id="257">It must have not been the planned marriage of their dreams. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Indeed, it was not. </sentence><sentence id="261">As I understand it in retrospect, they were very much opposed to it, because in Europe it was not like in the United States where you have misalliances between rich and poor and between professional and non-professional. </sentence><sentence id="262">There was a class-consciousness, even among Jews so that it was unlikely that a person from a well-to-do family would marry someone from a very poor family by contrast. </sentence><sentence id="263">And my grandparents were opposing too on the ground that the fact that they wanted someone from a more prestigious family than some obscure town in Poland and they didn't like the idea that my mother was older than he. </sentence><sentence id="264">Four years older. </sentence><sentence id="265">They didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="266">But apparently they were overruled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: By your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Probably by my father. </sentence><sentence id="277">He wanted to have his way. </sentence><sentence id="278">My mother was never very happy living in such close proximity to my father's family because she realized the objection and she realized she was married over these objections. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Interesting. </sentence><sentence id="283">How about your father's brothers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: My father's brothers were not affected by this religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which was the second in line was a very handsome bachelor as you can see from the existing photographs, who was a bachelor for a long time and didn't get married until probably maybe a year or two before the outbreak of WWII and his position in the company was that he had the job of administrator of the properties that my grandparents possessed, owned, and he was also the head bookkeeper in the company that fabricated shoes, Topaz Shoe Company. </sentence><sentence id="287">But I have very fond memories of my uncle the bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="288">Bachelors have money. </sentence><sentence id="289">Married people have This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="290">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="291"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection responsibilities and bills. </sentence><sentence id="292">And he lived with the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="293">So my brother Szymon and I and my cousin Lela, which was the daughter of my father's sister Bella Necovyak who lived with them there, we would come on Sunday morning when my dear uncle Neteck was still sleeping in his room from the Saturday night outing trying to recover, we would be waiting for him to wake up sort of helping the process and then we would mooch from him movie money for the matinee to go and see the movie. </sentence><sentence id="294">And we would scan the daily paper to tell him what are the choices and he would open one eye and say are you here already. </sentence><sentence id="295">And he knew to buy his peace he had top give us some movie money and then we would ask him for transportation for the streetcars. </sentence><sentence id="296">Sometimes he would say, "It's such a beautiful day, why don't you go to the park?" " </sentence><sentence id="297">Why do you always have to go to the movie?" </sentence><sentence id="298">That is one of my fond memories that he was very generous that way. </sentence><sentence id="299">I also remember that he bought me my first two -wheeler. </sentence><sentence id="300">My parents probably couldn't afford it, even though they were well off but they had expenses. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Your uncle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Neteck? </sentence><sentence id="333">I don't think that he distinguished himself particularly. </sentence><sentence id="334">He graduated high school. </sentence><sentence id="335">He might have taken a course in bookkeeping and administration, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="336">But the one who distinguished himself scholastically was the youngest son, Benack. </sentence><sentence id="337">He was distinguished in many sports too, that's why we remember him. </sentence><sentence id="338">The newspaper clippings would tell us about his prowess as a soccer player on a team called Hapoyal which was one of the first line teams in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="339">It was a Jewish team. </sentence><sentence id="340">Hapoyal means the worker. </sentence><sentence id="341">That didn't sit well with my grandparents who first of all were opposed to any socialist ideas and my grandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to be engaged in sports of any kind and incur an injury or something like this and I understand he incurred an injury and he had blood infection. </sentence><sentence id="342">But I remember that when he graduated high school and I was still then very young, he didn't want to go or perhaps he couldn't get admission although he was a very good student, to the University of Warsaw and he wanted to go for chemical engineering. </sentence><sentence id="343">So he went to the Polytechnic in Prague in Czechoslovakia, and became an excellent chemist in his field. </sentence><sentence id="344">He survived the war and when he came to America he couldn't get any employment. </sentence><sentence id="345">But eventually he got a job with Dutch copper and later on with Merck Pharmaceuticals when he distinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became a director of research and went to Marshall Rectify in Los Angeles and he told me one time that the rectifier that weighs about a ton made by General Electric was made by him that weighs as much as a book of matches. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="475">But I think the founders of the whole Topas Enterprises were actually my grandfather, Jacob Topas and my grandmother Etta Sara Topas. </sentence><sentence id="476">It's hard for me to determine after such a long time something that I was not private to, just exactly who had greater share in the dynamics of the expansion of this. </sentence><sentence id="477">But it started from a very modest beginning. </sentence><sentence id="478">Because after marriage, my grandmother tried to develop the talent that my grandfather possessed. </sentence><sentence id="479">He was a person who modeled ladies" shoes. </sentence><sentence id="480">He had a flair for this so she exploited him to the extent that she wanted to set up a store that would manufacture handmade, custom-made shoes that would have his imprint on it, his model. </sentence><sentence id="481">I think this is the way it originated. </sentence><sentence id="482">First, I think that they had a place on Pyskas Street but by the time I was born they already had a flourishing store in Warsaw, in the same building where we had also an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="483">Later on they opened two more stores in Warsaw, one on Noves and one on Mar which was the main  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection five zloty to a dollar. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="494">Q: Was there any chance that perhaps one of the stores was liquidated in order to help to pay this off? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: This is quite conceivable. </sentence><sentence id="497">It might have been because I know that some real estate was sold in order to meet that --- those demands. </sentence><sentence id="498">Because my grandparents owned land in the country where we had our villa. ( </sentence><sentence id="499">End of Side A, Tape 1) I was mentioning the properties which my grandparents owned. </sentence><sentence id="500">They also, as I understand, had a building in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="501">This dates to the time that Poland was occupied; the occupation of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="502">They also had an apartment house in Danzig. </sentence><sentence id="503">But by the time I was born, all these properties were liquidated or sold, possibly to meet the demands of the Polish government. </sentence><sentence id="504">You know, the assessment as to how much of the debt is taxable to us. </sentence><sentence id="505">Poland had a peculiar labor law. </sentence><sentence id="506">It permitted occupation strike which meant -- in actual experience this is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="507">Our shoes were hand made. </sentence><sentence id="508">Most of the shoemakers which were employees were kind of the cottage-industry type meaning one who was the master craftsman employed journeymen and helpers, apprentices in his own household. </sentence><sentence id="509">He would come to our office and get the materials and the models and so forth and he would bring the ready-made products and was paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="510">He was paid in advance and he was paid when he finished it. </sentence><sentence id="511">If there were some corrections to be made, he would have to do that too. </sentence><sentence id="512">So they were individual shoemakers, perhaps a hundred or so that were making the shoes for our company. </sentence><sentence id="513">Now they became members of a union. </sentence><sentence id="514">| remember distinctly that a few years before the war, there was a strike but they called it in Poland an occupation strike, which meant that they were permitted to come into the stores and occupy the seats that normally are reserved for the customers. </sentence><sentence id="515">Bur the strike provided that they had to leave enough seats so that business can continue. </sentence><sentence id="516">Because I cannot conceive of a customer feeling comfortable in a store where there is a hostile strike. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: A labor conflict? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: Conflict, right. </sentence><sentence id="542">So I recall that strike and I remember an incident there that was largely discussed and talked about later. </sentence><sentence id="543">That one of the strikers, a heavy big guy, not only did he sit on the chairs but he stretched himself across several chairs to occupy. </sentence><sentence id="544">My father took him and forcibly threw him out the store. </sentence><sentence id="545">But the thing that struck me later is that I don't recall that any of the non-Jewish firms were ever affected by such a strike. </sentence><sentence id="546">This strike was eventually resolved and everything then returned to normal, but it was one of those things that the Jews were not the first-class citizens in Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="553">Q: Even if they were well off? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="555">A: Even if they were well off, I would imagine. </sentence><sentence id="556">Because a Jew always has to prove himself as a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="557">For instance, when the threat of war loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to show their loyalty, especially against Germany so there is in a book called Image Before My Eyes by Lucien Dobritsky, there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to the Polish air force as a show of patriotism. </sentence><sentence id="558">But it didn't help. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: As if anyone could have suspected or expected Jews to be in favor of Germany in such a war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: Were Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="577">But this was most of -- the Jews disturbed them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="580">Q: So the Jewish problem was the greater one than the German problem? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="582">A: Because they made it so. </sentence><sentence id="583">This was what was debated. </sentence><sentence id="584">When a Jewish member of their parliament, their Same as they called it, came out and he said that we should confront; we should unite and should confront a common enemy; so the response was that these are two separate questions. </sentence><sentence id="585">That the Jewish question and the German question have nothing to do with the Jewish problem. </sentence><sentence id="586">That's the way -- that was the answer </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="592">Q: The workers, the people who made the shoes, were they non-Jewish or Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: Non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="595">In that -- shoemakers were all non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="596">Now there are people which are doing the tops and they were mostly Jewish because this is something that trade that falls within the sphere of Jewish interest for some reason or another. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: The customers would be of all faiths? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="602">A: Yes, very heavily Christian. </sentence><sentence id="603">Because the product was known and you still can find people today that are of my age who live in Warsaw; they all remember the shoe store in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="604">Because it was a known firm, it was a known name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Now, 1938, which was the last year you were in Warsaw before the war; that was also the year when the Germans were expelling Polish Jews back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="609">Do you have any recollection of any of that? </sentence><sentence id="610">Did you witness any? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="614">A: Yes, we seen people with bundles that were sometimes seen on the street. </sentence><sentence id="615">My father would point out to me and say these are refugees from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="616">Also we seen photographs in the newspaper, pictures in the newspaper of the rioting. </sentence><sentence id="617">The stories that were behind them; where they were stripped of German citizenship and the Polish government declared quickly that they stripped them also of the Polish citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="618">So they were people without citizenship; it was very sad; it was a foretaste of things to come to an unimaginable proportion and degree. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="624">Q: Earlier we were talking about patriotism, the Polish patriotism of your father. </sentence><sentence id="625">I recall when we were looking at the photographs, that you mentioned other family members who were involved in various patriotic efforts; either when Poland was just becoming independent. </sentence><sentence id="626">I'm referring to the war against the Soviet Union in 1920. </sentence><sentence id="627">Then I remember too, there is someone who is in the Russian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="632">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="633">Poland, as you know, was occupied and didn't regain its independence until 1918 and prior to this, it was partitioned and occupied by three major powers which was Germany, Austrian-Hungarian empire and Russia. </sentence><sentence id="634">Warsaw was mainly under the Russian influence and Russian zone, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="635">The Russian government tried to -- they had a very strong intensive program of reciprocation, so the language in high schools was Russian and Russian was the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="636">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="637"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection language that you had to do business in Poland, in official Poland. </sentence><sentence id="638">Also when people were drafted into the army, they went to the Imperial Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="639">Now my grandfather, probably still a bachelor, was drafted into the Czar's army and was sent to Manchuria during the Russo- Japanese war. </sentence><sentence id="640">I remember him telling me stories of how cheap life was, of how many times they executed Chinese. </sentence><sentence id="641">The Russians were executing Chinese and they were frightened of the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="642">The Russians might have cast the fear among the Chinese; they didn't do so well with the Japanese because we know that the outcome of the war was not favorable to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="643">But he served with them. </sentence><sentence id="644">I don't know, I couldn't tell you just how long. </sentence><sentence id="645">I know he was with his friend who became his brother-in-law later because they married two sisters when they came back from the war, back to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="646">My future grandfather, Jacob Topas married my grandmother Esther Topas. </sentence><sentence id="647">So this was one experience of the military. </sentence><sentence id="648">I don't think my grandfather volunteered but my father did volunteer to the militia as I mentioned before, during the Bolshevik invasion and was very patriotic that way. </sentence><sentence id="649">In fact my father served in the Polish army later on already because there was a conscription, also Metek served in the Polish army for a short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="650">My father was a non-commissioned officer in the Polish army and after serving it, probably at a time when I was born, he also had to go periodically. </sentence><sentence id="651">He was recalled for maneuvers and for a few weeks of what they called exercises, military exercises. </sentence><sentence id="652">My father believed that we, the Jewish people, should be loyal regardless of anti-Semitism regardless of the inequities that existed in the social sphere of life, the economic discrimination --that we still owe allegiance to the country that we live in. </sentence><sentence id="653">In that respect, there was no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="654">He was also a realist and he knew that we have to get out of Poland because we are an endangered species there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="680">Q: My recollection is that even your mother was involved -- in describing her experiences at the University of Warsaw and then the tutoring work that she did. </sentence><sentence id="681">There was a document that you showed me earlier ---. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="685">That document showed that after graduating high school in 1918, 1919, she, during vacation time, did volunteer work in what they called Polish soldier home, which is apparently, I would imagine it's a convalescent home for soldiers that were injured in that 1919-1920 war. </sentence><sentence id="686">So she was briefly employed there or volunteered her services. </sentence><sentence id="687">She introduced that certificate and other certificates similar where she worked as a teacher in a school sort of to support her application for law school in the Warsaw University. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: This was in 1920 when she was helping, helping to care for the Polish soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: Which would have been the middle of that war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="700">Q: Yet, one of your family members was considered not to be a citizen of Poland? </sentence><sentence id="701">Or not a citizen of Poland early enough? </sentence><sentence id="702">I remember when you were talking about your store and --. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="723">Q: Were you surprised by the outbreak of war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="725">A: Yes, I was surprised by the reality of it not about what you read in the papers. </sentence><sentence id="726">Because the movies and the papers, they create a different image and illusion of what things really are until you are really directly affected by them. </sentence><sentence id="727">The outbreak of the war was excitement and sort of loss of interest for school subjects. </sentence><sentence id="728">The school authorities suspended classes and they had dismissed all the students to go to their respective hometowns except for the contingent from Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="729">Because they said Warsaw is under bombardment and for our own safety, we will remain in school. </sentence><sentence id="730">Because our school, I think the war broke out on Friday morning, I think on Sunday our buildings were already occupied by the Polish army because they were quartered there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: In what other ways does the war affect you? </sentence><sentence id="738">School is closed, Polish army takes over the school, your home is besieged by German forces --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="741">A: Not yet, at the very beginning, but it was under heavy pressure and bombardment because Warsaw -- there was a mass bombing raid on Warsaw before the war was declared. </sentence><sentence id="742">This was done on September 1*" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: And those continued, the bombing attacks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="748">Sometimes I think, I don't know if the war was declared, maybe at night or at 10 a.m. but it was already much later, hours already into the race where most of the Polish air force already was wiped out on the airfields before they got up in the air. </sentence><sentence id="749">So they definitely were taken by surprise -- those that shouldn't have been taken by surprise. </sentence><sentence id="750">We heard on the radio Friday morning at breakfast time, we heard about the attack on Warsaw and about the war. </sentence><sentence id="751">Of course, there were mixed emotions. </sentence><sentence id="752">There was a lot of excitement but there was also great concern. </sentence><sentence id="753">What does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="754">What does it portend? </sentence><sentence id="755">But the authorities were very reassuring. </sentence><sentence id="756">They said the war will soon be over and everybody will go home. </sentence><sentence id="757">I don't know whether by this they meant that Poland will win the war or there would be an armistice and the newscasters were very bombastic and enthusiastic in their reports. </sentence><sentence id="758">Of course, we didn't know, we didn't have the idea, the ability to be critical. </sentence><sentence id="759">We had no critical ability to be able to sort of digest the essence and what truth is in it. </sentence><sentence id="760">You would hear -- a broadcaster would say like this : The Polish cavalry is fighting in East Prussia like wild lions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: You had never seen a wild lion before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="777">A: But that was a kind of metaphor meaning that they are fierce fighters and also that they are -- the Polish army is advancing on Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="778">I mean this was like on the first or second day of the war. </sentence><sentence id="779">When England and France joined the war on the third day and we could hear the English national anthem and the Marseilles played over the radio, there was literally -- the newspapers were hysterical. </sentence><sentence id="780">They felt that the war is going to be finished in a matter of -- in a short time. </sentence><sentence id="781">Nobody really predicted any specific time but the feeling was that it was just a question of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="804">Q: What about the Russian invasion? </sentence><sentence id="805">Did that come as a surprise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="808">A: It was anti-climatic but it came also as a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="809">Perhaps to many people it was a welcome surprise because out of the two evils, many people thought that if they went to the Russian zone -- in the beginning it was very easy when they divide because the border was not firm -- there was an influx of people both ways and they were not yet -- they didn't have yet a strict instruction, how to handle the border movement across the border. </sentence><sentence id="810">So that anybody that thought, believed that he was better off being on the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of people made that choice and then they went. </sentence><sentence id="811">They made a wise choice because they had a greater chance of survival in Russia even those who were sent to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="812">They were displaced, they still had a better chance of survival because there was no deliberate effort by Stalin to destroy the people, no matter what nationality. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: Yes, I think within a day or two we already knew what Treblinka meant. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Many people didn't want to believe it, we believed it. </sentence><sentence id="1138">In these circumstances-- by that time my brother and I were already in a Luftwaffe camp, my brother Szymon. </sentence><sentence id="1139">In other words, he -- we both report as volunteers to go to Luftwaffe camp yet before this action was launched. </sentence><sentence id="1140">This was kind if a transition from the agricultural work into the Luftwaffe camp and this was a forced labor column. </sentence><sentence id="1141">We were not quartered there; we were still living with our family and were just coming to a point at the Warsaw Ghetto gate where two Luftwaffe guards would take us to our job. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Sometimes they used streetcars for part of the trip. </sentence><sentence id="1143">There was a place called Bilanie; there was a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment, paints, and maintenance things for aircraft when we were supposed to work. </sentence><sentence id="1144">But initially they got us cleaning bricks in bombed-out houses. </sentence><sentence id="1145">I don't know why but I said to myself, we are back in the brickfields, we are back in the brickfields. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Symbolically we were reduced to the status of our ancestors in Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="1147">But this still was, comparatively, benign to what was in store for us in this forced labor column. </sentence><sentence id="1148">When the action was launched, as I mentioned before, on the second and third day, there were no volunteers to go to the umschlagplatz. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So the Germans began isolating and putting a dragnet on certain sections of -- block by block of the city and emptied the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1150">They also would come in, when the Germans came to conduct this with their trucks and wagons, sometimes, they usually marched people, those that could march. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Those who were already immobile, they were handicapped or they were so starved that they couldn't walk, they threw them in the wagons and they took them that way. </sentence><sentence id="1152">They could come in and announce that they would respect all the passes because the people were working for German industry; they were working maybe for the ghetto government, like the Judenrat; they were working for the city ornundines which was the police; maybe they were working for the hospital; they would be all exempt. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So they were ---. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1174">A: They had an assorted degree of authority that in the beginning, they respected them all. </sentence><sentence id="1175">As the time went on, they were less and less respected. </sentence><sentence id="1176">I didn't have any pass so that if I was caught, I probably would have been shipped out to Treblinka too because we were simply assembling every morning before the action started, however, early in the morning to go out and were brought at the end of the day, to the point, to the gate and then we were on our own to get home.. But after this action went into effect and was already in effect for a week or two, once we came to work, the captain said when you come tomorrow to work, bring your things with you because you're going to be here, interned for your own protection. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Then he looked at the faces; he passed all of us in review. </sentence><sentence id="1178">The whole group of about two hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="1179">He looked at my brother and he said he cannot come tomorrow, he's too young. </sentence><sentence id="1180">He also, maybe, exempted another kid and that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="1181">When we came home, the ghetto was in such a state of terror besides this, that the German SS men were riding in rickshaws. </sentence><sentence id="1182">You know what the rickshaws were? </sentence><sentence id="1183">They were those bicycle-pedaled three-wheelers where the passengers are sitting in the front and the bicycle-peddler in the back. </sentence><sentence id="1184">They would ride in the bicycle-pedaled This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1185">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1186"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection rickshaw and they would be firing at the windows at the people and the crowds wherever they see them.. So we were literally dodging bullets when we were coming back from our work. </sentence><sentence id="1187">Of course, after that incident, after we were told that we're going to be interned there, I realized that I'm going to have to part from my family. </sentence><sentence id="1188">The morning after this, when I got up in the morning, my father was still praying. </sentence><sentence id="1189">I said goodbye to my mother and she was packing some of my things that I was going to take with me. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I said goodbye to my sweet brother Meir, my youngest brother, Meir, and to Szymon. </sentence><sentence id="1191">Then my father gave me a blessing; it was the first time I'd seen him cry in my life because he was a very steady influence. </sentence><sentence id="1192">He was a very self- possessed individual and confident that somehow we're going to get through this whole ordeal and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I don't know what was going on in his mind but if I did not realize it, he must have realized that we are parting for good. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="1233">I also had faith that evil cannot vanquish good. </sentence><sentence id="1234">So in the long run, I don't think that there was any doubt even by those who perished that Germany will be defeated and that they're going to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="1235">The question is when. </sentence><sentence id="1236">But there was no doubt that Hitler will lose that war and that the Allies will prevail and win. </sentence><sentence id="1237">But meanwhile, we were in their grasp so such optimism has a limited value and effect on your well-being. </sentence><sentence id="1238">Of course when I took my last glance at my father, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I haven't seen him again nor my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I went to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1241">We learned that in October, Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgment, was the last day of the shipments to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="1242">In fact, the Jewish police had the honor of being put in the last transport to Treblinka because they were promised that if they cooperate in the round-up of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, that they and their families would be spared. </sentence><sentence id="1243">So they and their families on the Judgment Day were spared until that point but then they were also shipped. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I guess there was some poetic justice in that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
