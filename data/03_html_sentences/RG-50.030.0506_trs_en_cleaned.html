<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: And you know, some of them had children, and I suspect that there were, you know, close family friends. </sentence><sentence id="150">So I do remember that one night when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the night on the floor of a barn, lying on the floor, somehow feeling that that was safer than staying in our homes. </sentence><sentence id="151">That there was the noise of artillery in the background. </sentence><sentence id="152">And I am told a story about myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me, but it doesn't, that apparently in the middle of the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and just relieved myself to the expense of a sleeping neighbor. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: That it would be a small east European village with largely unpaved streets, and probably chickens running around the place, and most of the men being bearded, and Yiddish being spoken -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: -- much more so than Polish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
