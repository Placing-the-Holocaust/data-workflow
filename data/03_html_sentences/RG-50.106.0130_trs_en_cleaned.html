<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: What was the test? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Oh well, I -- the test was extremely complicated. </sentence><sentence id="68">This mi -- Minister Meyer called up a colleague of his and asked me to -- asked him to give me a test. </sentence><sentence id="69">When I came to his office the test consisted of -- he asked me to translate the "Financial Times" from English to Czech. </sentence><sentence id="70">Course, I didn't understand a word of the "Financial Times" in English, let alone in Czech. </sentence><sentence id="71">So I sat at the typewriter with the "Financial Times" staring me in the face -- mind you, I was very young, of course, I didn't understand English very well, and of course eco-economics was beyond me. </sentence><sentence id="72">And I was terribly embarrassed and I didn't know what to do and I decided the best thing to do is to just get up and go home, which I did, and I left. </sentence><sentence id="73">At that time we -- my sister and I lived at the YWCA. </sentence><sentence id="74">And when I came home in the evening there was a message from Minister Meyer saying come back for another test. </sentence><sentence id="75">So I was really, really surprised. </sentence><sentence id="76">Obviously he was very a-a-anxious to help me to get into the government and he wanted me to have a job. </sentence><sentence id="77">So I came back for another test and this time he gave me a sheet of type -- typed material to copy type, which was, of course, very easy to do. </sentence><sentence id="78">And that was my second test and that's how I succeeded in getting into the government. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: When you worked for the government in exile, what were your duties and responsibilities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Well obviously I came in at very low levels, but I was a bilingual secretary. </sentence><sentence id="95">Of course I -- since I left Czechoslovakia, since I left the school system in Slovakia at the age of 13, my expertise in the language was very limited. </sentence><sentence id="96">But -- and so I'm -- but I suppose able to obvi -- obviously speak fluently and I was required in the Czech government to write and to work in Czech. </sentence><sentence id="97">And I was brought up in the Slovak schools, so I still hadn't learned the Czech when I got into the government, but I managed to get through. </sentence><sentence id="98">I don't know, one does the best one can and survives. </sentence><sentence id="99">And people were very ha -- friendly and -- and people helped. </sentence><sentence id="100">And so what I did was mostly Czech correspondence and also I did subtitles for films. </sentence><sentence id="101">I did the -- what do you call it?The little te -- the translations, you know, I typed those for Czech films, in Czech. </sentence><sentence id="102">And I did Czech and English correspondence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: When exactly did you start working for the Czech government in exile? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: I think it was -- I would have to look it up but I -- I can't remember exactly. </sentence><sentence id="116">I think it must have been in deg44, 1944, maybe a little earlier, because I came to England in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="117">I lived in Sussex in the children's home for a year, then I went to school for another year. </sentence><sentence id="118">And I worked for one year at [indecipherable] at the bookstore, and then I worked -- it must have been foy -- deg39 - "40 -- deg40 -- I would imagine deg43 - "44 I started working for the Czech government. </sentence><sentence id="119">But I could easily look it up later and tell you, okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: With whom did you work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Well most -- of course obviously I -- I -- all these people were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="128">I -- one -- I mean, I know that the minister -- Meyer, who was minister, I did not work with him. </sentence><sentence id="129">He was head of the whole thing, I hardly ever saw him. </sentence><sentence id="130">I can't remember the people's names, but I do have -- I would ha -- I have it written somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="131">There were different people, I mean economists, politicians, I mean, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="132">I worked for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Ministry of Finance, Industry and Commerce. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: I was, but I'm afraid I don't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="162">I really didn't at that time. </sentence><sentence id="163">Because first of all, we were really in a very -- let's say it was sort of like in a state of shock, let's put it that way. </sentence><sentence id="164">And we were sort of barely managing to exist anyway, because we were trying to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="165">We lived through the London blitz, we didn't -- I mean, we had to concentrate on survival, on surviving and we were terribly afraid of what's go -- what's going on in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="166">We heard terrible things but we didn't want to believe it because we were very frightened for our family. </sentence><sentence id="167">And we just lived from day to day and we were mostly together with refugees, other refugees. </sentence><sentence id="168">And of course we were just -- were not integrated into the British world. </sentence><sentence id="169">And what happened was that we lived, at first -- I mean, I don't know exactly the dates, but I would -- I would be able to look them up because I kept all the papers, but we n -- at first we lived in a chur -- when we -- after -- after we left the ho -- children's home, we lived in another girls" home run by a ger -- German refugee woman. </sentence><sentence id="170">And we were four girls to a home and then we lived -- my sister and another friend and I lived in a room rented from another -- in a house from another refugee, a lady. </sentence><sentence id="171">And we socialized mostly with other refugees. </sentence><sentence id="172">In the evenings we got together with other refugees and we just talked about our s -- but we had some very good times together, too, we had good social evenings, we went to the theater. </sentence><sentence id="173">We went dancing, we had it -- we were very close together because we were all in the same boat. </sentence><sentence id="174">But we were not included in the life of the British, and especially not in Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="175">I don't remember that we have ever been invited to a Jewish holiday, to a family. </sentence><sentence id="176">I don't think of -- I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="177">I can't remember that we ever had a Seder in England, or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="178">So we just sort of s-sat around waiting for    the end of the war because we thought we would -- we were very anxious for the war to end so that we could go home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: You mentioned a moment ago that there were things that you heard that you didn't want to believe. </sentence><sentence id="199">What kinds of things were you hearing that were -- were frightening you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Well, hearing terrible things about what was going on in the [indecipherable] concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="203">We weren't sure -- we didn't know the extent of -- of the things and we hoped -- and we always thought that our parents and af -- that our father would survive, because we thought -- he was very popular in the village and he was very important in the me -- running of the village, actually, because he was very helpful with things like the -- he was friendly with the mayor and he was friendly with the local population. </sentence><sentence id="204">He helped whenever there was any kind of problem with the fire engines. </sentence><sentence id="205">He was into everything, actually in -- and he was very handy. </sentence><sentence id="206">He was a mechanic and [indecipherable] a farm, we had some farm animals and he was very friendly with the local population, so I thought people would protect him. </sentence><sentence id="207">So we were hoping that h -- we kept on saying that probably our parents would be okay, but still we worried terribly about our friends and about the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence id="208">Because my father's family, the majority of the family lived in Poland, just across the border from where we were in Zakopane. </sentence><sentence id="209">We lived in a northern -- northern part of Slovakia, which is very close to the Polish border. </sentence><sentence id="210">And so we worried. </sentence><sentence id="211">And of course, during the war my father -- I mean, before the war, when Austria was occupied and Germany -- ther-there was trouble in Germany, my father used to walk refugees from those countries across the mountains to -- to Poland because they were escaping from Austria and from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="212">So we worried, of course, about Poland, family in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="213">And of course, about our grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="214">Oh, and there was one other thing. </sentence><sentence id="215">My grandmother, who was -- lived in Zakopane, came to live with our parents, because when things got bad in Poland she came across to Czechoslovakia and lived with our parents, and we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult for our parents because I knew that my father would never leave as -- as long as his mother was staying with him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: In your previous interview, you mentioned that there was some anti-Semitism in your village. </sentence></p></dialogue>

[ </sentence><sentence id="242">phone ringing] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Let me stop for just one moment, we have a disturbance.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: What kinds of things did she say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: Oh, she was very angry about what happened with Bernadotte, when he was assassinated, and she f -- said some terrible -- I mean, she had said very painful things which were very pr -- very painful to me because I felt, since we experienced so much anti-Semitism at home and since what was going on in Europe, and then we are experiencing it in England, I felt very disillusioned, but you know, that kind -- that was the only one, as far as I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: While you were in England, were you aware of any attempts to smuggle Jews into Palestine, during the war years especially, or immediately after the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Was there any public rush -- recognition in England of the existence of the Jewish brigade in the British army? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: Not that I know -- I mean, I did -- I wasn't aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="286">But because we were very pat- patriotic, we knew about the Czech army, we knew about all the other armies, but I didn't know about the Jewish brigade. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1633">A: The first time I went back was in 1968, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1634">Could have been a little earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1635">We arrived in -- we planned to go back because at that time things seem to have eased up in Czechoslovakia and we decided that was the time to go. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And it was very important for me to make my trip back to Czechoslovakia, since I had never been back there. </sentence><sentence id="1637">And we arrived in Vienna with plans to take a rent-a-car and drive to my village. </sentence><sentence id="1638">When we got to [indecipherable] Peter and myself and our son, who was then seven or eight years old, when we arrived in Vienna I suddenly got cold feet and I didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1639">I said to Peter, no, let's forget about it, I don't want to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1640">For several reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1641">First of all, I was very afraid of going back for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="1642">Secondly, I wasn't sure about the pol -- about the communist -- what was going -- you know, how it will be. </sentence><sentence id="1643">And it was just really frightening to me to go back, but Peter said no, we came all this way, we are definitely going back -- we are definitely driving. </sentence><sentence id="1644">So we rented a car and we drove to my village. </sentence><sentence id="1645">We arrived in my village at six o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="1646">It was not recognizable, because it used to be a very charming little village in the lower Tatras mountains and now it was sort of like a factory. </sentence><sentence id="1647">A lot of cement buildings all around and di -- very dilapidated. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And we arrived in the village at six o'clock in the evening and I didn't know who to ask for and I didn't know exactly where -- where everything was, it seemed to be different. </sentence><sentence id="1649">And when we arrived in ce-center of the village, I asked -- I decided to ask for my gir -- girlfriend, who used to be the mayor's daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1650">Her name was Maria Bautiva She was my girlfriend, who was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1651">And so we stopped in the middle of the village and I said, do you know Maria Bautiva? </sentence><sentence id="1652">And they -- I said, it's probably not her name any more, because it was her name when she was a little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1653">She may -- she's probably married and -- but this person know -- knew who she was and she said, she died two years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1654">I was so disappointed because I had not been in touch with her since 1939, but I felt she would be the only person I could think of that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And so then we decided to go and look at -- at the house where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="1656">And I couldn't recognize it, it was so run down. </sentence><sentence id="1657">The entire street was so run down. </sentence><sentence id="1658">And at first I didn't know where it was, and I said to him, let's go to the railway station, because from the railway station I know how to find the house. </sentence><sentence id="1659">So we went to the railway station, and walked down the street, when there was this hou -- what seemed to be our house, which my father finished building in 1938, it was brand new when we left it. </sentence><sentence id="1660">We left in deg39, my father finished building this house in "38. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And there were some children playing outside. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And said to the children, do you live in that house? </sentence><sentence id="1663">And they said yes, we do, we -- three families live in the house. </sentence><sentence id="1664">We live on the top floor. </sentence><sentence id="1665">I -- I said, go and ask you mother whether we could come in, because I used to live here. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And so she went in, we came to the front of the house and the child went in and she ran upstairs and she said to her mother, somebody wants to come and look at the house. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And the mother stood at the top of the stairs, she looked down at us. </sentence><sentence id="1668">She knocked on the door of the husband's room where he was ta -- taking a nap, and she says to her husband, come down, Miss Eberstark arrives here. </sentence><sentence id="1669">I was absolutely shocked, I said, how did you know who I was? </sentence><sentence id="1670">She said, well who else could it be? </sentence><sentence id="1671">Because I said I lived there, so she knew exactly in whose house she was living. </sentence><sentence id="1672">That was 1939, this was 1968, 30 years later. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And so we went up there and of course I looked -- and she said that two families lived downstairs [indecipherable] lived upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And they -- and I couldn't find one stick of anything that belonged to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1675">There was nothing that was recognizable. </sentence><sentence id="1676">And they immediately sent for other people to come in. </sentence><sentence id="1677">And he was telling u -- this man was apparently the same age as we were -- I-I was, and he said we used to play when we were children. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And then he said, I remember your grandfather and he pointed to his [indecipherable] your grandfather always used to wear this gold watch with a big gold chain. </sentence><sentence id="1679">And he made out as if the chain were four i -- three inches wide, which was a little gold chain, but to him that chain seemed to be a huge gold chain. </sentence><sentence id="1680">In any case, it was -- then they insisted that we spend the night. </sentence><sentence id="1681">Oh, another person was called, and they antic -- we were looking for a place to stay for the night and this man insisted that we spend the night at his house, which was nice of him. </sentence><sentence id="1682">We spend the night there and at 10 o'clock in the morning I said to Peter, we've got to get out of here, I can't stand being here. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And we went to a Jewish -- the only thing we did was g-go to a Jewish cemetery and we -- oh, everywhere we went -- I mean that first night, everybody wanted to buy our house. </sentence><sentence id="1684">They said, could we buy your house from you? </sentence><sentence id="1685">I said no, it's not my house any more. </sentence><sentence id="1686">So they s -- and anyway, next morning we went to my grandfather's house. </sentence><sentence id="1687">And everybody there said also, could we buy the house from you? </sentence><sentence id="1688">All these people lived there, all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="1689">There were lots of people living in the house. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1845">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Then we made another -- one other trip -- well, I went back to Czechoslovakia again, to Prague, once. </sentence><sentence id="1847">But then my -- my middle daughter came, who is a writer, a journalist, wanted to go back, which really surprised us. </sentence><sentence id="1848">She wanted to go and visit my village. </sentence><sentence id="1849">So we decided to make a trip back about four years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1850">And it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. </sentence><sentence id="1851">We stayed also a very short time, but it was wonderful for me to be able to take her, to show her where I was born, where my parents lived. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And we didn't go into the house this time, because nobody seemed to be there, but it was very run down. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And -- but we just walked around. </sentence><sentence id="1854">Of course, we went to the synagogue which is there, which is not a synagogue any longer, it's men's club or something. </sentence><sentence id="1855">It used to be a grain storage after the war, when we went back first time. </sentence><sentence id="1856">Then we went to a Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1857">Somebody seems to be taking care of the tombstones. </sentence><sentence id="1858">But one thing I did not do, which I still have to do one day when I go back, I didn't talk to anyone in the village. </sentence><sentence id="1859">I just didn't feel like I could talk to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And I should have done that, I should have gone to the office, to the -- what, a district building, whatever they call that, to find out who survived, who is there, who is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1861">I didn't ask anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1862">I just didn't talk to anybody, I didn't feel that I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="1863">But we wandered around the village, we went to the -- passed the synagogue, everybody was staring at us because we were looking up and down where the synagogue stood. </sentence><sentence id="1864">Then we asked the taxi driver to drive us to the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1865">We went and took photos and movies of the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1866">Then we went to stop at the schools to which I went, and my daughter just adored it all and thought it was marvelous to have been -- made the trip. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Now we have to take the -- my oldest daughter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1892">Q: Are you planning on any more trips? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1894">A: Yes, we want to go with my older daughter to s -- to do the same thing, because all the -- my yo -- son saw the village, he was only seven or eight years old, but -- so he would be willing to go again. </sentence><sentence id="1895">But my oldest daughter has never been and she absolutely wants to see it, so one of these days when -- maybe even a year or two, we'll go again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1904">Q: Is there anything that we have not discussed that you still want to talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1906">A: I think we've covered more or less everything except, let's see -- well, I think -- I can't think of -- probably after we finish I'll think of lots of other things that I haven't said, because that happened when I did the original tape. </sentence><sentence id="1907">After it was done, I thought of many things that I should have mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1908">Mm, well, yes, there are several things that I haven't mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1909">I haven't mentioned my uncle, who was instrumental in bringing us out. </sentence><sentence id="1910">My uncle, who was my mother's youngest brother, who lived in lon -- London. </sentence><sentence id="1911">First he lived in Berlin and so he knew what was going on and then he lived in London and he's the one who made the arrangements for us to -- to come out. </sentence><sentence id="1912">Now, it was absolutely a miracle that we came out because we lived in a small village in the Tatra mountains, where no one would have ever imagined that anything would happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And we always thought, during the war, that nothing would happen to my parents because we thought our friends, our neighbors would take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="1914">But we were wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1915">Now, if it hadn't been for my uncle and his wife, Lotte, we would -- who urged our parents, if it hadn't been for my brave parents who took it upon themselves to put three children on a train -- my God, when I think about it -- and to give up the children and to send them away, and if hadn't been for Nicholas Winton, and if it had -- hadn't been for my guardian who signed for me, and if it hadn't been for Marda Hess who signed for my oldest sister and my youngest sister, we would never have made it. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And also I want to say that -- that if I had to say anything critical about it, is that nobody paid attention to our education. </sentence><sentence id="1917">I must say that, because in London my older sister was left totally without schooling. </sentence><sentence id="1918">She was 15 years old and nobody thought of sending her to school. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And is -- I think that is absolutely awful, that is, when I think about it. </sentence><sentence id="1920">And with me it was a miracle that my guardian -- I mean, my uncle persuaded my guardian to send me to secretarial school. </sentence><sentence id="1921">That was a big argument, she didn't want to do it because she kept on saying that she only was required to sign, not to do a -- do anything because she -- he promised her that she wouldn't have to do anything but sign for me. </sentence><sentence id="1922">And now he was asking her to send me to school, and I had to finish my schooling in 10 months where other children went to that particular school for three years to get the -- or two years, or three years to get the schooling. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I had to do it in 10 months, which was not -- not good because I didn't speak English. </sentence><sentence id="1924">I had to learn to speak -- take shorthand, it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1925">But that is really a shame that no one really paid much attention, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1926">Everybody was so stressed and preoccupied and under such difficulties that nobody thought about it. </sentence><sentence id="1927">I mean -- I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1928">It seems to me that they could have seen to it that my older sister had some schooling, and that I was sent to a better school than I did -- was, but still, we -- we're grateful that we survived and we are grateful that all of these people participated, my uncle, the guardians, my parents, Nicholas Winton, who else? </sentence><sentence id="1929">A-And everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1930">It worked for -- for us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
