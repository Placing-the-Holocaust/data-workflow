And he vowed at that time, he said if he should come out alive, he said he would write a book about the miracle of St. Bernadette, and he did. </sentence><sentence id="365">And uh the book was called "The Son of Bernadette" which I'm sure you've read, have in your home. </sentence><sentence id="366">And on the first page of the book, he wrote the following quote: "For those who believe, an explanation is not necessary. </sentence><sentence id="367">For those who do not believe, an explanation is not possible." </sentence><sentence id="368">And here is the whole thing about religion. </sentence><sentence id="369">Either you believe or you don't believe, but I am digressing here. </sentence><sentence id="370">Eventually the Allies advanced and uh we heard uh cannon fire, artillery, coming closer and closer and one day a cry went through that little village, little Bella Mora, that uh the British are coming. </sentence><sentence id="371">Not like uh uh in American history...the British are coming, the British are coming. </sentence><sentence id="372">But uh they were...I I was fluent    in English, but uh not perhaps not as much as I am now after living here for forty years, but I was so tongue-tied and so nervous that I couldn't...I got stuttered...I couldn't even bring out one word out of my mouth, and they eventually told me uh to relax and I spoke to them, and this was uh British 8th Army under General Mark Clark who landed in Salerno and uh uh marched up uh the peninsula toward Rome. </sentence><sentence id="373">Rome wasn't liberated till uh 1944. </sentence><sentence id="374">And at that time uh I went back to Portenza, that big...big town where we came from, big town, that town where we came from and uh we uh...I sought uh employment and the Allies are a military government which was at that time it was called AMGOT, Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories and was later changed to the Allied Control Commission. </sentence><sentence id="375">I worked for them as an interpreter and we traveled all around the province. </sentence><sentence id="376">Uh I was with a doctor, uh a public health official, a British ar..army major whose name...] think it was Beardsley (ph). </sentence><sentence id="377">Uh I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="378">Uh I'm not...I thought the name escaped me, but his name was Beardsley. </sentence><sentence id="379">And uh we traveled around and looked uh for uh people who needed help. </sentence><sentence id="380">And uh that was it until the ___ went further and further and we went into Rome. </sentence><sentence id="381">I went into Rome with him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: As you traveled around and looked for people that needed help, did you come across any other Jewish... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: Yes, we did. </sentence><sentence id="459">Very few. </sentence><sentence id="460">Very few. </sentence><sentence id="461">The big shock for me came only after 1945 when uh the Allied Control Commission eventually was uh disbanded in Italy and uh was uh I went to work for the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="466">Q: What was the shock? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="468">A: The big shock was uh when we saw people coming from the camps, from the infamous death camps...Auschwitz, Dachau, uh Bergen-Belsen, uh Buchenwald, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="469">And how those people looked. </sentence><sentence id="470">Under-nourished, frightened, tattooed. </sentence><sentence id="471">Here as you know dressed in only in rags and that was uh...but I was appointed by the uh American Joint Distribution Committee to travel on my own through all the south from uh Rome south to Sicily to look for Jewish refugees and we found...we found quite a few who were hidden and uh they didn't know that the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="472">They were in uh bad...badly under- nourished. </sentence><sentence id="473">They had no money. </sentence><sentence id="474">I had to give them money and uh tell them to...resettle them, have them resettle in displaced person camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: How did these people get to this area ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: Uh they uh fled in freight cars, in uh...by uh nice people who helped them. </sentence><sentence id="485">The Italians were really good. </sentence><sentence id="486">The Italians uh had a saying. </sentence><sentence id="487">It said we we are all Christiany (ph), which doesn't mean Christians in the strict sense of the word. </sentence><sentence id="488">It means human being. </sentence><sentence id="489">And they helped them and resettled them into uh DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="490">At that time I was working out of Bari where the headquarters was and uh we cared for all the DP camp refugees. </sentence><sentence id="491">We fed them. </sentence><sentence id="492">They got clothing from uh the United States in care packages...you know if you remember that and uh this was uh when we slowly saw them build up their health, and in 1945 is uh Palestine was not...was still under British uh control and the British gun boats tried to keep uh Jews out and in "46 and "47 they relaxed a little bit and we were...we organized ships that were paid for by the American Joint Distribution Committee and we put some of the refugees on these ships and went to outside the port of Haifa and where they were picked up by small boats and smuggled into the country. </sentence><sentence id="493">Of course that all ended in May of "48 when Israel became independent. </sentence><sentence id="494">After that uh the independence of Israel, our work there was not uh necessary anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="507">Q: Your work in Italy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="509">A: My work in Italy, yes. </sentence><sentence id="510">And I went there...resettling of refugees I mean. </sentence><sentence id="511">Uh I was told that I was needed more in uh the north in a small town called Mirano (ph), which is a former that was uh before World War I, Austrian, and there they had a sanitarium for TB patients, again owned and run by the American Joint Distribution Committee under a Doctor Epstein (ph) who was uh a surgeon and who operated on people and cared them, for them. </sentence><sentence id="512">I was executive uh secretary there and uh there we...we could see as more so than before from day to day what uh people uh how they bloomed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q: Let's go back a minute to uh something you said earlier. </sentence><sentence id="519">There was a time, perhaps in 1943, when you became aware of what was going on in the camps, when you referred to the...I think you said that when people went in, they didn't come out. </sentence><sentence id="520">And then later you indicated that to learn about the camps was a shocking experience. ( </sentence><sentence id="521">It was, yes.) </sentence><sentence id="522">Tell me about your first thoughts, in 1943 when you first found out... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: We found out uh not through the Italian newspapers, which of course printed nothing about it, but uh through uh clandestine uh radio of the BCC and Voice of America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="530">Q: What did you hear? </sentence><sentence id="531">Can you recall that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="534">A: I can recall that uh there were camps where people were uh gassed, and they named uh I think only the uh camps that were in Germany, uh Dachau and Buchenwald and also uh Bergen-Belsen and then they said there are as far as we know...we haven't got it confirmed one hundred percent, but we know there are also camps where people are killed. </sentence><sentence id="535">There are trains, cattle...people were...Jews were forced to travel in uh cattle cars to those camps where they never came out. </sentence><sentence id="536">We did not know about the the gassing or the burning of the bodies, the literally cremating or that they were told to uh take a shower and the shower...there was no show...water coming out but uh poison gas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="540">Q: That you weren't aware of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="542">A: That we were not aware, no. </sentence><sentence id="543">But we were aware there were uh that it wasn't uh pleasant, that it would be impossible for us to go back and uh come out alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="546">Q: During the years that you mentioned of the internment, in Italy, did you ever have any experience with German officials? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: During the war experience that you had in "43 as the British were approaching, (yeah), who were they fighting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: They were fighting uh German, German troops and Italian troops and uh of course the Italian troops uh gave up immediately. </sentence><sentence id="557">They raised their hand and uh, , and funny thing is that uh the British Army...they didn't...uh when they captured Italians, they didn't send them to uh POW camps. </sentence><sentence id="558">They cut the bottom out of their pants and sent them back to the front line. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="562">Q: Which front? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="572">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="574">Q: What was the strategy in that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: That uh it...the Ital...the strategy behind it was uh probably that uh the Italians were not worth uh wasting uh food for in POW camps, or wasting ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="577">The Italians were...had a hard time in Yugoslavia with uh fighting the partisans, which uh was occupied most...occupied most of their forces, so they couldn't dedicate as much to the uh fighting the British and the Americans as uh they probably wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="578">They could never win the war against the partisans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: As the German and the Italian troops were fighting in your area (yes) and as the British forced them back, you didn't you see any German troops? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Why do you think that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: Why do I think that happened? </sentence><sentence id="611">Because uh out of the goodness and the kindness of the Italian people and also because they knew it was a lost cause, and they wanted to be on the winning side. </sentence><sentence id="612">They uh told us I hope uh when the British come and when the American, when the Americani (ph) are coming, uh that uh you'll always remember us and tell them of our friendship uh towards you and uh that we never tried to do you any harm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
