</sentence><sentence id="402">The popularity -- the population -- was mostly Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="403">All the great famous yeshivas were there. </sentence><sentence id="404">And when the war broke out, it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the villages, in Kovno and in other villages, because the fronts were going on fightings between the Russian Army and the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="405">But the civil Russian popula-- government in every community, including Kovno and Vilijampolis, disintegrated within a half a day of the

to go. </sentence><sentence id="425">Since of my attitude being extremely polished and friendly with everybody, one of these, one of the highest activists of the Communist Party was constantly imprisoned by the Lithuanian. </sentence><sentence id="426">And he was a, a -- and his background was the office product industry, and his family was known. </sentence><sentence id="427">And Hindale was the one who was collecting money from me to support his family, and to support other families, and the other of the imprisoned political prisoners, Jewish or non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="428">I gave to everybody generously, so she knew exactly who I was. </sentence><sentence id="429">And there were a great deal of members of the Central Committee of the Communist Pa -- Kovno Lithuanian Communist Party, who also knew about my activities as a human being. </sentence><sentence id="430">And she called me and informed me that I am on the list to be taken to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="431">There was a mi-- a, a minority rule vote against taking me out, but the majority won. </sentence><sentence id="432">And she suggested to me that the person from whose family I helped support -- I don't know his name, he became the head of the rectory of the vacation. </sentence><sentence id="433">He became the Commissioner of the head of the vacation for the whole commercial enterprises in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="434">And since I was - - had to take a job by then already, because I also was advised by inside information that it's not healthy for me to be a free-lance representative, so they appointed a job for me in one of the retail outlets. </sentence><sentence id="435">I became the prekiau (ph) zinaviets (ph) -- the merchandise specialist. </sentence><sentence id="436">So she suggested to me I thought I should call that gentleman and ask him to grant me a vacation, because I didn't feel good. </sentence><sentence id="437">I called him in his office, I made an appointment with him the same day to have dinner with him in a restaurant. </sentence><sentence id="438">I explained to him that I don't feel good. </sentence><sentence

to convince him that I am what I am. </sentence><sentence id="441">And he saw it. </sentence><sentence id="442">He called me the next day, and suggested that there's two openings for me on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="443">One was in Sochi, in Crimo-Cacausus"" -- the most luxury resort area in Russia, where Stalin personally had one of his villas. </sentence><sentence id="444">And I certainly shivered away from that. </sentence><sentence id="445">The next place was Druskininkai, a resort area, a very famous resort area which belonged to Lithuania five hundred years ago at the time when Lithuania ruled a great deal of eastern  0 Europe. </sentence><sentence id="446">And in 1918-20, in the war between the Lithuanian's independent and Poland's independent, a Polish general occupied the whole territory with this Lithuanian capital of Vilna, and it became Polish. </sentence><sentence id="447">And I accepted to go to Druskininkai. </sentence><sentence id="448">Since I am a person of -- I never believed in delaying matters and in being sloppy, whatever I do, I immediately accepted the permit and that was on Monday night. </sentence><sentence id="449">Tuesday, I took the train to Druskininkai. </sentence><sentence id="450">L arrived there late Tuesday night. </sentence><sentence id="451">I registered in the hotel with all the formalities. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="547">Q: When the war broke out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="549">A: Since I was a fairly well-to-do person, and without a family, as soon as the Communists took over Lithuania, everybody in Lithuania, every -- but everybody had to look like Stalin, to make themselves a Stalin jacket and high boots, and pants with, with -- how do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="550"> 1 Rider pants, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="551">So I, I had tailor-made luxury black ankle leather coats, with high boots, with Stalinuvka"? ( </sentence><sentence id="552">ph) jackets. </sentence><sentence id="553">And at the time when Molotov's speech was delivered, the tens of thousands of vacationers, they're starting to run around in chaotic -- a mad situation. </sentence><sentence id="554">And nobody know what to do, and nobody knew where to go. </sentence><sentence id="555">And I immediately decided that I will start to escape in the only highway road which was near the resort area. </sentence><sentence id="556">And I walked out with my beautiful black raincoat, dressed in the beautiful boots to look like a commissar. </sentence><sentence id="557">And after 10, 15 minutes walking, my feet were already crippled, and I had to throw away the boots and walk barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="558">I walked for an hour this way. </sentence><sentence id="559">While passing by -- that was in the middle of the night -- there was a water well. </sentence><sentence id="560">And thousands of people were laying around the water well, hanging around. </sentence><sentence id="561">There was a school of Russian students. </sentence><sentence id="562">I don't remember what kind of school. </sentence><sentence id="563">It was a vocational school. </sentence><sentence id="564">And the boys who were who were taking out the water from the well wore uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="565">And the thousands of people had stretched out their hands to get a drink of water. </sentence><sentence id="566">I had some properties with me, and in the properties I had built in two very, very expensive diamonds. </sentence><sentence id="567">I prepared myself for that kind of even-eventuality in many situations. </sentence><sentence id="568">In, in a dry shaving soap container, like a little, like a little roller. </sentence><sentence id="569">And I took that out and stretched out my hand to hand over to the boys; and within two seconds, I got the water. </sentence><sentence id="570">And I continued. </sentence><sentence id="571">Daybreak came, and by then I was half-dead. </sentence><sentence id="572">I couldn't walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="573">I was on a field where thousands of people were laying stretched out on the field, already half-dead from the same difficulty of walking barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="574">And the German airplanes came flying over the field. </sentence><sentence id="575">And a lot of people were shoving themselves through their bodies crawling, with the hope that they will be able to crawl closer to the bombs and get killed so they die, but it didn't happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="576">And it just so happened that by then I was near a road where thousands of refugees were running towards Russia. </sentence><sentence id="577">That highway was closer to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="578">Those borders, in those days, the, the, the, the national territories that a little, a little highway, a little road -- here was Poland, five seconds later it was Ukrainia, and, and a little bit further it was Byelorussia. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was all part of the same territories. </sentence><sentence id="580">So I happened to be lying near the, the route, near the road, where a Jewish family with a horse and buggy, with some children and women were on the, on the, on the, on the wagon, and men were walking with the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="581">And one of the women noticed me. </sentence><sentence id="582">And she started to cry and forced the man to put me on the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="583">And on the wagon, they bandaged my feet and powdered it. </sentence><sentence id="584">And I recuperated. </sentence><sentence id="585">And after traveling all day and almost a half a night, wherever we went the Germans were ahead of us. </sentence><sentence id="586">Finally we land up a village in Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="587">We were in a barn of a, of a Ukrainian farmer house. </sentence><sentence id="588">It was then already forbidden by Jews to take in wandering Jews. </sentence><sentence id="589">So the Ukrainian had mercy with us and took us in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="590">And I remember if it happened today, right now, that his two grown-up sons were busy in the village robbing the Jewish properties. </sentence><sentence id="591">And the old man -- he must have been eighty, ninety years old -- stood for hours in the doorway of his barn where we were laying, with a, with a stick like a baseball stick over his shoulder, ready to beat his sons when they'll be  2 finished robbing the Jewish houses in the village and when they will come back home to stop them from going in in the barn and kill us and take away the properties what those people had with whom I was attached. </sentence><sentence id="592">I had no properties again at all anymore, so there was nothing to take from me. </sentence><sentence id="593">All they could do is kill me. </sentence><sentence id="594">After we left this property, we continued riding further and further and further. </sentence><sentence id="595">And we didn't manage to go very far, where we stopped at another house. </sentence><sentence id="596">And I, I was relaxed already and almost everything in my foot healed, except one area which was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="597">And I was sitting in the front of the house. </sentence><sentence id="598">I think the house, the people in the house what made me do something in the front -- clean a pot, I don't remember what. </sentence><sentence id="599">And a group of German soldiers stopped and asked me, "Du Jude?"!(r) And I said, "Jude." </sentence><sentence id="600">And they took me with them. </sentence><sentence id="601">They took me to a, to a, to a, to a fairly decent-looking residence. </sentence><sentence id="602">And it was vacant, and they made me scrub the floor. </sentence><sentence id="603">It was the headquarters for the commanding general to stopover when he will arrive. </sentence><sentence id="604">They were preparing the headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="605">And since one of the guards noticed my bleeding foot, they called in the military doctor and he bandaged my foot. </sentence><sentence id="606">In the meantime, he bought something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="607">And after I was finished cleaning, they took me back to the place where they picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="608">By then, it was too late to go anywhere, because the routes were bombed and destroyed and the Germans were everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="609">So the family, the family from Grodno to whom I attached myself, decided to go back to Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="610">And it took us several days. </sentence><sentence id="611">And we arrived in Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="612">Shortly before we came to the proper city in Grodno, there was the gendarmes, the military gendarmes, who were controlling the traffic. </sentence><sentence id="613">And they stepped -- they stopped us and identified a whole group as Jews and took us straight to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="614">And from there, they kept us for a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="615">And since the whole family was in Grodno, resident family, they let them all go -- including me. </sentence><sentence id="616">So I stayed for a few days with that family. </sentence><sentence id="617">Shortly afterwards, few -- I rested for a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="618">And then I -- they told me -- I spoke no Polish. </sentence><sentence id="619">So the family with whom I was staying discovered that there are thousands of refugees are lined up in the front of the German commandant to get passes to go back to their homes. </sentence><sentence id="620">Where do you have that many thousands of refugees?Because Druskininkai, the resort area where I was, was a resort area only for, for vacationers. </sentence><sentence id="621">There were dozens of hotels only for vacationers. </sentence><sentence id="622">And there were many other resort hotels in that area. </sentence><sentence id="623">So thousands, and maybe tens of thousands of Russian laborers and employees who had a vacation lined up over there and were caught in the war. </sentence><sentence id="624">And they all lined up in Grodno, in the front of the Kommandantur to get passes to go home. </sentence><sentence id="625">And I did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="626">The procedure was: there was a big street, no traffic, it was blocked off; across the street of the building of the Kommandantur, the thousands of people were staying and waiting in line. </sentence><sentence id="627">There were several German guards who controlled the traffic of the people. </sentence><sentence id="628">And when a group of 10, 20 people walked out from the Kommandantur, that means they took care of their business. </sentence><sentence id="629">The guards permitted a group of these other 10, 20 people to go in. </sentence><sentence id="630">Since thousands of people were waiting on the other side and the guard doesn't designate who should come in, so the thousands of them was starting to run. </sentence><sentence id="631">So the guards  3 were controlling the outside. </sentence><sentence id="632">They let that many people in, and they did not permit any more. </sentence><sentence id="633">And the rest of them went back. </sentence><sentence id="634">That repeated itself several times a day. </sentence><sentence id="635">I was there for one day, and I think a second day. </sentence><sentence id="636">After that, the rule came out that every Jew should wear a Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="637">And the Grodno family made up Stars of David on the front and on the back, and they made a set of Star of Davids for me, too. </sentence><sentence id="638">So the next morning, six o'clock in the morning, I arrived at the, at the line-up place, already with my Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="639">I am not a tall person. </sentence><sentence id="640">And between the husky big people without the Star of David, I would never had a opportunity to get there because as groups of people got their, their fulfillment, new groups of people arrived to wait for the police. </sentence><sentence id="641">A day passed by. </sentence><sentence id="642">Although nobody ever attempted to offend me at all, while I was standing, but when I started to run with all the other people to get in, that's when they pushed me aside and did not let me go near it. </sentence><sentence id="643">And one day, I think, two days passed by. </sentence><sentence id="644">Early morning on the third day, when I lined up together with all the other people, the German guard walked over to me and said, "Du, Jude, komm.""" </sentence><sentence id="645">And he walked me through the gate, and while walking he said to me, "Die Schweine, die, die, die Russians! </sentence><sentence id="646">Ich hab gesehen was ist -- was angeht, und du hast niemals die Gelegenheit durchzugehen. </sentence><sentence id="647">""(r) </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="995">Q: What, what happens to you next, now that you're back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: The next, the next thing what happened, I happened to have an apartment in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="998">My mother, when I made the trip to Druskininkai for a vacation, my mother was living with me. </sentence><sentence id="999">She was taking care of the maid I had, and helping her. </sentence><sentence id="1000">I didn't want my mother to be by herself. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So I gave her money to buy gifts for all her daughters, and travel to visit from one daughter to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And the first stop she made was in Jonava, with my sister who had fou-four children. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Over there, the first day the Jews were lined up from their apartments, driven to the forest and they were kept for several days. </sentence><sentence id="1004">My then-70-years-old mother realized that nothing good will come out from the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And she grabbed Dinah's (ph) hand -- my oldest niece, my sister's oldest daughter -- and she pushed herself closer and closer to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And when it became dark, she pulled out Dinah and they walked away. </sentence><sentence id="1007">They were hiding during the day in the, in the, in the ravinas (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1008">Ravina, that's a English word? </sentence><sentence id="1009">Between the -- and during the night, they were walking. </sentence><sentence id="1010">A woman who couldn't read and write, never went to a school, never know what a map means, managed to go from Janova to Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And that's how they arrived in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1012">They were hiding during the day, because they would have been caught by the partisans and murdered. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And if there weren't any partisans, some of the decent Christians would have fingered them to the partisans and called over a murderer. </sentence><sentence id="1014">So they arrived in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1015">So I had already a built-in family of my sister Chayke (ph), whose husband was murdered in Slobodka, with her little girl, Raisele (ph), and a boy, Alenke (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1016">The boy was six years old. </sentence><sentence id="1017">The girl was about 12, 14. </sentence><sentence id="1018">That was three people. </sentence><sentence id="1019">My mother is four, and Dinahle (ph) then is five. </sentence><sentence id="1020">So I had five dependents, on whose ability to survive depends on me only. </sentence><sentence id="1021">After a while, the rule came out to go into Kovno ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I, on the other hand, the minute when I heard what happened to my brother- in-law and their, and the, the other people -- and that had happened only three, four days before my arrival. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Because they didn't murder them in the first three days of the onslaught. </sentence><sentence id="1024">It was on the fourth day; and it was three -- it was seven days since the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I decided to walk to the criminal police headquarters to attempt to speak to this chief of the criminal police, Mr. Pomatitis (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1026">My relationship with Pomatitis was as following: while I was the manager, so-called  8 manager of the new Christian office products store and his office was buying, and he personally was coming and place orders for me for 5,000 dollar carpets and other expensive properties and put in on the invoice "office products" to be sent to his home, it was a personal relationship between him and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1027">Since I wasn't some several times for business, and when I became the employee of the government store retail outlet, after the, the Communists took over, because I had to have a job, his wife was coming to the store to buy school supplies for the children. </sentence><sentence id="1028">So she told me that he was imprisoned in the Kovno prison, and I realized that they had difficulty to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1029">So I gave her money to buy the school supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1030">I helped her with food, and I sent quite often hilf? -- </sentence><sentence id="1031">help -- to her house. </sentence><sentence id="1032">My logic was, that when he was rel-- freed from prison from the Communists, and became again the chief of the police headquarters in Kovno, my logic was that she would have told him what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1033">He knew who I am. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And I think I'll take the, I'll take the risk and go to see him, and ask him if he can liberate my brother-in-law and all the people who were kept in that house. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1036">In order to be secure, because it wasn't safe to walk through Kovno for the Lithuanian partisans who didn't know who I am and didn't care who I am, I had a distant relative -- a Jewish distant relative -- who was a former volunteer in the original Lithuanian Army. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And that was a big honor by the Lithuanians, and he wore a little button on his--. </sentence><sentence id="1038">With that, we were stopped a couple times going to the, to the police, to this. -- </sentence><sentence id="1039">to the chief of police, to Mr. Pomatitis, which was all the way on the, on the, on the new part in Kovno, quite a distant. </sentence><sentence id="1040">But we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1041">There were thousands of Jews waiting in the offices for appointments, and hundreds and hundreds of Lithuanian and other minorities who were waiting for their appointment. </sentence><sentence id="1042">But when I informed the desk clerk that I came to see Mr.Jonas Pomatitis, the chief of the police headquarters, within two seconds the assistant of the police, chief of police of Mr. Pomatitis came out and asked me my business, and I told him. </sentence><sentence id="1043">He went back in; and came out and regretted that Mr. Pomatitis does not have the opportunity to come and speak to me. </sentence><sentence id="1044">But he'll do everything he can, but he thinks it may be too late. </sentence><sentence id="1045">And that's exactly what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1046">It was too late. </sentence><sentence id="1047">On the way back, we were stopped again by Lithuanian partisans, who were picking up Jews from all over. </sentence><sentence id="1048">It was still permitted for Jews to walk on the street, but you had to have your star already. </sentence><sentence id="1049">Or maybe by then it was not. </sentence><sentence id="1050">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1051">But it wasn't hard for a Lithuanian to know who is a Jew in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1052">They looked at the at the little button of my friend, and they pushed him away; and they took me to the prison, to the yellow prison, which was nearby. </sentence><sentence id="1053">They kept me there for several hours. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And then, with a group of hundreds of other Jews, they took me on the mountains in a former Russian casere, a military unit. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And they made me sort clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And when the day was over, they sent me back in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Then the decree came out that all Jews should go in in ghetto; and I made arrangements with my family to go to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Since we had -- didn't have anything to transfer, it was for easier for us just to go Kovno to the apartment of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1059">She lived in ghetto in, in Slobodka, where it was supposed to be. </sentence><sentence id="1060">The street she lived was supposed to be part of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Before we did that, I decided to go  9 to my former apartment and see if there was anything I could recuperate. </sentence><sentence id="1062">The superintendent of the building was a Russian, a old Russian with a big beard. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Nobody persecuted Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1064">The Lithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years. </sentence><sentence id="1065">But the Russian were, were kept neutral. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Nobody -- the old ones, and not new Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1067">They were regular Lithuanian citizens. </sentence><sentence id="1068">When I walked in in that apartment, a rifle was hanging on the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And he explained me, "You see, I can easily take down the rifle and shoot you dead. </sentence><sentence id="1070">But I'm not going to do it." </sentence><sentence id="1071">He returned to me a pair of shoes and some underwear, and a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Because I was extremely well-to-do, and because my friend was a former Polish immigrant, he arranged for me to buy from Vilna the most luxury Polish furniture that only nobility could afford to have it -- or multi-millionaires. </sentence><sentence id="1073">It was called tonnette (ph) manufacturing. </sentence><sentence id="1074">So he became the possessor of all the luxury, with everything I had. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And after a few days, we moved into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1076">By then, my sister's apartment where she lived was not any more designated to the ghetto, and we had to move in somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And since every Jew got something, so my family got also some kind of a location together with other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1078">But in the meantime, we were in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1079">The ghetto was not completely closed up by then. </sentence><sentence id="1080">But Jews were constantly moving in. </sentence><sentence id="1081">The German authorities gave us, I think, until August 15th to close in the ghetto, where no more, no, no Jews would be in Kovno ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1082">It should be in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Free should move in in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I had a dear Lithuanian friend, a Chris, a Christian Lithuanian friend -- also a former assistant of mine -- by the name of Kostas (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1085">And while I was preparing myself, I was not prepared that Stal-- Hitler will attack Stalin and overnight we will be finished. </sentence><sentence id="1086">We were prepared that the Russians will take over Lithuania and stay aside watching Hitler fighting with England and, and France, and nothing will happen in Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And since the Germans -- the Russians -- might will take over my country, I was prepared with my, with my wealth that I could live for a thousand years by having packages of my properties in different houses of different friends, Jewish and non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Whoever was my friends, I supported some of those families for a couple years, in order for them to -- while they are keeping my properties. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Because I figured out exactly and precisely, if anything should happen except the war between Hitler and Stalin, I would have enough to live for myself and for all the dozens of families who had my properties. </sentence><sentence id="1090">When I say "myself," it's not "T" personally. </sentence><sentence id="1091">It's the five families of my, of my sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1092">And that could have happened. </sentence><sentence id="1093">I left with Kostas a box of British gold pens to be put in in fountain pens. </sentence><sentence id="1094">In that time, there was no ball-points. </sentence><sentence id="1095">It was only -- no ball-points. </sentence><sentence id="1096">It was only pencils and pens. </sentence><sentence id="1097">I had a box about that big. </sentence><sentence id="1098">In that box was a hundred boxes of a hundred pen in each box. </sentence><sentence id="1099">If that property would have been converted successfully, at the time of the transfer from Russian might to German might to the private -- might, it would have been worth millions. </sentence><sentence id="1100">Because nobody could have refused a gold pen to put in in their fountain pen, to continue be able to write. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I left a whole box of that with Kostas. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And when I came, before I got into the ghetto, to pick up from him -- I had dinner with him, and at dinner  0 they served me with a broken fork and I left. </sentence><sentence id="1103">I took a droska(tm)(r) back and a droska forth. </sentence><sentence id="1104">If I would have been caught riding a droska, I would have been shot on the premises. </sentence><sentence id="1105">But I did. </sentence><sentence id="1106">I felt I had to do it, because by going in in the ghetto I thought I would be able to help myself survive for a long time with that, with that pens. </sentence><sentence id="1107">You know what I'm talking about, that pen?Do you know what I'm saying? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1227">Q: Like a fountain pen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1229">A: Like a foun-- a pen to be put in, in the fountain pen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="1232">Right, I understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: The most treasured thing in Lithuania or in Russia was a fountain pen. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And the pen, the fountain pen, could not function without that pen. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I came back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I took in with, with the, with the properties. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And I immediately, the next day -- but immediately the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1240">Most of the Jewish were permitted to come into the ghetto with all their properties, with the furniture. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Some of them hired transportation -- horse and buggies -- and came into the ghetto with everything they had because the Nazis knew that everything the Jewish would bring in in the ghetto, they'll get it later. </sentence><sentence id="1242">It was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1243">The Jewish were not running from them anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1244">But I came in with nothing, with five mouths. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And the first meal you may manage, the second and the third. </sentence><sentence id="1246">What you do with the fourth meal? </sentence><sentence id="1247">So the following day, I immediately walked around the streets, where most of the people -- who had everything they needed for the first three, four weeks -- they're hiding, in order not to be captured to be taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Because there's no guarantee that you'll come back. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I was walking around looking to be captured, to be taken to work, because that was the only opportunity, by being at work outside the Kovno ghetto, that I may have somehow a possibility to have some kind of food to survive and to bring to my family. </sentence><sentence id="1250">That was my motivation. </sentence><sentence id="1251">A young member of the, of the same apartment where I lived -- there were several families in one room apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1252">I think a young couple. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And he followed my footsteps, and he went with me. </sentence><sentence id="1254">After walking for 10, 15 minutes, we naturally were captured by Lithuanian guards. </sentence><sentence id="1255">One important factor I forgot to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Can I put it in now? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1257">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1259">Q: At a time a when Jewish were still walking back and forth from Kovno ghetto, from Kovno  1 to the ghetto, to, to pick up their things and to bring, I decided one day also to go to Kovno. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1261">Maybe I would visit Jonas Petronis, my other Christian real friend, who offered me I should help in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="1262">And by then he had a retail book shop in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I thought I would visit him and take up a couple matters with him to discuss. </sentence><sentence id="1264">There was a bridge between Kovno and Slobodka. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And when I came near the bridge from the Slobod-- from the ghetto side, from the Slobodka side to go to Kovno, there was a Lithuanian unifor-- a Lithuanian guard with a rifle standing there. </sentence><sentence id="1266">I didn't know who it was. </sentence><sentence id="1267">I know him standing there, but I didn't know who it was. </sentence><sentence id="1268">When I came closer, he captured me. </sentence><sentence id="1269">He was the son, the Yiddish- speaking son, of the Lithuanian superintendent in the building where the family for whom I worked had purchased with the help of an American brother of the lady, a multi-millionaire, Mr. Israel Matz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1270">So his father was the superintendent in the building; and he was the son of the superintendent -- who spoke Yiddish as good as I, or more better. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And he captured me. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And he shouted to call the guard from the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And who was the guard on the other side? </sentence><sentence id="1274">His older brother, who was my best friend while, while , while we were, we were on the, on the free side. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And both of them decided in my presence, they were debating should they knock me off, throw me in the river, not knock me off. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And both of them decided to let me go back to Kovno ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1277">So with that, I, I survived the first incident of destruction. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Or, or that wasn't the first incident, but I survived that incident, too. </sentence><sentence id="1279">The next morning, I went off with my friend to go to look for work and I was captured. </sentence><sentence id="1280">We were taken to shant-- to the military casernes which was a tremendous distant. </sentence><sentence id="1281">We walked. </sentence><sentence id="1282">When we arrived there, we were half-dead. </sentence><sentence id="1283">It was about three, four hundred people altogether. </sentence><sentence id="1284">My friend and I was taken to a huge military barrack home. </sentence><sentence id="1285">We were given a, a emer" --a pail -- and a brush, and we, we were taken to this to the water foun-- sink. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And we were told to take water, and lay down and scrub the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1287">So we did. </sentence><sentence id="1288">We did. </sentence><sentence id="1289">We scrubbed the floor until our knees were swollen and bloody. </sentence><sentence id="1290">The Lithuanian, the Lithuanian murderous partisan who was in charge of us, every three or four hours came in to watch us. </sentence><sentence id="1291">In the meantime, he murdered up -- he and his friends murdered up half of the Jewish over there because the Jewish didn't realize. </sentence><sentence id="1292">They mistakenly believed that they are still dealing with human beings, and tried to persuade them not to have them work so hard. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And the slightest request of resentment or opposition to the hard work, they immediately took them out and murdered them. </sentence><sentence id="1294">I didn't have that case. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I laid down on my knees, and I rubbed and scrubbed and rubbed and scrubbed. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And the young man who was with me did exactly the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1297">That affected so much the murderous Christian Lithuanian guard that he himself run around to the Lithuanian houses and begged food from them, got food from them, came in and throw it on the floor for us to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1298">When we were finished with that, five o'clock we were lined up and we arrived back in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1299">It just so happened that the houses we got, they are the territory, the neighborhood of the poorest non-sufficient Jewish, who are worth any, nothing to the, to the Jewish administration anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1300">But value nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And that's where we got the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1302">So there was a long desert to walk, a desert area, a sandy area, to walk to our quarters. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Quiet  2 walk. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We were half-dead already, by the way, while we're arriving. </sentence><sentence id="1305">When we arrived at the gate, there was already a organized a Ghettowache(tm) who were checking the gates for the Jewish who came in. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And there was a organized Jewish police community guards, who were guarding on the other side, on the inside of the Ghettowache. </sentence><sentence id="1307">The cooperation between the murderous guards and the Jewish guards after a while became pretty, pretty decent, pretty tolerant after a while. </sentence><sentence id="1308">The rule had came out already then by the chief Gestapo commander of the ghetto that every Jew who meets a German executive -- civilian or military -- has to bow and take off the hat. </sentence><sentence id="1309">When we walked in the Ghettowache, we were told to be careful. </sentence><sentence id="1310">If we will meet a German, we should bow and take off our hats if we had. </sentence><sentence id="1311">We didn't have hats then. </sentence><sentence id="1312">So we're walking halfway. </sentence><sentence id="1313">We are starving. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And a Jew was not supposed to walk on the sidewalk, so we didn't walk on the sidewalk in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And we were walking already in the desert area when suddenly, from a comer street, two guards, two armed German military men came out walking towards us. </sentence><sentence id="1316">When we came close enough to them, we bowed. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And they immediately took down their rifles to shoot at us. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And I immediately figured out what's going on, what their thought was. </sentence><sentence id="1319">If I would turn around and run back, they would shoot us right away because they would understand that I'm running away. </sentence><sentence id="1320">There's no way how I could run away. </sentence><sentence id="1321">So I immediately start running backwards, for them to know that my intentions are good, and the other man followed me. </sentence><sentence id="1322">After walking backwards 10, 15 steps and we came to their presence, we bowed very deep. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And they laughed and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And then, after a while, we came home and relaxed and, and had a little to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I think the guards -- the Lithuanian, whom, for whom we worked -- gave us some food to take along with us. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And this way, every day I was going out, without waiting for anybody to line up and without waiting to be captured. </sentence><sentence id="1327">That young man and I were walking out every morning, and we were waiting to be to be, we were looking for the opportunity to be caught and be taken outside the ghetto where, where eventually we would have had something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1328">The first day, I was taken to a German military unit, to the PX canteen, to wash the floors there and to help put the merchandise on the shelves. </sentence><sentence id="1329">When we arrived there, the manager of the canteen -- the German officer, the Christian German-speaking officer in charge of the canteen -- took the two of us in the canteen room. </sentence><sentence id="1330">The canteen room was a little like a room as, as, as big as that comer there. </sentence><sentence id="1331">He put the pail of water in the front of the door, so when somebody would try to get in they would have to move the pail of water or, or know that it's something there. </sentence><sentence id="1332">He was able to see who would come in. </sentence><sentence id="1333">If it's something that he's afraid of, he would open the door right away. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And if it was somebody not important, he would tell them that the floor is wet. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And immediately gave us food to eat, and told us if anything will try to get in in the door and he will tell us to remove the pail, we should put the food in a corner nobody, not, not to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And after eating, we cleaned up everything exactly and precisely, and he invited us for a few more days to come. </sentence><sentence id="1337"> 3 And I had a beautiful, comfortable existence for my family and for other people after, for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="1338">Then that was over. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And I started again, and, and after three, four days being in bad areas where I had to come back with almost nothing to eat, I lined to work for the Third Police Brigade in the center of the most luxury area in, in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And I was working in the kitchen peeling potatoes, and, and, and doing all kind of manual work. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And I had enough to food to, to eat, and I had enough food to bring for the family and for other people. </sentence><sentence id="1342">By then, it must have been already mid, mid, mid, mid -- by end of August, where everything settled in. </sentence><sentence id="1343">In the early stages, where it was still permitted to go outside of the ghetto, a great deal of Jewish young men from Slobodka ghetto -- it was easy to go to Jonava because the highway was there. </sentence><sentence id="1344">They're running out every morning to go and get some food. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Jordan (ph), the chief murderer of the Gestapo, was waiting for them right by the end of the trip and murdered them all. </sentence><sentence id="1346">That was going on for three, four days, until some goyim"* -- decent goyim -- were able to come and to tell the Jewish not to go there, because they lined them up and they murdered them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1347">I was approached several times by very good friends of mine to go with them and buy food. </sentence><sentence id="1348">I didn't had any money or any clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Immediately thereafter the creation of the ghetto, clothing was the commodity to exchange. </sentence><sentence id="1350">I didn't had any. </sentence><sentence id="1351">What my superintendent returned to me was not enough for anything -- just a pair of shoes and a pair of socks, and some underwear. </sentence><sentence id="1352">So I had no reason to go, and that's why I survived this murderous onslaught. </sentence><sentence id="1353">When I lined up in the, in the Third Police Precinct, I think by reading the other memories I know that it was Captain Tornbaum"" who was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1354">After three, four days working there, the, the, the chief himself, the chef himself, for whom we were actually working and giving us instructions, didn't bother with us one day or another. </sentence><sentence id="1355">He gave us the instructions; we did them. </sentence><sentence id="1356">He gave us to eat, and, and he had nothing to do with us one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="1357">But one day, some more soldiers came to us, took one other man and me on a, on a, on a step on a attic in, in one of the houses, and took us over to a commer where two huge sacks of sugar was standing. </sentence><sentence id="1358">He instructed us to take the sacks, to bring them to the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1359">I immediately came over to the sack and started to grab it, and grabbed and grabbed and grabbed, and I couldn't even get near the sack. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And the other guy started to argue with him. </sentence><sentence id="1361">It's too heavy for him. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So he told me, "Stay here." </sentence><sentence id="1363">He walked over to him, slapped him around several times, and he grabbed the sack and run down like, like, like anything, came back with him upstairs, dragged my sack and they came down. </sentence><sentence id="1364">Because that that, that soldier realized that I couldn't even , even, even, even wrap around the sack. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And that was the end of the incident. </sentence><sentence id="1366">After a while, it organized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the ghetto working. </sentence><sentence id="1367">The best units were in the area where I was working, because there were a lot of, the complete population was filled up with Lithuanians. </sentence><sentence id="1368">They immediately took over the luxury  4 apartments from the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1369">And they immediately started to peddle with the Jewish, bartering food for clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And the Germans there, after, after a while getting used to the way of their slaves, probably keep their eye closed or didn't bother or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="1371">It was going on a, a business like a regular business. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out from Kovno ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1373">But the black marketeers, to them bring in food was not such a big thing. </sentence><sentence id="1374">To them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine. </sentence><sentence id="1375">You know what saccharine is? </sentence><sentence id="1376">Sweeteners. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Or sugar or fat or butter. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And that, at one time or another, it was pretty comfortable to get in, bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="1379">But after a while, it became extremely, extremely dangerous to bring in food of any value. </sentence><sentence id="1380">And in that time, the German Nazis put up a Lithuanian Wachmeister"(r) who was a tall, slim person. </sentence><sentence id="1381">By five o'clock in the afternoon, the street to enter Kovno ghetto was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken down by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the ghetto after a day's work. </sentence><sentence id="1382">That Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the black marketeers. </sentence><sentence id="1383">I had a contract in the work brigade, in that time, with a strong Jewish, physically strong Jew by the name of Chaimke Lipman (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1384">He was extremely strong, powerful man. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of potatoes was a tool for me to bring in in Kovno ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And at the entrance , by then a lot of people who were brought in some food were already starving. </sentence><sentence id="1387">So by then it was already seven, eight months, or five, six months in the existence of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And things changed dramatically. </sentence><sentence id="1389">And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their clothes to the black marketeers to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind. </sentence><sentence id="1391">If you come in even with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all. </sentence><sentence id="1392">He didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1393">If you had the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1394">If you had barley or any other, or any other of the vegetables, or cucumbers, or any other of those fruits or vegetables, it had no value. </sentence><sentence id="1395">He didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1396">But he was looking for sugar, butter, saccharine and other, and chocolate, and for schnapps -- any other expensive things. </sentence><sentence id="1397">So I had a contract with Chaimke Lipschitz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1398">I was buying a big sack of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1399">I couldn't even move the sack from the, from the, from the spot where I bought it. </sentence><sentence id="1400">Chaimke, it was after the line-up to go to work, Chaimke was picking up my sack of potatoes, carried all the five, six miles, carried in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I had my niece waiting with a little buggy, with a little dolly -- and dropped it in the dolly. </sentence><sentence id="1402">I didn't have much farth-- very far to go with this sack of potatoes because on both sides of the ghetto, inside of the ghetto and after the gate, after Jewish walked in there were two lines of Jewish stretched out with their hands to beg. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Among them was the famous writer, Joseph Garr (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1404">Within seconds, half of my sack of potatoes was emptied out. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Because it was my human duty to give it to them. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And the rest of it was easy to haul with a little more simply, with a little wagon, to my house. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And there my neighbors got, and my family got. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I, on the other hand, was carrying a little box of a thousand boxes of saccharine. </sentence><sentence id="1409">And there was five hundred saccharine in each box. </sentence><sentence id="1410">That product, brought in in ghetto, was  5 converted to millions, probably, in that time. </sentence><sentence id="1411">You could have gotten twenty-five suits. </sentence><sentence id="1412">You could have gotten gold and diamonds, all for that little box. </sentence><sentence id="1413">So I was carried this -- the box was not as long as these, as light as this, but only that thin. </sentence><sentence id="1414">So I was carrying under my arm, and dancing like a prima donna with that little box. </sentence><sentence id="1415">Except one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1416">You do realize that if I were caught with that little box getting in the gate, I would have been brutally beaten up and shot right there on the premises. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And Chaimke Lipman (ph) would have had no punishment at all for bringing in my sack of potatoes, because they saw his sack of potatoes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1596">A: One morning, I went out again to be, to be wait, to look for the opportunity to be captured and taken to units outside the ghetto that I would be able to bring in some food. </sentence><sentence id="1597">I was captured soon enough. </sentence><sentence id="1598">I was taken inside the ghetto to the new ghetto Kommandantur, where there were a group of barracks -- seven, eight single-story houses. </sentence><sentence id="1599">And it happened to be isolated away from the residents of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1600">The only next building closest was the Jewish police precinct. </sentence><sentence id="1601">I was taken to the Kommandantur. </sentence><sentence id="1602">A Jewish woman by the name of Luba, who was working there already, took me to the barn, pointed her finger to a big shovel and a broom and an axe and a saw to saw woods, and told me to clean the yard. </sentence><sentence id="1603">Then told me to clean the toilets. </sentence><sentence id="1604">When I was finished with that, I was sawing the woods, and when I was finished with sawing the woods, I was chopping the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1605">Luba was the maid for the Commandant. </sentence><sentence id="1606">The new Commandant was by the name of Ritter. </sentence><sentence id="1607">He was there every second morning. </sentence><sentence id="1608">He arrived every second morning, one o'clock in the afternoon, stayed there for, for the next, one afternoon, one o'clock in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1609">Stayed there until the next and the following afternoon, for two afternoons. </sentence><sentence id="1610">And one o'clock arrived, his former, his friend Tschich, who was on duty as Commandant -- both of them, they're former police officers in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And while I worked the first day and cleaned the toilets and cleaned out everything - - the street, the, the, the, the yard. </sentence><sentence id="1612">I realized that thanks to Luba and Esther, the two main maids of the Kommandantur, I will have the opportunity if nothing else will happen to feed my family and several other families. </sentence><sentence id="1613">Because this is the outlet that I have the opportunity to get food. </sentence><sentence id="1614">After a while, I trained myself to be so fast with all the other work that I was through by half day; and the rest of the half day, I was polishing the boots and the belt buckles and the belts of the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1615">The Ghettowache contained of about seven, eight individual story combined barracks with two rooms with one entrance. </sentence><sentence id="1616">And all entrances was on one side. </sentence><sentence id="1617">On the other side was the living room, with a window in the living room but no door to get in. </sentence><sentence id="1618">After a short period of time, under Luba's and Esther's influence, the Commandant instructed me to bring in all the confis-- almost all the confiscated food that was taken away from the Jewish in the evening when they came in from the work on the outside brigade, working brigades. </sentence><sentence id="1619">And it was all lined up in my hands to take care of and being in charge of separating, to bring in almost all the food in the bedroom of the Commandant Ritter. </sentence><sentence id="1620">The Jewish police precinct was only a short distance away. </sentence><sentence id="1621">The Chief of Third Jewish Police Precinct was a certain Kamse (ph), or Tarsis (ph) -- I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1622">A former good friend of mine from the wars, from the days before the war. </sentence><sentence id="1623">I had made arrangements with him. </sentence><sentence id="1624">He  7 was sending twenty to twenty-four policemen, lined up behind the window of the, of the bedroom of the Commandant. </sentence><sentence id="1625">I was opening the window, putting up the window or opening it, and hand over the first package to the first policeman who was standing behind the window. </sentence><sentence id="1626">He turned and gave it to the next, until it land up in the precinct. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And there, the Commandant was calling in, the Chief of Police called in the victims from whom the merchandise was taken away and returned to them. </sentence><sentence id="1628">After a while, Commandant Ritter instructed me to go to the Chief of Police and tell him that the Jewish who are coming in from the outside brigade should sew in initials on their bags, on their shopping bags, which was confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="1629">So they should be able to get in return their own properties. </sentence><sentence id="1630">All, all the Gestapo used to come and pick up some food for themselves from, from Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1631">They were coming in a small black Volkswagen. </sentence><sentence id="1632">Luba is the one who prepared everything for them. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Also, the food for the Ghettowache -- primarily, the Commandant -- was cooked with the confiscated food. </sentence><sentence id="1634">After a while -- but, but after a while, what's going on was while I was returning the food to the Jews, the Lithuanian Ghettowache started to mumble that they don't have enough food. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And where would they have enough food? </sentence><sentence id="1636">Because some of the food was returned to the victims, and it wasn't enough to cook for them, so they had to bring in foods for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1637">The Wache was hanging on, the Lithuanian and the German Ghettowache was hanging on the premises because the duty around the fences was only for two hours. </sentence><sentence id="1638">After the two hours, they were free for four hours. </sentence><sentence id="1639">They couldn't possibly go home and then come back in the four hours, or three hours, or two and two -- I just don't remember exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1640">It was not enough time for them to go home and then come back on duty. </sentence><sentence id="1641">So they were laying around in the outer barracks recuperating and resting and sewing their stockings, and do any of the other things there necessary while they were waiting to go back on duty. </sentence><sentence id="1642">In order to prevent any of the guards -- the Jewish or the German -- or any outside German who would come into the ghetto to catch what I'm doing. </sentence><sentence id="1643">Because if it would have been discovered what I'm doing, I would have been the second to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1644">Commandant Ritter would have been the first to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1645">For the period of the time when I was bringing in the food in his bedroom from the, from the barns opposite, he lined them all up in front on the garden, on the lawn up front, and personally conducted with all of them physical exer- exercise. </sentence><sentence id="1646">Up and down, and down and up, and up and down, and down and up. </sentence><sentence id="1647">Some of them were getting so exhausted that they couldn't move every time. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And the only time when I walked around with my big broom and shovel twice around the yard, that was the signal to him that it's all over, and he released them. </sentence><sentence id="1649">That was going on for two days. </sentence><sentence id="1650">After that Tschich came, and he was for two days. </sentence><sentence id="1651">Although Tschich, Commandant Tschich, never harmed me at all -- he was rather decent to me -- but he told me from the first day that if he, if he will ever catch me returning anything to the, of the confiscated food to the Jews, he will shot me right there and then. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And I followed his rule. </sentence><sentence id="1653">He never caught me returning anything and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1654">When I was finished with the actual duty of helping in the kitchen and peeling potatoes and cleaning the latrines, I was shining the buckles and the boots. </sentence><sentence id="1655">You can be assured that the most beautiful polished boots in the whole world was Commandant Ritter's. </sentence><sentence id="1656">And his buckle -- so was his buckle. </sentence><sentence id="1657">I had invented a special invention. </sentence><sentence id="1658">I took a  8 glass, a empty glass. </sentence><sentence id="1659">And with the back side of the glass I rubbed in the polish on the boot and the buckle, let it dry out for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And then, when the, with the, with the, with bottom side of the glass I circular rubbed all away. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And I'm not sure that if anybody in the world would have had such a beautiful shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1662">After a while -- I think it was about four or five months -- and Ritter and Tschich, the whole unit -- the whole unit moved away. </sentence><sentence id="1663">And a new unit came in. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And the commandant of that new unit was a German by the name of Schultz. </sentence><sentence id="1665">He did not instruct me to repeat the same things what I did with Commander Ritter, except he instructed me something else. </sentence><sentence id="1666">At that time, the Gestapo permitted to form a Volkskiiche" -- a kitchen to give the starving Jews, those that were starving, to give soup during the day free of charge. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And that volksktiche needed food to cook. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And there was a former Hebrew teacher, I think by the name of Schulgasser (ph), who would come, who was coming with a horse and buggy. </sentence><sentence id="1669">And he fill down, the horse, I fill down for him the horse and buggy with the food, and they took away. </sentence><sentence id="1670">After a short period of time, I am sure that there was -- again, under the influence of Luba and Esther -- he, he instructed me to go to the Chief of the Third Precinct, Police Precinct, Mr. Tomason (ph), and tell him he should arrange that Schulgasser should have a second horse and buggy similar to the first horse. </sentence><sentence id="1671">If the first horse was a white horse, so the second one should be a white horse. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And stay a distant away. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And when he was filled up with the first one and the first one came out from the territory of the Ghettowache territory, to bring in the second one and filling in the second one. </sentence><sentence id="1674">Schultz, at the time when it became already very, very difficult, and at a time when it was known that Obersturmbannfiihrer Goecke"" is coming to liquidate the Kovno ghetto -- and Goecke was known by all Jews that he was the liquidator. </sentence><sentence id="1675">He started from the furthest part in Russia, and when the German armies were stepping back toward Germany, he was liquidating ghetto after ghetto after ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1676">At the time it was known that Goecke is coming with units of liquidating the Kovno ghetto, I was helping sew a rucksack for the Commandant Schultz to put in Luba's blonde four, five years old boy and carry him over through the gates at night with the flashlight of the signals. </sentence><sentence id="1677">They had flashlights with three different colors, that there was a signal, a specia-- a separate signal that the commandant is going, to better to go climb through the ghetto and take the baby in the village, where one of the Lithuanian guards -- they are by then already in the beginning of "44, 1944, even some of the worst murde-- Lithuanian murderers became already friendly with Jews because they were looking already for a ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1678">So one of the Lithuanians offered to survive and Luba's son, and the Commandant Schultz carried over personally the son to the Lithuanian's house. </sentence><sentence id="1679">After a short period of time, the Ghettowache disappeared, and a new Ghettowache arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1680">And they didn't have anymore the quarters in Kovno ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1681">They had the quarters already in  9 a school, in a former school outside the Kovno ghetto which is about 15, 20 minutes by, by car away from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1682">There I was again called in to be the slave of the, of the Ghettowache kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1683">It was the unit of Obersturmbannfiihrer Goethe -- Goecke. </sentence><sentence id="1684">It was the unit of the Obersturmbannftihrer Goecke, who arrived for the process of liquidating the Kovno ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1685">He immediately converted the Kovno ghetto to a Kon, to a Konzentrationslager"" Kaunas. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And the restrictions became extremely severe for the Jews in every level. </sentence><sentence id="1687">I and all the other slaves for the Ghettowache were immediately taken away from the ghetto, and they built special bungalows, special quarters, upstairs of this of this school for us to be there and to stay there and not to go back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1688">By then it was a big kitchen with maybe several hundred SS guards, and it required more people to work. </sentence><sentence id="1689">And quite a few Jews managed to get themselves in the brigade. </sentence><sentence id="1690">And while they were there, they were locked in together with me, and they became permanent laborers, slave laborers, for the Ghettowache. </sentence><sentence id="1691">The, the chef of the kitchen was Ober, or Unter, or Oberscharfiihrer*" Blaufuchs. </sentence><sentence id="1692">He was a, a, a, a, they had -- he was not the chef. </sentence><sentence id="1693">He was the head of the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1694">The chef was somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1695">And he was the direct boss of Luba and Esther, and direct my boss. </sentence><sentence id="1696">I continued with the same duties of cleaning the toilets, cleaning the rooms, peeling potatoes, peeling beans for the kitchen, and all other manual labor work. </sentence><sentence id="1697">In addition to that, Wagner was one of the, of the PX managers. </sentence><sentence id="1698">And he had a bicycle, and he constantly instructed me to clean his bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="1699">The physical appearance of the location was as following: a small walking gate was from the main street. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Well, about 15 blocks further was the Ghettowache, the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And it was the low, lower gate in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1702">The ghetto had two entrances. </sentence><sentence id="1703">By then, they built a second entrance which was closer to the school where the Ghettowache was located. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And there, there was a constant guard standing with a rifle on the sidewalk of the, of the walking entrance. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And any time Goecke was about to arrive about one o'clock in the afternoon, that guard was giving signals that Goecke is arriving. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And with those signals, even high ranking officers of the SS attempted, if they could, to shy away from the premises, because nobody wanted to stumble into Goecke. </sentence><sentence id="1707">The only person who had a strong influence on him in a relationship to the, to the, to the dining room was Unter-- Oberscharfiihrer Blaufuchs, the head of the kitchen, because he was putting food in his stomach. </sentence><sentence id="1708">I, by habit, didn't want to get rich. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I couldn't get anymore to my family at all. </sentence><sentence id="1710">I couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1711">I didn't want to go out and, and, and do business on the black market. </sentence><sentence id="1712">As several Jews, from time to time -- arranged by the admin-- Jewish Judenrat(r) -- they're coming to the Wache to, to beg and to buy themselves food. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Because every outside work brigade had the opportunity to buy food, except the airport. </sentence><sentence id="1714">And a lot of people who worked on the airport get passes to go to the other work brigades, in order to be able to get themselves food; because the airport slave labor was the real slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And the whole existence of the ghetto depended on the airports. </sentence><sentence id="1716">If the general in  0 charge of the airports would decided to liquidate the airports brigade, probably the ghetto would have been liquidated immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1717">So it was very important for the Judenrat to have the, the, the Flug-- the Fliighafen(tm) functioning. </sentence><sentence id="1718">One time somebody asked me to buy medicine for a child. </sentence><sentence id="1719">I just don't remember what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1720">And I walked out outside of the gates, outside of the premises, in the next gentile house, Christian house, where everybody was communicating there constantly except I. I never did, but to do somebody a very important favor, I did walk out. </sentence><sentence id="1721">The premises of the, of the, of the, of the school was that on the front on the main street was the walking entrance, but on the side street was the driving entrance. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And the gate was constantly open to driving entrance, because there was a danger the Goecke may drive in any time. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And how would it be that gate is closed, and he had to beep, blow the horn to be let in? </sentence><sentence id="1724">So it was constantly open. </sentence><sentence id="1725">I walked out to that house next to, close enough to the Ghettowache, and discussed with the farmer, with the gentile family about the question I was, I came to ask. </sentence><sentence id="1726">And I, I was about ready to go back, and two Lithuanian policemen arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And one of them sat down to write the protocol to take me to the Gestapo where I would have been immediately shot because they got a bonus for bringing me there. </sentence><sentence id="1728">And the other was walking around from door, from the door to the middle of the room, while the first one was writing the protocol. </sentence><sentence id="1729">I was standing as shivering like, like, like, like hell for a few seconds, and then it dawned on me, "What am I shivering?" </sentence><sentence id="1730">I looked around, and I saw that the door was a push-out from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1731">I waited on the next turn when the guard, the policeman, was coming closer to the inside. </sentence><sentence id="1732">And I run to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1733">I pushed with my foot. </sentence><sentence id="1734">I start running. </sentence><sentence id="1735">They shoot at me, but they didn't got me. </sentence><sentence id="1736">And I was immediately, through the open wide gate, in on the premises, I immediately came to Luba. </sentence><sentence id="1737">She immediately informed Oberscharfiihrer Blaufuchs and he within seconds took me, put me upstairs, put a guard over there. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And a few minutes later, the two Lithuanian came to look for me, and he chased them out. </sentence><sentence id="1739">His chasing them out was it was only a momentary victory, a moment, a momen-- a momentarily victory. </sentence><sentence id="1740">The higher powers over him were of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And those two Lithuanian policeman were, were the employees of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1742">It was their business to capture the Jewish on the outside so they could have reported to the Gestapo and get, and Gestapo could have come and find me there. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And Obersturmbann-- Ober, Oberscharfiihrer Blaufuchs could not have helped a bit in that case. </sentence><sentence id="1744">But within seconds, he lined up a closed truck, got two guards shipped out with me inside, took me to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And in the ghetto, where will they find me? </sentence><sentence id="1746">The next day, I came back to work. </sentence><sentence id="1747">At one time I was called in, in, in, in, in Blaufuchs's apartment to clean his apartment, because his wife was coming to visit him. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And while I was cleaning the floor and everything else, she arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1749">And when she arrived, he hardly kissed her and introduced her to me and said, "David, du kannst ausstrecken deine Hand zu meiner Frau."" </sentence><sentence id="1750">&gt; I can shake hands with his Frau. </sentence><sentence id="1751">And I shook hands with her. </sentence><sentence id="1752">My job was finished then, and, and, and I disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1753"> 1 The, the, the liquidation of the Kovno ghetto got closer and closer and closer by the day. </sentence><sentence id="1754">It was going on by the day. </sentence><sentence id="1755">It took probably about five, six months from the time Goecke arrived until he started to liquidate. </sentence><sentence id="1756">All that depended on the front. </sentence><sentence id="1757">If the front got closer, then he liquidated faster. </sentence><sentence id="1758">In the meantime, he started to organize the Konzentrationslager Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="1759">In the meantime, he had the Kinder(r)(r) and the woman and the old people liquidation, where all the children and all the old people were in one day lined up and taken to be destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1760">In that action, my little seven years old nephew and my almost 75 years old mother was taken out. </sentence><sentence id="1761">They told me afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1762">It's a German Wachmeister, one of the units. </sentence><sentence id="1763">When he came back, cried when he told me in torturous murder, how they destroyed the people, the old people. </sentence><sentence id="1764">Mothers, mothers, mothers, mothers were, were, were, were falling, kneeling for them, kissing their feet, not to take their child. </sentence><sentence id="1765">So they killed the mother with the child. </sentence><sentence id="1766">They were taking children. </sentence><sentence id="1767">The main action of liquidating, it was in the front of the three big brick buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1768">They were taking children, the, the, the Ukrainian and Lithuanian murderers were going up to the third floor. </sentence><sentence id="1769">It was a three story building. </sentence><sentence id="1770">They were finding children on the top floor, and dropping them down through the window to the Ukrainian or Lithuanian guard who was standing downstairs on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1771">And he picked them up and knocked his head on the wall, choking up, until the child was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1772">The German Wachmeister who told me the brutality told me how a woman was find, a elderly woman was find in a toilet. </sentence><sentence id="1773">The toilets were wooden house, wooden bungalows-like. </sentence><sentence id="1774">And she was hiding, and it was almost all over. </sentence><sentence id="1775">And she mistakenly stuck out her head to see if it is all over and the Gestapo man saw her. </sentence><sentence id="1776">They were walking with big sticks exactly for that purpose, with wide, with wide handles. </sentence><sentence id="1777">My stick doesn't have a wide handle, but their stick had special wide curves in order to grab a, a person's neck and pull them like that. </sentence><sentence id="1778">So the Wachmeister cried for me, in telling me how brutally elderly woman was dragged with the stick on the sidewalk until she was dead before she was thrown in the truck. </sentence><sentence id="1779">When I came back after, when they started to liquidate the ghetto and brought me back in the ghetto, my sister told me that that old lady was my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1780">That's the way she was, she was taken out. </sentence><sentence id="1781">At the start of the liquidation of Kovno ghetto, the last few days Goecke, personally, and, and, and Berman (ph) or Breller (ph), his assistant -- I don't really remember him. </sentence><sentence id="1782">In the book their whole names, but it's not important for us. </sentence><sentence id="1783">They, personally, they're driving around the areas where groups of young people they're trying to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1784">Everybody knew it's the end. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And they caught them and shot them on the streets, on the field -- wherever they caught them -- without any mercy. </sentence><sentence id="1786">Immediately, they murdered them. </sentence><sentence id="1787">I was brought in in Kovno ghetto, back in KZ Kovno, back to be prepared for the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1788">But then they sent in a new group of guards, and that new group of guards needed service. </sentence><sentence id="1789">They needed to prepare straw, straw mattresses for them. </sentence><sentence id="1790">And I was called in with the other former workers  2 to prepare the sacks for them. </sentence><sentence id="1791">In those days they were building -- there was a barn where the wood was located, and all the tools. </sentence><sentence id="1792">It was old rotten wood. </sentence><sentence id="1793">They were building new barracks up to the last minute to prevent the Jewish to go through the, to cut through, dig out and, and -- because the wood was all then rotten, to, to break it out and go, and go through. </sentence><sentence id="1794">So I, I, I, I, with the five, six other Jewish workers there, practically the last couple days before the liquidation of our camp, attempted to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1795">We attempted to dig out in the side that was still rotten. </sentence><sentence id="1796">You pull it out from under the earth. </sentence><sentence id="1797">You dug out the earth. </sentence><sentence id="1798">And there was a religious Jew by the name of Portnoy (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1799">He had already his family outside, and he had prepared his place for himself outside. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And when he noticed that, he came to the kitchen and informed on us. </sentence><sentence id="1801">So you should see this scene, how the cook, and the assistant cook, and Wagner and, and, and, and Blaufuchs all came out to help us dig back in, so those who would see and kill us immediately they should not be able to see anything that were not smooth. </sentence><sentence id="1802">It was not smooth. </sentence><sentence id="1803">There was a guard, Schmittus (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1804">One of the guards was a man by the name of Schmittus. </sentence><sentence id="1805">I was told that he was a Ger--a, a, a, Ger, a Volksdeutsche"" in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1806">You know what a Volksdeutsche, Volksdeutsche is? </sentence><sentence id="1807">And the Nazis recognized Volksdeutsche as Deutsche(tm)(r). </sentence><sentence id="1808">Some of the Volksdeutsche were the worst murderers, and some of them were decent people -- like all people are bad and good, except the good were in a very small minority. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Probably amongst 10 thousands, you could have find one or two decent people. </sentence><sentence id="1810">Schmittus tried, made so many efforts to help me. </sentence><sentence id="1811">Schmittus was constantly arguing with Blaufuchs against the treatment of, the bad treatment of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1812">But he was arguing with the wrong person, because Blaufuchs didn't have any better, any other opinion than he had. </sentence><sentence id="1813">The day before we were liqui-- before we were taken back to Kovno ghetto, and few days before the total liquidation, I was doing my work and Wagner called me over. </sentence><sentence id="1814">His bicycle was standing in the front of the entrance to the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1815">The entrance of the kitchen was here, and the open gates to drive in was here. </sentence><sentence id="1816">And Goecke, when he was driving in, was driving in to, to the other wall, turn around, faced his car to get out, and walked to the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1817">So Wagner told me to clean his bicycle suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="1818">It was the hour in the day when nobody would expect Goecke to come to the dining room. </sentence><sentence id="1819">He had his own headquarters in, in the ghetto, and he had his own headquarters in the Gestapo headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="1820">He used to come to that, to the guard unit only for dinner, for, for lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And it was about 11 o'clock in the morning, or 11:30, when nobody would ever suspect or dream that he would come. </sentence><sentence id="1822">The guard who was constantly stationed on the, on the front of the main street with the sidewalk entrance was a, a, a, a -- also a Volksdeutsche. </sentence><sentence id="1823">A little confused human being, you know, but a very decent person. </sentence><sentence id="1824">We taught him that when you see danger -- Goecke, or Gestapo, or any other officer -- he should knock on the sidewalk with the rifle and shout twice, "Yaveh (ph) v'yavo""." </sentence><sentence id="1825"> 3 That's the Hebrew words: "He comes, he's here." </sentence><sentence id="1826">And when he shout, he couldn't pronounce both words, but "Yahveh" he remember very well. </sentence><sentence id="1827">But when he shouted, "Yahveh!" </sentence><sentence id="1828">everything disappeared from the, from the front area. </sentence><sentence id="1829">That day he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="1830">Somebody else -- a stranger who was not under our influence. </sentence><sentence id="1831">And Wagner told me to clean his bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And I removed my beautiful blue jacket with the stars of David on the front and the back in order not to make dirty, and I took the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1833">I was walking with the bicycle from the area where Wagner gave it to me towards the, towards the barn, where I had my tools. </sentence><sentence id="1834">And I passed by the area of the open gate and in drives in Goecke with a lady. </sentence><sentence id="1835">Turns around. </sentence><sentence id="1836">Gets out of the car. </sentence><sentence id="1837">Walks over to me. </sentence><sentence id="1838">Pulls out a gun. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And he was ready to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And I, and I stood up like a military person. </sentence><sentence id="1841">I clicked my feet. </sentence><sentence id="1842">I was wearing galoshes. </sentence><sentence id="1843">In July, I was wearing galoshes. </sentence><sentence id="1844">But I made movement like I'm clicking my feet, and I shouted loud and clear, "Obersturmbannfiihrer Goecke! </sentence><sentence id="1845">Das ist nicht mein Schuld -- mein Schuld, dass ich keine Star of David habe. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Der Wagner verlangte ich soll sein Fahrrad saubermachen, (and) um nicht zu verschmutzen die Jacke mit die gelbe Stern ... hab ich runtergenommen und ich ging mit dem Fahrrad zu der Bahn um meine Gezeig zu nehmen.""" </sentence><sentence id="1847">In that moment, he lowered down the revolver. </sentence><sentence id="1848">And within, in, in that moment, Blaufuchs was already near him. </sentence><sentence id="1849">That's the only person whom he'll listen to. </sentence><sentence id="1850">Wagner was on the other side, and other high ranking SS officers. </sentence><sentence id="1851">There was a new man who came a few days ago -- a huge person, a SS officer. </sentence><sentence id="1852">He probably was the head of the transportation. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And he saw what's going on, and everybody testified on my behalf, that I was not attempting to escape with the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1854">I was just going to the other area to clean it. </sentence><sentence id="1855">It, it took minutes, and Goecke gave a shout to me, "Verschwinden!" </sentence><sentence id="1856">And I immediately "verschwind." </sentence><sentence id="1857">You know what ""verschwind" is -- disappear. </sentence><sentence id="1858">And I disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1859">He went to have lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1860">He walked out from his lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1861">Blaufuchs was right behind him. </sentence><sentence id="1862">And he shouted, "Wo ist die Jude mit die blaue Jacke?!"""*" </sentence><sentence id="1863">And I immediately was there standing, like, like, like "Attention!" </sentence><sentence id="1864">And he delivered this small speech to me, and he explained that the "Blaue Jacke ist beschlagnahmt."" </sentence><sentence id="1865">It's confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="1866">And again shouted to me, "Andreten!"*? </sentence><sentence id="1867">And I walked away, and he drove away. </sentence><sentence id="1868">And the same day, we were taken back to the ghetto and it started the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1869"> 4 I arrived Saturday night back in Kovno, never to go back to the, to the Ghettowache. </sentence><sentence id="1870">I slept over the night. </sentence><sentence id="1871">I, I had my niece then. </sentence><sentence id="1872">My mother and the baby, Alenke was already murdered. </sentence><sentence id="1873">By the way, people told me when IJ arrived in the ghetto that that was the day when Goecke murdered, caught and murdered four or five group of young people -- a total of six, seven people per group. </sentence><sentence id="1874">About thirty, forty people were murdered that day. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And that's when they permitted me to be saved from Goecke, in a situation like that. </sentence><sentence id="1876">Couldn't happen in a million years anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And Sunday morning the Wache started already to catch us and to put us in a cage. </sentence><sentence id="1878">Shortly before I left the Kovno ghetto, two or three weeks before, to to and never came to come back to work for the Ghettowache, I noticed that Jewish were building near the Kaisergasse (ph), a gate --a, a, a fence, a fenced a, a, a wire fence, a wire bu-- a wire partition like -- four or five times as big as this here, on the field in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1879">And somehow I thought maybe, maybe, maybe that will be to, to drive in Jews before the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1880">Anyhow, Sunday morning the liquidation started, and I was caught by one of the new guards. </sentence><sentence id="1881">And -- no, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I was -- I begged my sister to go with me whatever will be happened, and my niece to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="1883">But she got permission to go in a bunker which one of the most prominent Jewish people build. </sentence><sentence id="1884">She was a friend of the man's wife, and they permitted her to stay until. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And we figured it's only for three or four days, and in three or four days Russians were coming. </sentence><sentence id="1886">And they permitted my niece, after a while, to going in. </sentence><sentence id="1887">And while I was running to look for directions they had -- Mongrel (ph) was his name -- came out from the bunker and invited me, too. </sentence><sentence id="1888">I am a, I am a breathing difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="1889">I was then, and I am today. </sentence><sentence id="1890">So after being there for a couple of seconds, the bunker was built for maybe 12, 14 people. </sentence><sentence id="1891">By when I came in -- the last one, I and my niece there was already -- I was already the 67th or the 68th. </sentence><sentence id="1892">It was burning hot in July. </sentence><sentence id="1893">It was the first week in July, so how long could I have stayed in that place? </sentence><sentence id="1894">After a few seconds, I started to cough and I got out. </sentence><sentence id="1895">I forced Dinah, my niece, also to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1896">Somehow, she listened to me. </sentence><sentence id="1897">And we were captured right away on the street, and put in the enclosed wire fence that was fenced. </sentence><sentence id="1898">We were one of the few in the beginning, but as the day progressed, it became thousands of them. </sentence><sentence id="1899">People were stepping on each other already. </sentence><sentence id="1900">We were laying there for three days and three nights. </sentence><sentence id="1901">On the second day, the transportation of the Kovno ghetto took place in three groups. </sentence><sentence id="1902">The first group went out Sunday afternoon without any incident. </sentence><sentence id="1903">They went out, and they were taken to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1904">The second group was my transportation. </sentence><sentence id="1905">But the Jewish that they find on the street, they lined them up and safely under the fence. </sentence><sentence id="1906">But they were going with Jewish men, Jewish policemen, from building, house to house, fish out the people in the hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And there, the woman were laying nude just in a garden, and the men were practically nude, and brought them all to the to the encampment. </sentence><sentence id="1908">So from an area that it could house maximum a hundred or 200 people, there were already two-- 3000 people concentrated. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And it became a tremendous situation. </sentence><sentence id="1910">You had to do your bowel movements right there and then on the premises because you couldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And the stink from the smell from the bowels was not to be believed. </sentence><sentence id="1912">I think we were laying there for three, four days or more, because they couldn't get transportation for us to go to the ghetto, to go to the, to the train. </sentence><sentence id="1913">Anyhow, in those days, Schmittus was crawling from body -- person to person  5 over the people to look for "the David." </sentence><sentence id="1914">I am "the David." </sentence><sentence id="1915">I am David. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And when he find, "Who would know is "the David"?" </sentence><sentence id="1917">Only the few Jews who worked with me knew that they called "the David." </sentence><sentence id="1918">There must have been fifty Davids there. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Who would know? </sentence><sentence id="1920">He finally find me. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And when he find me, he told me that I, when, to-- tonight or the next night, they wake us all up to march out. </sentence><sentence id="1922">And at that time, I should try to be the very last line, and I instructed my niece to be the very one with me. </sentence><sentence id="1923">And other people who were near me, I instructed them the same way. </sentence><sentence id="1924">He said, by being the very last line, he and Wagner and two other additional people will close up the line of guards. </sentence><sentence id="1925">They will be the last guards. </sentence><sentence id="1926">And as soon as they get out from the ghetto, I should escape. </sentence><sentence id="1927">He said naturally I should not get concerned that all four of them will, will kneel and shoot at me. </sentence><sentence id="1928">But they wouldn't shoot at me. </sentence><sentence id="1929">I should keep running. </sentence><sentence id="1930">I instructed my sister, my niece to do that, too. </sentence><sentence id="1931">I was ready to two eventualities. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I wanted to escape anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1933">I was ready, I hoped for two things may happen while I'm escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1934">Maybe I'll escape and be an escapee; or while escaping I'll be shot in the rear. </sentence><sentence id="1935">Without pain, I'll be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1936">I happened to walk out Sunday morning in a clean, bright shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1937">And while laying the few days in the field, I find the brother of my brother-in-law, who happened to have had a brown shirt, a dark shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And I exchanged with him. </sentence><sentence id="1939">I gave him my shirt, and he gave me his shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1940">I, I, I had a silly logic that if I'll have to run in the middle of the night, the guards may see my white shirt and shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="1941">The brown shirt, they will not see, because I planned to run out. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I had a German bag, a bread bag. </sentence><sentence id="1943">It's a linen bread bad by a hanging strap where they were carrying their loaf of bread, and I had a razor there and a couple of small things, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1944">I was ready to escape, to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1945">That's all I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1946">I felt I'll never wind up in concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1947">And I instructed my niece to do that, too. </sentence><sentence id="1948">When they marched out, about four o'clock in the, early in the morning, I tried to be the last line, and I was about in the last line. </sentence><sentence id="1949">I was about the closest to the right side to be able to run in a, in a, in a private house garden. </sentence><sentence id="1950">It was through a little gate. </sentence><sentence id="1951">I planned to do that, but I realized that Schmittus was not in the back and he's not the one to decide in the first place where he would stay. </sentence><sentence id="1952">And all he did is tried to sell me a bill of goods I should try to save myself and believe him. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And with that, I may, I may survive. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And that's all that he wanted: to help me to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1955">As soon as we walked out, Christa Kartigas (ph) took us -- I think it was Christa Kartigas. </sentence><sentence id="1956">We walked out maybe twenty steps from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1957">I saw an open gate, that little pri-- that little gateway to a private house. </sentence><sentence id="1958">You, you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="1959">I ran in, and I ran through the garden. </sentence><sentence id="1960">And a Lithuanian was working in the garden, and he followed me and he caught me. </sentence><sentence id="1961">And I loosened myself, and he remained with the same jacket that was supposed to be "beschlagnahmt" and the sleeves of the shirt, in his hands. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And I was already away from him. </sentence><sentence id="1963">And I kept running and running and running, until I came to a big fence that was -- the, the Lithuanian government had had built up a huge animal, animal in -- animal, animal treatment for -- how do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="1964">A, a--to, to, to cure animals. </sentence><sentence id="1965">Oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="1966">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="1967">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="1968"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2343">Q: Oh, like an animal treatment center. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2345">A: Ok, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And it was a huge tall gate. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And I couldn't, I couldn't possibly climb over the -- in my height. </sentence><sentence id="2348">It just happened that a pile of garbage was laying right there where I find myself. </sentence><sentence id="2349">I climbed up on the garbage, climbed over the gate. </sentence><sentence id="2350">And halfway on my -- halfway to the building, I see there are hundreds of German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2351">So I ran back, climbed over -- from the inside, it was easier to climb because there are the two planks, the bottom plank and the top plank. </sentence><sentence id="2352">It was easy for me to climb back in, and I continued walking. </sentence><sentence id="2353">I walked all day long. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And a tremendous rain storm broke out. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And I hid in the corn to hide myself from the rain. </sentence><sentence id="2356">How much I can hide myself from the rain, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2357">But I, I was, I was like a animal, really. </sentence><sentence id="2358">My mind was like a animal. </sentence><sentence id="2359">And the four guards, when I escaped with -- and, and, and when I walked out from the corn, my body was all smeared up in clay. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And I, I slept the night over in a, in a, in a, in a forest. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And the next morning, I continued. </sentence><sentence id="2362">By then I was hungry and thirsty, and I was making up my mind which house I should attempt to go in and ask for something. </sentence><sentence id="2363">And I noticed a big looking house, a big building, and I thought maybe, maybe, maybe a owner of property -- they call it pomeshchik,"* in that time -- and most of them were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2364">They, they're land owners. </sentence><sentence id="2365">The rich land owners were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2366">And the Poles were not so hot with the Lithuanians, and he may have been willing to help me, give me some food. </sentence><sentence id="2367">So I started to go to that house, because I thought it's the owner of a rich man, because it's a bigger house than the average. </sentence><sentence id="2368">When I came close enough, I noticed it's the Ninth Fortification. </sentence><sentence id="2369">And I went back, and I started again walking. </sentence><sentence id="2370">About noontime, I fall asleep -- weak and hungry, and smeared out in clay like, like , like a stray cat. </sentence><sentence id="2371">And while I fall asleep, I heard voices of children -- Lithuanian voices saying, "Zydu*! </sentence><sentence id="2372">Zydu! </sentence><sentence id="2373">Ectu (ph) Gestapo!" -- " </sentence><sentence id="2374">Run to Gestapo!" </sentence><sentence id="2375">So I got up, and I went
