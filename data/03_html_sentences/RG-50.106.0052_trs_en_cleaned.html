<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: My father was out of town a lot. </sentence><sentence id="127">As a matter of fact he was gone sometimes for weeks at a time. </sentence><sentence id="128">And my mother and her sister and my grandmother were very close and they would take Interview with Margie Rosenthal =) trips together with us children and by the way my aunt Ruth K, her name now was last name was Karliner but before that she was married to a Banger and they used to take us to the mountains and we had wonderful times. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was like a resort into the mountains which was resort was called Reinerts. </sentence><sentence id="130">And I don't really know what kind of mountains they were, but I do remember having a wonderful time up there with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="131">Climbing and, and using sticks where you put metals on them telling you what city you were in which I thought fascinating. </sentence><sentence id="132">And it usually was around my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="133">So they would have to kind of sneak the gifts into a suitcase so that they could surprise me when I woke up on my birthday that they would have a present for me. </sentence><sentence id="134">I surely didn't expect it because I mean we were so far away from home. </sentence><sentence id="135">But they did that for me. </sentence><sentence id="136">And going back again to, my sister she was born when I was five like I said. </sentence><sentence id="137">And she was born in our house. </sentence><sentence id="138">Our regular apartment. </sentence><sentence id="139">We didn't have a house in this case. </sentence><sentence id="140">But she was born and my cousin is the same age and she was born about 14 days prior to my sister. </sentence><sentence id="141">And she didn't tell her husband that she was going to have the baby that soon. </sentence><sentence id="142">So when he came home, that's my uncle, uncle Herbert was his name. </sentence><sentence id="143">It was aunt Ruth's husband. </sentence><sentence id="144">He came home and he said what are you doing in bed. </sentence><sentence id="145">And she said oh nothing. </sentence><sentence id="146">I didn't feel that good. </sentence><sentence id="147">She says, go look at the carriage, the doll carriage that Margie has. </sentence><sentence id="148">And he said what. </sentence><sentence id="149">I've seen that carriage and the dolls a million times before. </sentence><sentence id="150">And she says go take a look and go look at it again. </sentence><sentence id="151">Well finally to get him to do that, I urged him on. </sentence><sentence id="152">So I said uncle come look, come look, look at my Suzy. </sentence><sentence id="153">And he looked in there and there was this child. </sentence><sentence id="154">My doll's name was Suzy so he didn't know that it was areal child. </sentence><sentence id="155">But it was so funny because he couldn't get over it, that this little baby was in my carriage. </sentence><sentence id="156">And he had no idea what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="157">And then my sister came a few, exactly two weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="158">One was, my cousin was on the third of October, my sister was born on the 19% of October. </sentence><sentence id="159">But my dad was out of town as usual. </sentence><sentence id="160">And he did have an inkling that when he came Interview with Margie Rosenthal 6 back there would be a child there. </sentence><sentence id="161">And sure enough. </sentence><sentence id="162">In those days you didn't go to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="163">You had a midwife. </sentence><sentence id="164">And then I loved playing with the babies you might say because they were like my own doll. </sentence><sentence id="165">And I was able to hold them and play with them. </sentence><sentence id="166">So that kind of grew because when I was about six years old, my parents put me in charge, my mother put me in charge of taking care of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I would, I roll her up and down the streets. </sentence><sentence id="168">But then being a young kid, you know you kind of forget about what you're supposed to be doing. </sentence><sentence id="169">And a girlfriend of mine would say hey let's play hopscotch. </sentence><sentence id="170">So I did and the next thing I know my sister falls head over onto the cement, screaming, crying and I was so afraid to go back home. </sentence><sentence id="171">I thought oh my I'm going to really get it. </sentence><sentence id="172">| came home because my, they could hear. </sentence><sentence id="173">I guess the whole neighborhood could hear my sister. </sentence><sentence id="174">She was really upset and a little hurt but not really drastically. </sentence><sentence id="175">And I came home and she was still screaming and my mother says what happened what happened. </sentence><sentence id="176">And I said she fell kind of with the carriage on the cement. </sentence><sentence id="177">How could you. </sentence><sentence id="178">And my grandmother said what do you expect a child. </sentence><sentence id="179">She's still a child herself. </sentence><sentence id="180">You shouldn't punish her. </sentence><sentence id="181">So I got away with that one too. </sentence><sentence id="182">And later on we, where I was living they had always a fair once a year. </sentence><sentence id="183">And that was run by the gypsies and they were living in these house wagons lined up along the plaza there. </sentence><sentence id="184">It was like in the, on Fridays they would have a market there. </sentence><sentence id="185">and the rest of the time, at times they would have a fair. </sentence><sentence id="186">They would have carousels and big wheel and that was a big treat for us. </sentence><sentence id="187">And because my sister was too small, we couldn't' take her and neither could we take our my cousin because she was the same age. </sentence><sentence id="188">And this was maybe when they were about three or four years old. </sentence><sentence id="189">And one night I remember very well, my aunt goes home. </sentence><sentence id="190">Her daughter was missing and she got a shock of her life. </sentence><sentence id="191">Where could the child have gone to. </sentence><sentence id="192">She was gone. </sentence><sentence id="193">We combed the neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="194">Everybody was running around and finally we located her oh maybe a half a block away. </sentence><sentence id="195">Somebody had seen her walking as a little Interview with Margie Rosenthal 7 kid in the middle of evening, dark already and they took her in and they said you wait til your mom will come. </sentence><sentence id="196">And sure enough she was sitting in the window looking out and when my aunt came by she said oh there's my mommy. </sentence><sentence id="197">And that was one of the things I really remember. </sentence><sentence id="198">Very, very well. </sentence><sentence id="199">I went to the Jewish school and that, that was a wonderful place. </sentence><sentence id="200">When I first got there however, the very first year they asked us for a physical and they had this big hall and you went from one doctor to the next. </sentence><sentence id="201">One was a doctor for general. </sentence><sentence id="202">Then there was a doctor for looking in the eyes. </sentence><sentence id="203">There was a dentist that looked in your mouth. </sentence><sentence id="204">And of course they wanted us to be stripped to the waist because they wanted to take our I guess our vitals. </sentence><sentence id="205">Anyway, I wasn't about to do that. </sentence><sentence id="206">I was too ashamed to show my body. </sentence><sentence id="207">And they said it's ok, you can do that. </sentence><sentence id="208">And I said no. </sentence><sentence id="209">I took my clothes and ran down the stairs and I didn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="210">So then the teacher came over to my mother and she said did you know that your daughter ran from school and my mother said no, why would she do that. </sentence><sentence id="211">And she said well she didn't want to undress. </sentence><sentence id="212">And my mother said, well of course. </sentence><sentence id="213">She's very shameful of showing her body you know. </sentence><sentence id="214">And I never lived that one down. </sentence><sentence id="215">Ever since then, everybody is always laughing about it. </sentence><sentence id="216">The kids used to kind of snicker when they saw me. </sentence><sentence id="217">What are you ashamed of. </sentence><sentence id="218">You're not developed yet or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="219">But it's I was only about six years old. </sentence><sentence id="220">And I mean to me my body was kind of precious and I wasn't about to show it off to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="221">And anyway, my sister, Eva, her name is Eva Renart. </sentence><sentence id="222">I don't know if I mentioned it prior to this. </sentence><sentence id="223">She went to kindergarten, also a Jewish kindergarten and she had a wonderful time as well. </sentence><sentence id="224">And as I think back, we, my parents well that is my mother and father if he was in town, and my aunt and her husband, they went to the temple every Saturday faithfully. </sentence><sentence id="225">Of course in those days you didn't hire any baby sitters, you used the older child. </sentence><sentence id="226">That was me. </sentence><sentence id="227">And I would have to play house and entertain the young ones. </sentence><sentence id="228">And that was kind of fun because we played house and I was always the mother and they Interview with Margie Rosenthal 8 were the children. </sentence><sentence id="229">And of course they had to behave. </sentence><sentence id="230">Otherwise I would punish them and put them in a corner or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="231">And those are really very, very good memories for me because I enjoyed what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="232">And then in see we lived in upper Silesia, so we were protected by the Versailles contract or however you want to call it. </sentence><sentence id="233">I'm not sure exactly the wording. </sentence><sentence id="234">But until 1935 Hitler could not touch us. </sentence><sentence id="235">But in 1935 Hitler then said no more Jews to leave out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="236">So my dad couldn't go anymore to the in his business to the Polish forests and to the Czechoslovakia Russia and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="237">So the Nazis took him for forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="238">And he was digging ditches and they were there was water accumulated over there. </sentence><sentence id="239">And he got quite ill. </sentence><sentence id="240">So in 1938 we did get, in the early part of 1938 we received an affidavit from our uncles. </sentence><sentence id="241">That is my grandmother's brothers who lived in Battle Creek, Michigan. </sentence><sentence id="242">They posted an affidavit but when my dad heard that there, you know he had, I don't know, he was very smart man. </sentence><sentence id="243">He had an inkling that things were going, not going to go so well for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="244">So he decided rather than waiting in Germany we should go ahead and go to another country that's affiliated with the United States, wait there and then as soon as our visa became valid that they would give it to us, then we could go to America. </sentence><sentence id="245">That was the plan. </sentence><sentence id="246">However, that wasn't exactly what took place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Before we get to the to your leaving Germany, I want to go back a little bit so I don't forget. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="374">Why don't we talk a little bit about what you remember about where you lived, what your parents were like, what it was like when your grandparents moved into the house with you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: Well my grandparents moved in once my grandfather got the stroke. </sentence><sentence id="376">They could not, my grandmother wasn't able to take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="377">So we had moved into a place that had three Interview with Margie Rosenthal 9 bedrooms. </sentence><sentence id="378">And one was occupied by my parents. </sentence><sentence id="379">One was occupied by we rented out one and the other one was my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="380">And my grandmother and my grandfather had a beautiful room and we enjoyed going in there and talking to them. </sentence><sentence id="381">Oh let me tell you something else that happened. </sentence><sentence id="382">When I was about six years old, I think it was something like that. </sentence><sentence id="383">We had Passover and my father always wore the white kitle and he was a very, he came from a very orthodox family. </sentence><sentence id="384">So he wore the white kitle like I said and my grandfather who had a stroke couldn't get up. </sentence><sentence id="385">So he sat there and asked the children. </sentence><sentence id="386">Of course it was us children, so they were still kind of tiny and they were just sitting and like in a little not a playpen exactly but something where they could contain them because they were just crawling around at that point. </sentence><sentence id="387">And all of a sudden I said you know dad, you look like a beggar. </sentence><sentence id="388">Oh, my dad got so upset at me. </sentence><sentence id="389">How dare I say you look like a beggar and my grandfather, my father was so upset at me, my grandfather being he couldn't speak very well, start in his own way yelling. </sentence><sentence id="390">Well the women all were in the kitchen trying to bring the food out. </sentence><sentence id="391">When they heard my father yelling and my grandfather trying to yell and me crying they dumped all the dishes on the kitchen floor. </sentence><sentence id="392">That was my mother, my aunt and my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="393">They came running. </sentence><sentence id="394">What in the world happened. </sentence><sentence id="395">And when we told them what happened, well it wasn't a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="396">But to me it was horrible that my dad would get so upset that I said that. </sentence><sentence id="397">Our neighborhood where I lived was mostly Catholic or Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="398">I think it was more like Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="399">So the girlfriends that I had in our very immediate neighborhood were all Christian kids. </sentence><sentence id="400">So but they never made a difference between my being Jewish and themselves. </sentence><sentence id="401">And they would call us and say come on and play with me. </sentence><sentence id="402">And I would go out and play with them. </sentence><sentence id="403">And until they very day that we left, I never knew that they would even, have a difference. </sentence><sentence id="404">So to me I was accepted as their equal. </sentence><sentence id="405">There was no discrimination. </sentence><sentence id="406">The schooling had to be in, I had to go to a Jewish school because I guess maybe the others wouldn't accept us. </sentence><sentence id="407">I really don't Interview with Margie Rosenthal 10 know why. </sentence><sentence id="408">But I started the first grade and went all the way up to fifth. </sentence><sentence id="409">Like I said before. </sentence><sentence id="410">And that's the only way there was. </sentence><sentence id="411">But one of the memories I have that also that I loved to dance. </sentence><sentence id="412">And do gymnastics. </sentence><sentence id="413">So at a very early age, my mother enrolled me into a school for gymnastics and I wanted to become a gymnastics teacher. </sentence><sentence id="414">Or a ballerina. </sentence><sentence id="415">Anything that had to do with dance or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="416">And I was pretty flexible and I enjoyed it very much. </sentence><sentence id="417">And then we would put on plays, like little dances and so forth and with that we would then entertain our congregation. </sentence><sentence id="418">Or we would go to the old age home and perform over there. </sentence><sentence id="419">It was really a lot of fun and my mother made sure I had the most beautiful costumes. </sentence><sentence id="420">One of the ones that I really remember is that I was a butterfly and my girlfriend was the flower. </sentence><sentence id="421">So I could dance around a lot. </sentence><sentence id="422">And we, these are just wonderful memories and I had also of course a lot of Jewish girlfriends, that is when school would let out. </sentence><sentence id="423">I would go over there and play with them and one of the girls hada bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="424">Well I didn't have one. </sentence><sentence id="425">So she would let me ride the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="426">Well the first time I got onto the bike, I headed right straight for the rose bushes. </sentence><sentence id="427">And I came out of there looking and a mess, scratched up from head to toe. </sentence><sentence id="428">You might say. </sentence><sentence id="429">But I didn't care because I had fun. </sentence><sentence id="430">It didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="431">I was learning how to ride the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="432">I did it the hard way perhaps but I got it. </sentence><sentence id="433">And let's see what else. </sentence><sentence id="434">The, one of my girlfriends Hannah Weissenberg, she was my very best friend. </sentence><sentence id="435">And she didn't live all that far away but not in our immediate area, so only time I could play with her was either right after school or when my mother would take me over there and pick me up because we just didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="436">And as I said before, there was another girl too that I only know now the last name, Richar, was her name. </sentence><sentence id="437">And they went to Israel as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="438">But I couldn't be very sure. </sentence><sentence id="439">People left you know, some had left already. </sentence><sentence id="440">The moment in 1935 they would leave and go. </sentence><sentence id="441">But my two girlfriends that I you know I had really close ties with they were in Germany as long as I was. </sentence><sentence id="442">Now there was another girlfriend that I had. </sentence><sentence id="443">Her father was very Interview with Margie Rosenthal 11 orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="444">Her name is Miana Shy. </sentence><sentence id="445">And she we found her again in the United States but that was a very strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="446">I didn't even know she would be here. </sentence><sentence id="447">So but let me go, get back to that later. </sentence><sentence id="448">While I was in school I learned English. </sentence><sentence id="449">However it was not the English that people in America talk or in the Philippines. </sentence><sentence id="450">It was Oxford English. </sentence><sentence id="451">The eithers and the neithers and the looking glass and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="452">Well when I left Germany and I went to another school, the kids all made fun of me. </sentence><sentence id="453">Because I didn't speak like any of them. </sentence><sentence id="454">And they would snicker and laugh and like ridicule me. </sentence><sentence id="455">And I felt really bad about that because that's the only English I did know. </sentence><sentence id="456">But anyway so in like, we can go back to the time we went and got the visa. </sentence><sentence id="457">My dad like I said kind of saw the writing on the wall and he said we're now leaving. </sentence><sentence id="458">So in Germany you hardly bought any dresses ready-made. </sentence><sentence id="459">Everything had to be made. </sentence><sentence id="460">By material and the dressmakers and the dressmakers were a few blocks away of course. </sentence><sentence id="461">And so my mother had started putting things into suitcase because she knew we had to leave in October and this was now around Rosh Hashanah. </sentence><sentence id="462">And during Rosh Hashanah somebody came in and told my parents you'd better get out now. </sentence><sentence id="463">They're going to be closing the border to France which is Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="464">So we rushed out of the temple, the middle of services, went home, started putting things into the suitcases and then we had to call the government official to put a seal on it. </sentence><sentence id="465">Once it was sealed you could not break the seal unless you were outside Germany. </sentence><sentence id="466">So I remember us rushing through and getting everything ready and which is what my parents did. </sentence><sentence id="467">Then the official came and then we had to leave with ten marks in our pocket. </sentence></p></dialogue>

fun. </sentence><sentence id="699">I mean I can't say that any of that was bad. </sentence><sentence id="700">But my grandmother spoiled me. </sentence><sentence id="701">I didn't like, like for example on Friday afternoons for midday was our big meal. </sentence><sentence id="702">And of course Shabbos was a big, big, big thing in our house so during the noon hours we would have like maybe rice and cinnamon or something, a very light meal. </sentence><sentence id="703">Well I didn't like that at all, so my grandmother would make me a soup, chicken soup and put some things in there so I

</sentence><sentence id="717">And none of the others did but I got it. </sentence><sentence id="718">So when I would go like during vacation, during say Easter vacation, Passover vacation, I would go to a girlfriend in Boyden, Germany. </sentence><sentence id="719">That was oh not that far away but it was far enough. </sentence><sentence id="720">For me every distance was far actually. </sentence><sentence id="721">And I would stay there for a few weeks and I would have to buy her always the same chocolates that she loved which was a coffee liquor filled chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="722">And she loved those so whenever I went to Boyden, I had a little money saved up. </sentence><sentence id="723">I would buy that for her so I could bring it back to her. </sentence><sentence id="724">And she appreciated it so much. </sentence><sentence id="725">Well, that's the least I could do for her goodness to me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="726">And,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: You said something at the beginning of the interview about things changing in the area where you lived in 1935 I think. </sentence><sentence id="782">As a child what filtered into your impressions of the changes that were happening and how did you see your parents dealing with it and your, I don't' know if you grandfather was dead then, but your grandmother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: My well it didn't really, really come to my attention. </sentence><sentence id="786">However, my mother and my sister and I would go to Katowice to visit my great, my grandparents in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="787">And one time when she went and then came back she got a letter that you have to come to the police station, that you were carrying contraband. </sentence><sentence id="788">And I said what in the world. </sentence><sentence id="789">I wouldn't carry anything that wasn't legal. </sentence><sentence id="790">And apparently they had found a sausage that my mother had brought from Poland to Germany and that too wasn't allowed. </sentence><sentence id="791">And so they had a, I mean we were scared that they would take her to a concentration camp or something, that you know going to really punish her and thank the, thanks be to God. </sentence><sentence id="792">Nothing really happened. </sentence><sentence id="793">She was able to explain that it was a gift from my in-laws and that it was just a gift and that she hadn't even bought it. </sentence><sentence id="794">With German money or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="795">And that she didn't' have any contraband. </sentence><sentence id="796">She had no money that belonged to Poland or anything. </sentence><sentence id="797">We knew better than that. </sentence><sentence id="798">So those are things that stuck in my mind that she was so upset and the whole family was upset when that happened. </sentence><sentence id="799">But my girlfriends, nobody we didn't we didn't really have that big a problem with the stores or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="800">it was just the government took my father to work in the ditches and my dad was coming home Interview with Margie Rosenthal 17 very, feeling not well. </sentence><sentence id="801">He was having pains. </sentence><sentence id="802">I guess kidney, already then problems. </sentence><sentence id="803">And for me, really nothing really, really happened that I could remember that was a difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: No I think they tried to shield us from all that. </sentence><sentence id="829">No, I, I don't' ever remember them saying much of anything and we still had our Jewish doctor that we went to. </sentence><sentence id="830">And until the time we left there was really no major problems. </sentence><sentence id="831">In fact one of my Christian girlfriends wanted to come to the depot the railway station and my parents said better not. </sentence><sentence id="832">That's how close we all were. </sentence><sentence id="833">Cause there was really, like I said, I myself did not feel it. </sentence><sentence id="834">And they kept it from us. </sentence><sentence id="835">They did not want to share because this was very disturbing and they didn't want to put us into that. </sentence><sentence id="836">My sister Eva, she was a very timid person. </sentence><sentence id="837">She was shy and but she loved to eat. </sentence><sentence id="838">Oh boy did she love to eat. </sentence><sentence id="839">And whenever we would go, we would go visiting people like friends of ours and they would put out the coffee and the cake. </sentence><sentence id="840">For the children special little goodies. </sentence><sentence id="841">She would say oh, she wouldn't ask right out you know. </sentence><sentence id="842">And before we left, my mother always gave us something to eat because she loved to eat. </sentence><sentence id="843">And I was a very poor eater as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="844">And my, my food was they had to put it on a chair with a little stool and they would put a lot of butter on it because I didn't, I wasn't eating enough as far as they were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="845">So I hate the butter. </sentence><sentence id="846">So they didn't', they didn't give me a knife or anything So they always knew where I sat because I would take the butter off on the edge of the plate. </sentence><sentence id="847">And I would go around like that. </sentence><sentence id="848">so that's why I guess maybe my grandmother was spoiling me a little bit With the squab and all that stuff, veal cutlets and because I was a very poor eater. </sentence><sentence id="849">Now not my sister. </sentence><sentence id="850">We would go to these people Interview with Margie Rosenthal 18 and she had the full tummy. </sentence><sentence id="851">And we would go there and she would just look at my mother and she said you know I haven't had that in a long time. </sentence><sentence id="852">And of course the people would feel so sorry for her and they would say oh poor Eva. </sentence><sentence id="853">Sure, help yourself, take something. </sentence><sentence id="854">It was so embarrassing for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="855">She would get so red in the face. </sentence><sentence id="856">She would say like I don't feed her anything, but it wasn't true at all. </sentence><sentence id="857">She just had a very good appetite. </sentence><sentence id="858">And I was, going back to when I was saying, playing house with them you know. </sentence><sentence id="859">My little cousin I told you is this little devious person. </sentence><sentence id="860">I mean she was just, I mean she was always into things. </sentence><sentence id="861">And all of a sudden my sister would start crying. </sentence><sentence id="862">I said why are you crying, Eva, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="863">Suzie. </sentence><sentence id="864">And I didn't see anything. </sentence><sentence id="865">She said but she did and my cousin was so sneaky, Suzie. </sentence><sentence id="866">She was so sneaky, she would either drop something on the ground on the floor or pretend that she's picking it up. </sentence><sentence id="867">At the same time she's pinching my foot or leg or something on my sister or behind my back. </sentence><sentence id="868">I think it was really something. </sentence><sentence id="869">Keeping those two apart was a major, major problem. </sentence><sentence id="870">When I walked with them, I had to keep one on the left and one on the right, I mean at arm's length. </sentence><sentence id="871">I couldn't even bring them together. </sentence><sentence id="872">But like I said my sister followed me everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="873">Well one time we were a bunch of kids were playing. </sentence><sentence id="874">Down in the we had meadows, very pretty meadows near, nearby and oh like across the street and we lived in the newer portion of Gleiwitz. </sentence><sentence id="875">It was a lovely place. </sentence><sentence id="876">And we stepped outside and then there was this big meadow on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="877">Beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="878">So kids are you know they take, I learned how to throw knife. </sentence><sentence id="879">Pocket knife. </sentence><sentence id="880">That's a boys" game but I played with everybody. </sentence><sentence id="881">Wasn't just girls, it was boys too. </sentence><sentence id="882">I was only maybe ten years old at that time. </sentence><sentence id="883">So I said to Eva I said why don't' you run and get me a knife so I can play also. </sentence><sentence id="884">So she runs up the hill and she comes back. </sentence><sentence id="885">While she's running down, she falls and she cuts herself. </sentence><sentence id="886">Oh my goodness. </sentence><sentence id="887">Here she is bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="888">| think that she's dying because she's crying like you know there's no tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="889">And of course again I had to take her home and again my Interview with Margie Rosenthal 19 grandmother said not her. </sentence><sentence id="890">I mean we should have covered in something so she wouldn't fall because she was carrying it and running. </sentence><sentence id="891">But she was trying to do me a favor, the, my little sister so like I said it was of her I was in trouble more than for my own sake. </sentence><sentence id="892">But hey, that's all right. </sentence><sentence id="893">I mean she was five years younger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="894">I mean after all I was a big sister you know. </sentence><sentence id="895">I had to really do whatever I was supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="896">But sometimes I'd forget it and did what I, what any young kid would do. </sentence><sentence id="897">But it matured me. </sentence><sentence id="898">I'd say that much it did. </sentence><sentence id="899">And where, I don't know now where. </sentence></p></dialogue>

to put down like $500. </sentence><sentence id="1132">That was a lot of money in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And that should see us through whatever comes in the next year or so that we would not be a burden to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1134">No other government. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And with that we were able to get the visa to go to the Philippines. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And that was how we finally got that and then we left on a train and went over Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And my mother started to cry and I thought you know that she's just upset because she left her family there. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And which was very traumatic for her. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Because her sister and her were just very close. </sentence><sentence id="1140">They were just a couple of years apart. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And so and my grandmother of course. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So then we got past the as we get to Strasbourg, the German government, the officials come up and they said let's open your suitcases. </sentence><sentence id="1143">We want to see what you have in there and so my mother opened up the suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="1144">They broke the seal rather and then she opened up and they kind of went through it. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And then they said everything is ok and close up again and go on. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And this was the same train that left our home, town of Gleiwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1147">It was going all the way to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Well after we passed into France my mother was very hysterical by this time. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So I asked her, I said if you're missing your sister so much, I can be your sister. </sentence><sentence id="1150">I'm old enough. </sentence><sentence id="1151">I'm 11 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And that Interview with Margie Rosenthal 23 made her cry even more. </sentence><sentence id="1153">But then she told me that while they were sealing and she had forgotten to take the money out for the dresses. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And those German marks in the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And if they had caught her, she would have been in jail and they would have thrown away the key. </sentence><sentence id="1156">I mean that was going against every, everything so they just the customs was very strict in those days anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Especially the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Only let you take ten marks. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Well we're supposed to live with ten marks, that's 40 marks the four of us for this was in the early part of September and our ship didn't leave until about, I think almost like three weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So we went, the first time we came into Paris when we got to Paris, the cab driver took us, we said yes take us to a hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1161">He drove around and around and around. </sentence><sentence id="1162">That was number one. </sentence><sentence id="1163">Charged an exorbitant amount. </sentence><sentence id="1164">Then he took us to this hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1165">It was $50, dollars, 50 marks, whatever the currency to francs a day. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Well that depleted the money that we were able to take from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Thank god for the few dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Well pretty soon that money ran out too. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And we had to eat and of course we only stayed in the hotel one day. </sentence><sentence id="1170">We went to another building that about 3 or 4 stories up. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And they didn't even have a toilet up there. </sentence><sentence id="1172">All you had to do in France. </sentence><sentence id="1173">On each floor they had one, one of those things where you kind of squat on a hole. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And the only toilet we had was on the ground floor. </sentence><sentence id="1175">Well we had never seen anything like this or had even been close to something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1176">So it was, that part was really very traumatic for us. </sentence><sentence id="1177">How, not to have a toilet. </sentence><sentence id="1178">I mean that was unheard of in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1179">Anyway so here we were now without money. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And we didn't want to be burdened with the Jewish HIAS or whoever Joint, whoever was there. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So my mother somehow made mention in a letter to my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="1182">So she said go to this insane asylum. </sentence><sentence id="1183">There is the son of a friend of mine which, the mother always sends money to him. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And he will give you the money and I in turn will give her the money in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And that's what we did but let me tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Going to the insane asylum was a horrible feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1187">All these people that were Interview with Margie Rosenthal 24 either crying or singing and pretending to holding a baby and some came up to us and pulling us and didn't' want us to go and it was just that part was really very bothersome. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Then we talked to the man. </sentence><sentence id="1189">He sounded as normal as anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1190">As you and I. well the reason he was in the insane asylum was because he had taken a dip in the river Seine and he was naked. </sentence><sentence id="1191">It was evening and he didn't think anybody would see him. </sentence><sentence id="1192">Well lo and behold, they got him and they said anybody that does that has to go to the insane asylum. </sentence><sentence id="1193">So that was where we got our money. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And then we were in Paris for about ten days I would say. </sentence><sentence id="1195">And but we didn't go and eat all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1196">I mean there was no way for us to go and eat. </sentence><sentence id="1197">We couldn't afford it. </sentence><sentence id="1198">so we'd buy the bread and get some cheese and we'd eat upstairs in the room or whatever we rented. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1390">Well we come across this beggar on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1391">My sister turns around, runs back up onto board. </sentence><sentence id="1392">We didn't know why she was

very soft hearted person. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Anyway so on board ship we met a lot of other refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Like I said Margot Kassel was my sister's age and Bi, Biata Zuskind she was a younger, she was about maybe three years old at that time, two or three years old. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And things were pretty good but I don't like, I didn't know any French food. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And for me to start eating French food when I'm used to the regular kosher German kitchen, you know was quite a change. </sentence><sentence id="1407">So I said and I did say something to my dad. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I don't remember exactly what, but he said my reply was well I'm going to write to my grandmother because she will have to know how I am treated on here. </sentence><sentence id="1409">You are treating me not well at all. </sentence><sentence id="1410">I told my dad. </sentence><sentence id="1411">Uh oh. </sentence><sentence id="1412">That was the wrong thing to say, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1413">So he said you Interview with Margie Rosenthal 29 just dare do that. </sentence><sentence id="1414">Make a heart more heavy than she already has. </sentence><sentence id="1415">I mean the poor woman has just lost a daughter, her granddaughter, granddaughters and now you want to write a letter and tell her how miserable things are here. </sentence><sentence id="1416">You better not. </sentence><sentence id="1417">Well he was right. </sentence><sentence id="1418">Of course, I didn't but needless to say I would never have hurt my grandmother in any, any kind of a way. </sentence><sentence id="1419">so I had to adjust to the food. </sentence><sentence id="1420">But you know I missed my tomatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Oh I love tomatoes and pickles and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So there was one gentleman that was in the, working in the kitchen and I mentioned it to him. </sentence><sentence id="1423">They all spoke some German. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And I told him that I really missed having a fresh tomato. </sentence><sentence id="1425">Guess what. </sentence><sentence id="1426">At dinner he brought me a fresh tomato. </sentence><sentence id="1427">That was the best meal I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And every meal we had wine as well but of course children never drank the wine but the food was so different than what I had known that it took quite an adjustment and then we went from Port Said, we went over to Porti. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Oh, Suez Canal. </sentence><sentence id="1430">Let me not forget the Suez Canal which was a very exciting experience. </sentence><sentence id="1431">You could see across the bank and you could see buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1432">I mean buildings, I would say more like pyramids. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And you see the Arabs and I mean it was so close. </sentence><sentence id="1434">It was just a very thrilling experience and dad said you'd better remember this very well. </sentence><sentence id="1435">This may be your last time you're going to go through Suez Canal. </sentence><sentence id="1436">This is something that is very, very important for you to know. </sentence><sentence id="1437">So we really stayed on board and looked at everything. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And then we came to Djibouti and somebody wanted to buy my sister from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1439">They said oh she is so cute. </sentence><sentence id="1440">My sister had blond hair, blue eyes and curly hair. </sentence><sentence id="1441">I mean she was very adorable. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And they, the woman wouldn't give up. </sentence><sentence id="1443">She wanted to buy my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1444">My sister said no, she's not for sale. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And then so then we were afraid that she was going to take her so we were always around her. </sentence><sentence id="1446">I mean it was like until we left, you know we had to watch her every second because we really thought that she might kidnap her or something. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And then we went to Singapore. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Singapore was just beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1449">It was absolutely lovely. </sentence><sentence id="1450">But hot. </sentence><sentence id="1451">It was so hot Interview with Margie Rosenthal 30 and we just came from Germany and we are in autumn already in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And we come over there and it was, I mean we were not used to the heat. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="1454">But anyway we did take a walk and strolled in a little bit on the pier and then it was too much. </sentence><sentence id="1455">And we had to turn back to the ship. </sentence><sentence id="1456">So we never really got to see Singapore. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And then from there my next recollection was getting to Saigon. </sentence><sentence id="1458">Now Saigon my dad bought himself a beautiful one of those tropical helmet type things and he looked really chic and he wore that on deck all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1459">But in Saigon we stayed there two days. </sentence><sentence id="1460">We had French legionnaires on board. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And these poor guys didn't have wine or anything so the men at our table took the wine from our table and took it over there to these guys. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And they were so happy to have something that like wine for the French. </sentence><sentence id="1463">You know how that, it is. </sentence><sentence id="1464">So they were so happy. </sentence><sentence id="1465">But before I even get that far. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Let me say something else. </sentence><sentence id="1467">For days, there were, the people, the officers on the ship said "Keep an eye on the back of the ship. </sentence><sentence id="1468">We have a line out. </sentence><sentence id="1469">We hope to catch a whale." </sentence><sentence id="1470">Oh boy. </sentence><sentence id="1471">With us kids, we were always checking the line that was hanging out of the back of the ship. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And we'd see it trailing you know. </sentence><sentence id="1473">But nothing is happening, nothing is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1474">One day finally there was a big thing, intercom and attention, attention. </sentence><sentence id="1475">We caught whale. </sentence><sentence id="1476">I want most, everybody on board, children first. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Let them see the whale. </sentence><sentence id="1478">Before we cut the whale open. </sentence><sentence id="1479">So oh boy. </sentence><sentence id="1480">I mean we were in the lounge as a matter of fact, in the ladies lounge, washing our hands and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1481">And we run upstairs to the deck where the line was. </sentence><sentence id="1482">And there was this long fish, dripping water still, black fish, very impressive, big huge thing. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And they said well now all the girls, all the kids are here. </sentence><sentence id="1484">There weren't that many children on board because this was a luxury liner really and was dropping off the legionnaires to Saigon. </sentence><sentence id="1485">And so it was very, very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="1486">So we all rushed up there and were standing with bated breath. </sentence><sentence id="1487">Now they're going to cut the fish open, going to see what's inside the fish. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And the captain come out and has this big knife and he cuts it open. </sentence><sentence id="1489">And you know what Interview with Margie Rosenthal 31 falls out. </sentence><sentence id="1490">Candies. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Oh it was, we had crossed I guess the dateline. </sentence><sentence id="1492">I am not sure what exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1493">But it was so thrilling. </sentence><sentence id="1494">All these candies fell out and they were green and different colors, mainly green that represent the eggs I guess in the whale or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1495">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1496">But it was so funny. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And, oh he said take all the candy you want. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Of course, we kids, candy. </sentence><sentence id="1499">We all grabbed hands full and then of course there were other passengers took it too. </sentence><sentence id="1500">So this is one of my very memorable experiences we had on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="1501">Other than that I mean that was really nothing much happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1618">Q: I think you had told me that your parents had pre-paid for the entire trip while you were still in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1619">It was a kind of package. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Why don't you tell me a little bit about that and how if you know anything, how they knew how to go about doing that. </sentence><sentence id="1621">And another question was how many immigrants and refugees there were on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="1622">From other countries besides France and doing something similar to what you were doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1628">A: No the only people were from Germany and they were the only refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1629">And like I said there was only this one young family. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And this one family with the daughter Margot and the one with Zuskind. </sentence><sentence id="1631">That was the other one. </sentence><sentence id="1632">That I believe was all there was on the ship, as far as Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1633">And the other ones, I don't, there were French people going to Singapore, Saigon, really not a whole lot of people but we only knew about ours. </sentence><sentence id="1634">And I did not mention this but the men slept separately from the women. </sentence><sentence id="1635">So we had in our cabin was this young woman that was just married, my mother and my sister and I, four of us. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And in dad's cabin there were also four men. </sentence><sentence id="1637">So they had for some reason, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1638">I guess they didn't have the facilities to accommodate us because we were the refugees but we did pay for the passage already in Interview with Margie Rosenthal 32 Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1639">And I believe the HIAS was helping us. </sentence><sentence id="1640">But I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1641">I never did question them how, when and where and what. </sentence><sentence id="1642">All I know is that we had the money that we had to put down in Breslau to the American consulate and vouch that we would never be a burden to any government. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1659">Q: Also I wanted to ask you, did you have a German passport. </sentence><sentence id="1660">Do you remember that? </sentence><sentence id="1661">When you left Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1665">A: We did and it all over Juden ok. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And by that time we were stateless. </sentence><sentence id="1667">We did not have any more a home, so we were considered stateless. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And in Singapore, my sister and were always on deck looking around and you know kids, there was nothing more for us to do really. </sentence><sentence id="1669">There were no movies. </sentence><sentence id="1670">If there were, they would have been in French. </sentence><sentence id="1671">We would never have understood anyways, so us children kind of had to devise our own games and talk and do things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1672">So I was looking into the hold of the ship, I see that our box that we had our furniture in, our furniture. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I would say like bicycle and soap that my mother was bringing along and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1674">Oh, the few goblets of crystal. </sentence><sentence id="1675">I mean painstakingly wrapped. </sentence><sentence id="1676">It was a big wooden box, they called them lifts in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1677">And that had broken open. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And with all of those natives there, I was so afraid they were going to take it all and we wouldn't have anything left when we got to the Philippines. </sentence><sentence id="1679">So I told my sister, I said you watch while I go run and find dad so he can get ahold of the captain to make sure that they get it covered up again. </sentence><sentence id="1680">Or nail it together, whatever it takes. </sentence><sentence id="1681">Cause I don't' want to lose all our stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1682">So she was standing on top there looking down. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And I found my father pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="1684">And I said come quick, come quick. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Look what's happened. </sentence><sentence id="1686">So he ran and got the captain and they went down in the hold and they were </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1687"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 33 able to get our stuff together. </sentence><sentence id="1688">But that is how we reached the Philippines. </sentence><sentence id="1689">The soap had spilled out onto the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1690">The bicycle had rusted away. </sentence><sentence id="1691">So by that time we really didn't have a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1692">We didn't' have much of soap. </sentence><sentence id="1693">I mean a lot of stuff was ruined regardless you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1694">But anyways so that was in Saigon. </sentence><sentence id="1695">And on the way from Saigon to Hong Kong came the typhoon. </sentence><sentence id="1696">Everybody was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Everybody was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1698">We couldn't go to the dining room. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And oh my dad's hat flew away that he just so painstakingly bought in Saigon. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Went overboard and it was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1701">He was more upset about that than I think anything else because it was such a nice helmet type thing that they wore in the Orient you know. </sentence><sentence id="1702">Anyway so we were too sick to eat. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1703">But my dad was at the table, eating. </sentence><sentence id="1704">I mean we could never understand how could you eat. </sentence><sentence id="1705">We were so sick that the doctor had to give us medications because we couldn't hold food down and we couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1706">I mean it was horrible and I mean, all the passengers were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1707">Except my dad and this young guy that had just gotten married. </sentence><sentence id="1708">The two of them had the whole dining room to themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And they had all the food they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1710">And they had to put the plates into containers which were bolted to the tables. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Otherwise they would be sliding this way and sliding that way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1712">But we finally made it into Kowloon which is Hong Kong China. </sentence><sentence id="1713">But we had to stay in Kowloon because that's where the ship docked. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Now we needed shots in Kowloon because we didn't get the malaria and, and that, whatever the tropical diseases were. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So we had to go to this Chinese doctor who had an office in this building. </sentence><sentence id="1716">The staircase was so narrow and so dark that we could hardly see where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="1717">Well my imagination was oh my god he's going to abduct us and we're not going to go get anywhere and we're going to be sold as slaves or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Like I said I had a very vivid imagination. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And we made it up the stairs. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Got our shots, came back down and we were all kind of (sniffs) like this you know. </sentence><sentence id="1721">We were kind of crying cause it was hurting. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And my dad said all right, I had a, I couldn't take my big doll from </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1723"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 34 Germany but I was able to take the smaller version. </sentence><sentence id="1724">And I loved that doll. </sentence><sentence id="1725">Of course I had to name her Suzie also, naturally because I left my Suzie one in Germany so this was also Suzie. </sentence><sentence id="1726">So he said how about we buy Suzie a dress. </sentence><sentence id="1727">Well that was a big deal so I went with him to, with my parents into this beautiful store that had all embroidered things. </sentence><sentence id="1728">And I said I showed them the doll and they said we've got the thing for you. </sentence><sentence id="1729">They gave me this beautiful dress for my doll. </sentence><sentence id="1730">Oh it was absolutely gorgeous. </sentence><sentence id="1731">All kinds of embroidery and all it was so pretty. </sentence><sentence id="1732">So now I had a dress. </sentence><sentence id="1733">And we stayed in a very pretty hotel in Hong Kong and the food, I guess I had gotten used to eating almost anything because if you're hungry you'll have to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1734">And so I did eat French. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1735">Now I was going to experience Chinese food. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Which was again something different, but noodles I liked so that was ok. </sentence><sentence id="1737">We ate a lot of noodles. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And we did take a trip also over to Hong Kong which is by ferry boat which was kind of exciting for us as well. </sentence><sentence id="1739">So we were a few days in, I can't remember exactly the how many days we were in Hong Kong. </sentence><sentence id="1740">But then we were on our way to the Philippines on a not with a passenger ship which I thought we would have. </sentence><sentence id="1741">No. </sentence><sentence id="1742">We had to leave the ship and go on a freighter, a small freighter and there we were all in one cabin together. </sentence><sentence id="1743">But my dad always liked to have the round window, the portholes opened because he liked it. </sentence><sentence id="1744">So while dad was there and he had his mouth open one of us kids, I guess probably it was me, took a raisin and threw it in his mouth and he thought it was a fly. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And he started coughing and screaming and yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1746">I swallowed a fly, I swallowed a fly. </sentence><sentence id="1747">But then we laughed and he says what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1748">What did you guys do. </sentence><sentence id="1749">And you know how kids do pranks like that. </sentence><sentence id="1750">So we told him, it was only a raisin. </sentence><sentence id="1751">Well the next day he was sleeping again, the window open again. </sentence><sentence id="1752">This time a big wave came and he thought we're drowning. </sentence><sentence id="1753">He's screaming we're drowning, we're drowning. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Why don't we all jump. </sentence><sentence id="1755">You know he thought for sure we were drowning. </sentence><sentence id="1756">As it was, a wave had come into the cabin on top of him. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And all he </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1758"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 35 could he was breathing. </sentence><sentence id="1759">I mean he had been sleeping and all of a sudden he was like d, you know being drenched with this ocean water. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And so that was another experience that we won't forget, because he thought for sure we were drowning. </sentence><sentence id="1761">Well anyway we make it finally to Manila and we </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1762">Q: How long did the trip take all together? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1763">A: Hmm. </sentence><sentence id="1764">Mmm. </sentence><sentence id="1765">Ok we left Marseilles around the, I would say the 16" yeah, 16" of October and we did not get the, between all that, we did not get to Manila til the 16", no, 14 of November. </sentence><sentence id="1766">I did forget to mention something and now it came at just now I had a loss of memory again but itll get back to me, ok. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And we were met at the docks by the Jewish committee and they took us to a hotel in the walled city. </sentence><sentence id="1768">The walled city is called Intramuros and that is a very old. </sentence><sentence id="1769">That was because of the Spaniards and the Spanish were occupying Manila. </sentence><sentence id="1770">That was a fortress and so this time you know it was very exciting to be living in something like that and, but they warned us don't leave any food out. </sentence><sentence id="1771">Because of the rats that go around these old buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1772">Oh my gosh. </sentence><sentence id="1773">Now we are afraid of rats as well. </sentence><sentence id="1774">I mean I love animals, but I don't' think I'd like rats. </sentence><sentence id="1775">So we would take food upstairs but have to wrap it in linen napkin, very well. </sentence><sentence id="1776">And they still got to it. </sentence><sentence id="1777">So we still all the food we brought upstairs was eaten you know nibbled on during the night by these stupid rats. </sentence><sentence id="1778">And we only stayed there like 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="1779">And then the Jewish committee said we'll give, tell you where you can go and rent something. </sentence><sentence id="1780">So we rented the upstairs of a house. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Downstairs was a Filipino dentist. </sentence><sentence id="1782">And upstairs was for us refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1783">My parents, other people I don't even remember their names very well but every room was occupied by a different family. </sentence><sentence id="1784">And one, then we had a single bachelor and he had to sleep outside on the sofa because we just Interview with Margie Rosenthal 36 ran out of room. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And this man gets up the next morning and he says he yelled at us. </sentence><sentence id="1786">He says you kids are playing tricks on me again. </sentence><sentence id="1787">Apparently somebody played a trick on him on one of the ships where he came from. </sentence><sentence id="1788">And we don't know which ship he came on because there were quite a few refugees at that time, already. </sentence><sentence id="1789">Anyhow so he accused us of taking his pants and hiding them. </sentence><sentence id="1790">Well we didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1791">so everybody started looking for his pants because he said, how I can't even get out of bed you know. </sentence><sentence id="1792">So finally somebody looked down. </sentence><sentence id="1793">All the windows in the Philippines had bars by the way because a lot of robberies took place. </sentence><sentence id="1794">So we looked down and sure enough on the ground were his pants. </sentence><sentence id="1795">And so we kids went and got them. </sentence><sentence id="1796">And how in the world did they do that. </sentence><sentence id="1797">We asked the dentist downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="1798">Oh he said easy. </sentence><sentence id="1799">They are on a tree, which is a ways away but same level as your upstairs, up, apartment is and he said they just take a fishhook, fish line, hook the pants bring them out, take the money and leave the pants. </sentence><sentence id="1800">That's exactly what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1801">They took all of his money. </sentence><sentence id="1802">They took his papers and everything else but they left his pants. </sentence><sentence id="1803">So that was our one experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1846">Q: You had mentioned being excited about going to the jungle. </sentence><sentence id="1847">And I was wondering what your earliest impressions were of what the Philippines were like compared to what you had been thinking it was going to be like and how it compared to your experience in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1850">A: A far cry from Germany, a very far cry. </sentence><sentence id="1851">There were palm trees, all right with coconuts on them. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And the Filipinos would climb up the tree and throw down the coconuts for us. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And we could crack them open, but first they had a green hull around them which had to be stripped, but they all carried knives, bolos, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1854">And so like hatchet, big hatchet things. </sentence><sentence id="1855">Oh very vicious looking deals. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And that's what they used to do. </sentence><sentence id="1857">But I could not see any jungle. </sentence><sentence id="1858">I mean these were Interview with Margie Rosenthal 37 paved streets. </sentence><sentence id="1859">These were houses. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And I thought well maybe when we move further in, you know away from the city area, I might find the jungle. </sentence><sentence id="1861">Well it didn't quite happen that way. </sentence><sentence id="1862">We only stayed in there one month because that was no place for us, when they can hook something and take things out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1863">That was not for us. </sentence><sentence id="1864">So then again we have asked the Jewish committee, where we could go and where we could live. </sentence><sentence id="1865">So they said well there is a house. </sentence><sentence id="1866">I'll show you but you have to share it with another family. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Well no problem, I mean, that's fine. </sentence><sentence id="1868">So we met the Kostenits family, a husband, wife and one daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1869">The daughter was just a couple of years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1870">And so that was a beautiful complex. </sentence><sentence id="1871">It was, it belonged to I think a mayor, Resal. </sentence><sentence id="1872">His last name was Resal. </sentence><sentence id="1873">I don't remember his first name. </sentence><sentence id="1874">But there are a lot of Resals over there. </sentence><sentence id="1875">There are lot, it's a very popular name. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And this house was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1877">It had, downstairs was a hall. </sentence><sentence id="1878">Cause it was like a dance hall. </sentence><sentence id="1879">Oh it was huge. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And then you went up the stairs and upstairs were the living quarters -- the kitchen, three bedrooms. </sentence><sentence id="1881">One was occupied by my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1882">One was occupied by the girl, Eva. </sentence><sentence id="1883">Kostenits parents. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And the other room was for us three girls. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And it also had a very long veranda out front. </sentence><sentence id="1886">The length of the house. </sentence><sentence id="1887">Of course, also it had bars. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Downstairs, upstairs and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1889">The only bar that wasn't on was in the kitchen because they felt I guess there wasn't much to steal in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1890">So anyway so we moved in with what we had, not a whole lot because like I said the bicycle was already ruined from the ocean water and everything else so I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1891">My dad wasn't able to clean it up. </sentence><sentence id="1892">There was just no way of rescuing it. </sentence><sentence id="1893">My mother's soap became like soap suds. </sentence><sentence id="1894">There was hardly anything left of that. </sentence><sentence id="1895">But we did have a few clothes that we had brought along and we were able to use them. </sentence><sentence id="1896">But since we knew that this was going to be temporary because it was for two people, we wanted something for ourselves and they wanted something for themselves as well. </sentence><sentence id="1897">But what happened is which made us move even faster, was we were sleeping one night Interview with Margie Rosenthal 38 and I was awoken by a man putting his arms around my neck and putting his face next to me. </sentence><sentence id="1898">And I woke up and I yelled. </sentence><sentence id="1899">A boy wants to kiss me. </sentence><sentence id="1900">I like I said my imagination, I have very vivid imagination. </sentence><sentence id="1901">At this time, by that time I was 12 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1902">My birthday was in July and you know time passes on. </sentence><sentence id="1903">so this was July and I was 12. </sentence><sentence id="1904">And but back to this robber. </sentence><sentence id="1905">He was taking a check on what I was wearing and he had been already to somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1906">I don't remember now. </sentence><sentence id="1907">It was my sister or the other gal. </sentence><sentence id="1908">both were named Eva so I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And so this lady next door in the bedroom said oh go to sleep you had a, you had a dream. </sentence><sentence id="1910">You just, go back to sleep, go back to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1911">I said no he's creeping out now. </sentence><sentence id="1912">He's leaving. </sentence><sentence id="1913">He's leaving. </sentence><sentence id="1914">Catch him, somebody stop him. </sentence><sentence id="1915">You know. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And so my parents, by my voice could tell immediately that something was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1917">So my mom got up and of course she saw the window to the kitchen wide open. </sentence><sentence id="1918">The door to the, from the kitchen going down was wide open, things scattered all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And my dad had a very bad habit, of taking his rings off at night. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Wedding ring and all. </sentence><sentence id="1921">Well that was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1922">The wedding ring was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1923">The watch was gone and that he was very upset about. </sentence><sentence id="1924">And then we had some eau de cologne that we had brought from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1925">It had a gold cap on it, sort of gold metal thing. </sentence><sentence id="1926">They took that. </sentence><sentence id="1927">They thought that was the real thing. </sentence><sentence id="1928">So what over a period of time, I mean this is how we lost some things. </sentence><sentence id="1929">You know robberies. </sentence><sentence id="1930">So he took quite a few things with him. </sentence><sentence id="1931">He took we had brought coral necklaces, my sister and I. Those he took. </sentence><sentence id="1932">Oh a few odds and ends, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="1933">At this time I don't' even remember what all the man did take, but he was so deft at it that he had gone to this one, and nobody, he was in my parents" room and they didn't even feel his presence or hear him or that is so very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1934">If he hadn't touched me I might not have woke up. </sentence><sentence id="1935">But he made the mistake of touching me. </sentence><sentence id="1936">With that I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="1937">And they said had he had I worn earrings he would have probably been able to take them out. </sentence><sentence id="1938">I would not have felt it. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And the necklace the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1940">He, they do it in one, one Interview with Margie Rosenthal 39 grab, feeling for necklace and earrings. </sentence><sentence id="1941">And being I'm a light sleeper, that he was able to take it. </sentence><sentence id="1942">Not, I mean not get to it. </sentence><sentence id="1943">Then we called, I guess I didn't call, we didn't call the police. </sentence><sentence id="1944">We had no phone of course. </sentence><sentence id="1945">Somebody heard us and commotion and so the people next door that lived there came over and asked what went on and we told them. </sentence><sentence id="1946">And so I see this Filipino man coming up the stairs and I'm yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1947">I said "that's him, that's him". </sentence><sentence id="1948">At night it you know this is night time we're talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1949">He had on white t-shirt and white shorts. </sentence><sentence id="1950">So did this man that was creeping out of the room that had touched me and he too had. </sentence><sentence id="1951">So I said "that's him, that's him". </sentence><sentence id="1952">And they kept saying "no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1953">No, he's our houseboy." </sentence><sentence id="1954">I said "that's the man, I saw him." </sentence><sentence id="1955">But of course it wasn't him. </sentence><sentence id="1956">But I was so hysterical at that point that, and then of course I was afraid to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1957">They had to look under the beds, they had to look everywhere before I would even go to bed. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I mean I was just so afraid of everything. </sentence><sentence id="1959">By then and to this day, I am still. </sentence><sentence id="1960">I mean this wasn't the only robbery. </sentence><sentence id="1961">I'll get to that later. </sentence><sentence id="1962">But to this very day I don't trust anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1963">When I had a dog in America, I was fine. </sentence><sentence id="1964">We lost our dog. </sentence><sentence id="1965">Now I have ADT which is a security system installed. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And my husband can't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="1967">He's from Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1968">But me, I am from the Philippines. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And we had so many robberies that I am paranoid about things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Anyway, so that was one of the experiences with the robbery. </sentence><sentence id="1971">The very first one. </sentence><sentence id="1972">Then these people moved out and they moved across to the next house. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And then we took another family in because nobody could afford to pay that kind of rent and my dad still didn't have a job. </sentence><sentence id="1974">So they kept saying "you'll find one. </sentence><sentence id="1975">Don't worry, you'll find one." </sentence><sentence id="1976">But I went, enrolled as we had to go to school of course. </sentence><sentence id="1977">I mean we can't do without school. </sentence><sentence id="1978">So my parents enrolled us into a parochial school run by the German nuns. </sentence><sentence id="1979">They figured because German nuns would be helpful in learning, then we could learn to speak English better than we did. </sentence><sentence id="1980">So they put me into fourth grade and my sister was very young so she went into first grade. </sentence><sentence id="1981">Well, after a while they realized Interview with Margie Rosenthal 40 that I'm not, I'm too far ahead because I you know I had already been in the fifth grade in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1982">So they put me into fourth first and then they put me into fifth. </sentence><sentence id="1983">So that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1984">Into fourth grade first and then into the fifth. </sentence><sentence id="1985">Then before I knew it we were kicked out of school. </sentence><sentence id="1986">My mother was called. </sentence><sentence id="1987">Come to school. </sentence><sentence id="1988">We want to talk to all the parents were called one by one. </sentence><sentence id="1989">And the head, the Mother Superior said to my family, my mother, sorry you have to take your children out. </sentence><sentence id="1990">My mother said, why. </sentence><sentence id="1991">Well because you're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1992">My mother said because we're Jewish. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2152">A: We heard that the temples had been burned and that there was a big closings of the stores of the Jewish merchants and that must have come in over the radio to the operator on board ship. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And he passed it along to the refugees that were on board. </sentence><sentence id="2154">So we knew how close my dad had gotten to not even getting us out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2155">And that was a very fortunate thing for us that we made it out before all this took place. </sentence><sentence id="2156">Oh, they were arresting all the Jewish people but the men especially the men. </sentence><sentence id="2157">And taking them to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2158">And my uncle, my aunt Ruth's husband, Herbert Binger was one of the first that they took to the concentration camp, Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="2159">And he was there so that's how we had heard only through letters, that were in Manila by the time we reached Manila. </sentence><sentence id="2160">And I also forgot to mention the fact that when we got off the ship in Interview with Margie Rosenthal 41 Manila, there was a girl that had a cousin waiting on her at the pier or the docks in Manila. </sentence><sentence id="2161">And she said to her cousin, she said "Hey" she said ""who's that Chinese lady that, that Chinese girl that's there with you that came off the ship. </sentence><sentence id="2162">She is Chinese." </sentence><sentence id="2163">And my girlfriend said "Oh no, she's one of us." </sentence><sentence id="2164">And I was so devastated when I heard that, I had never forgotten that ever since. </sentence><sentence id="2165">It's been bothering me and I told her about that, the last day that we were here together at the reunion but I'm getting ahead of myself. </sentence><sentence id="2166">Now back to our moving around to the Santa Escolastica school and going to classes over there. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And the boy that had, we had to leave the school because this little boy that was in kindergarten, he apparently had either stomped on the picture of Jesus or spit on it or both. </sentence><sentence id="2168">I'm not exactly sure. </sentence><sentence id="2169">But the Mother Superior told my mother that she has to take us out of school because we cannot expect, she said "we cannot expect Jewish children to come and study at the Catholic school. </sentence><sentence id="2170">We wouldn't go to your school." </sentence><sentence id="2171">So my mother said "well we don't have a school. </sentence><sentence id="2172">There are just a handful of Jewish children here." </sentence><sentence id="2173">She said, "Well then it's time you opened one up." </sentence><sentence id="2174">And with that my mother was so upset that she said "yes, ok". </sentence><sentence id="2175">So all of the kids that were in that school. </sentence><sentence id="2176">There weren't all that many. </sentence><sentence id="2177">But there were a number of the refugees that were there and we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2178">But while I was in classes over there, the children all made fun of my English because my English was the Oxford English and if I said something like looking glass or either or neither, they just would laugh and that would really embarrass me. </sentence><sentence id="2179">And then another thing that happened is there are so many cats over there and somehow, I didn't know yet. </sentence><sentence id="2180">I learned later on that you had to be very careful where you stepped because if you stepped into some cat do, you would get that horrible smell on you and the whole class would smell badly. </sentence><sentence id="2181">And somebody would say "hm, I smell something horrible. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Margie, did you step into something." </sentence><sentence id="2183">And you know what, I really was the one that did it. </sentence><sentence id="2184">So they'd send me out of the class. </sentence><sentence id="2185">I had to clean my shoes off. </sentence><sentence id="2186">The Interview with Margie Rosenthal 42 bottom and wherever I stepped into it and then I could return to the class. </sentence><sentence id="2187">But I still had a few very ugly experiences over in Santa Escolastica. </sentence><sentence id="2188">So when they told us we had to leave I really wasn't all that sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2189">To me, that was kind of a new page in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2190">I was going on from this bad experience with the German sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2191">So we moved, this was Pasay where we were living in that big house and that where we shared with so many people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2234">Q: You weren't in Intramuros anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2235">Is Pasay a suburb of Manila. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2238">A: Yeah, by the way yeah, Pasay is a suburb of Manila. </sentence><sentence id="2239">And Pasay had also the Jewish committee. </sentence><sentence id="2240">I think they were located either very close to it or I'm not sure exactly where. </sentence><sentence id="2241">But they told my dad that he should use his money up first and not to worry about a job. </sentence><sentence id="2242">It'll come, it'll come and my dad said "yeah but I don't' want to use everything up. </sentence><sentence id="2243">We'll have nothing to live on anymore." </sentence><sentence id="2244">And they said "oh, it's all right. </sentence><sentence id="2245">You'll find work. </sentence><sentence id="2246">You'll find." </sentence><sentence id="2247">So it was over a year later that my dad finally did. </sentence><sentence id="2248">But not until we moved to Ermita. </sentence><sentence id="2249">But I do want to say one more thing what happened to me while we were living in Pasay. </sentence><sentence id="2250">We had this one lady that had a baby and her husband, they were living with us at that time in the big house. </sentence><sentence id="2251">And she asked my mother if I could go and get her some sanitary napkins. </sentence><sentence id="2252">So my mother said yeah she should go. </sentence><sentence id="2253">So she gave me some one and she said "why don't you go to the market, over" which was not all that far away. </sentence><sentence id="2254">And she said "go and get me a box of sanitary napkins". </sentence><sentence id="2255">And I went ahead and I was about 12 years old at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2256">And I went over there and I said "I want a box of sanitary napkins". </sentence><sentence id="2257">And this Chinese merchant said to me, he says do you know what they are. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And I says "Of course," I said "it's a napkin that you wipe your mouth with when you are done". </sentence><sentence id="2259">Well they all were laughing like crazy and I couldn't understand why they are laughing. </sentence><sentence id="2260">Interview with Margie Rosenthal 43 To me it was a very serious matter. </sentence><sentence id="2261">So when I went home I told my mother, I said "you know they were laughing but when I, they asked me if I knew what a sanitary napkin was and I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2262">All I said is well it's something that you have to use when you eat your lunch or dinner and you wipe your mouth and to be you know. </sentence><sentence id="2263">Etiquette, it reminds you to have a napkin. </sentence><sentence id="2264">And they roared, they absolutely roared." </sentence><sentence id="2265">And she said "oh my goodness". </sentence><sentence id="2266">She said you don't know really, do you?" </sentence><sentence id="2267">I said "what should I know". </sentence><sentence id="2268">And she said "Well that's when you get your period." </sentence><sentence id="2269">Well I was so embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="2270">From that moment on, when I had to go to the market I went across the street. </sentence><sentence id="2271">I passed them so I wouldn't have to look at them or go near them. </sentence><sentence id="2272">It was the most embarrassing moment of my life, I think at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2273">It was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="2274">Anyway, from like I said from Pasay we did finally move to Ermita because first of all there were no jobs to be had over where we were living in Pasay and there was a nice school with American nuns and I think really that was the main reason that my parents moved to Ermita. </sentence><sentence id="2275">There were many other suburbs they could have gone to, suburbs of Manila that they could have gone to. </sentence><sentence id="2276">But that so we went over to meet the sisters of Maryknoll. </sentence><sentence id="2277">And they were so wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2278">They opened their arms, took us in. </sentence><sentence id="2279">We had to pay which we did too at Santa Escolastica. </sentence><sentence id="2280">Nothing is for free. </sentence><sentence id="2281">We even had to buy uniforms at Santa Escolastica. </sentence><sentence id="2282">And now we had to buy uniforms again in Maryknoll, at or college. </sentence><sentence id="2283">But Maryknoll college uniform was very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="2284">It was a wine red full skirt with bib like. </sentence><sentence id="2285">And underneath you had a beige blouse, short sleeves and it had a wine red ribbon around the collar which was very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="2286">It was kind of a pleated top and down to the waist and then again pleat from the waist down. </sentence><sentence id="2287">And we really loved the sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2288">It was so wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2289">And being we were Jewish we were not required to take religious lessons as we had to do in Santa Escolastica. </sentence><sentence id="2290">We had to attend all the lessons, but over there they gave me the freedom. </sentence><sentence id="2291">If I wanted to, I could sit in the back of the class and just listen. </sentence><sentence id="2292">Well I thought that Interview with Margie Rosenthal 44 was very interesting for me was the history so I just sat there and listened to all the teachings of Jesus Christ and the parables and all the things that happened and saints and what have. </sentence><sentence id="2293">And then it came. </sentence><sentence id="2294">Oh before I go on, I was put into the sixth grade right then and there because I was in fifth grade at Santa Escolastica. </sentence><sentence id="2295">And they thought that I would fit very well into the sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="2296">So I was in the sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="2297">And they had a test, an examination at the end of the school year and they said would you like to take the examination on, on the religious part of it. </sentence><sentence id="2298">I said sure. </sentence><sentence id="2299">What have I to lose. </sentence><sentence id="2300">I mean after all you know I'm not supposed to be here but I'll take it. </sentence><sentence id="2301">And believe it or not I was on the honor roll, the second person on the honor, I did better than the Catholics did. </sentence><sentence id="2302">And the sisters told it all over the school. </sentence><sentence id="2303">Can you imagine. </sentence><sentence id="2304">We have a Jewish girl and she got a 98% whereas you kids don't even get anything. </sentence><sentence id="2305">You are barely passing. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And so I was really thrilled. </sentence><sentence id="2307">And then came the seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="2308">And again I was on the honor roll and again I was on the top in fact this time I was on the first on the honor roll. </sentence><sentence id="2309">I was number one which made me very happy. </sentence><sentence id="2310">And it pleased them immensely. </sentence><sentence id="2311">Then we graduated from the seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="2312">Well that is a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="2313">The archbishop has to come in and he has to bless the children and you had to have special uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2314">White dress and I, well my mother really couldn't afford to buy a white dress so one of the classmates of mine said oh her sister already graduated and I could fit into her dress. </sentence><sentence id="2315">And that's what happened and I had to go forward and kiss the ring. </sentence><sentence id="2316">I pretended to kiss it. </sentence><sentence id="2317">I didn't really kiss, I didn't think it was sanitary enough to kiss the ring, but I did and from then on I went to high school. </sentence><sentence id="2318">And in the first year of high school, I learned Latin and that was a very difficult language. </sentence><sentence id="2319">And then the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="2320">And that was the end of it for my school of that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2422">A: We had by that time, we had joined the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="2423">The Temple Emil and we had a wonderful person that was I think he wasn't really a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="2424">He was the father of Rebecca Konigsberg because her father was very well educated in the Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="2425">And he knew all the customs so he was leading the congregation there for a number of years. </sentence><sentence id="2426">And we went to Sunday School. </sentence><sentence id="2427">We took Hebrew lessons. </sentence><sentence id="2428">We, we learned a lot in that time. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And even through all the war years, we still were going to that temple until the very end of the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="2430">But let me not get ahead of it. </sentence><sentence id="2431">We moved to Ermita and we had to share again a lower flat like. </sentence><sentence id="2432">It had several bedrooms and we rented it in the beginning, we rented it to American businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="2433">Then they left. </sentence><sentence id="2434">Then we rented it to an American woman with a child and the man was in the military. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And then they were evacuated because they knew that something was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="2436">People had an inkling that war was not far away but nobody really talked about it, that this was in 1940 I would say. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And then white Russians moved in. </sentence><sentence id="2438">After they all had left, so we had quite Interview with Margie Rosenthal 46 a turn over, over there, but we always were able to rent it. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And before all this, I do want to say something really cute. </sentence><sentence id="2440">We had a black cat. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And this cat was like a little dog. </sentence><sentence id="2442">It would know exactly when we would come from school, at lunch time and would sit at the gate waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="2443">And it was adorable. </sentence><sentence id="2444">That cat was just like a, like a little, it was like, but like a cat, it wasn't, wasn't a cat. </sentence><sentence id="2445">It was like a dog I want to say. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And then my mother saw a black cat one day out while she was shopping for groceries. </sentence><sentence id="2447">And she said "my goodness, that looks like our cat Peter". </sentence><sentence id="2448">So she was feeding this cat Peter all the way to the home and guess what. </sentence><sentence id="2449">There was our cat in the window sitting and looking. </sentence><sentence id="2450">So she had fed this strange black cat who was very happy to receive the food. </sentence><sentence id="2451">That was one of the funny experiences we had during that time. </sentence><sentence id="2452">Anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2485">Q: I forgot to ask you. </sentence><sentence id="2486">Do you remember approximately when your father got the job with the Ford motor company and what that did to your life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2489">A: My dad got the job after one year, which was 1939. </sentence><sentence id="2490">He did get a job with Ford Motors as a purchasing agent. </sentence><sentence id="2491">And he had to drive the car around and pick up parts and things like that and he really loved the job. </sentence><sentence id="2492">It was very nice and he really enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="2493">And we were very happy to finally have you know some extra money. </sentence><sentence id="2494">And in the meanwhile, we got a word that in Manila, in, I'm sorry in Shanghai an uncle who had been coming over Manila and we couldn't keep him there, had gone on to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2495">Had pneumonia and passed away and left my aunt with a six year old daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2496">That was in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="2497">The same age as my sister. </sentence><sentence id="2498">So it was a very trying experience for her so we were able to send her money so she would have something to live on. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And then came the news that my grandmother was still in Germany and had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="2500">So again Interview with Margie Rosenthal 47 we had to send some money and to, into Shanghai and my grandmother got the very last train out of Germany, over Siberia to go to Shanghai. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2514">Q: Now when you say your grandmother you're talking about Anna Zusman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2516">A: Yes, yes it was Anna Zusman that was my grandmother that was left behind. </sentence><sentence id="2517">The other ones I, like I said I don't even know you know. </sentence><sentence id="2518">I knew they were in Katowice. </sentence><sentence id="2519">That's the last, we had said our goodbyes over there. </sentence><sentence id="2520">And my grandmother in Germany, she by that time everybody had to wear the Star of David on their, the yellow star of David, or an arm band. </sentence><sentence id="2521">They had to be identified as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2522">And when friends that she had before wouldn't' even talk to her. </sentence><sentence id="2523">That they ran across the street or just to get out of the way so they wouldn't have to greet her. </sentence><sentence id="2524">And so </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2525">Q: this is probably a good time for me to ask you. </sentence><sentence id="2526">You mentioned there were letters waiting for you when you got to Manila. </sentence><sentence id="2527">And although you knew about Kristallnacht from on board the ship, I assume you learned more things from the correspondence that you had waiting for you in Manila. </sentence><sentence id="2528">I wanted to ask you about that correspondence and whether you were able to continue receiving mail after that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2529">A: Yes we did letters, get letters from my aunt and my grandmothers stating the fact that my uncle now was in a concentration camp and he has to get out. </sentence><sentence id="2530">Out of Germany because that's the only way he could get out of the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2531">Now my uncle had already years ago had TV. </sentence><sentence id="2532">He was so he had weak lungs. </sentence><sentence id="2533">So when he went into we tried to keep him Manila by the way. </sentence><sentence id="2534">We tried everything. </sentence><sentence id="2535">We went to the HIAS, we went to the Jewish committee. </sentence><sentence id="2536">We tried </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2537"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 48 every which way and there was absolutely no way they could, we could keep them over there which was very disturbing to us because we had hoped that they could stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="2538">And as fate would have it. </sentence><sentence id="2539">they went to Shanghai and that's the only place my grandmother, Anna Zusman could go. </sentence><sentence id="2540">So perhaps this was the way fate played it on us, that she was saved that way. </sentence><sentence id="2541">And she died in Shanghai at, of old age but my aunt said that also she had stomach cancer and nobody wanted to really talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2542">And thinking now about the going back to the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2543">I'm trying to remember in sequence how things were going. </sentence><sentence id="2544">In Ermita, when we found out that the war was coming. </sentence><sentence id="2545">My dad of course was still working on the pier. </sentence><sentence id="2546">And then the Japanese started bombing us very, very heavily. </sentence><sentence id="2547">And there was no difference between military objects or private people. </sentence><sentence id="2548">It just didn't' matter. </sentence><sentence id="2549">And we could always tell when you saw them in morning, early high up above at around 8:00, that would mean they would bomb us. </sentence><sentence id="2550">If they weren't there at 8:00 that day they would not bomb. </sentence><sentence id="2551">SO this was from December the eighth until oh, into I think it was like February when they finally decided to invade us. </sentence><sentence id="2552">And my dad was working like I say on the docks and they're bombing all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2553">And then the Americans had to set fire to all of the ships" cargo and everything that was on the docks. </sentence><sentence id="2554">They didn't want to leave anything to the Japanese of course. </sentence><sentence id="2555">So the people were told, take whatever you can carry. </sentence><sentence id="2556">The ships are open to you. </sentence><sentence id="2557">The factories are open to you. </sentence><sentence id="2558">Grab whatever you can. </sentence><sentence id="2559">Make as many trips as you can and get all the food or whatever you feel like you're going to grab and if you can make several trips go for it. </sentence><sentence id="2560">So people would pass our house with, carrying things like clothing and just materials so my mother bought a couple of materials from these people and we bought potatoes because potatoes did not grow in Manila. </sentence><sentence id="2561">They had to be imported. </sentence><sentence id="2562">So and we were used to eating potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="2563">So then my dad got a bicycle from the company and they said take whatever you can take. </sentence><sentence id="2564">So he just took the bicycle and a few odds and ends. </sentence><sentence id="2565">But no, not a whole lot. </sentence><sentence id="2566">We're </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2567"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 49 not, he wasn't the kind of person to just take. </sentence><sentence id="2568">But we did get a few things from the people that were dragging it and then they could go back and get more. </sentence><sentence id="2569">This way they had money and at the same time were able to get some groceries or foods, I mean clothing and whatever else we could possibly use. </sentence><sentence id="2570">One thing we heard about and that was kind of a strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="2571">These people, there were four of them. </sentence><sentence id="2572">And they were carrying this, they saw this huge heavy box. </sentence><sentence id="2573">And they figured there must be something wonderful in that box. </sentence><sentence id="2574">So the four, four people are carrying it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2575">And they took it all the way down to, into our area and along the beach. </sentence><sentence id="2576">It was called Dewey Boulevard, it was a beautiful, it wasn't a beach. </sentence><sentence id="2577">First it was a street and then there was a beach. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2578">That this was Dewey Boulevard with a street that they were walking on and dragging things and pulling and whatever they could do. </sentence><sentence id="2579">And finally got far enough from the fire and opened it up and inside was a coffin with a dead person who was on his way to wherever they were going next to be buried. </sentence><sentence id="2580">Well needless to say that was the end of that, never got to go to his resting place. </sentence><sentence id="2581">And then the fire was going a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2582">I mean it was all around. </sentence><sentence id="2583">They were trying to burn as much as they could. </sentence><sentence id="2584">But they did not burn homes or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2585">it was just at the pier. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2586">And then pretty soon the Japanese started marching in and the Americans had already left for Bataan and I think Corregidor and they went kind of away from Manila. </sentence><sentence id="2587">And only people left were the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="2588">Us. </sentence><sentence id="2589">And we were declared open city, a long time ago but the Japanese just didn't' care. </sentence><sentence id="2590">they bombed us anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2591">And that is how some people did get killed, injured et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2592">We were safe. </sentence><sentence id="2593">We were very, very fortunate that we did not get killed. </sentence><sentence id="2594">And my dad being, working with the at the docks for so long, it was a miracle that he wasn't hit by something or other. </sentence><sentence id="2595">And </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2596">Q: Before we go on to the Japanese occupation, I didn't want to forget to ask you about whether </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2597">   Interview with Margie Rosenthal 50 the Filipinos

and there was, they were very strict Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="2604">They would go to Mass and they really respected everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2605">And therefore they believed in the Ten Commandments. </sentence><sentence id="2606">Honor thy parents, love thy neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="2607">And they really believed in that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2617">Q: Also during that period of time, before the Japanese occupation you were going to, you were still in school. </sentence><sentence id="2618">At the Maryknoll college. </sentence><sentence id="2619">And I assume you were still going to Sunday school at the temple. </sentence><sentence id="2620">So before the Japanese came, what was your life like within the Jewish community. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2625">A: We had a very life. </sentence><sentence id="2626">We had our get together. </sentence><sentence id="2627">We had, made a lot of friends with other Jewish refugees and we children enjoyed going to Sunday school. </sentence><sentence id="2628">We met our peers and we just enjoyed it and during the high holidays it was always a wonderful time for us because everybody was there, regardless of whether they were very religious or not and a lot of the people that, there were some, I shouldn't say a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2629">There were some people that came from Shanghai that friends, I made friends with the Helmans. </sentence><sentence id="2630">There was Rosie Helman, Siggy Helman and Gloria Helman. </sentence><sentence id="2631">Those were the children. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And Mr. and Mrs. Helman. </sentence><sentence id="2633">I don't' remember their first names at this moment. </sentence><sentence id="2634">They had a boarding house right on Dewey Boulevard overlooking the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="2635">And that was a very favorite place for everybody and Rosie and I became very dear friends because she    Interview with Margie Rosenthal 51 went to the Sunday school and we just all had a very pretty good life considering you know we weren't' rich or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2636">We couldn't take things out of their country so we were, had to start fresh, completely fresh as I've said before. </sentence><sentence id="2637">There was not a whole lot left that we could rescue or salvage. </sentence><sentence id="2638">We did keep that wooden box that all our stuff came in. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And my mother had packed away a couple of things, including some crystal because we only lived in one room, the four of us were in one room and rented all out to the other people so we could pay for this flat. </sentence><sentence id="2640">Like I say we had a hard time because they had to give money for the visa for my grandmother and already mentioned for us to be able to buy a popsicle, ice cream. </sentence><sentence id="2641">I mean there, the food thing on a popsicle. </sentence><sentence id="2642">Oh that was quite a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="2643">We never were able to buy a Coke because those were expensive. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Even five centavos we couldn't have. </sentence><sentence id="2645">We had to save every penny to send to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2646">And for the visa for my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="2647">So we were really considered quite poor in those days. </sentence><sentence id="2648">So when the war, I mean when the Japanese came in, we had taken, we had gotten a few furnitures of course, and all the people, the Americans had left. </sentence><sentence id="2649">Now the Japanese were marching in. </sentence><sentence id="2650">We heard them coming in during the night. </sentence><sentence id="2651">And it was an awful feeling to hear marching. </sentence><sentence id="2652">It reminded us of the Nazis in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2653">And we were so afraid that they were going to come into our homes. </sentence><sentence id="2654">And, and just kill us all. </sentence><sentence id="2655">We had heard horrible stories of what Japanese can do from people in different areas. </sentence><sentence id="2656">They were very sadistic. </sentence><sentence id="2657">And the first troops in were mostly Koreans. </sentence><sentence id="2658">They had taken them as the foot soldiers and the officers were Japanese and these people, the Koreans and the low, low Japanese their uniforms smelled so horrible that you could actually smell them through the windows into the house. </sentence><sentence id="2659">And had a terrible stench about them. </sentence><sentence id="2660">I don't' know whether they were able to wash it there or what you know. </sentence><sentence id="2661">Because they were in the war. </sentence><sentence id="2662">I mean they were just waiting and they had to land someplace. </sentence><sentence id="2663">But it was very, very hard for us to all of a sudden for the Americans to the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="2664">We didn't know what awaited us. </sentence><sentence id="2665">How they Interview with Margie Rosenthal 52 were going to treat us, being Jewish and of course our nuns were still at the Maryknoll college but we were not able to go to school because we were afraid to go out into the streets and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2666">And of course they were, later we learned they were right away interned in Saint Thomas which as an internment camp for Americans, for white Russians and people that they suspected of being pro-American. </sentence><sentence id="2667">So but also then we were afraid we were going to be bombed by the Americans and so in a way that is also sort of what happened, but not right away. </sentence><sentence id="2668">Not, they were still gathering themselves together and trying to get all the forces that were left because they, a lot of them were in Bataan and they didn't' have a lot of communications with them because the Japanese intercepted everything that went out of the country.

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2717"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 53 (file 3 -- RG-50.106.0052.03.03 -- duration: ) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2718">Q: This is continuation of an interview for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. </sentence><sentence id="2719">I'm interviewing Margie Rosenthal and my name is Nancy Alper. </sentence><sentence id="2720">It's the 24" of October 1996. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2721">This is the third tape of this interview, the first side. </sentence><sentence id="2722">And Margie and I were just talking about their life style, the family's life style before the Japanese took over and afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2723">A: Before the Japanese took over, we could go to the market and buy beef and you know better things. </sentence><sentence id="2724">However no the potatoes before the war were still there because they were imported. </sentence><sentence id="2725">Once the Japanese moved in we did not have any fresh food. </sentence><sentence id="2726">We did not have any regular potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="2727">We ate yams or yellow potatoes, the sweet potatoes, I should say. </sentence><sentence id="2728">And we didn't have much money. </sentence><sentence id="2729">In fact money was like going always up, up, up. </sentence><sentence id="2730">It was like inflation. </sentence><sentence id="2731">Money wasn't worth a thing and so we ate rice. </sentence><sentence id="2732">One meal would be the rice soup. </sentence><sentence id="2733">Another meal would be the rice. </sentence><sentence id="2734">Another meal would be the potato peels , the sweet potato peel and another one would be the regular sweet potato. </sentence><sentence id="2735">But my mother became inventive. </sentence><sentence id="2736">She would take for example she would take the potato which was an awful sweet potato and she would put vinegar on it and would put salt on it and it kind of deadened the sweetness. </sentence><sentence id="2737">And it was a little bit like a potato salad, were trying to imitate that. </sentence><sentence id="2738">Then to make, in those days we still had electricity and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2739">So my mother would get some coconuts and with (rust?) </sentence><sentence id="2740">with the coconut and then squeeze out the cream and from that she would make ice cream and put that into like cubes, into cube trays in the freezer. </sentence><sentence id="2741">And we would have ice cream. </sentence><sentence id="2742">I mean you had to be very inventive. </sentence><sentence id="2743">You could take flowers and make a jelly and jam out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2744">And later on in the things, I mean flour disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2745">We had then we made, we bought bread made of rice flour. </sentence><sentence id="2746">We bought bread Interview with Margie Rosenthal 54 out of just about anything that you could imagine and the matzo. </sentence><sentence id="2747">We had no matzo of course so we used sour flour for matzo. </sentence><sentence id="2748">Things were really pretty rotten. </sentence><sentence id="2749">And the beef came to an end as well because the caribous were, you know there were more no more caribous and the Japanese confiscated a lot of the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2750">So all of a sudden we were having horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="2751">But we didn't know it was. </sentence><sentence id="2752">It tasted different. </sentence><sentence id="2753">Our Dad finally told us because he was in Russia before the war if you remember. </sentence><sentence id="2754">He would say it tastes sweet and that is horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="2755">Well then we didn't want to eat that any more either. </sentence><sentence id="2756">So we stuck to a diet of fish and chicken but chicken was really a delicacy. </sentence><sentence id="2757">We couldn't hardly afford to buy a chicken so we decided we're going to raise our own and well where do you keep a chicken, right. </sentence><sentence id="2758">There was no, you can't leave it outside. </sentence><sentence id="2759">It might get stolen so we put chickens in one of the little rooms like a closet and had a bar across it and they would roost right on top of the bars. </sentence><sentence id="2760">But then the rats would come and would like to eat those poor chickens. </sentence><sentence id="2761">You had, you know making a lot of fluttering and screaming and screeching. </sentence><sentence id="2762">And we would jump out of bed and we tried to chase the rats away from the where we had the chickens because like I said they liked to eat chickens too. </sentence><sentence id="2763">Then during the winter season we lived in a place where we were downstairs and across the street from us was the house of Japanese where they were torturing Filipinos. </sentence><sentence id="2764">Whoever they thought was a group that was against them. </sentence><sentence id="2765">And they would do the most horrible things to them. </sentence><sentence id="2766">And we would see walking by. </sentence><sentence id="2767">It was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="2768">They would have men hanging upside down and would make them smoke and they would have them close their nose and mouth and they would have to inhale the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="2769">And they would just absolutely and they'd blow up like they would swell up. </sentence><sentence id="2770">It was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="2771">Or they would pull fingernails out and toenails and the water torture. </sentence><sentence id="2772">They did everything and anything to get some information out of them. </sentence><sentence id="2773">And that they didn't do, they couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="2774">And my dad at that time, there was no more. </sentence><sentence id="2775">In the beginning my dad and I were selling automobile parts, in the very Interview with Margie Rosenthal 55 beginning of the Japanese occupation because we needed to get some money. </sentence><sentence id="2776">So we would buy parts from one place and take it and sell it to another place. </sentence><sentence id="2777">One of our, my good customers was the cigar company. </sentence><sentence id="2778">Hamber, I think it was called cigar company. </sentence><sentence id="2779">And they would give me what they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2780">They needed say X number of piston rings, X number of spark plugs. </sentence><sentence id="2781">X number of fan belts. </sentence><sentence id="2782">I mean things like that or even batteries. </sentence><sentence id="2783">So I would go and find where I could find some and then bring it to them and sell them. </sentence><sentence id="2784">Now I was having a better time of sales than my dad, I guess because I was a girl. </sentence><sentence id="2785">Anyway, and that way I was able to support my family some money somehow. </sentence><sentence id="2786">And in the meantime, of course the Americans were bombing us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2853">Q: Were you still Ermita then or had you moved to a different location and where did you get the auto parts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2855">A: Well we still were in Ermita and the auto parts, people tipped us off who might be wanting to sell. </sentence><sentence id="2856">Well you had no gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="2857">You only had cars there so you dismantled them and sold part by part because nobody could drive a car at that point anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2858">Gasoline was out of the question so you had to do what you had to do and this is how I found out well these people had this and that and so I went and procured it and sold it to them. </sentence><sentence id="2859">And we'd separate, my dad and I. He'd go one direction and I'd go someplace else and sometimes we'd meet for lunch or whatever, downtown. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2860">But between the bombings, the Americans were flying way up there. </sentence><sentence id="2861">And we wanted to say hooray, hooray, hooray but we didn't dare show any kind of an emotion because that would have been the end. </sentence><sentence id="2862">But then that stopped too. </sentence><sentence id="2863">And so then my dad used to go to the market, get some linguises, they called them. </sentence><sentence id="2864">That's a sausage and other things that he thought people would need and took it into the provinces, way into the interior of Manila, in that bundle into Philippines, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2865"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 56 interior of the suburbs and further out. </sentence><sentence id="2866">Well twice, my poor father was caught. </sentence><sentence id="2867">The first time they thought he was a guerrilla but he talked his way out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2868">The second time he wasn't so lucky. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2869">He, they had him, they hand bound him. </sentence><sentence id="2870">They were going to shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="2871">I mean they already had a position to sue. </sentence><sentence id="2872">And he said I can show you that I'm a Jewish person. </sentence><sentence id="2873">I had the bris, and they said that doesn't mean anything. </sentence><sentence id="2874">We do too. </sentence><sentence id="2875">We had the same operation. </sentence><sentence id="2876">Don't work, that stuff. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2877">So he said I can recite the Shema. </sentence><sentence id="2878">He said how do we know that that is your prayer. </sentence><sentence id="2879">We don't' know Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="2880">So he was there for hours. </sentence><sentence id="2881">They were keep, questioning him. </sentence><sentence id="2882">And he kept saying Iam not a, I am not a spy for the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="2883">I am not. </sentence><sentence id="2884">I am pro-American. </sentence><sentence id="2885">We </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2886">Q: Now if I understand this they were rebel guerrillas. </sentence><sentence id="2887">These were not Japanese soldiers but these were the Filipinos who were fighting the Japanese. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2888">A: That is correct. </sentence><sentence id="2889">They were in the outskirts hiding underground so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="2890">Yes, and they, when they see a white man or what's he doing in the province, find out he's German on top of that. </sentence><sentence id="2891">Well, that means enemy. </sentence><sentence id="2892">And so they really wanted to kill him. </sentence><sentence id="2893">And so he said "look, if you're going to kill me, do it now. </sentence><sentence id="2894">Don't prolong this anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2895">I've had enough." </sentence><sentence id="2896">He was saying the Shema over and over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="2897">And nothing they said, he said or did. </sentence><sentence id="2898">He says I have a family. </sentence><sentence id="2899">I have two children. </sentence><sentence id="2900">I have a, my wife is there. </sentence><sentence id="2901">He said please you know this was in the Pasay. </sentence><sentence id="2902">This, in the meanwhile we had to move Ermita, because Ermita was getting very expensive, so we went back to Pasay. </sentence><sentence id="2903">And we rented a downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="2904">It was like a basement type thing, level to the ground. </sentence><sentence id="2905">And that, from there we were making our trips into the city and you didn't have much. </sentence><sentence id="2906">As transportation you mostly had to walk and it was pretty hard. </sentence><sentence id="2907">And anyway so my dad, this finally somebody else, the big, big macher came from the group. </sentence><sentence id="2908">And he said, "I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2909"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 57 believe this man. </sentence><sentence id="2910">Let him go." </sentence><sentence id="2911">So they said ok, let him go. </sentence><sentence id="2912">He was so sure they were going to shoot him in the back. </sentence><sentence id="2913">And he took his bicycle and started walking. </sentence><sentence id="2914">He didn't dare get on a bicycle because he was so weak by that time. </sentence><sentence id="2915">He was so exhausted from the interrogations and from the, the whole way they held him, hand cuffed behind his back and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2916">I mean he was just a broken man. </sentence><sentence id="2917">Well, they let him go. </sentence><sentence id="2918">But the man that told him you can go, said, "I will watch you. </sentence><sentence id="2919">I will make sure that you are telling the truth. </sentence><sentence id="2920">And if you're not, you're a dead man." </sentence><sentence id="2921">So he told him where he, where we lived so he says "I'm going to come and check up on you." </sentence><sentence id="2922">My dad came home walking. </sentence><sentence id="2923">He never rode the bicycle all the way, miles and miles and miles, kilometers over there. </sentence><sentence id="2924">And he came home and he always was an old man. </sentence><sentence id="2925">He was so broken up about this that we said you're not going back into that again ever, ever. </sentence><sentence id="2926">You cannot do it. </sentence><sentence id="2927">And so my poor father, that night, sure enough we spied, we saw somebody outside our window. </sentence><sentence id="2928">We thought it was somebody going to break in again. </sentence><sentence id="2929">And no, it was one of the people that had said they're going to check up on him were outside our window, looking in. </sentence><sentence id="2930">But barely. </sentence><sentence id="2931">You had to just kind of look in through the slats. </sentence><sentence id="2932">But they were there checking up on us. </sentence><sentence id="2933">That was the last time he went into the country. </sentence><sentence id="2934">We would not let him. </sentence><sentence id="2935">I said we'd rather starve. </sentence><sentence id="2936">Now we, like I said, we were at the floor level. </sentence><sentence id="2937">In the back was swamp. </sentence><sentence id="2938">And they had fish so we would go out there and try to catch some fish for food. </sentence><sentence id="2939">And we had those two chickens. </sentence><sentence id="2940">But you know we didn't have heart. </sentence><sentence id="2941">We did not have the heart to kill them so we gave them to a neighbor and says here. </sentence><sentence id="2942">You take them. </sentence><sentence id="2943">We don't want to eat them. </sentence><sentence id="2944">And they're getting older. </sentence><sentence id="2945">You better just use them. </sentence><sentence id="2946">Of course they didn't' give us any share at all, but the Japanese kept up their atrocities something awful. </sentence><sentence id="2947">And many people didn't make it back. </sentence><sentence id="2948">I mean even some of our Jewish people were taken. </sentence><sentence id="2949">They found a short wave radio or sometimes they didn't find anything. </sentence><sentence id="2950">They just didn't' like the way you answered them and that was it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2951"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 58 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2952">Q: With the Japanese patrolling on a daily basis around all the neighborhoods sort of like a police force. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2953">A: Not really patrolling. </sentence><sentence id="2954">They had houses. </sentence><sentence id="2955">Little like a, it was like you see in England. </sentence><sentence id="2956">You know those little guard houses. </sentence><sentence id="2957">They had that that set up all over and when you walked by you had to bend down as low as you could because if you didn't they just slap you left and right. </sentence><sentence id="2958">And so we learned to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2959">But later on we get to the idea, hey wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="2960">We are German. </sentence><sentence id="2961">They don't' know the difference so we said Allemande, Allemande. </sentence><sentence id="2962">German. </sentence><sentence id="2963">Deutsch, Deutsch. </sentence><sentence id="2964">And you know it worked. </sentence><sentence id="2965">We didn't' have to do it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2966">They bowed to us. </sentence><sentence id="2967">But they were like I said pretty viscous. </sentence><sentence id="2968">And again things became, the water kept rising in that place. </sentence><sentence id="2969">Whenever it rained. </sentence><sentence id="2970">It was rainy season, the piles came loose. </sentence><sentence id="2971">And we, whenever we put our feet out ora hand out, it would touch water. </sentence><sentence id="2972">So we know the water had risen to our bed. </sentence><sentence id="2973">And the beds were way up there. </sentence><sentence id="2974">High up. </sentence><sentence id="2975">Everything was up high. </sentence><sentence id="2976">And that's how so we could open the, we had window open. </sentence><sentence id="2977">The water was as high outside as it was inside. </sentence><sentence id="2978">So we saw fish floating by and we tried to catch those fish. </sentence><sentence id="2979">So once in a while we were lucky and we were able to catch the fish. </sentence><sentence id="2980">So between vegetables that were growing out back and fish we didn't need a whole lot of money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3009">Q: I think you talked about the fact that the Japanese placed their munitions near some, in suburban neighborhoods. </sentence><sentence id="3010">And I'm wondering if that was true in Pasay as well as Ermita. </sentence><sentence id="3011">If that was just a general practice of the Japanese. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3015">A: It certainly was. </sentence><sentence id="3016">From Pasay, we moved back to Ermita. </sentence><sentence id="3017">We just things were getting pretty bad. </sentence><sentence id="3018">We couldn't' stay in that, in a place where the water was coming up all the time. </sentence><sentence id="3019">We lost a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3020"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 59 lot of things due to that. </sentence><sentence id="3021">The shoes molded away, the blankets and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="3022">So that didn't last. </sentence><sentence id="3023">So then we went to Ermita now. </sentence><sentence id="3024">It was almost 1945, very close to 1945 when we moved back to Ermita. </sentence><sentence id="3025">I would say that was probably in the very beginning of 45. </sentence><sentence id="3026">And the bombings of the Americans increased. </sentence><sentence id="3027">Then came shelling. </sentence><sentence id="3028">They had, they dropped leaflets and were telling us that they had already come to the outskirts of Manila by dropping leaflets. </sentence><sentence id="3029">So we knew the end was near. </sentence><sentence id="3030">We could just hold out a little bit longer. </sentence><sentence id="3031">And we had ok, also we, up until that time we were able to go to the temple. </sentence><sentence id="3032">And we were able to go every week to services. </sentence><sentence id="3033">But when the shell, the bombings got worse and worse, it really was very dangerous to be outside. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3034">And there was no place to really hide because there were no air raid shelters in Manila because it was too low. </sentence><sentence id="3035">It was water underneath, not far down, we had water. </sentence><sentence id="3036">So we couldn't build any air shelters. </sentence><sentence id="3037">So you had to hope for the best. </sentence><sentence id="3038">That was about it. </sentence><sentence id="3039">So then we were again back in Ermita and then the Japanese had been storing ammunition in between the civilians because they knew that the, if the Americans knew civilians lived there, they would not bomb the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="3040">So they very smartly put gasoline, ammunition, anything that was flammable to put in- between the civilians, like maybe two houses of civilian. </sentence><sentence id="3041">The third one would have that. </sentence><sentence id="3042">Or five houses of civilians and a big bloc of Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="3043">So they were all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="3044">And we knew more or less where they were. </sentence><sentence id="3045">So we but we, where else can you run. </sentence><sentence id="3046">I mean you can't keep running so we were at one place. </sentence><sentence id="3047">It used to be a dressmaker's place. </sentence><sentence id="3048">That was our very last stand. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3049">We were so tired of moving and running away and no matter where we went we were getting bombed or getting shelled. </sentence><sentence id="3050">It really didn't' make any difference. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3051"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 60 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3052">Q: Iknow you told me that you also sold pies. </sentence><sentence id="3053">And I'm wondering where that fit in and in this time period we're discussing and if you reached a point where there simply wasn't anything you could do anymore to earn money. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3054">A: Well the pies came at a very late date also because like I said food was running out. </sentence><sentence id="3055">So this one lady was baking pies and I took it to the hospital where they still had some doctors and nurses. </sentence><sentence id="3056">And also the people that were discharged from the prisons were there. </sentence><sentence id="3057">And there was one Jewish man that I, basically that was the one I really, really remembered. </sentence><sentence id="3058">Because I had known him. </sentence><sentence id="3059">His name was Moser. </sentence><sentence id="3060">And he was laying on the bed, white. </sentence><sentence id="3061">His legs were saw raw that he couldn't even put his legs together and he was so thin that there was nothing left and he looked almost like what you see nowadays

id="3064">They did everything you can possibly imagine. </sentence><sentence id="3065">He could barely talk to us. </sentence><sentence id="3066">And I brought a pie over to him and I fed him because I felt that was the only thing I could do. </sentence><sentence id="3067">I would explain what happened to that pie later on to the lady that made them, but he had to have some nourishment and I started feeding him small little pieces and he ate it and his eyes became big and cause he couldn't really show much emotion at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3068">He was just too, too tired of living, too tired of everything. </sentence><sentence id="3069">And the pies like I said you know I sold as long as I could. </sentence><sentence id="3070">And that stopped as well because the bombing got more severe and more severe and by that time, the Americans were already in Intramuros, in that area we heard. </sentence><sentence id="3071">So it was time to just put an end to this. </sentence><sentence id="3072">And so we were in this building that we had taken over from the dressmaker. </sentence><sentence id="3073">And across the street from us were this red light house, the red light district house. </sentence><sentence id="3074">And I was standing in the doorway of our place where we were. </sentence><sentence id="3075">And all of a sudden this Japanese soldier comes

</sentence><sentence id="3106">Well then this all was coming to an end. </sentence><sentence id="3107">The Japanese were making, going from house to house interrogating or taking people. </sentence><sentence id="3108">My dad said goodby already. </sentence><sentence id="3109">My mother said goodby to us too. </sentence><sentence id="3110">And said that your aunt is in Shanghai and I

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3200">A: We think that might have happened because how else I mean we had the same place. </sentence><sentence id="3201">I mean we were side by side we'd go from one to the next to the next. </sentence><sentence id="3202">I mean you know how, we assumed that maybe this officer when somehow word must have spread. </sentence><sentence id="3203">Say don't go

</sentence><sentence id="3212">In the morning we heard that that street had not burned yet so we cautiously made our way back there and sure it was not burned yet. </sentence><sentence id="3213">So my

</sentence><sentence id="3218">It was mainly the heavy, heavy shelling. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3219">By the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="3220">And they just shot into it because the Japanese were intermingled with us and the ammunition and the gasoline and daddy, my father said we don't want to go up in flames and be thrown to smithereens. </sentence><sentence id="3221">We just might as well leave while we still can. </sentence><sentence id="3222">So that morning we gathered all our meager, one photo album, the address for my aunt and the visa, affidavits for America. </sentence><sentence id="3223">I, my dad told me to take the electric plate over my neck and that was heavy. </sentence><sentence id="3224">And the dog and the leash. </sentence><sentence id="3225">We had a dog. </sentence><sentence id="3226">And my sister couldn't' carry anything. </sentence><sentence id="3227">She was too, I was 17 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="3228">and so my sister she was, what 12. </sentence><sentence id="3229">So I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3230">Maybe they gave her something to carry also. </sentence><sentence id="3231">And on top of that we had again bought some chickens. </sentence><sentence id="3232">Raw, live chickens. </sentence><sentence id="3233">And they were making such a racket. </sentence><sentence id="3234">So we gave it to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="3235">And said we don't' want to be, we can't kill them anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3236">Just take them, just go. </sentence><sentence id="3237">So we gave them to somebody who I don't even know who they were. </sentence><sentence id="3238">And we went to this apartment house that was down the street and in that apartment house we went to that apartment building that was standing. </sentence><sentence id="3239">That was a very high rise building for those days. </sentence><sentence id="3240">And in the bottom, or as you walked in from off the street were sandbags Well apparently a bomb, a shell had come into there and had not exploded. </sentence><sentence id="3241">A great big thing and one bomb was also in the shaft, elevator shaft. </sentence><sentence id="3242">And we figured well let's lay down there. </sentence><sentence id="3243">I mean we've got to get out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="3244">At least it's far enough, even though that explodes it"! </sentence><sentence id="3245">give us some protection with these bags around the building. </sentence><sentence id="3246">Well we didn't expect a shell to come right, explode, come right into the, it was like a carport almost. </sentence><sentence id="3247">Open on all the sides you see. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3248"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 64 And it came right in and exploded and it was phosphorous now. </sentence><sentence id="3249">And the explosion of it, threw me under a very low table. </sentence><sentence id="3250">It was like maybe 5 inches, 6 inches off the floor. </sentence><sentence id="3251">It pushed me underneath that and my mother got hit with shrapnel. </sentence><sentence id="3252">Our dog ran away at that time and we were looking for the dog afterwards but it was just as well because where we were before had taken our dog was barking at all the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="3253">We didn't know how to keep her quiet. </sentence><sentence id="3254">So when this explosion happened, she took off which was probably a blessing. </sentence><sentence id="3255">Anyway so we I thought I said I think I'm dying. </sentence><sentence id="3256">I couldn't' breathe because of the phosphor in my lungs, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3257">And my mother was bleeding from her shrapnel wounds. </sentence><sentence id="3258">So we got out of there and went to a maybe a block away to a garage that had burned I mean the garage. </sentence><sentence id="3259">A house that had already burned out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3260">All those left were the bottom with hot, hot coals like tiles and things. </sentence><sentence id="3261">But where else can we go. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3262">We stayed there for just a little bit, maybe one night. </sentence><sentence id="3263">That didn't work very well. </sentence><sentence id="3264">So then we went to the school which was Atenao, a parochial school for boys. </sentence><sentence id="3265">The building was already occupied by a lot of refugees so there was no more room in the building. </sentence><sentence id="3266">So the other people that were outside were sitting in ditches that had been placed around the whole parameter of the school. </sentence><sentence id="3267">Well that's where we were when the shots kept coming over our heads. </sentence><sentence id="3268">And my mother still had that shrapnel in her but what could we do. </sentence><sentence id="3269">There were no doctors, medics, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3270">So all we did was we put some bandage on her and that was all we could do. </sentence><sentence id="3271">And then we, shell, a big shrapnel fell between my mother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="3272">If we had been closer it would have killed one of us. </sentence><sentence id="3273">Well we figured out that wasn't a place to stay again. </sentence><sentence id="3274">So again we started moving around. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3275">So then we spied this, oh that was several blocks away because we knew that this was going to go up and sure enough that night, our house, our place, that whole block went up. </sentence><sentence id="3276">In explosion because a shell had hit there as well and it hit our apartment where we were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="3277">It also was </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3278"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 65 hitting already close to that place where we were living before. </sentence><sentence id="3279">So we had to go further. </sentence><sentence id="3280">So we walked and we w </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3281">Q:

to the end. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3285">A: The, we had finally come upon this garage that had a roof like I said, three sides but the front was all open. </sentence><sentence id="3286">We were in like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="3287">We tried to get out of the outside as much as possible. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3288">But we barely made it in because a lot of people there already. </sentence><sentence id="3289">And there was one Jewish lady. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3290">She had her maid there. </sentence><sentence id="3291">She had her cushions there. </sentence><sentence id="3292">She had everything that it could possibly could think of. </sentence><sentence id="3293">She would not move an inch. </sentence><sentence id="3294">So we all were trying to help each other, trying to get in as many people as we could. </sentence><sentence id="3295">Well we couldn't lie down. </sentence><sentence id="3296">I mean it was you just laid to the side of yourself. </sentence><sentence id="3297">Anyway, and then we were across the street was a whole contingent of Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="3298">The whole house was occupied by Japanese soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="3299">And pretty soon these Japanese came over, wanted the girls. </sentence><sentence id="3300">And being that I was very undernourished, underweight, didn't have much on me, they didn't see me. </sentence><sentence id="3301">They thought I was just a kid. </sentence><sentence id="3302">But there were some girls there that were well endowed. </sentence><sentence id="3303">They lined them all up and they said you, you, you, you. </sentence><sentence id="3304">Come. </sentence><sentence id="3305">Well one of them was the daughter of optometrist that we knew. </sentence><sentence id="3306">And he went up to this soldier who said you, you, you. </sentence><sentence id="3307">He said watch, my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="3308">And so he understood. </sentence><sentence id="3309">He let the girl go. </sentence><sentence id="3310">And he gave him his gold watch. </sentence><sentence id="3311">Then he asked for the men to come out. </sentence><sentence id="3312">So all the men including my father of course. </sentence><sentence id="3313">He was lining them up and we thought oh my god, he's going to shoot them </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3314"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 66 all now. </sentence><sentence id="3315">I mean what. </sentence><sentence id="3316">So my dad, said German, German. </sentence><sentence id="3317">That saved him. </sentence><sentence id="3318">So he sent him back to us. </sentence><sentence id="3319">But the other ones they took along. </sentence><sentence id="3320">They didn't shoot them right in front of our faces. </sentence><sentence id="3321">They just took them. </sentence><sentence id="3322">So that gave us a little bit more room in the garage which is a sad thing to say you know. </sentence><sentence id="3323">But that's when the moment you say German that was it. </sentence><sentence id="3324">So then we had no food, no water and at this time we were pretty worn out by running around from one area to another area and nothing to eat but we had had with us a little bit of drink. </sentence><sentence id="3325">My dad had saved some whiskey in a bottle. </sentence><sentence id="3326">And he said we were going to use this when we are liberated. </sentence><sentence id="3327">Well this was an emergency. </sentence><sentence id="3328">And we had no more water. </sentence><sentence id="3329">So when, they, I looked across the ruins and I saw a bunch of people. </sentence><sentence id="3330">I said looks to me like they're going for water. </sentence><sentence id="3331">I saw them lowering a can on a string. </sentence><sentence id="3332">I said that looks to me like that might have been a house. </sentence><sentence id="3333">I'm going. </sentence><sentence id="3334">So my dad said, no I'm going. </sentence><sentence id="3335">I said no you're not. </sentence><sentence id="3336">Because you are man. </sentence><sentence id="3337">You might get killed. </sentence><sentence id="3338">You are staying. </sentence><sentence id="3339">I said I'm going to take my sister, Eva. </sentence><sentence id="3340">So she and I had this flask that was used to probably wine in there. </sentence><sentence id="3341">It was kind of a maybe a five gallon jug, empty. </sentence><sentence id="3342">So I said I'm going to go because whatever, we had nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="3343">I mean we found it along the way somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="3344">| that's not what we carried because we had nothing, except what we had on our body, the photo album and a stamp album and electric plate. </sentence><sentence id="3345">And when you throw yourself down, by that time I'd lost the electric plate also already. </sentence><sentence id="3346">I didn't' have that anymore because that was at least it was heavy and how could you fall on top of that. </sentence><sentence id="3347">It was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="3348">So I left it some time ago. </sentence><sentence id="3349">So then I said, let's go Eva. </sentence><sentence id="3350">So we walked over there to the place where I saw those women and they were fighting over the water. </sentence><sentence id="3351">I mean there were so , maybe 60 and I had no way of even getting close to it. </sentence><sentence id="3352">So I just stood there and what next. </sentence><sentence id="3353">How am I going to obtain water. </sentence><sentence id="3354">We needed water. </sentence><sentence id="3355">All of a sudden shelling started, whizzing right over our heads. </sentence><sentence id="3356">Well the Filipinos, these were all Filipinos that we are talking about, all lay down flat on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="3357">So that they wouldn't' be hit. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3358">   Interview with Margie Rosenthal 67 And I said Eva lay down too. </sentence><sentence id="3359">And I said look. </sentence><sentence id="3360">She says come on lay down, lay down. </sentence><sentence id="3361">I said no I can't. </sentence><sentence id="3362">I have got to get the water while I can. </sentence><sentence id="3363">I'm going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3364">So that's exactly what I did. </sentence><sentence id="3365">I took the can that was standing. </sentence><sentence id="3366">I lowered it, brought up this filthy looking water. </sentence><sentence id="3367">Threw it into the jug. </sentence><sentence id="3368">I got a few cans because the bombing, the shelling goes on for a while. </sentence><sentence id="3369">I mean once one hits, then there are several. </sentence><sentence id="3370">And I was standing up. </sentence><sentence id="3371">I said to my sister, I said if it hits me, you take the water and you carry it home, carry it to the garage. </sentence><sentence id="3372">So I was standing there. </sentence><sentence id="3373">And I, everything's fate in my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3374">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3375">I got the water. </sentence><sentence id="3376">The shelling stopped. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3377">We didn't get a whole lot but we got enough to tide us over. </sentence><sentence id="3378">So I said come on. </sentence><sentence id="3379">Grab the one end of it. </sentence><sentence id="3380">I grabbed the other end. </sentence><sentence id="3381">We stumbled over all the ruins and the burned out things and no, nothing was standing anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3382">Everything was just flattened. </sentence><sentence id="3383">But you know stones and, and glass whatever have you. </sentence><sentence id="3384">So we made it right back to the garage and my dad took the whiskey and put some into the, into the water we had and that we were survived and had water. </sentence><sentence id="3385">And then the next day we were, I had to go, we had no toilet. </sentence><sentence id="3386">I had to go to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="3387">I'm outside and all of a sudden, this soldier comes up to me and I thought it was a Japanese and I'm already going like this with my head down and my hands over my head and, and just cowering down. </sentence><sentence id="3388">He said "get up, get up. </sentence><sentence id="3389">We are here, we are here." </sentence><sentence id="3390">I jumped up. </sentence><sentence id="3391">I said ""an Americans, you're Americans. </sentence><sentence id="3392">And he said "yes" cause they were camouflaged with mud on their faces and they had things over their head. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="3396">He says "ok, I didn't know there were more civilians" he said. </sentence><sentence id="3397">I said "yes, but be careful." </sentence><sentence id="3398">I said "There are sentries in the house over there. </sentence><sentence id="3399">They see you, they're going to kill you." </sentence><sentence id="3400">So he called over to where my parents were and other people. </sentence><sentence id="3401">Had them crawl out. </sentence><sentence id="3402">I never went back again. </sentence><sentence id="3403">I just showed him where they were. </sentence><sentence id="3404">I stayed, he said "don't you go back. </sentence><sentence id="3405">Stay right here. </sentence><sentence id="3406">I'm coming for you." </sentence><sentence id="3407">And that's    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3408"> Interview with Margie Rosenthal 68 what happened and he brought the civilians out, calling and then running. </sentence><sentence id="3409">And he says ""you run as fast as you can over all these dead people," over the corpses that had already started to smell and I mean stink horrible and the ants and the worms. </sentence><sentence id="3410">Oh it's just horrible and that's what we saw. </sentence><sentence id="3411">And we passed that and by the time. </sentence><sentence id="3412">We reached, we reached the, the American lines, they put us on a truck and took us to Santa Ana cabaret where 2000 people were already there. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And anyway, 2000 people were there. </sentence><sentence id="3414">And we stayed there for that night and about two nights. </sentence><sentence id="3415">And we were famished. </sentence><sentence id="3416">And they had a soup kitchen is that what it was. </sentence><sentence id="3417">And we ate the soup that they served us and that was the best thing that we ever ate. </sentence><sentence id="3418">1 mean we were so hungry that anything and everything would have been just wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="3419">Of course, I did not even have a period because all the excitement, no nourishment. </sentence><sentence id="3420">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3421">I mean so I didn't have to worry about that at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3422">And so we were laying there with thousands. </sentence><sentence id="3423">Like I said it was a dancing hall before and they called it Santa Ana cabaret. </sentence><sentence id="3424">And we met some other people but they came, not all, too many of our people. </sentence><sentence id="3425">And then we went and said, we walked along someplace else to see if we could find shelter elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="3426">And we came to this one man. </sentence><sentence id="3427">And he said come upstairs and you know it'll be ok. </sentence><sentence id="3428">And I said "no, I have to get my parents". </sentence><sentence id="3429">He said "bring your parents. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3430">I don't care". </sentence><sentence id="3431">So I brought my parents and we stayed there for a night or so and I said, and then my mother and dad said "no we can't take his hospitality. </sentence><sentence id="3432">He doesn't have enough himself." </sentence><sentence id="3433">So we started walking and we saw a house, a vacant house. </sentence><sentence id="3434">Oh maybe a couple or three blocks away and we went towards that and we took shelter in there. </sentence><sentence id="3435">Well that night it started
