<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: Oh, it was different. </sentence><sentence id="272">When I boarded a train, went down to Nashville, Tennessee, we wereclassified -- actually we took some basic training down there, we learned how to march and do KP and all the things that usually new recruits do -- and took some tests down there to see -- we were in the Air Corps and to see what we would be classified as. </sentence><sentence id="273">And I had a preference of being a pilot and passed enough of the tests that theyclassified me as apilot recruit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: And how did they establish that preference? </sentence><sentence id="278">Were you merely asked or did you fill out a form? </sentence><sentence id="279">How did you express that you wanted to be a pilot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: I think the fact that we joined the Air Corps we wanted to be apilot, period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="288">And along the way they would classify you, depending on a number of tests we took we would be a pilot, anavigator, bombardier. </sentence><sentence id="289">So I wanted to bea pilot and expressed adesire to be asingle engine pilot. </sentence><sentence id="290">And there's aseries of tests, I think, that we took that they determined and sent us on for further training. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: When did you -- when were you informed that you had been selected for flight school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: I think from Nashville, Tennessee, which was sort of basic army training, we went to Mitchell Fields and basically just went to school there. </sentence><sentence id="298">We studied meteorology, navigation, map reading. </sentence><sentence id="299">We learned reading of code. </sentence><sentence id="300">They gave us basically a-- almost a two-year college course in acouple of weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: They just crammed us full of knowledge, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: It was all classroom. </sentence><sentence id="314">We hadn't even seen an airplane yet. </sentence><sentence id="315">Yeah, it was certainly all -- and a lot of military training, doing what you were told. </sentence><sentence id="316">The cadet program was like West Point, it was very, very strict. </sentence><sentence id="317">What we would do, we had to do a lot of parade stuff and we were classified as underclassman for a while and had to do -- we got hazed by the upperclassman. </sentence><sentence id="318">It was basically like West Point, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="326">What was the biggest challenge for you academically? </sentence><sentence id="327">Or was there any academic challenges for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Ican't think of any that bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="332">Most all my training came easy. </sentence><sentence id="333">I tried to stay out of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="334">One of the fears was if you were caught in a lie or doing something, they would wash youout. </sentence><sentence id="335">You just never wanted to do anything that was not proper. </sentence><sentence id="336">We were trained to be officers and gentlemen -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: -- and we just tried to keep our nose to the grindstone, because we didn't want to get washedout. </sentence><sentence id="339">Flying pay was good, we all had a desire to be pilots. </sentence><sentence id="340">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Did you have any classmates who you felt were struggling, that you had to help out? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="351">Atleast I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="352">But in the thing they told us to look to your right and look to your left, one of you are going to get washed out. </sentence><sentence id="353">The washout rate was fairly high. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: Did that prove to be true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="361">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="362">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="363">A lot of the cadets were washed out early. </sentence><sentence id="364">They couldn't meet the academic standards or did some infraction or something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Where did they go when they were washed out? </sentence><sentence id="371">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="516">A: Then I went to advanced training. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="519">| Where was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: I think I went to (? </sentence><sentence id="523">Molta?), </sentence><sentence id="524">Georgia -- I think one was Macon -- did I say Macon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: Yes, Macon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Macon, and then I went to (? </sentence><sentence id="531">Molta?), </sentence><sentence id="532">Georgia, and we flew AT-6s, which was the Texan -- had anickname, "the Texan." </sentence><sentence id="533">Again, more advanced, more controls, retractable gear. </sentence><sentence id="534">We had flaps. </sentence><sentence id="535">We had -- each one became a little bit more of achallenge. </sentence><sentence id="536">But it was not like learning everything at once. </sentence><sentence id="537">From primary to basic to advanced, each aircraft was a little bit morecomplex. </sentence><sentence id="538">And we did -- I think it was the first time Ididanight flight. </sentence><sentence id="539">Up to that we had never done any night flying. </sentence><sentence id="540">And in all these flying schools we did all kinds of manoeuvres. </sentence><sentence id="541">We learned instrument flying. </sentence><sentence id="542">Put a-- hada hood put over our heads so we see nothing but thecontrols in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="543">And the instructor was still with us, he could see what we were doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="561">So we learned instrument flying where you've got to rely on your instruments. </sentence><sentence id="562">You can get very disoriented. </sentence><sentence id="563">If you do some manoeuvres, your ear kicks off and you -- sometimes you can't see anything. </sentence><sentence id="564">You don't know if you're right side up, sideways, you don't know if you're losingaltitude or gaining altitude. </sentence><sentence id="565">So each step along the way became more complex. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Was it frightening? </sentence><sentence id="573">Flying blind, you know, with that hood over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: It -- [didn't find it difficult. </sentence><sentence id="577">We had some time in Link Trainers. </sentence><sentence id="578">Do you know what a Link Trainer is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="584">A: A Link Trainer is a little aircraft that's in a stationary position where I'm in there, you'retelling me what to do, and you have a_ showing me what I'm doing in the aircraft. </sentence><sentence id="585">It's away to learn blind flying without being in an aircraft. </sentence><sentence id="586">He'd basically tell you what to do and you'd do it. </sentence><sentence id="587">And you're just looking at -- you got to rely on instruments, you can't rely on your ear andstuff like that when you're learning to fly. </sentence><sentence id="588">You got to believe the altimeter, the artificial horizon, the RPMs that the motor's -- you got to rely on your instruments because you can't always see the ground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="594">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="596">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="598">Q: So throughout this entire process from basic training, to Avon, to going to Macon, to going on to the AT-6, blind cockpit training, what haveyou, what length of time are we talking abouthere, this entire time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="600">A: Two-month intervals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="602">Q: They're cramming a lot into a short period of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="605">I went from not flying to six months later I'm a pilot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="611">All our training was in two-month intervals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: Up to and through the AT-6 training, is there any training involving combat engagement up tothat point or is it purely flying at that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="616">A: At advance training we did some aerial gunnery. </sentence><sentence id="617">We had a ship that towed a big target and we shot at that. </sentence><sentence id="618">We had to be fairly proficient because they'd count the holes. </sentence><sentence id="619">Anumber of us would be shooting at -- the AT-6 was the first aircraftthat we had a gun, and our ammo was painted, the projectile. </sentence><sentence id="620">So if we shot at the target, as it went through the screen it left yellow or red, so that when you dropped the target you could seewhat your proficiency was in aerial gunnery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="626">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="628">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="629">So we did that in advanced training. </sentence><sentence id="630">Advanced training was the first time we flew acombat-type aircraft. </sentence><sentence id="631">Part of our training was to go down to Avon Field in Florida, and they had P-40s and we flew a P-40. </sentence><sentence id="632">That's the first aircraft I ever flew with no dual time. </sentence><sentence id="633">Just sat in the aircraft, looked where all the instruments were and took it off. </sentence><sentence id="634">No training whatsoever on -- the P-40 was the old war hawk that was _ used, basically, in China. </sentence><sentence id="635">A very powerful aircraft but sort of obsolete by World War II standards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="644">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="646">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: But, still, what was that first experience like, getting into that P-40, no real exposure to the aircraft before, going up in it, what was the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="649">A: It was scary. </sentence><sentence id="650">Because when you put the throttle forward, the airplane moved and it was very manoeuvrable, but -- I don't know, it was exiting. </sentence><sentence id="651">It got your blood going like mad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="655">Q: At what point during your training did you realise that you had been slotted and selected specifically for fighter pilot training? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: Oh, it was in the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="657">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="658">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="659">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="660">I knew when I started flying that -- well, probably basically at advanced they made up their mind you were capable of being a combat pilot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="666">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="667">How long did you spend with the P-40? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: Probably less than 10 hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: And then on to what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: Then Icame home on leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="679">At that point I graduated from flight school. </sentence><sentence id="680">I got my wings. </sentence><sentence id="681">My wife came down, pinned my wings on me. </sentence><sentence id="682">I went home for 30 days leave and was a second lieutenant, single engine pilot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="688">Q: What month, what year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="690">A: August "43. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: August "43. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: Iwas in the class of 43H, H being -- A being January, B February, so I was in the class of 43H. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="700">Q: What happens after your leave is expired and you have to report back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="702">Where do you go? </sentence><sentence id="703">What do you do? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="704">A: I went down to Tallahassee, Florida and learned I was going to fly P-47s. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="706">Q: What did you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="708">A: Oh, it was great. </sentence><sentence id="709">Imean this was a big aircraft. </sentence><sentence id="710">It was -- it had more horses behind that propeller, 2800 horsepower. </sentence><sentence id="711">It was a big aircraft. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="716">Q: Were you thrilled? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="718">A: Oh, it was great. </sentence><sentence id="719">Imean we were just hot pilots -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="720">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="721">A: -- you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="723">Q: Do you remember the first flight? </sentence><sentence id="724">Do you remember getting in the first time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="728">It seemed pretty natural. </sentence><sentence id="729">Because I had flown the P-40, which was the fighter aircraft but sort of obsolete. </sentence><sentence id="730">Went down to Tallahassee -- and, again, it's a single enginefighter, there's no dual time. </sentence><sentence id="731">You sit in the cockpit, you learn where all the instruments are, you know where all the controls are to pick up the wheels, the flaps and everything you need to know, and just go ahead and fly it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: How much training did you have with the P-47? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: None. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: None. </sentence><sentence id="742">You just -- that's it, you were in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="745">A: That's it. </sentence><sentence id="746">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="747">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: From the time that you were first exposed to the P-47 to then deployment to Europe, presumably, how long was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: Oh, golly. </sentence><sentence id="754">Iwas flying the P-47 in November, I went overseas in December. </sentence><sentence id="755">Solhad maybe two months training in the P-47 before I went overseas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="759">Q: How did you get overseas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="761">A: Ship. </sentence><sentence id="762">Boat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: Where did you arrive in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Well, first of all, after I finished my training in the P-47 -- well, my wife and I got married then. </sentence><sentence id="768">|mean we were married in November. </sentence><sentence id="769">And one night I didn't come home for dinner and she knew Iwas going out. </sentence><sentence id="770">Inever said good-bye to her. </sentence><sentence id="771">My gear was all at the base and they closed down the base. </sentence><sentence id="772">I got a train up to Boston and a boat to England and she's sitting in Tallahassee waiting for me to come home for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="773">And she knew I was going overseas because all my gear was on the base, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: Were you trying to spare her the pain of separation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: No, she knew I was going to leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="785">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A: I mean I think during World War I all the wives knew that their -- in the air corp --were going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="788">They didn't know when, but it's going to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="791">Q: Sure, but why did you choose to do it in that fashion, not come home for dinner that night? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="793">A: I felt bad because I couldn't say good-bye to her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="795">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: I couldn't make aphone call. </sentence><sentence id="798">They just closed down the base, put us on the train and we were on our way to England. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="801">Q: So it really wasn't your choice, you were sort of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="802">A: It was not our choice, no. </sentence><sentence id="803">I didn't know if I was going to go to eastern -- or to Japan or to England. </sentence><sentence id="804">I went to England. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: How did you explain it to your wife? </sentence><sentence id="806">Did you write her a letter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="809">A: Eventually I let her know, when I got to England and could write. </sentence><sentence id="810">Communication was bad during World War II. </sentence><sentence id="811">It took along time. </sentence><sentence id="812">She really hardly ever got your letter because if youwrote your wife it was photographed, 16 mm film, went back to the States, and it was printed out on what they call V- Mail, have you heard of V-Mail? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="817">Q: Absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="819">A: So she gets a little 4 x 6 copy of the letter that you wrote, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="821">Q: That was so that the sensors could have a look at it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="824">Right. </sentence><sentence id="825">They looked at it, it was photographed, blocked out any reference to where you were in England, and she'd get a little photocopy of your letters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="829">Q: How long did it take you to get to England? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="831">A: I think it took probably seven days or so. </sentence><sentence id="832">It was aslow trip. </sentence><sentence id="833">Went over by boat. </sentence><sentence id="834">I think it was the EMPRESS OF AUSTRALIA or something likethat. </sentence><sentence id="835">It was pretty nice ride over because as officers we had a nice stateroom, we ate ina nice dining room, we had a table, we had tablecloths. </sentence><sentence id="836">And it was a troop ship, and alot of the troops were down in the hold under terrible conditions, I thought. </sentence><sentence id="837">I found that being an officer had a lot of privileges. </sentence><sentence id="838">It was amazing, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: Where precisely in England did you land? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="849">A: Tlanded, actually, in Scotland. </sentence><sentence id="850">I think we landed at Liverpool. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="853">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="855">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="856">Landed in Liverpool. </sentence><sentence id="857">I went over as areplacement pilot. </sentence><sentence id="858">Idid not train for the squadron or a group, I went over to England as areplacement pilot and didn't know where I wouldbe. </sentence><sentence id="859">So we went into this pool of pilots. </sentence><sentence id="860">And they said, "Okay, we need two fighter pilots for Europe, we need four for there," and you just sort of picked out where you wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="861">And I had a buddy that I trained with, and we went over to England together, and we found that the 353rd Fighter Group only needed two versussomebody else that needed six or so. </sentence><sentence id="862">So we figured the guys that needed the least pilots were probably better, so we chose that fighter group to go with. </sentence><sentence id="863">We hada choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="873">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="875">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: So where exactly -- which squadron were you with? </sentence><sentence id="878">Where did you end up? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="891">Q: Eighth Air Force? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="893">A: Eighth Air Force. </sentence><sentence id="894">So the one we picked out was the 353rd Fighter Group and after getting into that group, then we were assigned to the 350th Fighter Squadron. </sentence><sentence id="895">The fighter group had three squadrons to it, it had the 350th, 351st and352nd, and we were assigned to the 350th Fighter Group. </sentence><sentence id="896">This was the P- 47. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="901">Q: Right, the Thunderbolt. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="905">Q: What city? </sentence><sentence id="906">Do you remember what town or village you were stationed out of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="909">A: The first base I went to we didn't stay there very long, but I ended up in a town called Raydon, R-A-Y-D-O-N. It was in the eastern area of England, in the East Anglia area of Great Britain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="911">Q: What did you think of England? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: Didn't see any of it. [ </sentence><sentence id="914">mean at that time. </sentence><sentence id="915">We just took atrain, we got off at this town of Raydon and went on to a base. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="919">Q: And did you spend most of your time when you were not in the aircraft on that base or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="921">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="922">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="923">Oh, we did get leave. </sentence><sentence id="924">We did go into London and stuff like that on a fewoccasions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: What was your sense of how the English people accepted you or your interaction with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="931">A: [had basically no contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="932">On leave -- I only was on leave a couple times andwent into London. </sentence><sentence id="933">And London was strange because it was a blacked out city. </sentence><sentence id="934">You were there with alittle tiny flashlight, they had a little (? </sentence><sentence id="935">slit?), </sentence><sentence id="936">that you didn't bump into people goingaround the town. </sentence><sentence id="937">Food was scarce in England at the time. </sentence><sentence id="938">I did know a family in England through Boy Scouts. </sentence><sentence id="939">As a Boy Scout we used to sponsor -- or we used to go up to Canada and visit -- sort of an exchange with Boy Scouts, and when I went up to Canada this family had a family in England who I contacted and had occasion tovisit them. </sentence><sentence id="940">We used to take them some food items scrounged from our base because they were limited in what they could buy. </sentence><sentence id="941">Food was scarce in England. </sentence><sentence id="942">It was pretty much rationed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: What was your job as a pilot with the 350th? </sentence><sentence id="956">What were you tasked with doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="959">A: Whatever the mission was. </sentence><sentence id="960">First of all, when Ijoined the 350th, that was in January, I really didn't get to fly my first mission until almost March because this fighter group wanted to train new recruits on how they did things, how they flew formation, how they attacked something and just what they did, so you were comfortable and didn't run into each other in combat. </sentence><sentence id="961">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="962">Q: And what was that few months like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: It was fun. </sentence><sentence id="964">It was good training. </sentence><sentence id="965">We did some dog fighting, we chased each other, tried to evade. </sentence><sentence id="966">Just to learn how to do stuff as this group did it. </sentence><sentence id="967">So -- and after that then I flew first mission. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="973">Q: And what -- I want you to tell me all about that. </sentence><sentence id="974">What was the first mission like? </sentence><sentence id="975">When was it, precisely? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="979">A: The first mission, if I recall -- I went overseas in January, first part of January, I didn't fly my first mission until, | think, March. </sentence><sentence id="980">The biggest thing I remember is I was breathing hard because I had never seen theselittle black puffs coming up into the sky, the flack. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="983">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: And I found that I got pretty low on oxygen, because I must have been breathing very, veryhard. </sentence><sentence id="986">It was scary but exiting. </sentence><sentence id="987">And it was uneventful. </sentence><sentence id="988">It was just sort of a milk run or escorting bombers into Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="993">Q: What sort of bombers were they? </sentence><sentence id="994">Do you recall? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: Yeah, mostly all the bombers that we escorted were B-17s sometimes B-24s. </sentence><sentence id="998">And we couldn't stay with them very long. </sentence><sentence id="999">I mean they flew fairly slow compared to us. </sentence><sentence id="1000">So they'd be flying along and we'd be just sort of zigzagging because it was _+ get ahead of them. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So we could only stay with them for maybe 15, 20 minutes before anothersquadron would come in to take over and escort them a little bit further. </sentence><sentence id="1002">So most all our missions in the beginning were escort missions, high altitude, 28 - 30,000 feet, escortingbombers. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Some of our missions later ran into the area were low-altitude missions where we'd go in and dive bomb a bridge, dive bomb atunnel, shoot up atrain, whatever our mission was. </sentence><sentence id="1004">But most of them -- probably I'd say 60, 70 percent were escort missions and some were just "let's go in and target of opportunity." </sentence><sentence id="1005">You see something moving, try to stop it from moving. </sentence><sentence id="1006">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1017">Q: Do you recall your first combat engagement? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1019">A: lonly had one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1021">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
