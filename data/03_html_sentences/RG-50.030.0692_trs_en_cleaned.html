[ </sentence><sentence id="502">think we had flaps. </sentence><sentence id="503">It was alow- wing monoplane. </sentence><sentence id="504">A lot more horsepower than the primary trainer. </sentence><sentence id="505">And, again, we went through the same procedures of landings, take-offs, short field landings. </sentence><sentence id="506">Just learning the basics with amore powerful aircraft. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="522">Q: What was that step-up like, to step up from the bi-plane into that monoplane? </sentence><sentence id="523">Was it a huge experience? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="526">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="527">It was more powerful and you were enclosed in the cockpit. </sentence><sentence id="528">You had more controls. </sentence><sentence id="529">It was -- it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="530">You thought you were on your way to being agreat pilot. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="550">| Where was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: I think I went to (? </sentence><sentence id="554">Molta?), </sentence><sentence id="555">Georgia -- I think one was Macon -- did I say Macon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="559">Q: Yes, Macon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: Macon, and then I went to (? </sentence><sentence id="562">Molta?), </sentence><sentence id="563">Georgia, and we flew AT-6s, which was the Texan -- had anickname, "the Texan." </sentence><sentence id="564">Again, more advanced, more controls, retractable gear. </sentence><sentence id="565">We had flaps. </sentence><sentence id="566">We had -- each one became a little bit more of achallenge. </sentence><sentence id="567">But it was not like learning everything at once. </sentence><sentence id="568">From primary to basic to advanced, each aircraft was a little bit morecomplex. </sentence><sentence id="569">And we did -- I think it was the first time Ididanight flight. </sentence><sentence id="570">Up to that we had never done any night flying. </sentence><sentence id="571">And in all these flying schools we did all kinds of manoeuvres. </sentence><sentence id="572">We learned instrument flying. </sentence><sentence id="573">Put a-- hada hood put over our heads so we see nothing but thecontrols in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="574">And the instructor was still with us, he could see what we were doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="589">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="592">So we learned instrument flying where you've got to rely on your instruments. </sentence><sentence id="593">You can get very disoriented. </sentence><sentence id="594">If you do some manoeuvres, your ear kicks off and you -- sometimes you can't see anything. </sentence><sentence id="595">You don't know if you're right side up, sideways, you don't know if you're losingaltitude or gaining altitude. </sentence><sentence id="596">So each step along the way became more complex. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="603">Q: Was it frightening? </sentence><sentence id="604">Flying blind, you know, with that hood over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="607">A: It -- [didn't find it difficult. </sentence><sentence id="608">We had some time in Link Trainers. </sentence><sentence id="609">Do you know what a Link Trainer is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: A Link Trainer is a little aircraft that's in a stationary position where I'm in there, you'retelling me what to do, and you have a_ showing me what I'm doing in the aircraft. </sentence><sentence id="616">It's away to learn blind flying without being in an aircraft. </sentence><sentence id="617">He'd basically tell you what to do and you'd do it. </sentence><sentence id="618">And you're just looking at -- you got to rely on instruments, you can't rely on your ear andstuff like that when you're learning to fly. </sentence><sentence id="619">You got to believe the altimeter, the artificial horizon, the RPMs that the motor's -- you got to rely on your instruments because you can't always see the ground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="625">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="632">Q: So throughout this entire process from basic training, to Avon, to going to Macon, to going on to the AT-6, blind cockpit training, what haveyou, what length of time are we talking abouthere, this entire time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="634">A: Two-month intervals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: They're cramming a lot into a short period of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="639">I went from not flying to six months later I'm a pilot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="642">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="645">All our training was in two-month intervals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: Up to and through the AT-6 training, is there any training involving combat engagement up tothat point or is it purely flying at that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: At advance training we did some aerial gunnery. </sentence><sentence id="651">We had a ship that towed a big target and we shot at that. </sentence><sentence id="652">We had to be fairly proficient because they'd count the holes. </sentence><sentence id="653">Anumber of us would be shooting at -- the AT-6 was the first aircraftthat we had a gun, and our ammo was painted, the projectile. </sentence><sentence id="654">So if we shot at the target, as it went through the screen it left yellow or red, so that when you dropped the target you could seewhat your proficiency was in aerial gunnery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="663">So we did that in advanced training. </sentence><sentence id="664">Advanced training was the first time we flew acombat-type aircraft. </sentence><sentence id="665">Part of our training was to go down to Avon Field in Florida, and they had P-40s and we flew a P-40. </sentence><sentence id="666">That's the first aircraft I ever flew with no dual time. </sentence><sentence id="667">Just sat in the aircraft, looked where all the instruments were and took it off. </sentence><sentence id="668">No training whatsoever on -- the P-40 was the old war hawk that was _ used, basically, in China. </sentence><sentence id="669">A very powerful aircraft but sort of obsolete by World War II standards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="678">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="680">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="682">Q: But, still, what was that first experience like, getting into that P-40, no real exposure to the aircraft before, going up in it, what was the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: It was scary. </sentence><sentence id="684">Because when you put the throttle forward, the airplane moved and it was very manoeuvrable, but -- I don't know, it was exiting. </sentence><sentence id="685">It got your blood going like mad. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="703">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="704">How long did you spend with the P-40? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: Probably less than 10 hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: And then on to what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: Then Icame home on leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="768">It seemed pretty natural. </sentence><sentence id="769">Because I had flown the P-40, which was the fighter aircraft but sort of obsolete. </sentence><sentence id="770">Went down to Tallahassee -- and, again, it's a single enginefighter, there's no dual time. </sentence><sentence id="771">You sit in the cockpit, you learn where all the instruments are, you know where all the controls are to pick up the wheels, the flaps and everything you need to know, and just go ahead and fly it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="863">Q: Absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
