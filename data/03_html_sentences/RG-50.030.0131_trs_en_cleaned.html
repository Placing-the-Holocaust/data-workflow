My family, we always stuck together--my sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="413">But my brothers were not with us, because they were in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="414">So it was easier, because we didn't need so much room, so many shoes. </sentence><sentence id="415">Because my brother once worked in a bakery; so he used to work at night. </sentence><sentence id="416">So we had only one pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="417">Being he is a small guy, I was always his size, even though he was older. </sentence><sentence id="418">So he used to sleep during the day; and I would work, use his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="419">Then at night, I used to sleep and he would take his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="420">So...but I used to work. </sentence><sentence id="421">We used to cut saxaul (ph) all day. </sentence><sentence id="422">Grows a certain branch over there, it's called saxhaul (ph). </sentence><sentence id="423">And this is like corn, you know. </sentence><sentence id="424">So we used to cut it for a price, you know, for the government. </sentence><sentence id="425">And they used to give us--not pay, you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of bread 200...400... And that's how you survive. </sentence><sentence id="426">And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in like to Germany, he would send a package to us. </sentence><sentence id="427">It was already after the war. </sentence><sentence id="428">So we should survive. </sentence><sentence id="429">So he would send shoes; so we would sell it and just wait for that moment to go home. </sentence><sentence id="430">And we always sell the things in order to get the money, to always have money to go home. </sentence></p></dialogue>

You know, European people, they were not as old in years, but they looked older. </sentence><sentence id="596">It was...it was very hard, because they had to constantly take care of children. </sentence><sentence id="597">We were young children. </sentence><sentence id="598">But we tried to uh help them out as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="599">Because uh, you know, they couldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="600">So we did work. </sentence><sentence id="601">We...my sisters ...my...whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="602">Even to go out to dig a ditch or pick cotton. </sentence><sentence id="603">We used to pick cotton. </sentence><sentence id="604">Or do something. </sentence><sentence id="605">Just to earn some money. </sentence><sentence id="606">And like the mother: you do have respect for your mother and father, you know. </sentence><sentence id="607">They were home. </sentence><sentence id="608">Even though my father, when we lived in a place where there was a lot of Jewish people, he would teach them Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="609">He would teach them Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="610">He spoke very good Russian, very good Polish. </sentence><sentence id="611">So he would [teach] the younger people... You see, we always somehow wanted to learn, no matter how. </sentence><sentence id="612">Not myself just. </sentence><sentence id="613">I think all the Jewish people are like this. </sentence><sentence id="614">No matter where they are, and what kind of thing, they always... something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="615">But among other things, you have to learn something, too--about the world, about books, about this. </sentence><sentence id="616">So my father had a job. </sentence><sentence id="617">A little job. </sentence><sentence id="618">Let's say, if I had a child and I wanted him to learn Jewish--because there was no facility otherwise--so I would give him a piece of bread, a pot of pickles, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="619">And he would teach the children. </sentence><sentence id="620">So he got himself... He loved it. </sentence><sentence id="621">And he was very proud of it; because when he used to come home, he said, "You know, this child, he is so smart. </sentence><sentence id="622">He will someday be a good Jew." </sentence><sentence id="623">You know, he predicted it. </sentence><sentence id="624">And uh that's how we survived, and again hoping to go home.
