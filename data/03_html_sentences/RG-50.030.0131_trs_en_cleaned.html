It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="73">And all of a sudden, we wound up in Siberia-- where there was no... I mean, the train ended. </sentence><sentence id="74">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="75">Because in the meantime, we were so many people; and the sanitary things were so unsanitary. </sentence><sentence id="76">There was no place to go to the bathroom or anything. </sentence><sentence id="77">And we had three children got sick... My niece--my sister's daughter--at that time she was about 3 years old. </sentence><sentence id="78">She got also sick. </sentence><sentence id="79">She was among the three children. </sentence><sentence id="80">And by the time we stopped at the end, two children died in the train. </sentence><sentence id="81">And my sister's daughter, my niece, they took her off to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="82">We couldn't go no place, because we were waiting for the child. </sentence><sentence id="83">So we were left near Tomsk, which was Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="84">And we worked there; and we got the rations, bread. </sentence><sentence id="85">And... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: What kind of work did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

Anybody that didn't work, didn't get a ration of 400 gram of bread. </sentence><sentence id="114">So, of course, every...even though I was young; but I had to go to work in order to get my ration. </sentence><sentence id="115">Ration. </sentence><sentence id="116">How do you say it? </sentence><sentence id="117">Ration, ration of bread. </sentence><sentence id="118">So I went to work in the taiga--you know, in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="119">And we were cutting trees, you know, by hand. </sentence><sentence id="120">Cutting trees, putting trees together. </sentence><sentence id="121">And that's how we earned our bread and water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: How did you live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: Well, we lived... You see, they had those wooden houses that their prisoners lived. </sentence><sentence id="135">So they took them someplace else, and they gave those houses to us. </sentence><sentence id="136">And, of course, we used to cut our own wood for heating the house--which was one house...was one big room, and like two families would live. </sentence><sentence id="137">So we would build, like against the wall, benches; you know, from wall to wall. </sentence><sentence id="138">And we slept one next to another. </sentence><sentence id="139">First of all, it kept warm; and it saved room, because there was no room. </sentence><sentence id="140">And there we would go...like we would melt the snow for cooking. </sentence><sentence id="141">Cooking consisted of... 1 mean, if you got a pound of uh corn kernels, so we used to grind it and it became flour. </sentence><sentence id="142">And you boiled the water. </sentence><sentence id="143">So...in order it should be a lot. </sentence><sentence id="144">I mean, it was like 20 people; and everybody should get a spoonful. </sentence><sentence id="145">So it got thick. </sentence><sentence id="146">And you know, you would just look at; and it should get thicker and thicker, you hoped. </sentence><sentence id="147">If you didn't add water, so it got thicker. </sentence><sentence id="148">And everybody would, you know, just get a spoonful and eat. </sentence><sentence id="149">And that's what kept us going...kept us going, with the hope that some day, you know, that the war will finish and we'll go back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="150">Hoping! </sentence><sentence id="151">But when we got back to Poland, forget it! </sentence><sentence id="152">We didn't even go even to our town. </sentence><sentence id="153">We didn't go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Let's hold Poland and stay in Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="175">We have time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="179">Well, Siberia, we worked. </sentence><sentence id="180">A lot of people...we didn't have any meat. </sentence><sentence id="181">So a lot of...when the sun went down, the light disappeared, they got blind. </sentence><sentence id="182">I mean, from lack of vitamins, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="183">If you don't eat meat, you don't have some kind of vitamin and you get blind. </sentence><sentence id="184">So as soon the sun would set, they would get like...and they would walk around like mummies. </sentence><sentence id="185">And they would say, you know, "Please take me here..." And young people. </sentence><sentence id="186">But they didn't have the meat. </sentence><sentence id="187">They didn't have all those vitamins that one needs. </sentence><sentence id="188">And my brother was like this, you know; so we had to take him. </sentence><sentence id="189">But during the day, he was all right. </sentence><sentence id="190">The minute it got a little darker, forget it! </sentence><sentence id="191">They went blind. </sentence><sentence id="192">I don't know what it was...what would you call it. </sentence><sentence id="193">But that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="194">And, of course, what, uh... You know, it was very cold there. </sentence><sentence id="195">And in the summer and the spring, like we would go in the woods, there was a lot of... We had to wear veils over our faces, because there were big mosquitos. </sentence><sentence id="196">And if you got bitten by those mosquitos, a lot of people went crazy. </sentence><sentence id="197">Crazy, simply crazy; because I don't know what they had in them. </sentence><sentence id="198">So they gave us masks, and that's how we used to go to work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: How were you treated by the population? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Well, uh we were not harassed, because... Well, first of all, we were like in a camp. </sentence><sentence id="223">It was only people that were taken, like myself, from...you know, from Poland or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="224">And they put there. </sentence><sentence id="225">And we didn't see too many people that lived there, because all we saw is the one that . </sentence><sentence id="226">How do you say it? </sentence><sentence id="227">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="228">My husband tells me. ( </sentence><sentence id="229">Laughter). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: The prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="241">Prisoners, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="242">So we would see the prisoners when they came from a different prison. </sentence><sentence id="243">And my father used to cook the water for them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was a job. </sentence><sentence id="245">The cook had water. </sentence><sentence id="246">So he used to cook the hot water, and he used to put them with a cup; and he used to give each one a cupful of water. </sentence><sentence id="247">I mean, that was the disgusting thing. </sentence><sentence id="248">Just that, water--to share water. </sentence><sentence id="249">And you would get a piece of bread, and you would soak it; and they would eat it. </sentence><sentence id="250">So these are the people actually we saw during the day. </sentence><sentence id="251">And at night, we used to be among ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="252">Family would always sit and dream and hope and pray that some day this will end, and some day we'll go home someplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Were you all together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="269">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="270">We were all together; and with barbed wires, of course, you could not say, "Oh, I don't like it here and I am going to go to a bigger town." </sentence><sentence id="271">Of course, you couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="272">We didn't run off. </sentence><sentence id="273">As a matter of fact, my brother did. </sentence><sentence id="274">My brother was very strong, young. </sentence><sentence id="275">And he did try to go away to a bigger town. </sentence><sentence id="276">They did catch him. </sentence><sentence id="277">They did bring him back. </sentence><sentence id="278">I mean, they didn't do anything to him. </sentence><sentence id="279">They just committed him to a crazy hospital. </sentence><sentence id="280">They told him that he is crazy, because he decided to run away. </sentence><sentence id="281">And that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: What happened to him in the hospital? </sentence><sentence id="297">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Well, they kept him and they gave him some medication. </sentence><sentence id="301">And he did play along. </sentence><sentence id="302">He was very smart. </sentence><sentence id="303">He said, "Listen, if they think I am crazy. </sentence><sentence id="304">First of all, it keeps me out, you know, from the taiga, from the cutting the wood. </sentence><sentence id="305">So let me be crazy." </sentence><sentence id="306">And then if... Later on, he went back to the... I mean, they let him out. </sentence><sentence id="307">I mean, they didn't harm him or anything. </sentence><sentence id="308">They didn't physically abuse him. </sentence><sentence id="309">No way. </sentence><sentence id="310">But it was not a place for us to be. </sentence><sentence id="311">In a...in a way, it was good for us. </sentence><sentence id="312">We didn't know at that time; but, you know, fate works in different ways. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Did you have much contact with Russian guards? </sentence><sentence id="327">How were you guarded? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: Well, uh there were not too many guards. </sentence><sentence id="331">There were just only by the main gate. </sentence><sentence id="332">Because behind you were the taiga, were Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="333">You couldn't run there in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="334">Where you gonna go? </sentence><sentence id="335">You gonna die there with the wolves. </sentence><sentence id="336">So the only thing, you had the front; and the front was the Russian guard. </sentence><sentence id="337">And that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="338">And you had no money. </sentence><sentence id="339">You couldn't go no place. </sentence><sentence id="340">So you just had to stick to one place with everybody else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: We were there for about a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="355">And then when the war started between Russia and...and Germany, that's when they liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="356">And they told us we could go wherever we want to go; but they told all the young men--the Polish, we were Polish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="357">So they told them they could register and go with the Russian Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian Armny--to fight against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="358">Which my two brothers did. </sentence><sentence id="359">And we went to Kazakhstan, which is a warm climate. </sentence><sentence id="360">Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan is near Iran. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: How did you get there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Well, we... At that time, we had some...they did... The Red Cross said...being we were Polish citizens, they did send us some sugar, tea, flour. </sentence><sentence id="371">So, of course, we didn't need it. </sentence><sentence id="372">My mother sold it. </sentence><sentence id="373">And for this, we got money to get tickets to get out of there from Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="374">You know, just to get away. </sentence><sentence id="375">Food was... You know, food was... You know, you could get a little hungry; once you get out of the place that you don't want to be, you could always pick up something...did something different. </sentence><sentence id="376">So we got there in Tashkent, and we worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="377">Which we didn't need any clothes. </sentence><sentence id="378">We didn't need any shoes. </sentence><sentence id="379">We didn't need anything. </sentence><sentence id="380">And we waited there for the war to be over and to go home again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="393">You didn't just... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Well, there was also a big community. </sentence><sentence id="397">Because a lot of people... My family, we always stuck together--my sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="398">But my brothers were not with us, because they were in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="399">So it was easier, because we didn't need so much room, so many shoes. </sentence><sentence id="400">Because my brother once worked in a bakery; so he used to work at night. </sentence><sentence id="401">So we had only one pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="402">Being he is a small guy, I was always his size, even though he was older. </sentence><sentence id="403">So he used to sleep during the day; and I would work, use his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="404">Then at night, I used to sleep and he would take his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="405">So...but I used to work. </sentence><sentence id="406">We used to cut saxaul (ph) all day. </sentence><sentence id="407">Grows a certain branch over there, it's called saxhaul (ph). </sentence><sentence id="408">And this is like corn, you know. </sentence><sentence id="409">So we used to cut it for a price, you know, for the government. </sentence><sentence id="410">And they used to give us--not pay, you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of bread 200...400... And that's how you survive. </sentence><sentence id="411">And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in like to Germany, he would send a package to us. </sentence><sentence id="412">It was already after the war. </sentence><sentence id="413">So we should survive. </sentence><sentence id="414">So he would send shoes; so we would sell it and just wait for that moment to go home. </sentence><sentence id="415">And we always sell the things in order to get the money, to always have money to go home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: You could save money? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: Well, we could...just for the train ride; because they wouldn't give it to you. </sentence><sentence id="439">So instead to buy a pair of shoes or a coat, or even something eat good, we had to have the money to get home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="442">Q: What were living conditions like in Tashkent? </sentence><sentence id="443">Where did you live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: Well, we had a...those house... We built our own house, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="447">You know, we would dig earth with straw and--yah, cow manure. </sentence><sentence id="448">I mean, manure from a cow. </sentence><sentence id="449">And you step on it...you know, with water. </sentence><sentence id="450">And then you make forms, and you make brick from it. </sentence><sentence id="451">And this would lay like maybe 4 weeks in the sun...in the sun... Being as tropical...you know, tropical climate, it dries. </sentence><sentence id="452">And this was...we made bricks, and we would build a house. </sentence><sentence id="453">And then we would make a room...a house...a room. </sentence><sentence id="454">That's about it. </sentence><sentence id="455">And then we would make a roof from the straw. </sentence><sentence id="456">And that's it. </sentence><sentence id="457">So if it got cooler, we would sleep inside; but during the summer, we would sleep outside on mats, straw mats. </sentence><sentence id="458">Because natives even there, that's how they live. </sentence><sentence id="459">The Uzbeks, that's how they live. </sentence><sentence id="460">They sleep outside. </sentence><sentence id="461">They eat on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="462">So we tried to imitate them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="480">Q: Speaking of the Uzbecks, what were your relationships like with them? </sentence><sentence id="481">The Russians? </sentence><sentence id="482">What was the relationship with the Uzbeks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: Well, we didn't see too many. </sentence><sentence id="487">Not in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="488">Well, the Uzbeks are... Well, first of all, we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="489">We spoke Russian. </sentence><sentence id="490">They don't. </sentence><sentence id="491">And they are very family-oriented. </sentence><sentence id="492">So they were together, and they were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="493">And they grow over there melons, all kind of melons. </sentence><sentence id="494">And we lived on the melons. </sentence><sentence id="495">We did get a little piece of garden, and we used to grow melons. </sentence><sentence id="496">And uh that's how we lived. </sentence><sentence id="497">They showed us. </sentence><sentence id="498">They were very nice to us, the Uzbeks. </sentence><sentence id="499">And they showed us how to grow, because we didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="500">And here again, we waited to go home. ( </sentence><sentence id="501">laughter) It was one line, but then they started... A lot of Russians came when Germany started to come into Russia, you know. </sentence><sentence id="502">They started to occupy Russia. </sentence><sentence id="503">They had a lot of Russia people coming from Kiev, [from] Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="504">They used to bring the women, the children; and the men used to go to the front. </sentence><sentence id="505">So that's when we saw a lot of Russian people there. </sentence><sentence id="506">But everybody was hungry there. </sentence><sentence id="507">Even they were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="508">Because there was not too much. </sentence><sentence id="509">There was...Everybody had to stay with that 400 gram of bread, even the people that were born there. </sentence><sentence id="510">And that's sad. </sentence><sentence id="511">So that's what it is. </sentence><sentence id="512">But, of course, what my husband went through... It's...You cannot... But we had, because every time like... You know, every time my sister, she would have a dress. </sentence><sentence id="513">And then she would see--because she was the oldest--she would see that us kids that we were hungry or something. </sentence><sentence id="514">So she would take off that dress and go on the market. </sentence><sentence id="515">And sell it, and get--sell it for bread, not money. </sentence><sentence id="516">And bring home a little bread. </sentence><sentence id="517">So then, after a year and a half, there was nothing to sell no more. </sentence><sentence id="518">And she got... (Laughing) You know, she was left with her petticoat, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="519">But, Thank God, we all survived. </sentence><sentence id="520">I...my sisters and brothers live in Brooklyn, and we are happy to be in America. </sentence><sentence id="521">What can I tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="560">Q: Tell me about the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="561">Your parents were with you this whole time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="564">A: Yes, we were all the time together. </sentence><sentence id="565">All the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: How did they fare with all this travelling? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A: Well, of course, it was my parents were not old. </sentence><sentence id="571">They were older; but those years... You know, European people, they were not as old in years, but they looked older. </sentence><sentence id="572">It was...it was very hard, because they had to constantly take care of children. </sentence><sentence id="573">We were young children. </sentence><sentence id="574">But we tried to uh help them out as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="575">Because uh, you know, they couldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="576">So we did work. </sentence><sentence id="577">We...my sisters ...my...whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="578">Even to go out to dig a ditch or pick cotton. </sentence><sentence id="579">We used to pick cotton. </sentence><sentence id="580">Or do something. </sentence><sentence id="581">Just to earn some money. </sentence><sentence id="582">And like the mother: you do have respect for your mother and father, you know. </sentence><sentence id="583">They were home. </sentence><sentence id="584">Even though my father, when we lived in a place where there was a lot of Jewish people, he would teach them Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="585">He would teach them Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="586">He spoke very good Russian, very good Polish. </sentence><sentence id="587">So he would [teach] the younger people... You see, we always somehow wanted to learn, no matter how. </sentence><sentence id="588">Not myself just. </sentence><sentence id="589">I think all the Jewish people are like this. </sentence><sentence id="590">No matter where they are, and what kind of thing, they always... something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="591">But among other things, you have to learn something, too--about the world, about books, about this. </sentence><sentence id="592">So my father had a job. </sentence><sentence id="593">A little job. </sentence><sentence id="594">Let's say, if I had a child and I wanted him to learn Jewish--because there was no facility otherwise--so I would give him a piece of bread, a pot of pickles, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="595">And he would teach the children. </sentence><sentence id="596">So he got himself... He loved it. </sentence><sentence id="597">And he was very proud of it; because when he used to come home, he said, "You know, this child, he is so smart. </sentence><sentence id="598">He will someday be a good Jew." </sentence><sentence id="599">You know, he predicted it. </sentence><sentence id="600">And uh that's how we survived, and again hoping to go home.
