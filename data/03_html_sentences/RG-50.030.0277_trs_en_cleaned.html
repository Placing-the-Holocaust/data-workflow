<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Who beat you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: The Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="246">We could not go to complain to the Romanians, because if we will complain, then the authorities, the Ukrainian authorities, which were very anti-Semitic, would kill us. </sentence><sentence id="247">So we didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="248">We took the beating, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="249">And that went on for days. </sentence><sentence id="250">Every day, every day. </sentence><sentence id="251">Another bad incident that I came through was they asked us one day to bring our bulletins. </sentence><sentence id="252">You know, we had identification cards. </sentence><sentence id="253">To bring the bulletins into the police station. </sentence><sentence id="254">Anybody that is not bringing in, is not coming in with a bulletin to be signed by the authorities will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="255">So I said, "I have to go." </sentence><sentence id="256">My mother was crying. </sentence><sentence id="257">She said, "Don't go. </sentence><sentence id="258">Whatever will happen will happen." </sentence><sentence id="259">I said, "Look, I must go." </sentence><sentence id="260">So I went, that was late in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="261">And as soon as they got them, about 500, 600 people they made a circle to their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="262">That was the Romanians, and they beat them. </sentence><sentence id="263">They hit us with daggers. </sentence><sentence id="264">Then they sent us down to go to Mogilev. </sentence><sentence id="265">When we came there, there was about 2,500 people gathered together from our town, from Jelenia (ph) , from Shagala (ph), from whatever town, whatever they had there. </sentence><sentence id="266">And they were going to send us away to Gruenwald. </sentence><sentence id="267">Then from Gruenwald, to send us away to the Germans, specifically to Nikolayev to build a bridge. </sentence><sentence id="268">And we knew that any person that went there from before never came back. </sentence><sentence id="269">So what I did is plainly, we were all sitting in a yard surrounded by fences. </sentence><sentence id="270">Somehow my luck was that I saw an opening in the fence, and I jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="271">And I went back to Mogilev, but they didn't know -- they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="272">They did not have any notification that I left when I came. </sentence><sentence id="273">And that was the only thing that saved me. </sentence><sentence id="274">I had cousins, Thad an uncle that went there, did not come back. </sentence><sentence id="275">They never came. </sentence><sentence id="276">Because you had to -- with the type of food that they gave you, you got sick. </sentence><sentence id="277">And after you got sick, the Germans shot you because they were very much afraid of having sick people, they feed their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="278">And that was the end of that little incident. </sentence></p></dialogue>
