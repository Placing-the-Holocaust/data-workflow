<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Can you think about any other dramatic or particular incidents that you witnessed in the ghetto of Morava? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: The particular incident that I witnessed in Morava, I mean that always comes to life in me was two incidents. </sentence><sentence id="311">One, that you were taken one time out to work on the tobacco fields. </sentence><sentence id="312"> They had a lot of tobacco. </sentence><sentence id="313">And there they lined us up, and we were all young kids. </sentence><sentence id="314">There they lined us up after work, and they beat us. </sentence><sentence id="315">Gave us a tremendous beating. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Who beat you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: The Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="325">We could not go to complain to the Romanians, because if we will complain, then the authorities, the Ukrainian authorities, which were very anti-Semitic, would kill us. </sentence><sentence id="326">So we didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="327">We took the beating, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="328">And that went on for days. </sentence><sentence id="329">Every day, every day. </sentence><sentence id="330">Another bad incident that I came through was they asked us one day to bring our bulletins. </sentence><sentence id="331">You know, we had identification cards. </sentence><sentence id="332">To bring the bulletins into the police station. </sentence><sentence id="333">Anybody that is not bringing in, is not coming in with a bulletin to be signed by the authorities will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="334">So I said, "I have to go." </sentence><sentence id="335">My mother was crying. </sentence><sentence id="336">She said, "Don't go. </sentence><sentence id="337">Whatever will happen will happen." </sentence><sentence id="338">I said, "Look, I must go." </sentence><sentence id="339">So I went, that was late in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="340">And as soon as they got them, about 500, 600 people they made a circle to their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="341">That was the Romanians, and they beat them. </sentence><sentence id="342">They hit us with daggers. </sentence><sentence id="343">Then they sent us down to go to Mogilev. </sentence><sentence id="344">When we came there, there was about 2,500 people gathered together from our town, from Jelenia (ph) , from Shagala (ph), from whatever town, whatever they had there. </sentence><sentence id="345">And they were going to send us away to Gruenwald. </sentence><sentence id="346">Then from Gruenwald, to send us away to the Germans, specifically to Nikolayev to build a bridge. </sentence><sentence id="347">And we knew that any person that went there from before never came back. </sentence><sentence id="348">So what I did is plainly, we were all sitting in a yard surrounded by fences. </sentence><sentence id="349">Somehow my luck was that I saw an opening in the fence, and I jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="350">And I went back to Mogilev, but they didn't know -- they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="351">They did not have any notification that I left when I came. </sentence><sentence id="352">And that was the only thing that saved me. </sentence><sentence id="353">I had cousins, Thad an uncle that went there, did not come back. </sentence><sentence id="354">They never came. </sentence><sentence id="355">Because you had to -- with the type of food that they gave you, you got sick. </sentence><sentence id="356">And after you got sick, the Germans shot you because they were very much afraid of having sick people, they feed their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="357">And that was the end of that little incident. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: How long did you stay in Transnistria? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="394">A: In all we stayed from 1941 to 1944. </sentence><sentence id="395">In 1944 the Russians liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="396">They went through, there was about two days and a night, there was fights between the Russians and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="397">And then you saw the Germans pulling back. </sentence><sentence id="398">I think we were lucky that the Germans pulled back, we could not -- they could not handle the SS. </sentence><sentence id="399">Because at the end of the German pullback, the SS always went and they always destroyed the towns. </sentence><sentence id="400">Somehow weird, it seems to me, that the Russians were too powerful and they chased them too fast. </sentence><sentence id="401">And they couldn't stop, and they didn't have any time to go around at that time. </sentence><sentence id="402">When I saw the first Russian in the village, I didn't recognize that it's a Russian. </sentence><sentence id="403">I just thought he was from the partisans that were fighting. </sentence><sentence id="404">They came in so fast, and there was machine gun fire that we sat all in the basements of the homes there. </sentence><sentence id="405">That we were just lucky that it just happened, and they liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="406">After the liberation, the Russians came down. </sentence><sentence id="407">They formed an army barracks, and said to us that we should come there to be examined. </sentence><sentence id="408">Because they wanted to take us and to sent us back to Russia to -- I would say an amount of military  exercise. </sentence><sentence id="409">And they put us back in the front. </sentence><sentence id="410">So, but we formed right away detachments of boys and girls, and they left the localities, going towards Mogilev. </sentence><sentence id="411">And from there, we came to the cattle car train that was also the army train. </sentence><sentence id="412">Then we came back to .

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: We stayed -- I stayed in Czernowitz about eight days, and I experienced in Czernowitz a gathering by the Russians, which they grabbed young kids. </sentence><sentence id="439">And they sent them away to the hinterland because they wanted to train us to be soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="440">They sent us to the Polish front. </sentence><sentence id="441">But I left Czernowitz, too. </sentence><sentence id="442">I was not that old, I didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="443">We left Czernowitz, and we followed the front to Mehalin (ph). </sentence><sentence id="444">Mehalin is close to Sirets (ph). </sentence><sentence id="445">There's a Gibba (ph) Sirets, too. </sentence><sentence id="446">It's about 45 kilometers from Czernowitz, and there we went already over to the Romanian side, where the Romanian authorities were in charge. </sentence><sentence id="447">So there I was waiting for my parents to come, because they came about four or five weeks later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="458">Q: Did already the Romanians switch sides at this moment or not yet? </sentence></p></dialogue>
