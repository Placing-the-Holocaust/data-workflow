<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1612">A: Not even yet, no. </sentence><sentence id="1613">It took a few days and then finally one morning the lieutenant said we're going to dig out here. </sentence><sentence id="1614">He put me in charge and we started digging some holes for the posts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1618">Q: For posts? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1632">A: Right, I was supposed to make sure that they did the digging. </sentence><sentence id="1633">I did some of the digging and the lieutenant said, "You don't have to do that, you're in charge of this," but I kept digging anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1634">I like to work. </sentence><sentence id="1635">But then about two or three days later is when I saw that stockade in the other direction, and then all of a sudden all of these women appear looking through the fence, but you can't see many buildings because of the trees again. </sentence><sentence id="1636">But then on this side you could see a little part of a building there, so maybe they were in that building the day before. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1671">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1673">A: Iwish I knew who they were, but then we lost track of them. </sentence><sentence id="1674">They were gone again after a while. </sentence><sentence id="1675">Maybe they left at night or something. </sentence><sentence id="1676">That camp was weird in a way that there were ghosts there. </sentence><sentence id="1677">There was no traffic in or out after we came. </sentence><sentence id="1678">I can't remember a single truck or anything coming in. </sentence><sentence id="1679">And the people at that hospital, that I call a hospital, about a hundred yards down the line from our building, all I saw there -- we weren't supposed to go there either -- were nurses evidently because they had the white uniforms on, and I felt, well, maybe they're nursing some of these Holocaust victims who couldn't move or be transferred. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1702">Q: I guess part of me is a little confused because I always pictured that Dachau as a concentration camp had to be enclosed because otherwise people would escape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
