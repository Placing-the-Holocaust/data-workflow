" </sentence><sentence id="2240">Dear Leney", he said, "I read your story. </sentence><sentence id="2241">I was so touched, what you made from your life. </sentence><sentence id="2242">I'm going to -- I want to help you. </sentence><sentence id="2243">I'm going to send you an affidavit, and I will --I will be good to you. </sentence><sentence id="2244">My wife, Rosie, and the children will love you, and forget your boyfriend or fiance. </sentence><sentence id="2245">I cannot. </sentence><sentence id="2246">I'm not rich enough. </sentence><sentence id="2247">I can't send him some papers, but looking at your picture and that you are a doctor or become a doctor, you won't have a hard time, you will find somebody else who will love you." </sentence><sentence id="2248">I was so happy with the letter, yes and no because Eddie -- at the moment -- I mean, from Heaven, such a letter. </sentence><sentence id="2249">I carry that letter wherever I go, but one thing was clear to me. </sentence><sentence id="2250">I will not leave without him, without Eddie. </sentence><sentence id="2251">I'd rather die. </sentence><sentence id="2252">I don't care at all. </sentence><sentence id="2253">So, I got this letter and a few weeks again pass, trying to make some connection for him. </sentence><sentence id="2254">Impossible, I didn't find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2255">Suddenly, I get a call, who was it?Muriel. </sentence><sentence id="2256">Who was it? </sentence><sentence id="2257">Muriel. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And again, I knew really nothing except for that one lecture that I saved her a seat. </sentence><sentence id="2259">Muriel, she said to me, "Leney, did you hear from your cousin?" " </sentence><sentence id="2260">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2261">But he's not going to send anything to Eddie, and I'm not leaving without him." </sentence><sentence id="2262">She thinks a minute, and she says, "Leney, don't despair." </sentence><sentence id="2263">I was a stranger to her. " </sentence><sentence id="2264">Don't despair Even if I sent so many affidavits -- wait, wait, help will come." </sentence><sentence id="2265">A few days passed, Muriel called again. " </sentence><sentence id="2266">Leney, Eddie has affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="2267">I didn't have to send anything. </sentence><sentence id="2268">I called up. </sentence><sentence id="2269">I talked with the ambassador, and an affidavit is there." </sentence><sentence id="2270">So, you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="2271">The world was ours. </sentence><sentence id="2272">The world was ours. </sentence><sentence id="2273">I mean, was it really true that just a few weeks there was nothing? </sentence><sentence id="2274">And I now had to wait for a certain number. </sentence><sentence id="2275">Even with the affidavit, you cannot go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2276">Your number has to come up. </sentence><sentence id="2277">It was a quota. </sentence><sentence id="2278">There was a quote -- from the number way back. </sentence><sentence id="2279">They were not ready for us yet. </sentence><sentence id="2280">We had to wait. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2391">Q: You know, we forgot to talk about something. </sentence><sentence id="2392">So, let me go back in time just a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2393">You were in Vienna during the Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2397">A: Yes, I was in Vienna. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2399">Q: And we didn't say it at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2401">A: I didn't stay in at home at all. </sentence><sentence id="2402">I was by coincidence with friends, allthe _--_--, and now I walk and we heard it. </sentence><sentence id="2403">I did not realize that ___--sagrabbing and grabbing whatever they can. </sentence><sentence id="2404">All they synagogues were burning. </sentence><sentence id="2405">It was a sight in the scared where you couldn't... I did not know I was alone. </sentence><sentence id="2406">Should I go back? </sentence><sentence id="2407">I stayed with them overnight, then I went back, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="2408">Do I still have a place to go or...? </sentence><sentence id="2409">But it was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="2410">It became the very fast the Kristallnacht, like a flash, and then it was gone. </sentence><sentence id="2411">Well, it was never gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2423">Q: So, did that make you even more frightened than you were before or was this a continuation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2425">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="2426">Even more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2429">Q: Even more? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2431">A: You saw the concentration, in the form, you see, it was concentrated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2433">Q: All right, when we ended the last tape, you were talking about the fact that your numbers were coming up, but I want you to explain because many people don't know what an affidavit is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2435">A: An affidavit is this. </sentence><sentence id="2436">You must have somebody in the United States who is willing to send you papers for you to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2437">They are believed to be write out, but you have to show proof of support, that you have the means, that I will not be a burden to the States until I'm a citizen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2441">Q: No, no, it's fine. </sentence><sentence id="2442">Let me ask you again. </sentence><sentence id="2443">Explain what an affidavit is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2447">A: An affidavit is you have to find someone -- it does not have to be a relative -- who's willing to send you papers to go to the United States, and the papers has to show what he owns, income tax and so on -- that he's really, if it comes to it, that he's able to support me, and that I will never be a burden to the United States as long as I'm not a citizen anymore, because if I'ma citizen, it is expected that I support myself if I'm able. </sentence><sentence id="2448">So, Muriel sent me that affidavit, but -- not Muriel, Sam Menczel; Muriel sent it for Eddie -- but you had to wait for a quota number. </sentence><sentence id="2449">There's only -- somebody might send somebody a hundred affidavits and only a certain number are allowed to enter every year to the United States, and there it was important from which country you came from. </sentence><sentence id="2450">For instance, if you came from Scandinavia, it was very easy to enter. </sentence><sentence id="2451">They will give you numbers because Scandinavian people had no interest to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2452">So, we had to wait for our numbers. </sentence><sentence id="2453">And so, it was very hard until you get to it. </sentence><sentence id="2454">I got right off. </sentence><sentence id="2455">I got the numbers, but the Germans had to give me all the permission to get that number that I'm clear. </sentence><sentence id="2456">I have all the -- did I tell you the story how I worked as a maid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2467">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2469">A: I did not tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2470">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2473">Q: Is that before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2475">A: Before that, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2476">It was the largest library in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="2477">It was like a beautiful home and beautiful furniture. </sentence><sentence id="2478">They did not want to give me that number yet, so one man who had looked over the income tax, "I have a mother. </sentence><sentence id="2479">She's old. </sentence><sentence id="2480">She's sick. </sentence><sentence id="2481">If you find me, if you arrive, you will work for me as a maid, when she's all done, maybe I will let you go and your family." </sentence><sentence id="2482">So, I took the job and it was a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="2483">She was so mean to me. </sentence><sentence id="2484">I worked day and night. </sentence><sentence id="2485">She was very sick and didn't give me practically anything to eat, but God help me she died after three months. </sentence><sentence id="2486">So, that was fine. </sentence><sentence id="2487">He went into Eddie's apartment, took out the nicest furniture he wanted to, and said, "Now you have the numbers, too." </sentence><sentence id="2488">And, he also -- Eddie, not me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2504">Q: Who was this man? </sentence><sentence id="2505">Was it a German? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2520">A: No, his family -- his mother perished, and Eddie had an affidavit for Muriel. </sentence><sentence id="2521">I told you already the story how she called and she said, am I right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2524">Q: So, how is it when you got the affidavit from my cousin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2526">A: My cousin Sam Menczel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2528">Q: And that's the only affidavit that you had? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2530">A: Yeah, I didn't need anymore </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2532">Q: Right, you just needed the one. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2536">Q: And, was your number a lower number than Eddie's number. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2538">A: I'll tell you -- here, I want to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2539">I was about the same, two three or four or five, close, but his number came up and he was in Vienna still. </sentence><sentence id="2540">I was at that time already in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="2541">I'd got a temporary -- you wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="2542">You had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="2543">I got a temporary visa from the Swiss, and Muriel helped me do it. </sentence><sentence id="2544">Do you understand? </sentence><sentence id="2545">He didn't have it, but then his number came up. </sentence><sentence id="2546">He got a letter from the American consul. </sentence><sentence id="2547">He went right up and he got his visa. </sentence><sentence id="2548">Do you understand? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2560">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2562">A: Here I was in Switzerland, my number came up. </sentence><sentence id="2563">The American Consul in Switzerland, which was the American, was very mean. </sentence><sentence id="2564">He would say, "If you want your number, go back to Vienna, go back to Austria -- which was Germany -- and get your number there." </sentence><sentence id="2565">I could not go back. </sentence><sentence id="2566">I had signed that I would never go back. </sentence><sentence id="2567">That means if I go back they"! </sentence><sentence id="2568">send me to a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2569">He didn't even want to listen. </sentence><sentence id="2570">In the end, people did not even try to ask me, "Please help us. </sentence><sentence id="2571">Give us it." </sentence><sentence id="2572">Because everything was here. </sentence><sentence id="2573">But he just didn't want to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2586">Q: Can I just ask you a question? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="2701">I come to Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="2702">I find the telephone number where the prominent lawyer is, had a hard time to get in. </sentence><sentence id="2703">He didn't want to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="2704">How I did it, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="2705">I reached him. </sentence><sentence id="2706">| talked to him. </sentence><sentence id="2707">He was very touched. </sentence><sentence id="2708">I don't know -- people were somehow taken by me. </sentence><sentence id="2709">It's just -- So, he said, "I will help you." </sentence><sentence id="2710">Yeah, my brother said to me, "Look if nobody helps you there, the League of Nations, you have to go illegally. </sentence><sentence id="2711">You have to go over the border. </sentence><sentence id="2712">It could take you days until you get there. </sentence><sentence id="2713">There mountains, mountain passes. </sentence><sentence id="2714">There are woods. </sentence><sentence id="2715">You will have to hike. </sentence><sentence id="2716">If the Swiss find you, there's no end to it. </sentence><sentence id="2717">They will send you right back." </sentence><sentence id="2718">The idea that I should be as thin as I was and there was nothing but me, all by myself, scared stiff. </sentence><sentence id="2719">Well, I talked to that lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="2720">He called up a very prominent, very high official at the League of Nations. </sentence><sentence id="2721">I understood French some. </sentence><sentence id="2722">I did not understand quite enough to understand while he was talking, and he said, "You have to help her. </sentence><sentence id="2723">You have to see her. </sentence><sentence id="2724">Do what you want, but you have to talk to her." </sentence><sentence id="2725">She didn't want to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="2726">He was pleading with her. </sentence><sentence id="2727">She agreed. </sentence><sentence id="2728">I think they were probably very close with each other. </sentence><sentence id="2729">I go over to the League of Nations. </sentence><sentence id="2730">I have no idea anymore did I walk, I had no money for that. </sentence><sentence id="2731">I got there. </sentence><sentence id="2732">I meet her, fantastic building, very </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2733"> elegant woman. </sentence><sentence id="2734">She was awfully nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="2735">She took a look at me, and she said to me, "Don't talk at all. </sentence><sentence id="2736">Did you eat yet?" </sentence><sentence id="2737">I said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="2738">She rings a little bell. </sentence><sentence id="2739">They bring in a fabulous breakfast with

will give you a temporary visa you will get to go to France." </sentence><sentence id="2743">And she said she will givemetoa__-- so I was relatively safe for a short period. </sentence><sentence id="2744">In the meantime, the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="2745">Poland and Germany, the borders were closed, and I did not need to go out right now, but Eddie called me. </sentence><sentence id="2746">He said, "Leney, I received my -- I have my visa. </sentence><sentence id="2747">I have the number." </sentence><sentence id="2748">I told you that before.
