<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: Well, let's see. </sentence><sentence id="13">I moved from Elizabeth to New York, and it was in 1917. </sentence><sentence id="14">We -- it was a combination of households. </sentence><sentence id="15">I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my grandfather, and he passed away. </sentence><sentence id="16">And so we were there along my -- my mother with two children and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="17">And so we had to get along. </sentence><sentence id="18">My education was in the New York school system. </sentence><sentence id="19">I went to New York University, got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics. </sentence><sentence id="20">Went to school at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="21">One job, though, that I took in 1929, I was working in the credit department of a mercantile firm. </sentence><sentence id="22">Working in the credit department decided me on becoming a credit man. </sentence><sentence id="23">And so in school, I studied credits and collections. </sentence><sentence id="24">That was the subject of my major and accounting. </sentence><sentence id="25">In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular firm and went into the banking business. </sentence><sentence id="26">As part of my banking training I was going to become a banker and a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="27">Went into the Manufacturers Trust Company. </sentence><sentence id="28">I started working for the Manufacturers Company a few days before Black Friday in 1929. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I guess that probably influenced my career. </sentence><sentence id="30">Anyhow, I was with the bank until 1936. </sentence><sentence id="31">They got looking around to see how things were going. </sentence><sentence id="32">Somebody suggested that I see the JDC, Joint Distribution Committee, and they asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing. </sentence><sentence id="33">And in due course I was prevailed upon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job. </sentence><sentence id="34">The one year out of my life turned out to be about 60 years. </sentence><sentence id="35">That was a very long agreement. </sentence><sentence id="36">I worked in the New York headquarters office of the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="37">Then until 1939 -- I was there until November. </sentence><sentence id="38">How come? </sentence><sentence id="39">The war

</sentence><sentence id="45">I was accepted, and I went overseas. </sentence><sentence id="46">And I arrived overseas in December 1939. </sentence><sentence id="47">My first permanent job, we thought would be in Paris, the headquarters in Paris, where I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="48">The head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper, T-1-0-p-e-r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="49">He was joined by a man by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to Europe at that time to join Mr. Troper. </sentence><sentence id="50">Joe Schwartz landed in Italy, joined Troper, who was going to Eastern Europe, who at that time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC was cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off. </sentence><sentence id="51">While they were overseas, war did ensue. </sentence><sentence id="52">While they were traveling around in Europe, war did come along. </sentence><sentence id="53">That was in June 1940. </sentence><sentence id="54">They were traveling around. </sentence><sentence id="55">The Germans were practically knocking on the door in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="56">I was in charge of the office. </sentence><sentence id="57">It was the European headquarters, I was in charge of the office at the time. </sentence><sentence id="58">After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the JDC has to move its office. </sentence><sentence id="59">It couldn't remain there. </sentence><sentence id="60">Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in Paris at the time, like ORT-HIAS, the French-Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would move without advising the others. </sentence><sentence id="61">I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to move out, having consulted with the American Embassy, who at that time were following up the French, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of Paris or not and so on. </sentence><sentence id="62">Decided to close up the office and to move out. </sentence><sentence id="63">That was on Monday -- it's Monday -- that was on Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="64">I guess that was on June the 8th or -- if that was a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="65">Anyhow, that Sunday around June, decided to close the office. </sentence><sentence id="66">Closed the office, moved -- intended originally to move to Tours. </sentence><sentence id="67">Couldn't go to Tours because the French government had decided that they were going to evacuate from Paris to Tours, and they occupied the city to such an extent that nobody else would be permitted to come in. </sentence><sentence id="68">In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the office, I had to phone the staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving Paris. </sentence><sentence id="69">They came in Monday to leave the office with their baggage and so on, and they went over to

</sentence><sentence id="76">The rest of the staff had left. </sentence><sentence id="77">I had kept the office open. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="78">There were just one -- two secretaries, myself

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: The mood in Paris was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the Champs Elysees, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="96">And you couldn't tell by looking around the streets that anything was happening at all. </sentence><sentence id="97">And I think that up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going to stop off the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="98">Well, it was misplaced, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="99">So that -- we ended up, then, in Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="100">We moved the office down there. </sentence><sentence id="101">We sent out the cables to all the agencies in Europe with which we had been operating to tell them where our new office was in Bordeaux, to discover later on that the center had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out. </sentence><sentence id="102">They were held up by the center, by the military people in Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="103">We were in Bordeaux (ph) for about four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="104">Government in the meantime had moved down to Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="105">The Germans knew that, and threatened to bomb the city. </sentence><sentence id="106">As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the railroad station to let the French know that they're still around. </sentence><sentence id="107">And the French, then, had sat down This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="108">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="109"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and said, "Anybody who wants to leave Bordeaux, must leave by midnight of a certain day or you can't get out." </sentence><sentence id="110">So we were there. </sentence><sentence id="111">Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="112">We decided to get out. </sentence><sentence id="113">We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the fields, just to get out of Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="114">As a matter of fact, the road were so crowded at that time with refugees -- who were coming down from Belgium into France, and from Northern France going down to Southern France -- that the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from Paris to Bordeaux, it took us three days to get down there. </sentence><sentence id="115">The roads were that crowded with refugees. </sentence><sentence id="116">And we had hardships along the road too, ran out of gasoline and shelter and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="117">So we decided then to get out of Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="118">We did that and headed for Lisbon and decided that the Lisbon was the furthest west one could go in Europe to still be in European territory, and that's the place to have the office. </sentence><sentence id="119">That was all right because the United States was not yet in the war. </sentence><sentence id="120">This was in -- when we went to Lisbon, that was in June, July 1940. </sentence><sentence id="121">So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it was all right for us to stay in Lisbon, and that's where we were going to make our new headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="122">I went back to Marseille after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the JDC could do with the French-Jewish population, especially -- particularly the refugees, who were coming down there from the north and from Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="123">Decided that there was work that the JDC could do, and I opened up the office for the JDC in Marseille for unoccupied France. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Poland, Romania and Hungary, Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="777">They were all to come to Paris to wait in Paris until they could get their visas. </sentence><sentence id="778">And you know the difficulties which existed in getting visas. </sentence><sentence id="779">Nobody would let people in. </sentence><sentence id="780">Even to come to the United States, visas were issued in the order of priority of your registration. </sentence><sentence id="781">And according to priorities in Poland, you could have waited for eight years or ten years before you had , because it was all done on a quota basis. </sentence><sentence id="782">So everybody wanted  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 are called forward by us. </sentence><sentence id="783">Called forward meant that there's transportation, there's a ship. </sentence><sentence id="784">At that time the ships were all clogged up. </sentence><sentence id="785">There were no passenger boats going between Europe and the United States at that ttme. </sentence><sentence id="786">When I say "no," sure, there were -- every once in a while there would be a boat. </sentence><sentence id="787">And there was a great deal of competition to get on those boats. </sentence><sentence id="788">So there were so many places that we could get. </sentence><sentence id="789">So we had to tell people -- keep them back where they are, keep them out of Paris, because the authorities in Paris were after us, to keep the influx down. </sentence><sentence id="790">And so they had to stay back. </sentence><sentence id="791">On one occasion we had to take a whole boat, the Shohan Newbit (ph), to send that to Australia. </sentence><sentence id="792">There were so many Australian visa holders that we had to put them all on one boat and send the boat down to Australia to get them down there. </sentence><sentence id="793">And so we were in the immigration business starting -- as I told you -- until 1954. </sentence><sentence id="794">And in 1954, a couple of the agencies that were involved with immigration merged, which included the JDC too. </sentence><sentence id="795">So that took us out of the immigration business and this merged organization, of which the JDC was the principal anyhow -- at least took it out of our office and took the responsibility away from us. </sentence><sentence id="796">Another operation that we had was the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation. </sentence><sentence id="797">The foundation was established during the wars to help in the establishment of moon (ph) cooperatives for poor people -- or people who couldn't go to the bank. </sentence><sentence id="798">Banks wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews or the interest rates were so exorbitant. </sentence><sentence id="799">So we provided capital, got the local people to provide capital, and these cooperative banks were established by the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which were all over the place, all over Eastern Europe, had these foundations. </sentence><sentence id="800">And then of course, there were people who couldn't even pay the low interest rate that was being charged by these local banks. </sentence><sentence id="801">So we opened up free loan societies and provided the capital for that. </sentence><sentence id="802">As I said before, anything that you touched, the JDC was in there somehow or other in trying to make life more livable, to bring people back to normal as quickly as possible and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: Look, the JDC had a job to do. </sentence><sentence id="909">And there wasn't any question of weighing things, can we do it or can't we do it, do we have staff or don't we have staff, do we need that or don't we need that, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="910">You just dug in and did it. </sentence><sentence id="911">Now, that sounds very simple, but to use a vernacular, we surrounded ourselves with a group of "can do" people, and they did. </sentence><sentence id="912">We had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="913">There was no choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
