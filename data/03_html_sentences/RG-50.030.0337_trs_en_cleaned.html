<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: Well, let's see. </sentence><sentence id="13">I moved from Elizabeth to New York, and it was in 1917. </sentence><sentence id="14">We -- it was a combination of households. </sentence><sentence id="15">I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my grandfather, and he passed away. </sentence><sentence id="16">And so we were there along my -- my mother with two children and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="17">And so we had to get along. </sentence><sentence id="18">My education was in the New York school system. </sentence><sentence id="19">I went to New York University, got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics. </sentence><sentence id="20">Went to school at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="21">One job, though, that I took in 1929, I was working in the credit department of a mercantile firm. </sentence><sentence id="22">Working in the credit department decided me on becoming a credit man. </sentence><sentence id="23">And so in school, I studied credits and collections. </sentence><sentence id="24">That was the subject of my major and accounting. </sentence><sentence id="25">In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular firm and went into the banking business. </sentence><sentence id="26">As part of my banking training I was going to become a banker and a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="27">Went into the Manufacturers Trust Company. </sentence><sentence id="28">I started working for the Manufacturers Company a few days before Black Friday in 1929. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I guess that probably influenced my career. </sentence><sentence id="30">Anyhow, I was with the bank until 1936. </sentence><sentence id="31">They got looking around to see how things were going. </sentence><sentence id="32">Somebody suggested that I see the JDC, Joint Distribution Committee, and they asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing. </sentence><sentence id="33">And in due course I was prevailed upon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job. </sentence><sentence id="34">The one year out of my life turned out to be about 60 years. </sentence><sentence id="35">That was a very long agreement. </sentence><sentence id="36">I worked in the New York headquarters office of the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="37">Then until 1939 -- I was there until November. </sentence><sentence id="38">How come? </sentence><sentence id="39">The war began in September. </sentence><sentence id="40">It became apparent to me as it did to others that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="41">It is not the primary

</sentence><sentence id="45">I was accepted, and I went overseas. </sentence><sentence id="46">And I arrived overseas in December 1939. </sentence><sentence id="47">My first permanent job, we thought would be in Paris, the headquarters in Paris, where I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="48">The head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper, T-1-0-p-e-r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="49">He was joined by a man by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to Europe at that time to join Mr. Troper. </sentence><sentence id="50">Joe Schwartz landed in Italy, joined Troper, who was going to Eastern Europe, who at that time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC was cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off. </sentence><sentence id="51">While they were overseas, war did ensue. </sentence><sentence id="52">While they were traveling around in Europe, war did come along. </sentence><sentence id="53">That was in June 1940. </sentence><sentence id="54">They were traveling around. </sentence><sentence id="55">The Germans were practically knocking on the door in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="56">I was in charge of the office. </sentence><sentence id="57">It was the European headquarters, I was in charge of the office at the time. </sentence><sentence id="58">After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the JDC has to move its office. </sentence><sentence id="59">It couldn't remain there. </sentence><sentence id="60">Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in Paris at the time, like ORT-HIAS, the French-Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would move without advising the others. </sentence><sentence id="61">I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to move out, having consulted with the American Embassy, who at that time were following up the French, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of Paris or not and so on. </sentence><sentence id="62">Decided to close up the office and to move out. </sentence><sentence id="63">That was on Monday -- it's Monday -- that was on Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="64">I guess that was on June the 8th or -- if that was a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="65">Anyhow, that Sunday around June, decided to close the office. </sentence><sentence id="66">Closed the office, moved -- intended originally to move to Tours. </sentence><sentence id="67">Couldn't go to Tours because the French government had decided that they were going to evacuate from Paris to Tours, and they occupied the city to such an extent that nobody else would be permitted to come in. </sentence><sentence id="68">In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the office, I had to phone the staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving Paris. </sentence><sentence id="69">They came in Monday to leave the office with their baggage and so on, and they went over to

there when I -- as I began to say, in that Sunday I phoned around to tell the other agencies we decided to move to discover that they had already left without telling us. </sentence><sentence id="74">And the JDC was the only Jewish organization, welfare organization, in Paris, all by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="75">Well, Dr. Schwartz and Mr. Troper came back to Paris on Monday. </sentence><sentence id="76">The rest of the staff had left. </sentence><sentence id="77">I had kept the office open. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="78">There were just one -- two secretaries, myself and -- no, three secretaries, myself and then the two gentlemen who came back. </sentence><sentence id="79">We closed down the -- closed down the shop on Tuesday, and the Germans came in on Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="80">As I said, we've started out for Tours, we couldn't get in, had to change directions. </sentence><sentence id="81">We ended up in Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="82">We

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: You were in Europe already when there had been quite a build up, and the war certainly had started -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: -- in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="90">What was the mood? </sentence><sentence id="91">What did you think was going to happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: The mood in Paris was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the Champs Elysees, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="96">And you couldn't tell by looking around the streets that anything was happening at all. </sentence><sentence id="97">And I think that up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going to stop off the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="98">Well, it was misplaced, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="99">So that -- we ended up, then, in Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="100">We moved the office down there. </sentence><sentence id="101">We sent out the cables to all the agencies in Europe with which we had been operating to tell them where our new office was in Bordeaux, to discover later on that the center had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out. </sentence><sentence id="102">They were held up by the center, by the military people in Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="103">We were in Bordeaux (ph) for about four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="104">Government in the meantime had moved down to Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="105">The Germans knew that, and threatened to bomb the city. </sentence><sentence id="106">As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the railroad station to let the French know that they're still around. </sentence><sentence id="107">And the French, then, had sat down This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="108">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="109"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and said, "Anybody who wants to leave Bordeaux, must leave by midnight of a certain day or you can't get out." </sentence><sentence id="110">So we were there. </sentence><sentence id="111">Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="112">We decided to get out. </sentence><sentence id="113">We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the fields, just to get out of Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="114">As a matter of fact, the road were so crowded at that time with refugees -- who were coming down from Belgium into France, and from Northern France going down to Southern France -- that the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from Paris to Bordeaux, it took us three days to get down there. </sentence><sentence id="115">The roads were that crowded with refugees. </sentence><sentence id="116">And we had hardships along the road too, ran out of gasoline and shelter and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="117">So we decided then to get out of Bordeaux. </sentence><sentence id="118">We did that and headed for Lisbon and decided that the Lisbon was the furthest west one could go in Europe to still be in European territory, and that's the place to have the office. </sentence><sentence id="119">That was all right because the United States was not yet in the war. </sentence><sentence id="120">This was in -- when we went to Lisbon, that was in June, July 1940. </sentence><sentence id="121">So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it was all right for us to stay in Lisbon, and that's where we were going to make our new headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="122">I went back to Marseille after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the JDC could do with the French-Jewish population, especially -- particularly the refugees, who were coming down there from the north and from Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="123">Decided that there was work that the JDC could do, and I opened up the office for the JDC in Marseille for unoccupied France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: I want to backtrack a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Because I have a lot of questions. </sentence><sentence id="159">In 1939 and 1940 before Paris was occupied -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Where were your efforts directed? </sentence><sentence id="162">Where were the JDC -- were you sending money into Germany or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="164">Starting with 1933 with the advent of Hitler, we did not send any money into Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="167">We had worked out an arrangement with the German Rifentrajung (ph) and the German Hoopsverine (ph), which were the agencies in Germany with which we worked, whereby they would collect to the extent that they could the cost of passage for people immigrating to the United This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="168">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="169"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection States. </sentence><sentence id="170">They would collect them in Marks, and we would buy their steamship tickets for the dollars. </sentence><sentence id="171">Consequently our dollars did not go into Germany, but the counter-value of local currency, which was already in Germany, was made available to the agency with which we operated. </sentence><sentence id="172">So if you ask if we sent money in, we did not. </sentence><sentence id="173">We operated that kind of a transaction. </sentence><sentence id="174">And when Austria was over-- office was the anschluss, we did the same thing with Austria. </sentence><sentence id="175">And in due course we even worked out by financial ledgerdomain to get money into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="176">We didn't send money into Poland either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: You went over with this purpose? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: No, I went over for the -- I didn't go over as a financier. </sentence><sentence id="191">I went over as a -- as a generalist, who happened to know something about finance, but that isn't why I went over. </sentence><sentence id="192">I went over, as I say, as a generalist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Is that what -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: You ask what did we do out of Lisbon. </sentence><sentence id="198">And Lisbon, since we were not in the war, and Lisbon was neutral, we could still communicate with any of the agencies with which we had formally been in contact with, by phone or mail or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="199">But of course, by mail we would not have tried to get in touch -- or any other way -- with Germany, because anything that a name like Jewish, who would have been -- tripped us ___ in Germany, and it wouldn't have gone through anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="200">And the same thing with Austria. </sentence><sentence id="201">But with the other countries we could still work. </sentence><sentence id="202">There weren't many countries left where the Germans -- of course they occupied everything. </sentence><sentence id="203">So that while we were at liberty to do it, we were rather restricted in what we could do. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Now, being that you were in Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: You, I assume, had a lot more information about what was already happening in Germany and Austria than the people back in the United States had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: The curious thing is this: People thought that since I was in Lisbon -- back in Lisbon in 1943 -- that we knew all about what was going on with the stories that were coming out from the concentration camps, which later became known. </sentence><sentence id="211">We did not -- I did not know that in Lisbon. </sentence><sentence id="212">We This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="213">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="214"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection didn't have that information. </sentence><sentence id="215">The information that was coming out on that was being sent out by Riegner from Geneva, and it got over to the State Department through the help of the American Mission in Berne. </sentence><sentence id="216">And they suppressed it, because they said they wanted proof that the stories that were coming out were accurate, and they were going to hold up the information until they got that proof. </sentence><sentence id="217">Well, as you know, it took months before the story finally was released what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="218">But in Lisbon, we didn't know it, because the Portuguese papers certainly didn't carry it. </sentence><sentence id="219">They didn't know it either. </sentence><sentence id="220">They had no reporters running around loose, going into the camps or something. </sentence><sentence id="221">So we didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="222">And only Riegner's reports brought the information out, and they were suppressed. </sentence><sentence id="223">So the information wasn't generally known. </sentence><sentence id="224">So we worked then. </sentence><sentence id="225">We stayed in contact, which was all right until December 1941, when -- everything got stopped off when we entered the war, and then we were fighting with Germany and with Austria, and the Italians came in in June 1941. </sentence><sentence id="226">And so we couldn't communicate with them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="227">We had to find other ways then for remaining in contact and communicating with them. </sentence><sentence id="228">We got in touch with a man in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="229">You may have heard his name, Soudymiah (ph). </sentence><sentence id="230">His name keeps coming up. </sentence><sentence id="231">He lived in up in St.Gallen in North Switzerland, who was president of the central Swiss welfare, Jewish welfare organization. </sentence><sentence id="232">And he agreed temporarily to act for the JDC in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="233">He finally gave up that position with the Swiss agency in order to devote all his time to JDC. </sentence><sentence id="234">So he became JDC's representative in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="235">And it turned out that he was our delegate for all these countries which the JDC itself as an American organization could not come in contact, which meant that he was in contact with Hungary, with Romania, and even with Shanghai, with France, occupied, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="236">And he did the things for us. </sentence><sentence id="237">Communication with Soudymiah was easy enough by telephone. </sentence><sentence id="238">From Lisbon you could talk back and forth -- you could talk to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="239">That was all right. </sentence><sentence id="240">You just had to be careful about routing the telephone calls, because if they crossed -- going to cross France, that was Germany. </sentence><sentence id="241">Do it by___; they were more liberal. </sentence><sentence id="242">And you could make your telephone calls that way, and even send mail that way in Lisbon. </sentence><sentence id="243">So that's how we kept in touch, then, with the countries with which the JDC -- which the United States ultimately was in war with. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: Working out of France, that was strictly for France. </sentence><sentence id="296">The refugees who had been up in the northern part -- it turned out to be the German-occupied area -- to the extent that they could, they came down to the southern part. </sentence><sentence id="297">Who were they? </sentence><sentence id="298">The ex-Germans and the ex-Austrians and the ex- other countries with which the Germans -- the Germans were at war -- so they came down south. </sentence><sentence id="299">The Belgians came down south, so there were plenty of refugees in the unoccupied zone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="300">Also came to Marseille the agencies with which we had been working in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="301">They were evacuated the same as we were. </sentence><sentence id="302">They ended up in Marseille too. </sentence><sentence id="303">The office was in Marseille with which we worked, they were there. </sentence><sentence id="304">The Ose -- you may have heard about them -- O-s-e. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="305">That's . </sentence><sentence id="306">They were down there. </sentence><sentence id="307">The agencies with which the JDC had operated in Paris were over in Marseille, so we just resumed contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="308">And we knew how they operated, they knew how we operated. </sentence><sentence id="309">We were back in business again -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: So what were you able to do down there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: -- in Marseille. </sentence><sentence id="312">The assistance which was given in the unoccupied zone was mainly a cash relief assistance program, because it was still possible for people to buy things in the stores and so on. </sentence><sentence id="313">And their big problem was that they had no jobs, and what they needed was some money with which to live. </sentence><sentence id="314">And the JDC provided that. </sentence><sentence id="315">The OSE was a medical assistance organization, and they cared for children. </sentence><sentence id="316">So they did their job. </sentence><sentence id="317">They had misunderatret (ph) -- installations where children, unaccompanied children were. </sentence><sentence id="318">And they had a medical program. </sentence><sentence id="319">The HIAS (Hebrew Immigration and Sheltering) -- what the HIAS -- you know what the HIAS -- you know that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: We just had to provide -- we just had to -- we provided them with funds so that they could continue operating in these various fields which I have just described to you. </sentence><sentence id="334">And we worked with welfare organizations too. </sentence><sentence id="335">There was a Jewish welfare organization in Lyons, which was pretty This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="336">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="337"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection large. </sentence><sentence id="338">And the other thing that we did out of Marseille was to continue sending assistance up to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="339">Of course we had left behind in Paris there some Jewish people who remained up in Paris and kept the organizations going and so on. </sentence><sentence id="340">And there was a woman who was active in the International Social Service, a non-Jewish lady who used to travel back and forth between the two zones. </sentence><sentence id="341">And we would give her a sum of money, and she would take it up with her back to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="342">And she would bring back the reports from Paris so that we knew what was going on up there at least and could follow up on their household and financing arrangements and so on. </sentence><sentence id="343">And so that's how we kept in touch with Paris. </sentence><sentence id="344">And so out of Marseille we were able to keep things on some kind of a fairly even keel in France. </sentence><sentence id="345">That went along reasonable all right until November 1942. </sentence><sentence id="346">In November 1942, the Germans came down and occupied the unoccupied zone and so on. </sentence><sentence id="347">And then things became a little bit topsy-turvy, because the Jewish refugees, they had no particular resource to which they could turn back on. </sentence><sentence id="348">And our office in Marseille became peripatetic, because they couldn't afford being around with the Germans and___ looking for Jewish people and so on. </sentence><sentence id="349">So it became peripatetic and so on. </sentence><sentence id="350">But the work continued, and during the whole war period the JDC programs continued. </sentence><sentence id="351">Of course there was problems connected with it. </sentence><sentence id="352">It didn't necessarily work smoothly, but to the extent possible, continued in both zones. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: Did you get at all involved with the French-Jewish resistance? </sentence><sentence id="375">Did you give them any kind of assistance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="378">A: When I left Germany -- when I left France, I came on home leave -- I left Marseille in the end of September, I think, or beginning of October of 1941 for some home leave. </sentence><sentence id="379">And I was on my way back to Lisbon when we entered the war. </sentence><sentence id="380">My assistant, who remained in Marseille, who was French, he took over then, when I couldn't go back. </sentence><sentence id="381">It subsequently developed that this assistant was active in the Jewish Army of Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="382">We didn't know it at the time -- extracurricular activity. </sentence><sentence id="383">And we didn't know that until he left France and came down to Barcelona. </sentence><sentence id="384">So that if you ask were we in contact with the resistance, sure, we were. </sentence><sentence id="385">As a matter of fact one of the things that we financed in France was the -- we helped the local organization -- we didn't do it ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="386">We didn't work in our own name in France. </sentence><sentence id="387">We worked through local organizations, which as you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="388">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="389"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection know is a matter of policy of the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="390">We worked through local organizations. </sentence><sentence id="391">And one of the organizations with which we worked had a business of providing false documents through Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="392">As a matter of fact, I'm told -- I didn't know this until later -- I'm told that these things were printed at the office of the . </sentence><sentence id="393">But they worked with our money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
