<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: It was going on that...that all the effects, all the effects from the people who came with the transport was brought to us and we had to sort them out. </sentence><sentence id="346">And what was uh uh useful for them, that was sorted out and sent everything to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="347">We had daily a few wagons of different type of uh goods which went to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="348">I, for instance, I was working in a magazine. </sentence><sentence id="349">I packed the spectacles, the glasses, the cutlery, the...the shaving brushes and differents...these small things, in big baskets. </sentence><sentence id="350">I don't know if you remember these old pleated travel baskets from heavy...from heavy uh cane. </sentence><sentence id="351">So we had to pack them full, close them up. </sentence><sentence id="352">I had to write on "KL Au," which mean KL Auschwitz, the  number what...what was on the [to goes (ph)] would be the papers, wind it...wind strings around it, and up it goes. </sentence><sentence id="353">Hundreds and hundreds of these baskets with uh brea...with uh spectacles, with everything--items what I mentioned before--went there. </sentence><sentence id="354">So when somebody is coming today to Auschwitz in the museum, and sees a heap of uh spectacles and shav...shaving uh uh brushes, he thinks whatever. </sentence><sentence id="355">But that was only a ver...that is only a very, very small percentage of that what went, that effects we went through. </sentence><sentence id="356">So, in beginning of 19...in about mid-April in 1943, I got typhus. </sentence><sentence id="357">So naturally I didn't went in the beginning to the so-called hospital; and I went every day to work with ninety degrees temperature. </sentence><sentence id="358">That was three kilometers there, three kilometers back. </sentence><sentence id="359">Maybe a little bit less. </sentence><sentence id="360">You know, actually...I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="361">I am mistaken. </sentence><sentence id="362">It was less; because this time uh the Kommando was still in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="363">And...wait a minute...I have to rectify myself. </sentence><sentence id="364">Something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="365">End of January, one day when we went from the Kommando instead to go to back to Auschwitz, they turned us to the right and they took us to Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="366">Which was...that was more than three kilometres coming in. </sentence><sentence id="367">We went to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="368">We got the uh...we been relocated there. </sentence><sentence id="369">We had to come everyday these three kilometers from and to, to work. </sentence><sentence id="370">And then happened that I got the uh typhus, and with ninety degree I had to walk this three kilometers every day, now and back. </sentence><sentence id="371">In about end of May "43, something...I can't remember exactly what happened in the Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="372">And uh our Hauptscharfithrer, who was our uh supervisor there, took us--about five or six of us-- brought out from one of the magazines the heaviest fur coats what he could ever find. </sentence><sentence id="373">The heavy Russian fur coats, what the Russian peasants used to wear in winter. </sentence><sentence id="374">The lambs wool. </sentence><sentence id="375">I mean, sheeps...sheepskin, not lambs" wool. </sentence><sentence id="376">Sheepskin. </sentence><sentence id="377">Such a coat was at least five, six kilogram heavy. </sentence><sentence id="378">That's means ten, twelve pound; and that was a very, very hot day. </sentence><sentence id="379">I had ninety degrees. </sentence><sentence id="380">And he commanded us to "make sport"--that was express what they used. </sentence><sentence id="381">Run, lie down. </sentence><sentence id="382">Up, run, up, run...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="383">He did it with us one hour long, the whole so-called lunch time. </sentence><sentence id="384">Naturally, I was extremely exhausted after that when we finished. </sentence><sentence id="385">So I went uh...I said I can't go back to the next day; so I went in the evening to the so-called "Revier"--Krankenbau [NB: the "sick bay"]. </sentence><sentence id="386">So when I came there, I saw the Krankenbau is nearly empty. </sentence><sentence id="387">And a friend of mine who was working there said, "The Krankenbau was taken to the gas chambers yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="388">You have a few days time. </sentence><sentence id="389">You can rest here." </sentence><sentence id="390">So I had been there about five or six days. </sentence><sentence id="391">The Krankenbau filled up, so the danger came always closer. </sentence><sentence id="392">I decided to tell him, "Listen, check me out from here." </sentence><sentence id="393">What he did; and really the next day the whole Krankenbau went to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="394">Again a brush with death. </sentence><sentence id="395">So I came uh out, back to the work force. </sentence><sentence id="396">How you say it? </sentence><sentence id="397">And for some reason, they didn't want to do...to take me back to the Kanada. </sentence><sentence id="398">So I started again and going out for manual work. </sentence><sentence id="399">And then...just a moment, I remember now something which was before what was actually the reason from...for that what they made the sport. </sentence><sentence id="400">I had a friend in uh...in Birkenau who was a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="401">And I had one of my tooth hurted, so I went to him he should pull me it out. </sentence><sentence id="402">So I wanted to uh show my appreciation for it. </sentence><sentence id="403">So I brought him a little bit of a...of Tabak, cigarette Tabak [NB: tobacco] what I found in the Kanada. </sentence><sentence id="404">And on the way back, they let us...undressed us, naked, and they found the cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="405">And for that I got a two month...two months in the Straf company [NB: Strafkommando = "punishment brigade"]. </sentence><sentence id="406">The Straf company is  the...everybody knows what a straf company...company is. </sentence><sentence id="407">So it was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="408">When we work, our work was there. </sentence><sentence id="409">We was digging uh a channel to...to let off the water; because that was swamp area, a canalization. </sentence><sentence id="410">And we was digging it to the...down to the banks of the Vistula, that it shouldn't be the...the terrain should be dry, the possibility to dry out. </sentence><sentence id="411">I was working up "til here in mud. </sentence><sentence id="412">On the end of the work, my colleagues had to pull me out; because by myself, between the cane what was going there, I would never came out by myself. </sentence><sentence id="413">Only with help. </sentence><sentence id="414">I did it...to our good luck, we...we have been released for some reason not in two months [but] after six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="415">So I came out. </sentence><sentence id="416">So I turned to a few friends for help. </sentence><sentence id="417">So they helped me a little bit--here a piece of bread, here a little bit something to eat, something else. </sentence><sentence id="418">And naturally that was the time when we came back to workforce. </sentence><sentence id="419">Meantime, I had already a few people whom I know. </sentence><sentence id="420">So I started to work; and again thanks to my knowledge in German, I got different uh jobs more or less...at least part Schreiber [Trans: "scribe"]. </sentence><sentence id="421">And now I work, say two hours; and two hours I worked in one small Kommando as Schreiber. </sentence><sentence id="422">In the afternoon, again I worked two hours, and went two hours this so-called clerical work. </sentence><sentence id="423">So that...what I made my life a little bit easier; because as a reward for my Schreiber work, I got a little bit of a soup extra from the kapo of that Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="424">Then...one of my...a friend of mine, he get...uh got a position in the Kanada Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="425">He some...somehow was uh promoted there. </sentence><sentence id="426">And I go...go to...went to him, and told him, "Listen." </sentence><sentence id="427">Uh, Carl was his name. " </sentence><sentence id="428">Say, Carl, can you do something for me? </sentence><sentence id="429">Look how I am. </sentence><sentence id="430">Look how I look. </sentence><sentence id="431">I would need a little bit to recover. </sentence><sentence id="432">Take me back to the Kommando." " </sentence><sentence id="433">Oh, yes, I will arrange that you are coming tomorrow to the Kommando." </sentence><sentence id="434">So I have been there a couple of weeks; and some jealousy and intrigues started against that man who brought me back. </sentence><sentence id="435">So say the...the...the Haftlings, the prisoners, uh claimed that I was working for him. </sentence><sentence id="436">That mean, I was stealing goods from the Kommando and carrying it for him. </sentence><sentence id="437">It wasn't true. </sentence><sentence id="438">The only thing what I ever "organized"--that was the slang expression for stealing--I organized only food. </sentence><sentence id="439">For myself, and for a few friends for whom I could help with what I brought home. </sentence><sentence id="440">I could share with them. </sentence><sentence id="441">So it went so far that they started to uh work against me. </sentence><sentence id="442">"Til one day, one of the fellows came to me and told me, "When you are coming tomorrow morning to work, you are not going home." </sentence><sentence id="443">So naturally I didn't came. </sentence><sentence id="444">This time a new Kommando started to...came in existence. </sentence><sentence id="445">Our job was to dismantle airplanes which has been shot up around that area, regardless German, English, American. </sentence><sentence id="446">And I befriended myself with that kapo. </sentence><sentence id="447">I knew him from before. </sentence><sentence id="448">We worked always...already sometime together. </sentence><sentence id="449">He knew about my knowledge of the German language. </sentence><sentence id="450">So I started there as a Schreiber. </sentence><sentence id="451">We started there with about a hundred uh prisoners, and slowly it was built up to about thirteen hundred. </sentence><sentence id="452">So the responsibility was quite big, because we had to have very exact evidence--every single number who was in the Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="453">In one case, I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="454">I don't know if they succeeded or...or not. </sentence><sentence id="455">But the fact was they didn't came in to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="456">Big excitement. </sentence><sentence id="457">"Schreiber from [zelligbatterie (ph)], nach voraus!"--"To the front to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="458">Give me the numbers uh from these two men who are missing." </sentence><sentence id="459">I didn't have that on me. </sentence><sentence id="460">I turned around to go back; and I saw my assistant was already running behind me waving the piece of paper where the two numbers have been written down. </sentence><sentence id="461">Because that what  happens in the morning before we went out. </sentence><sentence id="462">Every group of twenty had to be...uh their...his...their numbers had to written down on a piece of paper. </sentence><sentence id="463">And they had to be compared during the day, if he was yesterday in at work or not. </sentence><sentence id="464">So a lot of uh unnecessary scribbling. </sentence><sentence id="465">But he...so he came. </sentence><sentence id="466">He gave up that piece of paper to the SS in the front. </sentence><sentence id="467">They look at that are the numbers. " </sentence><sentence id="468">Hor auf!" </sentence><sentence id="469">That mean, "Disappear!" </sentence><sentence id="470">So we went back with no consequences whatsoever for us, because we been right. </sentence><sentence id="471">If I couldn't have produced the two numbers, that would be the end of...of me. </sentence><sentence id="472">So I just want to mention that what uh kind of job and what...what the...what uh dangers in there...have been there everyday. </sentence><sentence id="473">Every moment was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="474">Having a assistant this time, the new transport arrived on the same uh track where we got the wagons where we unloaded the remnantses [sic] and the raw material from the planes. </sentence><sentence id="475">The aluminum and every usable part was uh sorted out. </sentence><sentence id="476">The old aluminum what went in the mills or in the factories, that was recycled. </sentence><sentence id="477">So...and sometime on the same track came new transports. </sentence><sentence id="478">And in the Kanada, they had the duty...when a transport came, they had been on the ramp; and when they threw away their belongings, they had to collect it, pick it up and throw it on the trucks which took them to the working place of the Kanada. </sentence><sentence id="479">But they been quite experienced already to sneak out where is something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="480">So one of my friend--his name was [Juri (ph)] Fried. </sentence><sentence id="481">I don't know where he exists today, and looking for him in Israel now when I've been there; but I couldn't get any uh news about him, where he exists. </sentence><sentence id="482">So he...I have to mention that on the end of this place where the newcomers has to disembark from the train was a little hut. </sentence><sentence id="483">I went there when I saw from afar that the transport is coming. </sentence><sentence id="484">So I went there, hide myself in the hut; and [Juri (ph)] Fried came with...always with bags full of food. </sentence><sentence id="485">I was staying there and waiting "til everything was over with, "til the ramp was empty. </sentence><sentence id="486">So I took my harvest what I had and went back to the main Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="487">And here in one day I had a quite a good harvest. </sentence><sentence id="488">I called up all the Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="489">I had uh twenty-six of them; because thirteen hundred people...every hundred had two kapos. </sentence><sentence id="490">I called them up and told them, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="491">I want your sticks what you are using to beating the people." </sentence><sentence id="492">Very big surprise. " </sentence><sentence id="493">What is this?" " </sentence><sentence id="494">You are getting from me food for it. </sentence><sentence id="495">I don't mind if you have a small vine from some of the bushes here in your hand. </sentence><sentence id="496">But the big heavy ones I want to have, because I need it as heating material for I will let cook for you something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="497">I have the raw material." </sentence><sentence id="498">So that was one of my biggest deeds, in my opinion, what I did in the interest of my uh friends and prisoners. " </sentence><sentence id="499">Specially I didn't know everybody personally. </sentence><sentence id="500">But if only one was saved from two or three uh hits through a day, that was already something. </sentence><sentence id="501">So slowly, slowly they got used to it; and the beating let up. </sentence><sentence id="502">Screaming, yes. </sentence><sentence id="503">Screaming doesn't hurt to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="504">So then one day in August 19 uh...44, we been on the march home uh from the.... We worked on Sundays too. </sentence><sentence id="505">Coming uh home, coming in front...one of my duties was to arrange the hundreds that they should be at the long march. </sentence><sentence id="506">We had about nearly four kilometer march, and thirteen hundred people are walking tired. </sentence><sentence id="507">They are not walking like soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="508">So in front of the uh came about hundred fifty, two hundred meters--and that was exactly opposite the Lager C where my wife used to be this time. </sentence><sentence id="509">And I stopped there, without looking back what is going on behind my back. </sentence><sentence id="510">Just at that moment, I saw a group of girls standing there around. </sentence><sentence id="511">I didn't know how they came there, what they did there. </sentence><sentence id="512">And  during the time I was ordered...making that order, the SS man who was in charge in front of the camp in a wooden barrack, he called my wife in. " </sentence><sentence id="513">Come here." </sentence><sentence id="514">She went there. </sentence><sentence id="515">She made the procedure that uh how she had to report. </sentence><sentence id="516">And that...and he was drunk. </sentence><sentence id="517">He hardly saw (laughter)...and he hardly knew what he is doing. </sentence><sentence id="518">And asked her, "Do you have a boyfriend?" </sentence><sentence id="519">She was surprised about that question, and said, "No, I haven't got one." </sentence><sentence id="520">And he asked, "Why?" " </sentence><sentence id="521">Because nobody wants me," she said to him. </sentence><sentence id="522">And he said, "I will take care that somebody should want you. </sentence><sentence id="523">The first man who is passing here by, they had to want...have to want you." </sentence><sentence id="524">So the first one who came by was myself. </sentence><sentence id="525">So he told me, "Talk to her!" </sentence><sentence id="526">So, naturally, on her number I recognized right away that she is a girl from Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="527">And uh, naturally, I ask, "What is your name? </sentence><sentence id="528">What...where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="529">And about one or two such trivial questions. </sentence><sentence id="530">When she said, "I can't talk like this..." To the SS man. " </sentence><sentence id="531">I can't talk to this...to a man whom I never saw before like this on the street. </sentence><sentence id="532">And except [NB: besides], he has other duties to do." </sentence><sentence id="533">And he said, "Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="534">You are...you are right." </sentence><sentence id="535">He called me. " </sentence><sentence id="536">Come here!" </sentence><sentence id="537">I told him, "Yes, what you want?" </sentence><sentence id="538">He said, "Tomorrow morning you are reporting here. </sentence><sentence id="539">And you have to come to the camp." </sentence><sentence id="540">And to her, she [NB: he] said, "You will be here in the morning, and you will stay here in the window. </sentence><sentence id="541">And when he cames, you will write his number in in the book." </sentence><sentence id="542">Because everybody who came in or out was registered in a book, to keep it very exact and clear. </sentence><sentence id="543">So with that episode finished in that moment. </sentence><sentence id="544">So I, I did my job further; and I joined to the last five people who went in uh... went into the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="545">So straight away, when I came in, I went to my close friend, Erich Kulka--who is now here as a historian, he just recently got his doctorate for something--with whom we are still in good friendship. </sentence><sentence id="546">So I went to him. </sentence><sentence id="547">He was one of the maintenance men in the camp, and one of the few who had a pass to go everywhere in the different camps, when if something was broken down he was the man who had to repair it. </sentence><sentence id="548">He was working there as a engineer. </sentence><sentence id="549">They call in English "engineer," but a Schlosser [Trans: locksmith, mechanic or fitter]-- he was a fitter, or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="550">So he...I knew that he went quite often in the womans camps, too; and I knew that he knows Magda. </sentence><sentence id="551">So I went straight to him and asked him, "Listen, Erich. </sentence><sentence id="552">What is your opinion about Magda? </sentence><sentence id="553">Do you know her?" " </sentence><sentence id="554">Yes, I know her very well." " </sentence><sentence id="555">And what is your opinion?" </sentence><sentence id="556">He said, "I will tell it to you in one sentence. ( </sentence><sentence id="557">Pause-choking up) She is one...she is one of the few woman or persons here in the camp who manage to be still human." </sentence><sentence id="558">I mean, I couldn't ask for a better information. </sentence><sentence id="559">So I started to run around; I organized again a...a bottle of schnapps. </sentence><sentence id="560">Because that was definitely the best uh currency between SS and Haftlings what you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="561">Better than today the American dollar or the Fren...or the Japanese yen. </sentence><sentence id="562">So I got it through my connections. </sentence><sentence id="563">The next day in the morning, really, I went in. </sentence><sentence id="564">When I came to the gate, I took out from under my arm where I have hidden the bottle, put it on the window. </sentence><sentence id="565">And really Magda was there. </sentence><sentence id="566">She write down my name. </sentence><sentence id="567">I mean, we didn't have names. </sentence><sentence id="568">Uh, my number; and uh so I could go in. </sentence><sentence id="569">She was very uh embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="570">She...because she wasn't expecting that I will come. </sentence><sentence id="571">But for curiosity, I wanted to find out what is going on, wanted from her certain in...information. </sentence><sentence id="572">So we went in. </sentence><sentence id="573">She was running away, hiding somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="574">After few uh time...because in after short time, we met. </sentence><sentence id="575">We had uh the opportunity to talk a few words. </sentence><sentence id="576">So when I uh came in her room, because as in her  functions she had the right to have a small room which was about two by four meter big. </sentence><sentence id="577">That her own...she had her own bed. </sentence><sentence id="578">And when...when I saw her belongings, the few belongings what she had. </sentence><sentence id="579">So she reminded me somehow of my wife. </sentence><sentence id="580">And later on she was uh still very uh embarrassed, and a little bit out of shape; so she turns, she had a small mirror there hanging on the wall. </sentence><sentence id="581">She went there and started with her fingers to arrange her hair. </sentence><sentence id="582">When I told her, "Listen, it is quite a few years that I saw a woman standing in front of a mirror and getting, combing on her hair." </sentence><sentence id="583">And that somehow touched her, too. </sentence><sentence id="584">I was very touched, and she was very touched. </sentence><sentence id="585">And that somehow brought us close. </sentence><sentence id="586">Closer. </sentence><sentence id="587">And in the next few weeks, now and then I asked permission from my Oberkapo that he let me one or a few times to go and visit her. </sentence><sentence id="588">Just harmless talk, because everything else was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="589">And it was because the fact was, I didn't want to be somehow too much uh interested; because when you are not uh.... I don't know how you said that. </sentence><sentence id="590">Fallstrick [Trans: pitfall, trap]. </sentence><sentence id="591">When you are not careful enough, it can can bring you in trouble; and that is what we... nobody needed. </sentence><sentence id="592">So the whole relationship, all the time what we went in, was absolute platonic. </sentence><sentence id="593">So the time went by. </sentence><sentence id="594">I saw her about five or six times. </sentence><sentence id="595">And I started to like her; because I saw what she's doing, how's she's doing, how.... And I knew her reputation in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="596">Because everybody knew all about her, everybody in the men's camp knew about her and knew about her deeds--what she is doing and how she is doing. </sentence><sentence id="597">She had a wonderful reputation in the...in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="598">And naturally I was very much impressed with that. </sentence><sentence id="599">And later on, end of November or so, "44, some difficulties started on in my Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="600">I had that...I was already one and a half years there. </sentence><sentence id="601">So she arranged somehow that I could join to a small Kommando which came regularly every day to her camp to do some maintenance work. </sentence><sentence id="602">There was a small magazine. </sentence><sentence id="603">There been a small, uh a few old sewing machines. </sentence><sentence id="604">It was our duty to clean them and bring them to shape. </sentence><sentence id="605">But we always was talking and never did real, some real work. </sentence><sentence id="606">So then came the 18th of January [1945]. </sentence><sentence id="607">The 18th of January was the day when the death march from Auschwitz started. </sentence><sentence id="608">So we, we...uh we marched late afternoon from Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="609">We was taken over to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="610">I tried to hide there, to stay there what maybe I hoped. </sentence><sentence id="611">But then the rumors went around [that] the whole camp is undermined, that there exist a plan that camps uh will be bombarded from all sides with artillery and with the planes, to make it to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="612">And...but still I went up in one of the blocks. </sentence><sentence id="613">I was very tired; because the whole day, we...the stress. </sentence><sentence id="614">We had to "antrehen, abtreten, antreten, abtreten" [report, get dismissed, report, get dismissed] about five or six times during the day. </sentence><sentence id="615">So I went in one of the blocks which was already empty. </sentence><sentence id="616">I hide...I hid myself under...in one of the beds, and I fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="617">Around midnight, all of a sudden I am woken up from the absolute quietness what was in the la...what was it in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="618">And I was very curious what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="619">So I went down, opened the gate; and in that moment two of my friends with whom I used to work together in Kanada passed by. </sentence><sentence id="620">They saw me. </sentence><sentence id="621">They say, "What you are doing here?" " </sentence><sentence id="622">I want to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="623">I don't want to...I have enough. </sentence><sentence id="624">I tried...." "No, don't stay here. </sentence><sentence id="625">That will be blown up everything. </sentence><sentence id="626">It is dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="627">Come. </sentence><sentence id="628">Come. </sentence><sentence id="629">We are going. </sentence><sentence id="630">Come with us." </sentence><sentence id="631">So I went. </sentence><sentence id="632">So I did it, that death march. </sentence><sentence id="633">We walked through uh three uh nights, days and nights. </sentence><sentence id="634">And in one intersection we collided with the woman. </sentence><sentence id="635">We came from ...from a different...they  0 came from a different way than we. </sentence><sentence id="636">And the woman, they looked for men. </sentence><sentence id="637">The men looked for woman, if somebody's there. </sentence><sentence id="638">Relation, friend or something. </sentence><sentence id="639">The woman... the girls went to the SS woman asking for permission, if they could give them a permission to talk to us; because somebody recognized me there from one of her friends and told that "Bela is there. </sentence><sentence id="640">Try what you can do." </sentence><sentence id="641">But meantime a big crowd started; because such a mass of people, two or four SS woman or men couldn't keep uh back even if they would start to shoot or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="642">So they started a big crowd; and we somehow came close to each other and we spoke a few words, and then...to each other. </sentence><sentence id="643">And I told her, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="644">We are now in a situation we know the war can't keep very long any more. </sentence><sentence id="645">So if we are coming home, I want to meet you." </sentence><sentence id="646">And she told me, "Ah! </sentence><sentence id="647">Who knows how we will meet?" </sentence><sentence id="648">I...we...somehow we been so uh used to that not to have names but we had only numbers. </sentence><sentence id="649">But I wasn't thinking on it that when we are coming home and we will be registered somewhere that I won't register under names, but under numbers. </sentence><sentence id="650">And I told her, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="651">I tell you...look when you...when you are coming home and you are coming home, look for my number." " </sentence><sentence id="652">Oh, I never will remember your number." " </sentence><sentence id="653">You will. </sentence><sentence id="654">I will explain to you how." </sentence><sentence id="655">And I showed her: "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="656">I have 65066, is my number. </sentence><sentence id="657">Your number, 2318. </sentence><sentence id="658">These your four numbers are included in my five." </sentence><sentence id="659">She asked how. </sentence><sentence id="660">I said, "Look, 5 - 6 - 11 - 12 is 23. </sentence><sentence id="661">Three 6 is 18. </sentence><sentence id="662">Simple as that." </sentence><sentence id="663">You know? </sentence><sentence id="664">Good that we haven't been registered, thank heavens, on the numbers but on the names. </sentence><sentence id="665">She came some where in East...to East Germany. </sentence><sentence id="666">I came to Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="667">I was in one month in Mauthausen, in the so-called quarantine. </sentence><sentence id="668">Naturally, when we arrived we been uh...stripped what we had. </sentence><sentence id="669">I had relative good clothes. </sentence><sentence id="670">And in my pocket--to our bad luck, Magda got from a woman from Bratislava a check to the uh...to one of the English banks. </sentence><sentence id="671">I don't know where that woman had transferred before the war big money from Bratislava to that...I think it was the Barclay Bank. </sentence><sentence id="672">I am not sure any more. </sentence><sentence id="673">And that woman came to Magda one day and told her, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="674">I see what you are doing here. </sentence><sentence id="675">I am a very rich woman. </sentence><sentence id="676">We have a lot of money in...in uh England, and all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="677">I have a little chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="678">I am older than you. </sentence><sentence id="679">Maybe you will survive. </sentence><sentence id="680">As a gratitude for that what you are doing here, I give you that check of thousand dollars, thousand pounds." </sentence><sentence id="681">And when we met on that place what I mentioned before, she [NB: Magda] told me, "You are a man. </sentence><sentence id="682">Take that check to you. </sentence><sentence id="683">Maybe it is safer with you." </sentence><sentence id="684">Unfortunately, it worked out if it would stay with her she could keep it. </sentence><sentence id="685">I couldn't; because when we came to Mauthausen, they stripped us. </sentence><sentence id="686">They stole all our uh better clothing what we had. </sentence><sentence id="687">And I didn't had...I wasn't thinking on it; and even if I would think it on it to take it out from my pocket, I had not the where to hide it. </sentence><sentence id="688">It was written on a thin paper. </sentence><sentence id="689">If I put it in my mouth, it would be dissolved; and go through the shower and save it, such a piece of paper....
