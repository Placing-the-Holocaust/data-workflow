<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: Yes, well, in the military I was -- I was -- I went to -- I was originally in field artillery. </sentence><sentence id="132">I went to officer candidate school and became -- I was an artillery officer. </sentence><sentence id="133">And then I was, shortly after graduation at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where the artillery school was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="134">I was called one night -- one evening I was called in and was told that Washington, in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to -- wanted me to go to the intelligence school, which was at Fort Ritchie, right in-- in Maryland here, then called Camp Ritchie. </sentence><sentence id="135">That was the military intelligence school and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training. </sentence><sentence id="136">Oh, we learned all kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life. </sentence><sentence id="137">Don't know anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign maps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to -- to know what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those. </sentence><sentence id="138">These were    Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 Maryland -- Maryland maps, maps of the -- of the Ritchie area, but printed in various languages including Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="139">I remember one night that they dropped me off someplace at a place and gave me this -- this map. </sentence><sentence id="140">And from landmarks and all that, you identified where you were and which way you were going. </sentence><sentence id="141">Well, that was important but in -- basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in German, of course, my native language, I also knew French. </sentence><sentence id="142">And that's the direction we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if-- if necessary. </sentence><sentence id="143">We were trained in order of battle, identifying -- we learned everything about the German -- we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their -- their insignia. </sentence><sentence id="144">That was all part of -- of the training and the units, the organization of the German army, what units looked like, what they were, how ba -- how strong they were, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="145">That was all part of it because that was all part of -- of the interrogation process. </sentence><sentence id="146">And so when we -- when I got into -- to the combat are -- zone, interrogating the people was simple. </sentence><sentence id="147">One thing, for example, was that every German had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook. </sentence><sentence id="148">Now that soldbuch -- soldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there. </sentence><sentence id="149">And it was easy to figure out who he was and what he was. </sentence><sentence id="150">So the first thing we'd ask them is, give me your soldbuch. </sentence><sentence id="151">And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that was -- now you knew. </sentence><sentence id="152">And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338"    Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 Fiisilier-Batallion(ph), yeah? </sentence><sentence id="153">And he'd say yeah, and take it from there. </sentence><sentence id="154">Most of the interrogations were actually not difficult. </sentence><sentence id="155">Most of them talked. </sentence><sentence id="156">Now you ran into some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and serial number, that's all they would give you. </sentence><sentence id="157">But again, you -- we -- all of us, I think, found ways to -- to break them. </sentence><sentence id="158">For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend or enemy, respected rank. </sentence><sentence id="159">So you made sure that the insignia you were -- you were wearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank higher than the man we had, and we could read that. </sentence><sentence id="160">So we -- we played that game, it was -- if you had time for it. </sentence><sentence id="161">Now a lot of -- most of it was right up in the front lines, so you didn't have time to -- to play games. </sentence><sentence id="162">And at those times we would just play tough, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="163">Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would -- we -- we'd say -- we'd tell them, okay, we'll let you walk back home, right through the front lines. </sentence><sentence id="164">Of course they wouldn't do that cause they'd get shot. </sentence><sentence id="165">And things like that, and they would -- I don't really recall anyone I could not break in an -- in an interrogation, and I've interrogated thousands of them. </sentence><sentence id="166">Now, what we did with the information, and we -- we -- in my case, being in the front lines, I would -- my targets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located, what kind of weapons do they have, where's their artillery. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I would immediately call in to artillery to give them the coordinate of locations so that they    Interview with Charles Stein " June 8, 1999 could fire on it, and my infantry units that I supported would get all the information -- the -- the intelligence officer of the unit would get all the information that was relevant to who -- who was on the other side of the line, what was their morale, how -- how strong were they, what kind of weapons did they have. </sentence><sentence id="168">And that went -- well, we had a lot of good results. </sentence><sentence id="169">One of the things that I and my team always did was when we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through the area we checked those targets to make su -- to see if they had been hit like we -- and I think most of them were. </sentence><sentence id="170">So, it was -- in Normandy it was -- is rough, cause we were going from hedgerow to hedgerow, you know, one hedgerow at a time, and you know, a hundred -- a hundred yards a day, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="171">But after that, of course, on the run, that was a little different. </sentence><sentence id="172">Once we broke through, it was -- it was a different story, it was easier then. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="575">I had whatever I had saved from my army pay, which wasn't very much. </sentence><sentence id="576">I wasn't working, I had not found a way to -- to do anything and so I said why, why don't I do something else first? </sentence><sentence id="577">So I--I dropped Palestine and I dropped medicine and I went into the export business. </sentence><sentence id="578">Opened

decided we'd go into the export business, and we did. </sentence><sentence id="583">And we si -- decided that the electrical appliances were a good thing, we -- I guess we liked electrical appliances, so we went into that and we decided that we would do South America -- Latin America as -- as our target. </sentence><sentence id="584">That, we had read was good    Interview with Charles Stein " June

-- I don't know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't know what else to do with it until I went to medical school, which would have been -- so I took Spanish and I was fairly fluent in Spanish by that time, it was now middle of 1946. </sentence><sentence id="587">By that time we -- we got to the point where I n-- I needed. </sentence><sentence id="588">And so I wrote up a catalog in

id="590">Not enough to live on, but there was still a G.I. bill that helped us out with that. </sentence><sentence id="591">And it lasted for -- until early 1948. </sentence><sentence id="592">In

we couldn't give any credit, we worked strictly as letter of credit. </sentence><sentence id="595">They sent a letter of credit in dollars to our bank and as soon as the ship -- we could turn over the shipping documents, that the merchandise had been shipped, the bank would release the money. </sentence><sentence id="596">Well, that stopped, there were no more dollar    Interview with Charles Stein 8 June 8, 1999 letters of credit and so we went out of business. </sentence><sentence id="597">And then started an interesting period. </sentence><sentence id="598">I didn't know which way to turn, I -- I'd never even looked for a job, I didn't know how to look for -- well, I-- I knew how, but th-th-th -- I didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="599">I -- so I went around and went to an

id="609">We -- you know, told them who I was and what I had done, I had my own business and all that. </sentence><sentence id="610">And they -- they -- they thought that was -- that was good, so my

id="612">This was a --a-- the two ladies was Nancy and her sister were the designers of these hats. </sentence><sentence id="613">Their clientele was -- were all name designers. </sentence><sentence

not my --my cup of tea. </sentence><sentence id="618">But I worked, I--I had to make a living and I was looking around. </sentence><sentence id="619">And -- and I worked there during the summer. </sentence><sentence id="620">I came home one day in September, it was September of 48, and I looked at my mail and there was a letter there from the Pentagon. </sentence><sentence id="621">I opened it up and it said, dear Captain Stein, we want you back. </sentence><sentence id="622">We have a special project here which is right in line with your experience during the war and please call this number. </sentence><sentence id="623">So I called the number in -- in the -- in Washington and talked to a major and he said -- he told me what it was. </sentence><sentence id="624">It was in the

id="626">And in Novem -- early November, starting in nove -- as a matter of fact, the third of November, I -- I came into Washington. </sentence><sentence id="627">Harry Truman and I came at th -- came together. </sentence><sentence id="628">That was the day Harry Truman was elected. </sentence><sentence id="629">I came into Washington, back in uniform, and I was in the Pentagon, became chief

id="632">And I was told that I was -- but I was told I was going to Germany, to the German side of our project. </sentence><sentence id="633">And two weeks later I got my orders saying report to San

the officer in charge of -- of that unit and -- who said, do you speak -- is it-- you came here as a prisoner of war interrogator, which was one of my specialties. </sentence><sentence id="636">Oh, let me back up for a moment. </sentence><sentence id="637">While I was still in Washington, when I got my orders and I read this thing, that I-- I was going over with the MOS, the specialty as a-- as a prisoner of war interrogator, I went down to what we called Korean man -- what was called Korean management, we called it Korean manglement, and was talking to some old colonel who'd been there since world -- since the Civil War, I think. </sentence><sentence id="638">Looked like it. </sentence><sentence id="639">And I said look, I have -- you're sending me to Korea with a 93-16. </sentence><sentence id="640">I don't speak any of those languages. </sentence><sentence id="641">And he said, well, we didn't asked for no languages, they just said they wanted 93-16s. </sentence><sentence id="642">Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 And I said, yes, sir. </sentence><sentence id="643">I knew there was nothing -- yeah -- well, I talked to this major and he said, do you speak Korean? </sentence><sentence id="644">I said nope. </sentence><sentence id="645">He said, Japanese? </sentence><sentence id="646">The Koreans in the -- in the army at that time grew up under Japanese occupation, so most of them spoke -- still spoke some Japanese, too. </sentence><sentence id="647">I said nope. </sentence><sentence id="648">He said, Chinese? </sentence><sentence id="649">I said, nope. </sentence><sentence id="650">He says, you're another one. </sentence><sentence id="651">I said, you mean you have more? </sentence><sentence id="652">He said yes. </sentence><sentence id="653">They've been sending us 93-16s and we have -- none of them speak Korean. </sentence><sentence id="654">Okay, they said, but never mind, we'll -- we'll have an assignment for you. </sentence><sentence id="655">And I was assigned to eighth -- eighth army headquarters and research and -- and -- yeah, and research, intelligence research. </sentence><sentence id="656">And later on, couple of months later I was reassigned as chief of the order of battle, a division of -- of eighth army headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="657">But the experience there was again, this now is December, end of December 1951. </sentence><sentence id="658">Cold, ice cold, bad weather and all that, and the chief of intelligence, Colonel Bump(ph) when I reported in, I and two other reported in at the same time, said well, I've got an assignment for you, I want you to go up to the second infantry division up in the hills and observe the air support for our infantry, and I'll call you back when the time comes. </sentence><sentence id="659">So we sat up there for about three weeks in the foxholes, on top of these ridges, watching air support, getting shot at. </sentence><sentence id="660">We didn't do any shooting then, infantry did. </sentence><sentence id="661">Watching the patrols go out and all that. </sentence><sentence id="662">Anyhow, we got back three weeks later and came in and I was this -- the    Interview with Charles Stein m June 8, 1999 senior of the three of us and so I--I reported. </sentence><sentence id="663">We came in and we saluted and said, Colonel, we have a report for you on the -- on the air support. </sentence><sentence id="664">We had put our notes together and whipped up a report. </sentence><sentence id="665">He said, oh, I don't want your report, I know all about what's going on up there. </sentence><sentence id="666">I just sent you up there because nobody works for me who doesn't get his feet wet. </sentence><sentence id="667">You know what the war is like, now you can start working on it. </sentence><sentence id="668">Was a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="669">Not for -- for -- not while we were up there. </sentence><sentence id="670">Okay, so we --I-- then I --I started working and th -- stayed there for -- until January of 1953, by which time I have had enough of the war and of the

</sentence><sentence id="672">The other services had already changed to permanent. </sentence><sentence id="673">And so we did th -- by executive order, ba -- ba -- the president, and when the Korean

</sentence><sentence id="675">So all of us who were in Korea in 1952 had to be home and out of the army by -- by the first of April, and the army decided that they were going to get us out by January to give us a chance -- to give us time to get back to the United States and get processed out. </sentence><sentence id="676">And so we got this   Interview with Charles Stein 8 June 8, 1999 letter saying we'd like you to sign up for the permanent and you" ll go on and all that. </sentence><sentence id="677">And statistics later on came out that said 66 percent of all the reserve officers said thank you but no thank you, including myself. </sentence><sentence id="678">And then in December of 1952, I happened to be -- I still had an R and R leave, five days in-- in Tokyo, I flew over to Tokyo, and I ran into some old friends of mine and one of them said, wa -- when you -- where you going? </sentence><sentence id="679">I said well, I'm going home in January. </sentence><sentence id="680">By the end of January I should be on the way home. </sentence><sentence id="681">And he said, what are you going to do? </sentence><sentence id="682">And I said I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="683">I have no place to go, I have no -- no -- no connections anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="684">So I'll just go home and [ll -- [""ll find something.

what it was, and they explained to me what it -- what it pays and it paid more than a captain. </sentence><sentence id="689">And all the perks with it and I said yeah, why not. </sentence><sentence id="690">And I signed up right there and they say yeah, you're -- you're qu -- I told them -- I had to write up what I was doing and for -- fill out a form. </sentence><sentence id="691">And they said

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="948">Q: What did you think about the developing Cold War? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: The Cold War, of course that was somehow predictable, that having met the Russians, we knew we weren't going to be friends, although we were friendly and the vodka flowed freely, but that was not it, and then of course when the Russians dug in and said -- and dictated to us practically what -- what we -- what we could do and what we couldn't do, that was pretty much the beginning of the Cold War, and Churchill saw it and -- and it happened. </sentence><sentence id="951">But there were -- there were many things that -- well, it was a political war, it was -- and political wars don't lead to anything, never have. </sentence><sentence id="952">And there should have been some accommodation someplace, but nobody would give, we didn't give, they didn't give. </sentence><sentence id="953">And I think the only thing that -- that -- that could have ended -- the way it ended was -- it was completely unexpected, I think. </sentence><sentence id="954">The only other way would have been a -- a hot war. </sentence><sentence id="955">Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 Fortunately, it didn't happen, but it was a bad time in history, I think, that whole period of the Cold War, because it had an influence on -- on everything, on -- on the lives of all the people in the world, on the economy and -- so that it was -- it was a bad thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="967">Q: I'm going to ask you clarify the t -- the term hot war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

State Department. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Could you walk me through some of those jobs and what your role was, your duties, responsibilities? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1094">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1095">In--I--TI mentioned that this was a new project that my friend told me about in the Air Force Intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="1096">What happened was the air force was the, in 1955 was getting into the -- the technological age of information processing. </sentence><sentence id="1097">They were the leaders in the thing. </sentence><sentence id="1098">They had come up with a project that was worked up with IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing where the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm, and at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the coding was then read electronically from the film, and would -- and when you -- when you got the right -- right thing, looking for a specific document that contained a subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And that was on there, and that would -- that then would print out the document that pertained to whatever you were looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1100">That was a -- a new way of doing it, you didn't have to have any    40 Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 --any input, typewriter input that you had until that time. </sentence><sentence id="1101">We had to type punch cards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come -- you -- th -- this way you could just photograph it. </sentence><sentence id="1102">Well, it was a novel thing, and that is what they -- they were hiring people to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1103">My job, I became a -- I was hired as the chief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech -- technical part, the -- the contractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we're do -- and we developed -- and again, we did this with the CIA, a -- a code -- a code dictionary, sort of. </sentence><sentence id="1104">An intelligence code, that for everything that was of interest to intelligence, would have a code number. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And then we would have -- this was my section then, readers read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports from all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document. </sentence><sentence id="1106">That document would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and it was available for -- for retrieval. </sentence><sentence id="1107">We had gotten that thing, it took a number of years to -- to do this, we worked from 55 to about -- by deg58 or "59 we had the first installation, and it worked. </sentence><sentence id="1108">We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I went out to help the installation of the thing at -- in Omaha at the Strategic Air Command. </sentence><sentence id="1109">And in Ohio at the Air Force Research and Development command and several other places, and we started sending out copies of what we had made the film into those. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And those were little chips, photo chips that ran through just --    Interview with Charles Stein " June 8, 1999 similar to -- to punch cards running through when you" re searching, but these were photo chips and when you got a hit it would extract it and make a full copy of it. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Or you could view it on a-- on a microfilm viewer. </sentence><sentence id="1112">That was the main project. </sentence><sentence id="1113">Now, it -- we got into -- more into different arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="1114">That unit then was taken over with a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was established. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on new developments, now we were into computer information, handling a computer. </sentence><sentence id="1116">It was all intelligence handling. </sentence><sentence id="1117">I was not, at that point any more directly involved with the intelligence, but with the technical operation. </sentence><sentence id="1118">And it was that, and DIA just a follow on to the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And it was that thing that State Department got interested in. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate unit to start an information processing operation in the State Department, they didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="1121">As I found out later, they didn't want any. </sentence><sentence id="1122">The foreign service offices, they didn't want to have information. </sentence><sentence id="1123">He wanted to have what he had, his pieces of paper and he'd make up his own mind, they didn't want anybody else to -- to shove stuff at him that he didn't see -- had seen -- hadn't seen before, to change his mind possibly. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Anyhow, that was an -- that's an interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="1125">But I got to the State Department and we started, there were about four or five of us that had been -- some from the State Department and a couple of people from CIA, myself from the    Interview with Charles Stein % June 8, 1999 TAA, and one from USIA, and there was one other -- a couple from the State Department, and we all sat and we started looking at what is it that the foreign service -- tha-that the State Department needs in the -- getting information. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Where do they get their information from and how could we put this into a system? </sentence><sentence id="1127">In other words, we were systems development. </sentence><sentence id="1128">And we then got money through a -- probably my most grueling and demeaning experience in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I had to testify before Congress, before a congressional committee. </sentence><sentence id="1130">It -- the man, my immediate superior in that particular thing, was lost. </sentence><sentence id="1131">He and I were sitting there, I was in the left hand seat. </sentence><sentence id="1132">The left hand seat is the -- when you're facing the committee is the -- the secondary. </sentence><sentence id="1133">I was the one with the information, he was the one that answered the questions. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And a certain congressman from Brooklyn destroyed my buddy. </sentence><sentence id="1135">The man was so confused he didn't know what to say and the chairman of the committee excused him and said at this point you're not answering any more questions, but your sidekick answers the questions, so let him answer it and you're excused, and he wal -- had to leave the -- the committee room. </sentence><sentence id="1136">I sat there for the rest of it and I got through it and I got the money. </sentence><sentence id="1137">So -- however, was an interesting thing. </sentence><sentence id="1138">I was noticing that the chairman's assistants, the -- not a congressman, one of -- his -- his office manager, wi -- whoever he was, had an interesting head movement. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And being a good observer, I had noticed that when they asked first    Interview with Charles Stein 8 June 8, 1999 questions and I was watching that, and I noticed that when he expected a positive answer to something, his head would go this way. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And when the congressman asked a trick question, the guy went this way. </sentence><sentence id="1141">So my eye was on him, and I got through the thing, it worked. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I was right, that that was the way, that he knew -- these people know the answers. </sentence><sentence id="1143">When they ask a question they know the answer. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And so -- they want confirmation of their knowledge, and well anyhow, it -- that -- that was -- it was -- it was a sad thing. </sentence><sentence id="1145">I came out and poor guy outside, I asked him to go home. </sentence><sentence id="1146">He wanted to go back to the office, I said, you should go home. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I'll call you later, I'1l tell you what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1148">He said, but di-di -- do you know what -- I said, yeah, we got the money, we're all -- you're all right, go home. </sentence><sentence id="1149">He went home and I called him later on and he had calmed down, and he said, he-hell, I--I can't even remember what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And very shortly after that he left the State Department, you know, fortunately there was some higher up sitting in the back listening to this thing and they weren't happy with him, so anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Well, we got the money and we had the department hire contractors, some of these big information processing firms. </sentence><sentence id="1152">They came in and they started working on a program. </sentence><sentence id="1153">The program was, oh about half way through, and we got more money, because we showed that it was good. </sentence><sentence id="1154">This time we didn't have to testify any more, it was done in the higher-ups. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And they -- let's see, after about -- it was about two and a half    Interview with Charles Stein " June 8, 1999 years into the -- into the program, that there was an internal thing. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Again, there's a political thing. </sentence><sentence id="1157">The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant Secretary of State, who wanted that unit, the other one, th-the -- the enemy there, the other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer operation of the State Department, the payroll, in other words. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Payroll and personnel and whatever, but never anything subst -- substance -- substantive in- information, they'd never handle it. </sentence><sentence id="1159">But they saw something that hadn't -- that got money and all kinds of possible -- and they wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Well, it was a time when my assistant secretary wanted another job. </sentence><sentence id="1161">He wanted to be a -- what do they call that?A diplomat in residence at the university. </sentence><sentence id="1162">We had -- the university, they have a diplomat in residence, that a -- that's a cream puff, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And usually that led to an ambassadorship. </sentence><sentence id="1164">People who were s -- who were selected for that. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Well, he was pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want -- but there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him because he had things going on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn't let him go. </sentence><sentence id="1166">So he changed. </sentence><sentence id="1167">He sold us a-- he sold my -- my organization to administration. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And I said, I'm not available for that. </sentence><sentence id="1169">You can transfer it, but I'm --I'm out. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I--I wouldn't work for those people, I -- well, I knew them, I had worked with them before. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Well, he was friendly enough to say -- he was Jewish, by the way, the only other Jew in    Interview with Charles Stein % June 8, 1999 the area. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And he said, I didn't think you would, but I've got another job for you, if you want it. </sentence><sentence id="1173">We have a new inspector general and I've told him about how you go about doing your investigations and how you can do these things and -- and he's interested in you, because you've reviewed, you know what this whole department is doing, you've done a survey to -- to find out what they need, and he wants to talk to you. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And he's -- he's brand new, he just came an -- an ambassador who just came back and got the job as Inspector General. </sentence><sentence id="1175">So I made an appointment, went to see him and he said, yeah, I want you. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And I became a senior foreign service inspector. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Now again, I shifted jobs without try -- even trying, you know, I -- I-- I was asked to. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And when I got into the Inspector General's office, that I hadn't used before, cause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in -- in very good company, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for whom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment. </sentence><sentence id="1179">And so they became inspectors and they traveled around from one embassy to the other, to make sure that everything was all right, and they were doing, you know, reviewing the embassies, mainly. </sentence><sentence id="1180">The idea I came up with, that sold m-- sold me to -- to the inspection corps was that there ma -- are many things that are overlapping that are not being looked at in Washington, th-the various bureaus, each one working as an independent thing, each one working with all the embassies that their -- you know,    Interview with Charles Stein %deg June 8, 1999 the European bureaus, working with all the European embassies, but there's no -- no connection between them. </sentence><sentence id="1181">They're doing all kind -- I said, I would like to look into that. </sentence><sentence id="1182">He said that's a great idea, you got it. </sentence><sentence id="1183">So I started out on that and I became -- I was doing -- what'd we call that? </sentence><sentence id="1184">Well, the organizational reviews. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And I did some of those. </sentence><sentence id="1186">As I went on, I did all the -- the bureaus, and particularly those that covered in substance more than an embassy. </sentence><sentence id="1187">The scientific bureau -- scientific and -- and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attaches out there that weren't talking to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1188">So, there -- it was a question of -- of getting information to them and -- I mean, getting information between them and not just reporting back to the bureau and the thing gets lost in the bureau. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And the consular offices, for -- of course, there are consulates in every country and more than there are embassies, and they're not talking to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1190">They're reporting in, it's all a one way flow, nothing goes out -- oh, excuse me -- to -- to all the others. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And so I started working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me, some of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat down and we ju -- started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we find out how things were and sort of rewrote the -- the -- the job descriptions. </sentence><sentence id="1192">The -- the job [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I had one particular one that was of great interest to me, having been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at    Interview with Charles Stein " June 8, 1999 these various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary of State for Refugee Affairs. </sentence><sentence id="1194">When I looked into that I found that the man was a political appointee. </sentence><sentence id="1195">He'd made big contributions to somebody and he had a few people in Washington, but his work was being done in Geneva at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. </sentence><sentence id="1196">In the process I also found that there was a special assistant to the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs. </sentence><sentence id="1197">Now here we have the international Red Cross, a British a -- a Swiss organization, and they have a one man office with one secretary who's a special assistant and who handles contacts with that. </sentence><sentence id="1198">But the international Red Cross is in Geneva and who handles the -- the br -- the work? </sentence><sentence id="1199">The office in Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="1200">And this is a large office in the united na -- in the mission to the United Nations. </sentence><sentence id="1201">The U.S. mission. </sentence><sentence id="1202">And I found a third one, a-a- another special assistant for a humanitar -- for -- not for humanitarian, for disaster relief affairs. </sentence><sentence id="1203">Again, all of them political appointees. </sentence><sentence id="1204">Well, I went -- so I went to Geneva and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing and they were hardworking people. </sentence><sentence id="1205">They were doing the budgeting for -- for these various operations. </sentence><sentence id="1206">They were representing the U.S. before the United Nations and before all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And I came back and I wrote a -- oh, about a 200 page report. </sentence><sentence id="1208">This was about a six months affair. </sentence><sentence id="1209">I wrote a rit -- I wrote a report and I said, reorganize    Interview with Charles Stein %8 June 8, 1999 the whole thing and my s -- my recommendation was that -- to get another position as an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under that subject heading and abolish these special assistants. </sentence><sentence id="1210">Have Geneva do the work and have Washington have a -- a regular office doing whatever is necessary in the United States, such as you know, budget -- getting -- getting money and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And that was finished in 1990 -- in January of 19 four -- four -- 1974, I finished that particular report. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And then I went on and was doing -- I think the next one was consular affairs and I was just about finished with consular affairs when one day I get a phone call from the refugee office. </sentence><sentence id="1213">The deputy to this political appointee was a regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with. </sentence><sentence id="1214">And he calls me and he said, I have a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1215">We've seen your report and I think it's great. </sentence><sentence id="1216">They thought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job. </sentence><sentence id="1217">They were -- they were the biggest one, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1218">Anyhow, we tha -- we thought we -- we have a -- we have a problem, our man in Geneva, our -- the head of the office just informed us that he is retiring in August. </sentence><sentence id="1219">This is about the fifth -- I think it was the day after the Fourth of July weekend, I'd just come back. </sentence><sentence id="1220">And he said, you're the only one who knows what's going on out there. </sentence><sentence id="1221">How would you like to go to Geneva? </sentence><sentence id="1222">And my answer to that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don't bother me with details, send five tickets. </sentence><sentence id="1223">We had a meeting after that, he explained    Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 to me what this problem was and I said yes, ?" </sentence><sentence id="1224">ll--T'll--T'll accept and I'll go. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And six weeks later we were in Geneva and I was running that office. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And I'd gotten, of course, I was at the time -- this -- the main job of that particular office really, was handling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year. </sentence><sentence id="1227">That was the beginning of the -- the major exodus from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1228">What they were doing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary agencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the International Catholic Migration Commission, the World Council of Churches and many others. </sentence><sentence id="1229">The -- the Polish American refugee, or Czech American. </sentence><sentence id="1230">All of those, all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1231">They -- tho -- they were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1232">All of them, probably. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And were trying to resettle them in Israel, in the U.S., in Australia, wherever. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went to these agencies for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their job, and make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do in the resettlement process. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And I learned a lot about Russians during that period, and others, but mainly the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Went to one of my jobs and the family was in Geneva, the kids were in international schools, which was a good experience for them, and my job was making -- reviewing the budgets, reviewing their budget requests and changing them where it was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="1237">They were all inflated, of    Interview with Charles Stein *deg June 8, 1999 course, the usual thing. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I was the first -- first stop. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And -- and actually, physically looking at them, periodically. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So every month I would be in one or -- or two, I'd be in -- in -- in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and I'd be in -- in-- in Munich, where many of them were. </sentence><sentence id="1241">In Rome, which were the main parts and occasionally in Moscow and then Bucharest, behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And Turkey is -- it was another place. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1244">Several places in Italy where they -- these people were, and working with them to expedite the process. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I had one critical, really critical thing. </sentence><sentence id="1246">That was, the Kurds in Iran, Iran would not let them out and it was a long process and finally they wouldn't let any -- finally they decide that yes, they could leave and so we would -- wanted to send in a plane and they wouldn't allow us. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And the international Red Cross, I involved them in it, and the international Red Cross was going to send in a plane and they wouldn't let them. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And finally there was a--a charter from -- Lufthansa had a charter service and the international Red Cross managed to get one of their planes, and they gave in. </sentence><sentence id="1249">Now, these people were to be brought out, the -- they -- ere -- ira -- ara -- Iranians gave in and let them go. </sentence><sentence id="1250">The people -- the -- the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let these people into the United States but it expired on a certain date, which was about -- we were one day away from that date when the thing -- when the Iranians gave in and the Red Cross took the plane over, got the people up and got them to    Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I went to Frankfurt to work with our consulate to make sure that these people get their visas. </sentence><sentence id="1252">It was just -- they had to get their passports stamped. </sentence><sentence id="1253">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="1254">What ha -- when they got to the United States was unimportant, but before that date -- oh, this was the day. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I get to -- to Frankfurt and they're processing it, doing a good job, and they still got about a -- about a hundred people at five o'clock in the afternoon, the consul -- the U.S. consul says well, we're gonna have to continue that tomorrow, we're going home. </sentence><sentence id="1256">I said no, you're not. </sentence><sentence id="1257">He said well, yeah, but you know, the day is over. </sentence><sentence id="1258">I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as I'm concerned it's midnight in Washington, not in Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="1259">And it is five o'clock and it's noon, we got 12 hours to go, you've got to finish these people. </sentence><sentence id="1260">He says no, I can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1261">I said, I want a line to the assistant secretary for consular affairs, whom I knew well. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I had done a job for her before I left and we had good -- good relationship. </sentence><sentence id="1263">And he got -- he says okay, so he got the line through. </sentence><sentence id="1264">He couldn't refuse me, so he got the line. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And I talked to the lady and I said, I've got a reluctant [indecipherable] I'm -- we're doing the Kurds, and she said yeah, yeah, how you doing? </sentence><sentence id="1266">I said we -- there's still about a hundred left that have not, and -- been visa'd and your man here wants to go home, he wants to close up. </sentence><sentence id="1267">She said, let me have him. </sentence><sentence id="1268">I said -- handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting longer and longer and he hung up and he said okay, we" ll work until it's finished. </sentence><sentence id="1269">  Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 Well, by about 10 o'clock that night we were finished. </sentence><sentence id="1270">Everybody had their visa, stamped with today's date -- with that day's date and the next day we got them on a plane and sent them to the U.S. But those are the kind of things that you -- the troubleshooting type things that -- that you had to do every once in awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Had to intervene in Rome with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1272">The Russians in -- in-- in Rome were treated very nice, they had them out on the -- on the li -- li -- just like they have in New York, in Brighton Beach, they all live out there. </sentence><sentence id="1273">In Rome they had them out on the -- on -- near the Lido someplace -- not Lido, whatever the beach is. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Nicely quartered. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Then you came into town to -- and HIAS was handling most of the Russians in th-- Rome. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And they walked in and he said -- and their -- their -- their questions were, where is my money, where is my house, where is my servants, where is my wi-- the Russian way. </sentence><sentence id="1277">The Russians were used to asking for some -- the government. </sentence><sentence id="1278">The government gave them. </sentence><sentence id="1279">They were still in that mode. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And we had some serious problems there, the people were intimidated by them. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And I told them, don't be intimidated, you've got -- they had Russian speakers there, and they were -- I--I--I told them how -- how to talk to these people. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Just yell at them. </sentence><sentence id="1283">Tell them to go away, they get nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1284">One more word out of you and you're out, you get nothing, you go wherever you want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And it -- it worked. </sentence><sentence id="1286">It worked, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Again, something they were used to. </sentence><sentence id="1288">The KGB wasn't going to be -- talk to    Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 them friendly like, so we weren't either. </sentence><sentence id="1289">They had something coming to them. </sentence><sentence id="1290">We told them that no, you don't have anything coming to you, we're giving it to you because we're good people. </sentence><sentence id="1291">And in that particular case, and there were a lot of them there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I represent -- see, those were just an organization. </sentence><sentence id="1293">When I came, I was the United States government. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Well that -- that made -- that -- that -- that did it. </sentence><sentence id="1295">When the government says you gotta be quiet, you're quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1296">So we're -- you know, it was game playing, but -- it was -- it was acting. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I did not go to Hollywood after that. </sentence><sentence id="1298">That's -- you know, experiences like that, that was -- that was my job. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And of course I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those camps in some areas, they were not too pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="1300">Some intellectuals, people with -- who had status and -- and now were begging, in effect. </sentence><sentence id="1301">I felt for them, but on the other hand, I was there too, once, and I knew how they felt. </sentence><sentence id="1302">So, you know, you treated them accordingly. </sentence><sentence id="1303">You talked to them, and particularly in some cases when I talked to them, I told them who I was, and I said, I was in your position once, and look at me now. </sentence><sentence id="1304">It's gonna happen to you, just take it easy. </sentence><sentence id="1305">It'Il be done. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We're doing it, but it takes time. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="2225">And one little girl said to me, with her teacher, they all spoke English very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="2226">And she said that her grandfather had -- was in the

the first bend, there are the resistance movements, you find the French resistance there, take a look there. </sentence><sentence id="2229">About two hours later, the girl came back with tears in her eyes, saying thank you, thank you so much. </sentence><sentence id="2230">I found not only my    Interview with Charles Stein u June 8, 1999 grandfather's gun, with his name on it and all that, with a

</sentence><sentence id="2246">We will -- I will -- will tell them that we -- we have to do something, you know, a plaque or something for a person ah -- we didn -- I don't think anybody even knows or

to know. </sentence><sentence id="2249">I read -- oh, well, an amazing thing. </sentence><sentence id="2250">One day I --I was -- I was the information desk, and a man walked up to me. </sentence><sentence id="2251">And he looks at    Interview with Charles Stein (r) June 8, 1999 me and I looked at him and he -- some [indecipherable] looked familiar, wasn't sure what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2252">He said, you're Stein. </sentence><sentence id="2253">I looked at him. </sentence><sentence id="2254">I said, I've seen you somewhere, way back. </sentence><sentence id="2255">He says, yeah, in [indecipherable] he started speaking German. </sentence><sentence id="2256">Somebody I knew in Vienna, and as a matter of fact I also knew him in New York, but we -- he had -- he changed comple -- I-I don't know, he --I guess I didn't change much, but he recognized me. </sentence><sentence id="2257">I didn't recognize him, but I had known him in -- in New York and -- about 1939 -- 1940, I guess, and then sort of lost track, I hadn't seen him since about then -- since then. </sentence><sentence id="2258">So we -- we had a long talk. </sentence><sentence id="2259">Those are some of the things. </sentence><sentence id="2260">Vis-Visitors, I have a -- I have my own personal policy in -- in -- in -- in visitor services. </sentence><sentence id="2261">There's no German or Austrian that comes to the museum that does not go and see it, I don't care whether there are tickets or not. </sentence><sentence id="2262">I always have some -- my own tickets in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="2263">I always save some for just those. </sentence><sentence id="2264">And I've had many cases where I -- I think they need to go see, see their own history. </sentence><sentence id="2265">Not mine, their history, now. </sentence><sentence id="2266">And I've had some of them come back, f-find me again, look me up and -- and thank me for -- for letting them see. </sentence><sentence id="2267">They says, you know, we read a lot about it, we heard a lot about it, but not like this. </sentence><sentence id="2268">I said, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="2269">It's all there. </sentence><sentence id="2270">I enjoy working with groups, school groups mostly, where we go a little deeper into the -- the subject matter, and I'm particularly i-interested in the questions the kids ask. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And some of them are good. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And then I have right now    Interview with Charles Stein " June 8, 1999 still -- still there from last year, so I guess two years now, the artwork down at the elevator, the basement -- the concourse elevator. </sentence><sentence id="2273">The first thing as you walk in on the left hand side is that large picture of the police station in Vienna, the one I lived next door to. </sentence><sentence id="2274">The one I've been in. </sentence><sentence id="2275">And so, after we -- I tell them all about the museum, I say, well while you're waiting for the elevator, take a look at this one. </sentence><sentence id="2276">It might give you something a little personal. </sentence><sentence id="2277">I was in that police station, I lived right next door to it. </sentence><sentence id="2278">I been in there many times before the Germans moved in and after the Germans moved in, I was in there asking for permission to leave the country. </sentence><sentence id="2279">And then I get all kinds of questions. </sentence><sentence id="2280">Oh, were you there, oh. </sentence><sentence id="2281">And, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2282">The elevators, fortunately take a long time to come down to -- to the concourse and so we got -- have time to answer those questions. </sentence><sentence id="2283">Makes an impression, and it gives them one more dimension to [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2284">I also -- I s -- 1-- excuse me, I started this program, which they are n-- are now continuing, o-of the -- when I was on the -- on the [indecipherable] of taking people through and having survivors telling their stories at certain places that they're particularly -- that they're -- were involved in. </sentence><sentence id="2285">And I just saw in those latest -- you may have seen that -- that they -- Pete Philips is now going to do it this fall again for th-the paid staff of visitor services. </sentence><sentence id="2286">And they need it. </sentence><sentence id="2287">Paid staff is, you know, they're -- they're the most temporary employees -- o-of visitor services, are the most temporaries i-in the Interview with Charles Stein .deg June 8, 1999 museum. </sentence><sentence id="2288">They come in, it's their first job after college and they can't wait to get their one year in to get status to apply for another job somewhere, because they're not paying them. </sentence><sentence id="2289">The pay is -- is ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="2290">And so they're not putting heart and soul into it like we do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
