<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: When you look back on that time, to me something that really is striking is that you had been...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="826">A: Then it takes over something else. </sentence><sentence id="827">You want to survive to tell it to the other people. </sentence><sentence id="828">I didn't care to survive, but they would tell me, "Listen Abe, you will survive." </sentence><sentence id="829">For one year, until it was fine. </sentence><sentence id="830">That such an atrocity happened. </sentence><sentence id="831">I owed it to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="832">I owed it to... it takes over in your body, the will to survive. </sentence><sentence id="833">And if you have to crawl, if you have to eat something, you have to do it, you will do it. </sentence><sentence id="834">And when you are younger, you got a better chance. </sentence><sentence id="835">Say you stood near... if they want to shoot somebody, it was you, it was you. </sentence><sentence id="836">There was not anymore... you know. </sentence><sentence id="837">Sometimes it's luck, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="850">Q: Uh huh. </sentence><sentence id="851">But it was almost, it was as if this whole different person, you became a whole different person. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="871">Q: And you described your journey and you described arriving in Auschwitz and being taken to the Gypsy lager. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: Gypsy camp. </sentence><sentence id="874">They did not make selections, because they saw all these people worked and they needed at that time, they needed workers. </sentence><sentence id="875">And a lot of Hungarian Jews came in that time and mostly they put them in D camp. </sentence><sentence id="876">So, since they didn't have any place, they put us for a while in the Gypsy camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="881">Q: Did you have any interactions at all with the gypsy families that were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="933">A: No, nobody wanted it, nobody wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="934">Usually when you stand, you know, I worked that time before I worked in katowe bunker (ph), you know, where the potatoes was. </sentence><sentence id="935">And you had to, there was two people, one in front and one in the back and then they filled it up. </sentence><sentence id="936">You lift it up and you go to other place, you know, and filled it, put it in there. </sentence><sentence id="937">Because mostly when they came with the railroads, they dumped it. </sentence><sentence id="938">And I knew one thing, there was always selection going on. </sentence><sentence id="939">There was selection to go in the crematoria if you didn't look good or if they didn't like you.13  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0004 14 So, you always watched out. </sentence><sentence id="940">Your eyes went the right way. </sentence><sentence id="941">Somehow I missed him. </sentence><sentence id="942">He was standing in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="943">And he said, write down here the number. </sentence><sentence id="944">You know, my number what I got right here on my hand. </sentence><sentence id="945">He wrote it down and they called me out. </sentence><sentence id="946">I didn't know where we'll go. </sentence><sentence id="947">You know, nobody wanted to work in two different places. </sentence><sentence id="948">Sonderkommando, where what the people burned them, you know it. </sentence><sentence id="949">And Canada, where you take the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="950">You told them, "Oh you will live, and it's nothing," whole kind of thing, "Take off, when you come out, you will find it." </sentence><sentence id="951">You know, we had to take it away, and they sold it. </sentence><sentence id="952">But this meant a certain death, too. </sentence><sentence id="953">Say, sonderkommando maybe three months, the other one may be six months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="978">Q: Well, it's interesting to hear you say that nobody wanted it, because I've heard other people say that it was, that they would try to get a position, because you would have advantages of clothing and food and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="980">A: Now, you had advantages, but you didn't want to, because you knew that you would be dead, too. </sentence><sentence id="981">And you always have that little hope, you know? </sentence><sentence id="982">They did not, they picked you, you didn't pick them. </sentence><sentence id="983">They picked me out. </sentence><sentence id="984">And I said, "Oh," you know it. </sentence><sentence id="985">No, I didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="986">I had a little bit of food, but then I had to watch out. </sentence><sentence id="987">Somebody would see me shoving it down my mouth, they would kill me, and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="988">But in a way, this food helped, but I didn't want to, no. </sentence><sentence id="989">So I was in Canada. </sentence><sentence id="990">It's like nobody wanted for the Sonderkommando. </sentence></p></dialogue>
