It's a village that's about 23 kilometers from Nuremberg, about ten kilometers from Schnaittach, after which we are named, and it had a population of 1,100. </sentence><sentence id="5">At the time I was born it might have had ten or fifteen Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="6">By the time I left, it had dwindled to eight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: I need some dates here. </sentence><sentence id="13">What year were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: I was born in July of 1913 and left -- an interesting part of the development of young Jews at that particular time was that the village only provided elementary education. </sentence><sentence id="17">During the first three years of my life, I was in a one room school house which was staffed by a teacher who was Jewish who acted also as a cantor and an insurance agent on the side. </sentence><sentence id="18">Finally, the small community could no longer afford this teacher, and we were transferred at the third year of elementary school to the government school, which was largely a Protestant school, because the village also had a Catholic school. </sentence><sentence id="19">I lived in this village of Forth until it became necessary for the purpose of getting a better education to go to a so called Pensionat, a glorified boarding house in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="20">My mother, who then had been a war widow, had to give me up just like she gave up her elder son, my brother Mike, who also went to this Pensionat in order to go from there to a Realschule, or in my case, ultimately to a commercial high school. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is interesting to note that because of coming from a village elementary school, I had to undergo an entrance examination into the then what we considered preferable the Realschule, a high school providing education in languages, math, etc. </sentence><sentence id="22">But anti-semitism back in 1923 in that particular school had risen to the extent where the director of the boarding house saw fit to transfer me from there to the commercial high school. </sentence><sentence id="23">Life continued as a student and the practice was to go home on vacation and holidays and of course that was a double holiday to be spent with my mother and spinster aunts who housed the family. </sentence><sentence id="24">After graduation, at the age of 17, I went to work in a wholesale establishment for the sale of household goods and toys. </sentence><sentence id="25">This would have brought us up to the year 1930. </sentence><sentence id="26">In these intervening years, Nazism grew, but it did attain the imminent danger of the overthrow of the Weimar Republic. </sentence><sentence id="27">The years 1932 indeed seemed to from my memory and as a youngster, seemed to reflect a decrease in the significance of the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="28">There was an election in Schleswig-Holstein which indicated for the first time a decrease in the electoral votes that the Nazis got. </sentence><sentence id="29">This presented the urgency to Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="30">That changed the situation radically. </sentence><sentence id="31">Immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor, forms of oppression of terror began to ensue not as yet outwardly against the Jews, but most of all against social democrats and communists, anti- fascist forces. </sentence><sentence id="32">In order to give the appointment of Hitler's Chancellor the democratic appearance, the election of March 6, 1933 was called. </sentence><sentence id="33">The disunity on the left and the support of the Nazi movement by German nationalists brought about the so-called electoral  victory confirming Hitler in the position of Chancellor. </sentence><sentence id="34">Thereafter, really, the efforts began to denude Germany of human rights, of civil rights, of democratic rights. </sentence><sentence id="35">Now, shall I swing over the time of the arrest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: Not yet. </sentence><sentence id="57">What I would like to ask you is prior to this period of time, did you have any trouble with people as a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="58">Did you come from a religious family? </sentence><sentence id="59">Did you mix well with your German neighbors? </sentence><sentence id="60">What was it like before Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: What was social life in a community such as the little village or for that matter social life in the city of Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="67">Now, I can speak of it from only a very limited point of view. </sentence><sentence id="68">As far as the village was concerned, after we had left school we hardly -- we only would socialize and to a very limited scale with young people whom we knew to be anti-Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="69">The few -- I shouldn't say few, there were quite a few social democrats and those were the only people that we socialized with. </sentence><sentence id="70">Earlier on, during the years that I went to school in Forth, we would play soccer yet with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="71">That was until say 1930. </sentence><sentence id="72">From then on, the lines were beginning to be drawn much more severely. </sentence><sentence id="73">Now, the question could be raised why would it be called for that a young man who is working in Nuremberg and during the week lives in Nuremberg would go home over weekends. </sentence><sentence id="74">Well, obviously one was drawn first of all by the family and one didn't have the opportunity to one as a Jew to form broad social friendships. </sentence><sentence id="75">It was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="76">My family was not a orthodox Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="77">It practiced traditional Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="78">| at one time through my growing up period had developed a spirit of orthodoxy in deed until I became some sixteen, seventeen years old and I lost it. </sentence><sentence id="79">| became agnostic. </sentence><sentence id="80">Our social life in Nuremberg centered around a German Jewish Youth movement which believed in ideas of humanity and yet we were able to enjoy life, until truly the radical changes took place in the beginning of 1933. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="195">My family lived in very comfortable circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="196">We weren't rich, but to be sure we were conscious of the very difficult conditions which existed in Germany economically where you could paper your walls with the money that was printed yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="197">The inflation didn't go unscathed by us and there was rationing of food and it is one of the few recollections that I have of being with my father after he had gotten back from the war and we were riding out in horse and buggy and opened freight car like in order to go toa neighboring village and buy from the farmer four geese. </sentence><sentence id="198">That was considered like black market. </sentence><sentence id="199">I know it, did my father know it? </sentence><sentence id="200">Probably. </sentence><sentence id="201">So, the farmer loaded the geese on the cart and covered them with straw, but it wasn't a half an hour later that we heard the shrill whistle of a policeman on a bicycle who could move faster than we did by bicycle, not motorcycle. </sentence><sentence id="202">As he drew abreast of us, he forced us to turn around and return the geese to the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="203">It was however, a week or two weeks later when the farmer drove up to our house and delivered the geese. </sentence><sentence id="204">Somehow he had escaped the attention of the authorities then, but  yes, there was hunger in the country. </sentence><sentence id="205">There was the large scale unemployment which led to the radicalization of the political life. </sentence><sentence id="206">Were the farmers friendly with us? </sentence><sentence id="207">Yes, in the main they were very friendly with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: You said that in 1933, everything started changing very quickly; like what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: The changes in 1933 that I indicated which came about were demonstrated immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30. </sentence><sentence id="225">The very following day there were demonstrations of stormtroopers along the street where I worked and the call went out close your windows or we shall shoot. </sentence><sentence id="226">On the same street there had been the editorial and printing offices of the social democratic newspaper which had been destroyed on this occasion. </sentence><sentence id="227">On top of that building on the fifth floor or fourth floor were the offices of people that the company that we had been doing business with. </sentence><sentence id="228">I forgot the name. </sentence><sentence id="229">They were wholesalers in textiles, and I took it upon myself to ask the stormtroopers who had been guarding the Social Democratic newspaper in order to visit the offices of this particular company which was owned by Jewish people, and I was greeted with a deep feeling of dismay and despair because their goods were stolen. </sentence><sentence id="230">Their goods were thrown out of the window to stormtroopers who were waiting downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="231">That was the beginning, only the very beginning of it and you could during the time of the announcement of elections to be held on March 6, 1933, during these short five weeks election rallies of the opposition were prohibited. </sentence><sentence id="232">So, it really began rapidly to spread fear and hopelessness in the circles of the anti-Nazi movement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: What were you afraid of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: I was afraid of physical persecution, of being beaten up and the beatings that they rendered were severe. </sentence><sentence id="245">After the --if you were accused of anti-Nazi activities you were likely to be sent to prison and after all that didn't take long. </sentence><sentence id="246">On March the 26th, twenty days after the election, when I came home on my weekly weekend visit to my mother, I was settled down and we would have a cup of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="247">My mother had a bad cold, but we were happy to see each other. </sentence><sentence id="248">That happiness lasted but a few minutes, and there was a hard knock on the door of our living room and there was the gendarme, who said, "Herr Schnaittacher, come with me to the police station." </sentence><sentence id="249">I asked why to no avail; no answer. </sentence><sentence id="250">I had no alternative but to follow him. </sentence><sentence id="251">That was in what would have been the purpose of saying no I'm not going with you not without an arrest warrant. </sentence><sentence id="252">This is authority. </sentence><sentence id="253">I followed him to the police station, and as we arrived at the police station he said, "Herr Schnaittacher, you're under arrest." </sentence><sentence id="254">I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="255">No answer. </sentence><sentence id="256">I said can I go home to say goodbye to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="257">He said no. </sentence><sentence id="258">I said can I call my mother? </sentence><sentence id="259">He said here use the telephone. </sentence><sentence id="260">It was probably one of the most difficult and painful telephone calls I've had to make in my life. " </sentence><sentence id="261">Mother, I'm under arrest." </sentence><sentence id="262">You could have heard her shriek to the police station. </sentence><sentence id="263">We lived quite a distance from it. </sentence><sentence id="264">She came storming out, protesting, but all to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="265">An hour later, after the policeman asked me whether I carried weapons on me, and I had a little knife and he said you better give it to me  so it couldn't be used as evidence. </sentence><sentence id="266">After an hour I was transported by train. </sentence><sentence id="267">The village didn't have a regular prison, and I was transported to the county seat of Erlangen, a university city and a county seat, and I was delivered to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="268">The warden received me, assigned me to a cell and dusk began to settle and the cell door opened and I was put in to a cell that consisted of a wooden board that we slept on, a bucket, and you can imagine what it was for, and three pitchers of water and water basins for drinking and washing. </sentence><sentence id="269">It was inhabited by two other men, one a communist, one a socialists. </sentence><sentence id="270">All of them were at least double my age. </sentence><sentence id="271">I wasn't twenty, yet. </sentence><sentence id="272">And, so here I was. </sentence><sentence id="273">It wasn't a incarceration that could be in the terms that we subsequently learned inhuman, it was deadening. </sentence><sentence id="274">There was very simple sometimes inedible food. </sentence><sentence id="275">The living conditions were very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="276">We then were assigned mattresses and a blanket. </sentence><sentence id="277">It wasn't without humor and I might relate these two little stories. </sentence><sentence id="278">The first morning and I didn't need sleeping pills then, which I do now, the first morning my cellmates very humanly gave me the easiest job and that was to fill the water buckets. </sentence><sentence id="279">There was one faucet with running water in the long hallway that opened up to the cells. </sentence><sentence id="280">And as a I stood there filling the pitchers with water and I turned around and who was sitting in the adjoining cell but my second cousin from the village. </sentence><sentence id="281">So what they had done was they had the humanity of only arresting the two young male Jews instead of all the others. </sentence><sentence id="282">The other little story is headed under humor. </sentence><sentence id="283">A few days after we had been brought in we saw on our daily walk in the courtyard of the prison which was important because we had no exercise otherwise, there was a young kid, even younger than I was who told us the story that he had been picked up in a certain village as a vagrant, for vagrancy, and one day as he came down he clapped his hands out of pure joy. </sentence><sentence id="284">Why? </sentence><sentence id="285">Because he saw the mayor of the village who had arrested him now also in prison. </sentence><sentence id="286">This is in Germany Schadenfreude, what is best English translation, "spiteful joy." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Did they ever tell you why you were arrested? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Okay, the charges for my arrested and I insisted and finally they were given to me. </sentence><sentence id="333">I was accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government, knowledge of secret ammunition dumps, and liaison man of secret anti-Nazi organizations. </sentence><sentence id="334">I remotely could have been accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government well it was perfectly legal. </sentence><sentence id="335">Thereafter I desisted of any political activity. </sentence><sentence id="336">I had been an anti-fascist throughout. </sentence><sentence id="337">My conscience dictated it to me. </sentence><sentence id="338">From the moment that I had been arrested, my mother did not rest for a moment, until she succeeded in setting us free. </sentence><sentence id="339">That came about through her contact with the Sturmbahnfihrer and the higher officer of the S.A. who three weeks after we had been in prison came to the prison to look me over and after he saw me in my stocking feet, pants and shirt, he said you don't look too dangerous to me. </sentence><sentence id="340">A week later, the head of the prison, the prison warden, gave us my cousin and myself the joyful news that we were to be released the following day. </sentence><sentence id="341">And who was there to release us but my mother. </sentence><sentence id="342">She really had given me two lives. </sentence><sentence id="343">When the news spread by wall Morse code, we had figured out a way of communicating that we were to be released and the answer came back from the two sides of the adjoining south well good for you. </sentence><sentence id="344">Leave all the uneaten food behind you. </sentence><sentence id="345">So, I was released from prison. </sentence><sentence id="346">However, with the understanding that I was to report to police station every other day. </sentence><sentence id="347">And as I returned to the place of work where I had been  working it had become apparent that rumors had been spreading which only furthered endangered my continued peaceful existence in Nuremberg in the area where I had been living and working then. </sentence><sentence id="348">So, then in consultation with my mother and an uncle of mine who lived in Munich and had his place of business in Munich, we decided that I was to move to Munich. </sentence><sentence id="349">So, I remember the date, May 1, May 1, 1933 I moved to Munich and started to work in my uncle's business which was a business selling wholesale glassware and chinaware. </sentence><sentence id="350">I reported in this capacity to his brokerist, brokerist means general manager. </sentence><sentence id="351">He had the power of signature. </sentence><sentence id="352">His name was Hermannn, and I would like you to remember that name, Hermannn, and I worked there in the offices before I started to travel, but I had filed an application to be able to travel and for that purpose I needed to be relieved of having to report to police stations every other day. </sentence><sentence id="353">So, I was in the office and I received a call from my aunt who was in her apartment in Munich and she said there is somebody here who wants to see you. </sentence><sentence id="354">As I came to the apartment, there was a man who stuttered unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="355">He was a criminal inspector. </sentence><sentence id="356">A criminalist. </sentence><sentence id="357">Until, with the stuttering, he brought out the fact that I had filed an application to be released of parole and he was here to grant it to me. </sentence><sentence id="358">I died a thousand deaths, because I saw now the concentration camp of Dachau looming for me. </sentence><sentence id="359">So thereafter I travelled for my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="360">I never returned to the village I was born because it became apparent that it would be very unsafe. </sentence><sentence id="361">Indeed, after he visited with my mother she was called by the village council and was told Mrs. Schnaittacher if you had been here yesterday, we would have arrested you. </sentence><sentence id="362">That was the summer of 1933. </sentence><sentence id="363">My mother courageous as she was said well, if you want to let out your ire on a poor war widow then do so. </sentence><sentence id="364">Arrest me now because tomorrow I shall be leaving to visit and stay with my mother who lived then near Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="365">I continued to live and work with my uncle until the late fall of 1933 and then probably in the month of September or so I filed for an application for a visitors visa to come to the United States under the subterfuge to sell German products. </sentence><sentence id="366">So, this visitor's visa and the exit visa from Germany was granted and I came to America in the late fall of 1933. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: I just want to ask you a couple of questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: My living and working in Munich was very interesting because Munich was a beautiful city. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="405">I had wonderful family contact but also working within my uncle's company gave me the opportunity to meet not only Jews but non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="406">I went mountain climbing with one particular man who was an extremely commraderie and friendly and if anything he saved my life when I was about to slip and he helped me back. </sentence><sentence id="407">He was by no means singular. </sentence><sentence id="408">Later on, I started to travel and I made no secret of the fact that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="409">I was not greeted by hostility and indeed I came back with a feeling or came to America later on with a feeling that the laden anti-semitism in Germany was not as significant as I experienced in my first few weeks of the United States of America. </sentence><sentence id="410">Now, that sounds like an illusion and a terrible accusation, but I experienced here in my early days more direct Jew calling than I did in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="411">I do remember several indecents along a railroad station where young men made remarks which were veiled anti-Nazi remarks. </sentence><sentence id="412">Of course it didn't last. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: When you were in Munich, was it starting to get more difficult for Jews even though you had some friends who were not? </sentence><sentence id="414">Was there a change that affected you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: In the 30s and you probably could extend it to the late 30s almost until the Kristallnacht, even though I can't authoritatively speak for it because I wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="416">I left Germany in the fall of "33, but there was the hope on the part of Jewish business people that it was a transient affair, that it was a passing affair and business was good. </sentence><sentence id="417">On the other hand, I witnessed, and I will never forget it, young kids being trained in the throwing of hand grenades. </sentence><sentence id="418">These were the future soldiers that invaded Europe, the world. </sentence><sentence id="419">And yet, my uncles were very intelligent, very capable businessman. </sentence><sentence id="420">He took, and I'm going ahead of myself, he took the Kristallnacht and the incarceration in Dachau to convince him in spite of my letters to come to America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: In 1933, there weren't yet any restrictions that impacted your movement of your activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>

Trial, I believe he was hung as well. </sentence><sentence id="885">I had asked you to remember the date of May |. </sentence><sentence id="886">It is the end of my story of Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="887">I went back to regimental headquarters and the very next day or morning we moved on. </sentence><sentence id="888">We then began to experience some hopeful signs. </sentence><sentence id="889">The underground anti-Nazis tried to make contact with us. </sentence><sentence id="890">I come back again to May |. </sentence><sentence id="891">I had moved to Munich on May 1, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="892">My division conquered Munich on May 1, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="893">I do think that it might be interesting to mention a few personal experiences. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="894">As soon as I did not have a regimental obligations I tried to clear up or redeem one event. </sentence><sentence id="895">I had asked you to remember the name Hermann. </sentence><sentence id="896">I had worked for him. </sentence><sentence id="897">He was my immediate boss and he was the one who prevented my uncle from entering his place of business and ultimately to be sent to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="898">As soon as I was able to, I went to my uncle's place of business, which had been bombed out, and I asked about Hermann and I was able to locate where he was living there. </sentence><sentence id="899">Having the ability to use a Jeep, not to drive it, I had a driver. </sentence><sentence id="900">By then I was a first lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="901">I drove out to this little town and I asked people and at that time gleefully as long as they weren't involved the Germans pointed at others, and so I arrived at the house where Hermannn was living. </sentence><sentence id="902">He was dressed in his stocking feet and pants and underwear and long johns and I said, in very harsh German, "Go and get dressed, and come with me to Munich." </sentence><sentence id="903">He didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="904">His wife wailed and so did his daughter, but I could be heartless, and I loaded him on my Jeep and we went to Munich where I took advantage of the friendly offer that was made by the counterintelligence and interrogated Hermann. </sentence><sentence id="905">As I mentioned or didn't mention, in accordance pursuant to army instructions and regulations would have been to go through channels, but I had no time for it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="906">Fortunately for me, in the course of the interrogation, he revealed that he was a guard at a concentration camp, which made him subject to automatic arrest. </sentence><sentence id="907">After I concluded my interrogation, I introduced myself to him. </sentence><sentence id="908">I told him who I was and he said "But you, Herr Schnaittacher, should know how good I was to your uncle." </sentence><sentence id="909">And I said "Yes, I certainly do." </sentence><sentence id="910"> 7 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: My stay in Munich gave me the opportunity also to meet the friend of the family, and that was a very joyous occasion. </sentence><sentence id="912">She had been working as the housekeeper for my aunt and she was overjoyed to see me and overjoyed about the end of the oppressive system. </sentence><sentence id="913">Another somewhat humorous experience reflecting upon some key reporters was the following. </sentence><sentence id="914">My division commander had learned that I lived in Munich prior to the war, and so I was ordered to come to him and he said Schnaittacher I understand you had lived here before. </sentence><sentence id="915">We are expecting a bunch of newspaper men, congressmen senators, all kinds of bigwigs that want to see the birthplace of Nazism and I want you to be their guide. </sentence><sentence id="916">So I took this group on the trip and I started with the Odeonsplatz, which is the square where the Putsch had taken place in 1923 which had failed, and the legend went that courageous Hitler as firing started quickly left his troops and hid behind one of two statues and one of these key reporters profoundly thought so nothing more important to ask behind which one. </sentence><sentence id="917">The other little story goes to the beer hall where the Putsch had started in 1923 and in the basement of the beer hall there was an air raid shelter which was filled to some degree with stuff which had been stolen from Jewish homes. </sentence><sentence id="918">Amongst them was a statue of a storm trooper standing on a swastika with a German eagle and the other key reporter raised the statue and said, "Did this come from a Jewish home, too?" </sentence><sentence id="919">This I could only laugh at. </sentence><sentence id="920">My stay in Munich was then a brief one. </sentence><sentence id="921">I participated in the surrender of the Hungarian Army and I do remember at the behest of my general and I do remember that the Hungarian general was really only interested in his men but in his two horses. </sentence><sentence id="922">Memories. </sentence><sentence id="923">Thereafter, I was assigned to a camp in Ludwigsburg near Stuttgart which was an American P.W. camp of so called automatic arrests. </sentence><sentence id="924">This was a very wise law that Eisenhower had released early after combat. </sentence><sentence id="925">Classifications of people would be subject to automatic arrest. </sentence><sentence id="926">Nothing noteworthy happened other than one general who revealed something that I had had no idea of that they were working on the ultimate secret weapon but I didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="927">Then after a brief rest in a rest area, I was transferred to the War Crimes Commission. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="945">Q: When was this, what month? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: I would say that should have been, could have been in July of 1945, and I was in charge of a detail that was screening the archives of the German army high command in pursuing the case of Hjalmar Schacht, the economic czar of Hitler's. </sentence><sentence id="948">I must say that we did not find any important evidence of his involvement in war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="949">Not of any national significance but a totally inhuman story was contained in a letter that I came across from a youngster who very proudly reports to someone in his family that on his 13th or 14th birthday his father gave him a rifle and three Jewish prisoners to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="950">Inhumanity beyond description. </sentence><sentence id="951">We could not make use of it as evidence in pursuing this case. </sentence><sentence id="952"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="959">Q: Why couldn't you use that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: Because we were not able to identify the people involved. </sentence><sentence id="962">This period where I had a good deal of free time, and possibly I skipped a few months, I should go back to the month of June when I had the first opportunity to visit my village. </sentence><sentence id="963">Again, I had the privilege of a Jeep and a buddy of mine, because my driving left much to be desired. </sentence><sentence id="964">I learned how to drive a truck on some desert exercises where we had no roads. </sentence><sentence id="965">As dusk began to settle we reached the village, and I can still see shutters opened and I hear the sound "Fritz is back, Fritz is back, Fritz is back." </sentence><sentence id="966">I come to my house, the house where I was born in, and we drive up to it. </sentence><sentence id="967">The house hadn't changed. </sentence><sentence id="968">Downstairs had been converted into the mayor's office of the party's office, but the upstairs were living quarters. </sentence><sentence id="969">I knock on the door and fearfully a young woman looks out of the window of the bedroom where my mother used to sleep and I could hear her knees shaking because those were the days when an American knock caused fear. </sentence><sentence id="970">I didn't recognize her. </sentence><sentence id="971">She was too young, and I asked her to send her father down. </sentence><sentence id="972">Her father came, and I recognized him at once and he fell around me because he recognized me inspite of my uniform. </sentence><sentence id="973">He had been an old Social Democrat, a very decent human being, a decent anti-Nazi and I said you can stay in my house but tonight we want to sleep here. </sentence><sentence id="974">But now I want to visit the driver of my mother who in my memory had taken on the role of a hero. </sentence><sentence id="975">He protected my mother wherever possible. </sentence><sentence id="976">He suffered the concentration camp of Dachau and I wanted to know whether he had come back from the war and whether there is anything I could do for him. </sentence><sentence id="977">We drive up to his house but he hadn't returned yet. </sentence><sentence id="978">He had I believe still a prisoner of war, but we left some gifts with his wife, who was deliriously happy to see us. </sentence><sentence id="979">As we drove back to our house and now again I close a cycle who was there to greet me? </sentence><sentence id="980">The very gendarme who had arrested me in 1933, plus another man. </sentence><sentence id="981">Both of them wanted to shake my hands but their hands are still sticking in the darkness of the night. </sentence><sentence id="982">But I ordered the gendarme to report to me the following morning that I needed him for certain steps that I wanted to take. </sentence><sentence id="983">In one of our back rooms of my house, I then asked him to bring to me the mayor and again I went beyond army authority and that was being held against me and I had him. </sentence><sentence id="984">We had town criers in the village and I ordered him to tell the town crier to return to the mayor's office all stolen Jewish property. </sentence><sentence id="985">Thereafter, I told the gendarme I want him back in about three or four hours because I wanted to drive to Schnaittach in order to set things straight there because grave stones had been thrown over, destroyed, etc. </sentence><sentence id="986">I went to the mayor's office, who at first was reluctant to cooperate but when I touched my sidearm, he said yes I will do it, I will do it. </sentence><sentence id="987">In order to restore to whatever extent possible the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="988">Then I drove back to the village. </sentence><sentence id="989">This is Fritz's war, and I ordered the apprehension of the guy who had been responsible for sending the remaining Jews after the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="990">I think his name was Britting (ph), and ordered him to be brought to me and I took him again without authority to Nuremberg and turned him over to the C.LC.Subsequently some months later I was ordered to come to Heidelberg because I received a decoration and after that I passed an office where the friend of mine who had become a major I believe and he took me into his office and he said you've got to watch your step, you went out of channel. </sentence><sentence id="991">Where did I go out of channel? </sentence><sentence id="992">By ordering the mayor to do things and by apprehending whom I considered to be a criminal and by ordering the mayor of Schnaittach to restore the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="993">So, I said, "Who's complaining about it?" " </sentence><sentence id="994">The  9 town major of Erlangen." </sentence><sentence id="995">Erlangen, where I had been in prison, so I said, "On my next trip, I will see the town major." </sentence><sentence id="996">and indeed I did and I said Major this isn't the first time I was in prison in Erlangen. </sentence><sentence id="997">I had been in prisoner here in 1933 but if you wish to imprison me feel free to do so. </sentence><sentence id="998">Well, he was embarrassed and then he tried to get information from me, but I used this opportunity to then go to the prison and knock on the door and the same warden was still alive and he said, Herr Schnaittacher, now the ones who imprisoned you are imprisoned here." </sentence><sentence id="999">Well, another cycle is closed. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Now, back to the War Crimes Commission. </sentence><sentence id="1001">The greatest satisfaction I had was when I was called in to act as interpreter for an integration carried out by I think a Colonel Gershon (ph) of Field Marshall Keitel, the chief of staff of all of the German armies. </sentence><sentence id="1002">I certainly felt a great deal of satisfaction when I entered the office that he stood up and stood at attention and saluted me. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Can I think for a minute? </sentence><sentence id="1004">I don't know if there was anything else worth mentioning of my tour of duty with the War Crimes Commission. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1064">Q: How many months did you work with the War Crimes Commission? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1066">A: Let me think now. </sentence><sentence id="1067">At most it was probably not more than two. </sentence><sentence id="1068">I'm trying to think, maybe three because in October the return trip started. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1078">Q: Ihave a few questions for you if you feel that you have covered the war crimes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1080">A: Yes, it's disappointing little because I don't have any recollection of any documents due to the specialization of our search. </sentence><sentence id="1081"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1084">Q: Were there certain difficulties or obstacles you faced in trying to --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1086">A: No, no because in the archives if anything it was lack of experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1088">Q: Well, I want to go back to the liberation of Dachau a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I know that that 45th did in fact go into Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1090">Were you part of the first group that went in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1094">A: I was part of the -- I can say that I was in --I must explain a little bit about the order of battle so to speak, the system of battle. </sentence><sentence id="1095">You have the advance unit of infantry men commanded by lieutenants or captains. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Usually there is a lieutenant in charge of a platoon and a captain in charge of a company. </sentence><sentence id="1097">They are the real heros in my opinion because they day by day are exposed to not only artillery fire but small arms fire and the physical danger which we were exposed to a much less degree. </sentence><sentence id="1098">I was with regimental headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="1099">My buddy Fritzie had gone somewhat earlier because I was ordered to stay back at regimental headquarters and I think he interrogated the wife of General Paulus, the general who was in command of the German army in Stalingrad I was ordered to come into the camp, camp headquarters which was in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I still heard firing but it was no longer an intense firing that we saw in the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I'm inclined to believe anyhow with the approach of our units that the SS took off as fast as they could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1110">Q: Who was doing the firing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1112">A: I could not identify, but I would be inclined to think that it was our men who did the firing. </sentence><sentence id="1113">Any German being killed because of the rage that was in our troops I wouldn't doubt it for one moment because one could only feel the deepest of rage and hatred for what human beings could do to each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1116">Q: You didn't see it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1118">A: I didn't witness it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1120">Q: What about retaliation by the prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1122">A: I saw one incident as I was in the process of entering which I interpreted to be the headquarters or one of the headquarters of the camp and a large group of prisoners seemed to want to tear a guy to pieces. </sentence><sentence id="1123">My false humanity showed itself. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I tried to stop but I didn't persist. </sentence><sentence id="1125">It was not a very pleasant sight. </sentence><sentence id="1126">It was an obviously disturbing and in retrospect and even then I could understand how valid and justified for what these people had gone through for years and years. </sentence><sentence id="1127"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1150">Q: What can you estimate when you saw those boxcars coming in how many of them there were or how many people you saw only corpses? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1152">A: The figure that sticks in my memory is anywhere between six to eight hundred. </sentence><sentence id="1153">I didn't count the boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I went along side them and I saw the horrible sights. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Some of them were trying to eat each other. </sentence><sentence id="1156">There was such terrible terrible hunger and then primarily what I seem to be impressed with was that then suddenly life ebbed out the precision of the corpses seemed to tell this as a story. </sentence><sentence id="1157">They succumbed in so many different positions. </sentence><sentence id="1158">They succumbed to weakness. </sentence><sentence id="1159">They succumbed to the end of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1168">Q: But at the time you were walking by there was still some sort of alive? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1192">A: They didn't come up to me. </sentence><sentence id="1193">There seemed to be traffic all around. </sentence><sentence id="1194">My memory doesn't justify me to say that there was overwhelming joy in the air. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I can't say that. </sentence><sentence id="1196">| was much too short a  2 time in the prison -- in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I think there is one little story which pertains to a young kid, age 13, 14 years. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And it was yet I do believe before we had reached Dachau that I came across him, and he wore the concentration camp garb. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I asked him where are you from? </sentence><sentence id="1200">He said, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1201">Where are your parents? </sentence><sentence id="1202">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1203">Where were you? </sentence><sentence id="1204">In Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1205">Where are you going? </sentence><sentence id="1206">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1207">I tried to persuade a woman in whose house we were to take care of the kid, but she refused. </sentence><sentence id="1208">Now memory tells me that I came across a group of anti-Nazi and they promised to pick up the kid and take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="1209">It was one story out of hundreds of thousands. </sentence><sentence id="1210">It was so deeply, deeply depressing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
