<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="885">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="886">We thank you, and I think what you have done here in this building is something that, it -- it -- it has been needed, and the people need -- more people need    to see what happened, so that they won't let it happen here in this country, because it can happen. </sentence><sentence id="887">It can happen. </sentence><sentence id="888">You know, the German people, the only reason it happened in Germany was because Hitler was such a charismic speaker that he convinced people that he knew more than what they did, and that he was -- his group of people were smarter than what they were. </sentence><sentence id="889">And that he had the answers to bring Germany back from 40 percent unemployment to what it was back before World War I. They fell for it. </sentence><sentence id="890">And the Senate rescinded their authority and let him have a one man decision on all questions, problems and answers to what he thinks that ger -- is best for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="891">The first thing he did, so the people tell me, was after he got this authority, was to eliminate everyone that disagreed with him, by building up hate within the people for a specific problem that Hitler wanted to get rid of. </sentence><sentence id="892">That was religion, God, and his enemies. </sentence><sentence id="893">And he was successful in getting the Senate to relinquish their power and to give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="894">But in the new constitution of Germany, they no longer have that authority to relinquish that power to one person. </sentence><sentence id="895">It must stay in a vote in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="896">So I was told in Weimar this time, because I ask them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
