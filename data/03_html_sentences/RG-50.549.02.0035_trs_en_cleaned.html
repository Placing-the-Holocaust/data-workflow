<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="156"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: And the -- then, from there, they took us with a small boat, all the G-Germans -- this was, you know, now it's Poland, but at that time it was Germany and they took us to the - - to Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="158">And when we arrived in Denmark, they put us in -- in a gymnasium. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Was it the Germans who took you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Yeah, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="164">But they didn't know we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="165">They were -- took us with Mrs. Unstrom, but they picked up all the people and they took us to Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="166">They put us in a big auditorium. </sentence><sentence id="167">and we could go out now, for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="168">We could go out and - - as long as we came back by dusk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: Was this like a -- a school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: It was a school and it was -- the place was called -- the little town was called Svininga, in Denmark. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: And did you then -- you were then separated from Mrs. Unstrom? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom, but we found out that she survived and five of her kids drowned. </sentence><sentence id="182">And it was very interesting, there was a trial in Denmark, because we - - well, I don't know, do you want me to talk about that? </sentence><sentence id="183">Well, when we came to -- to Denmark, on May fifth, 1945, I'll never forget the day we were liberated, the war was over, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="184">Actually, the very end of March, it was like maybe the 30th of March, so -- so I was only maybe five weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="185">Five weeks later, du-during that five weeks, before liberation, we didn't do anything, we were just -- could go on the street. </sentence><sentence id="186">We could -- had to stay in the little town. </sentence><sentence id="187">We could walk around and as long as we came back by dusk. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="188">And we were all in this big auditorium and I remember one day we were walking, my </sentence></p><p><sentence id="189"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 8 sister and I and there was a woman working in the fields and we asked her, "Are there any Jews here?" </sentence><sentence id="190">And she said, "When you Germans --" she thought we were Germans -- "When you Germans are going to be in concentration camps, the Jews will come back from Sweden." </sentence><sentence id="191">And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information because we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="192">And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we -- we -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no? </sentence><sentence id="193">When we first escaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="194">And that was the end of December or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the Christmas trees were still in the people's homes. </sentence><sentence id="195">So we knew it was around that time. </sentence><sentence id="196">We didn't know exactly the dates and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="197">And as soon as we wa -- we walk a whole day -- my sister was so sick with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="198">By then, already, my mother was taken into the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="199">I was with her inside the gas chamber and that, you have that, I'm sure, on the tape. </sentence><sentence id="200">And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that I wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened. </sentence><sentence id="201">Because the mo- most difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there will be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know. </sentence><sentence id="202">And we all vowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and that's why I was back a couple of times to Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="203">It just -- I feel that everybody there was my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell. </sentence><sentence id="204">So we -- my sister -- I was dragging her and she keeps saying, "I can't go on." </sentence><sentence id="205">She was -- she had </sentence></p><p><sentence id="206">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 9 typhus. </sentence><sentence id="207">Just right then, she had gotten typhus. </sentence><sentence id="208">And I kept saying, "We will live, we will live." </sentence><sentence id="209">And I kept egging on and all of a sudden, the sky opened up and the bombs started to fall and everybody started to run, everybody started to run. </sentence><sentence id="210">And I had no energy. </sentence><sentence id="211">I just fell into a ditch with an -- there was another woman, Luba, who was helping me. </sentence><sentence id="212">She was holding me up. </sentence><sentence id="213">I don't know who was holding who, we were all three. </sentence><sentence id="214">And we saw a house and we walked across the house and we knocked on the door. </sentence><sentence id="215">And the woman opened up the door and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped dress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm. </sentence><sentence id="216">And she quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our clothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a prisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="217">And that's where they took all the people, to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="218">And they gave us some food and oh, I was so sick from just having the first -- you know, real food. </sentence><sentence id="219">And we stayed there a couple of hours, til night time. </sentence><sentence id="220">And h-he sat there and she gave us a shawl and clothes and gave us some food and she told him to take us to the Umschlagplatz. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="221">Why she did it -- you know, my sister always says, "You gave -- give that woman credit that she saved our lives." </sentence><sentence id="222">And I said, "Yeah, because if she hadn't taken off the clothes from us and if she hasn't told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives." </sentence><sentence id="223">What he did was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we were and she said she was going to remain there. </sentence><sentence id="224">And when I was just back there, I found out that she died and they buried her right there in the farm. </sentence><sentence id="225">And so, anyways, we went    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 10 with this so -- Russian guy and he said, "I'm not taking you to the Umschlagplatz. </sentence><sentence id="226">What I'm going to do is -- is "m going to -- I'm going to take you to the nearest point where it's frozen." </sentence><sentence id="227">It's called the vikes -- it was called the Vikesel, now it's the Vistula river. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="228">And -- the narrowest point and wi -- and he was on the horse, he was making tracks and we were following him. </sentence><sentence id="229">And he said to call on all our force. </sentence><sentence id="230">If it's wet, we will drown, because that means that the ice is broken. </sentence><sentence id="231">And we should do it at night so nobody detect us. </sentence><sentence id="232">And all night long, we were crawling across. </sentence><sentence id="233">Th-They just filmed it and the film of there, you know, it was beautiful, you know, in the summer and that. </sentence><sentence id="234">And we got across on the other side and he told us to go to a convent. </sentence><sentence id="235">Th-The nuns w -- an -- but we should say we are not Jewish, we should say -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: What country is this? </sentence><sentence id="237">And what language were you speaking? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: This is -- we were speaking to him -- my sister knew Russian, because we lived under Stalin for a few years. </sentence><sentence id="239">And -- but this was -- they were all speaking German. </sentence><sentence id="240">Now, it's Poland, but then it was Germany, was East Germany. </sentence><sentence id="241">So, what happened is we -- we -- my name became from Udit -- Uta. </sentence><sentence id="242">Beker is a German name. </sentence><sentence id="243">And hers, from Wachal became Anna and we were now were wandering and we got to the -- to the convent and the nuns were wonderful to -- but they knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: So, the river was frozen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: The river was frozen. </sentence><sentence id="253">We crawled across the river all night long and we are able to go on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="254">And he said to go to the -- on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="255">The river divided so it was -- where Stutthof was, was on one side and da -- and the road -- there is a bridge now that    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="256"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 11 you can go over, is -- but it's really frozen because they have horses going across, I mean, that particular year, it was frozen. </sentence><sentence id="257">That was also when they attacked Russia and they couldn't do it, because the winter was so s-severe. </sentence><sentence id="258">And we are talking of the year of 1944 -- "45. </sentence><sentence id="259">And so, we -- she -- and we got into the convent. </sentence><sentence id="260">The convent, the nuns were wonderful, they washed us, they bathed us, they took care of us. </sentence><sentence id="261">And my sister's typhus got better, but I got sick. </sentence><sentence id="262">And they said to us that we cannot -- they cannot keep us. </sentence><sentence id="263">They knew we were Jewish -- that we would have to -- they would have to baptize us. </sentence><sentence id="264">We'd have to convert. </sentence><sentence id="265">And that we didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="266">It was the most important thing. </sentence><sentence id="267">The more they said they would do it, which in -- few days we decided we will not stay there. </sentence><sentence id="268">We were -- we talk about it now, how foolish we were. </sentence><sentence id="269">But we didn't know what that meaned, conversion and we, only to survive, to -- wanted to survive as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="270">We wanted to tell the world what happened as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="271">We didn't want to be Catholics or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="272">So we left and my sister -- and I was very, very sick, the -- again we met another Russian, because the Russian liberated that area and there were lot of fighting and took me to Danzig and left me on the steps of the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="273">And my sister said, "You can't say a word, you s -- you're stoom, you're no -- no -- don't make -- you know, don't talk." </sentence><sentence id="274">And she, without realizing it, crossed the bridge and went back to the same place near there -- near Stutthof, without realizing it. </sentence><sentence id="275">Because when I was just there, I've realize how close it is to Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="276">She went to the bridge and they told her that there is a place there -- she didn't know from Wehrmacht, from what, you know, she didn't know of that -- that they are looking for work -- that they need workers. </sentence><sentence id="277">So, we wen -- she worked -- went into a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="278">  ontackrefeeanne@aushariarg tr hither btrmedortabeattfiexalialon </sentence></p><p><sentence id="279"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 12 Wehrmacht station, which is -- you know, the German army, where they get all their -- and thats was Mrs. Unstrom, that's what she had. </sentence><sentence id="280">She had this huge, huge house and she was running like a hotel, or -- you know, for -- a stopover for the Wehrmacht -- for the German army to come. </sentence><sentence id="281">And when we worked -- and then, when I get better, she came and -- and got me back to the -- to the house where she worked. </sentence><sentence id="282">And it happened so fast, it happened within weeks, with the period of week. </sentence><sentence id="283">I was in the hospital, I think, for two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="284">She came and picked me up and we were there maybe 10 days on that farm and then we sailed for Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="285">But those 10 days was just horrifying, horrifying days, beca </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Do you think she knew you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
