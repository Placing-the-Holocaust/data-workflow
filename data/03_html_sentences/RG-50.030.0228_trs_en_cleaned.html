<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How...how do you...how did the Nuremberg laws affect you personally? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Uh...Me personally, directly, they only affected us because...I'm not sure whether it was the Nuremberg law or not, but we had to call ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss, add the name Israel and my sister and my mother Sarah. </sentence><sentence id="130">I remember one incident probably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my bicycle and I made a wrong turn of some kind and a policeman came and said, "Who are you?" </sentence><sentence id="131">And I said, "Martin Strauss." </sentence><sentence id="132">And he said, "Martin Israel Strauss." </sentence><sentence id="133">And I said, "Yes, Sir." </sentence><sentence id="134">The identification by saying Israel (coughing...excuse me please) was...uh...it didn't say Israel, it said Jew Strauss. </sentence><sentence id="135">Martin Jew Strauss. </sentence><sentence id="136">That's what Israel said. </sentence><sentence id="137">And of course I was guilty and I got a...a...a fine payable at the police station and...uh...I'm sure everybody else would have gotten away with it, but the minute it was Martin Israel Strauss, you were guilty no matter what. </sentence><sentence id="138">Uh...And of course, then in 38...let's go back to 36...I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="139">Uh...Schools no longer admitted us, or we were thrown out of schools. </sentence><sentence id="140">So the Jewish community created Jewish schools, Jewish teachers, Jewish learning. </sentence><sentence id="141">And we found that very comfortable, us kids, simply because we were not harassed. </sentence><sentence id="142">We were not exposed to the...to the gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="143">We played football with them and me being a good football at one time created a Hell of a fight. </sentence><sentence id="144">Because one party wanted me as a good football player, and the other party said, "We're not playing with any Jews." </sentence><sentence id="145">So a big fight erupted between the two football teams because the Jew Strauss was going to be on that team and they didn't want him on that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="146">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="147"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection team. </sentence><sentence id="148">Uh... These things as kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an impression, but they don't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="149">It was more important to play football, than it was the racial incident. </sentence><sentence id="150">And that's how we slowly became accustomed to being...let's say...inferior people but living with it. </sentence><sentence id="151">It's a system. </sentence><sentence id="152">But then many of my father's friends, Thank God, lost their occupation and couldn't practice any more and that gave them an impetus to leave Germany, thusly saving their lives. </sentence><sentence id="153">But my father and many others was quite wealthy, very wealthy indeed, and he said, "Hitler is going to go away. </sentence><sentence id="154">We're going to wait. </sentence><sentence id="155">Even if I cannot sell...sell my oil to many people who would not buy from me, there is still some big concerns who want to buy from me because I have something very special." </sentence><sentence id="156">And he said, "We will overcome and we will last longer than this nut, Hitler, will." </sentence><sentence id="157">And thusly we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="158">My father being the patriot of the family....he had 8 brothers and sisters, followed his example even though they were not that well off, but they were in the country and they were farmers and they were animal...uh...breeders. </sentence><sentence id="159">They had enough to eat, and they were living off the farm, and they didn't need much. </sentence><sentence id="160">They said, "If Leopold Strauss doesn't leave, I don't have to leave either." </sentence><sentence id="161">And I am ashamed and with great sorrow, I must say that my father to his dying day had nightmares of guilt of not having sent his 8 brothers and sisters, their families and their children out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="162">Meaning they all perished. </sentence><sentence id="163">There are 24, maybe 26. </sentence><sentence id="164">We are not totally sure. </sentence><sentence id="165">But 24 confirmed people who died in the Holocaust because they could not leave after it was too late, meaning 1939. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh...We have confirmation of various concentration camps where they perished. </sentence><sentence id="167">They were 8 brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their children amounting to a minimum of 24 people. </sentence><sentence id="168">They are all confirmed. </sentence><sentence id="169">That's on my father's side. </sentence><sentence id="170">On my mother's side, many of them escaped because they were smart enough to leave. </sentence><sentence id="171">From 36 to 39, which is a...uh...period of strengthening, growing anti- Semitism, growing laws, growing persecution...uh...they took away automobiles. </sentence><sentence id="172">You could not own a car anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in Leipzig who had permission to have an automobile because (a) he had lost his leg in World War I. He was a decorated veteran. </sentence><sentence id="173">He had connections to city hall, and he was permitted to keep an automobile, the only one in a city of large proportions. </sentence><sentence id="174">Everybody else had to take the street car, provided he stands up. </sentence><sentence id="175">You could not sit down in a street car. </sentence><sentence id="176">Of course, that leads to little shoving matches, shouting matches...uh...but we got used to it. </sentence><sentence id="177">It's a condition that...that's so unbelievable where the human dignity has been taken away from each individual. </sentence><sentence id="178">A little chip at a time until the time came that you had to walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the gutter because you couldn't walk on the side...sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="179">And...uh...a little chip at a time until you're just totally dehumanized and become nothing. </sentence><sentence id="180">But it happens step by step. </sentence><sentence id="181">It isn't a process that happens over night, and if I may inject a little bit of personal thoughts on this, the German people also were conditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward hitting the people, and they weren't all anti-Semites at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were taught to be anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="183">There were newspapers, the Sturmer, which is...I am sure we still have records of these, that had propaganda that even we, as children, laughed about. </sentence><sentence id="184">But many grownups took it as...as the truth. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I...I still remember about Passover where they accused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me a second please. </sentence><sentence id="186">You can edit it out. </sentence><sentence id="187">Uh...Where the the Sturmer, the newspaper showed Jews killing kids for Pass...for Passover. </sentence><sentence id="188">We laughed about it. </sentence><sentence id="189">But I am sure that many other people took it serious and accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="190">So life was tolerable because we had enough funds, and lucky This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="191">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="192"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection we...those that didn't have any funds tried to get out. </sentence><sentence id="193">All ended up in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="194">And we're getting...I'm sure there...there are many other periods in between, but right now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want to retrench then for a second. </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh...We had our Jewish schools and we felt very comfortable because we were together and nobody harassed us when we went to school, and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we studied religion where we could, but we also had a lot of Polish Jewish teachers. </sentence><sentence id="196">And there came a day...I don't know the exact date...where suddenly all Polish Jews were rounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on trains or on trucks and shoved back into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="197">That day I remember quite clearly. </sentence><sentence id="198">We lost many of our teachers. </sentence><sentence id="199">One thing we lost our English teacher. </sentence><sentence id="200">I remember we lost our Math teacher, the two primary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I remember distinctly the day when it happened. </sentence><sentence id="201">The teachers were rounded up, put on trucks and shoved out. </sentence><sentence id="202">My teacher...uh...asked me to please go to her house and fetch a little suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="203">We were very close to the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="204">She was often at our house, which is the custom you know. </sentence><sentence id="205">The teacher is the honored person in a...was the honored person, was always taken in Friday night dinners and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="206">Any how...uh...I ran to the teacher's house and got a little suitcase and threw it over a fence to her prior to her getting on to a truck. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I was school yard. </sentence><sentence id="208">I fetched her little valise with some stuff that she told me to bring, threw it over the fence, and she had it. </sentence><sentence id="209">Whatever it meant. </sentence><sentence id="210">It was totally meaningless, but one of those acts of desperation and...uh...she went off to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="211">Somehow, it is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out of Poland, went to England, became teacher in England, and now lives in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="212">It was a miracle happened. </sentence><sentence id="213">How she got out I...I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="214">In any event, we lost a great deal of our teaching staff, and the school after that was not any more because there were substitute teachers. </sentence><sentence id="215">They were lay...lay teachers. </sentence><sentence id="216">The school didn't function like it should. </sentence><sentence id="217">Uh... Things got worse and...and harassment was...were on the increase, but our parents shielded us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
