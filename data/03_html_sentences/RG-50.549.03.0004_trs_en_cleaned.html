<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: I will summarize the story of how you met your wife, because it is a long one -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: -- and we have only 15 minutes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: But I would like to talk about afterwards, so what -- so when -- once you had taken care of the columns, that was disconnected, the -- Krakew was saved, what were the other jobs? </sentence><sentence id="77">You had a lot of work to do. </sentence><sentence id="78">What was basically ho -- what did you work, and -- and what was the situation in Krakow, and what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: Well, Krakow was -- luckily Krakew was not touched. </sentence><sentence id="83">It was not destroyed y -- like other towns. </sentence><sentence id="84">Like Warsaw for instance, was 90 percent destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="85">Krakew was not destroyed and this is in the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because the Germans prepared for a destruction, and they prepared 287 colu -- places where -- were mined, and the 287 I remember distinctly because this was our main em -- th -- main thing to eliminate those things. </sentence><sentence id="86">So Krakew wasn't destroyed, but our -- our da -- duty, what we had to do the first thing, we had to clin -- to get rid of the people who   7 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 collaborated with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="87">Mostly Germans they left, the army left, but there were some who remained. </sentence><sentence id="88">But the people who collaborated, now they were Polish people, but during the German occupation they made out papers, and they find ways that their grandfather was from Germany, or great grandfather was a colonist. </sentence><sentence id="89">And e -- sometimes even if it was not true. </sentence><sentence id="90">They wanted to do it, why? </sentence><sentence id="91">Because doing this they became ethnic Germans, and the German gave them bigger ration cards, they could get a nicer apartment and they could get a good job. </sentence><sentence id="92">Even the Polish people who were sent away to concentration camps, and they were -- didn't have the rice, they had more rice, and they were the elite during the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="93">Now, as the Germans left, those people tried to be back Poles, because actually they were Poles, they were traitors. </sentence><sentence id="94">So naturally our aim was to find out, to interrogate them, and to find them. </sentence><sentence id="95">If they came from different towns, if they started having new papers. </sentence><sentence id="96">So mostly this was our aim, and this was also for the security of the government not to have enemies in our place. </sentence><sentence id="97">So this was the main things that we had to have. </sentence><sentence id="98">Then I got an -- a special job. </sentence><sentence id="99">This was -- now we occupied Krakow, officially occupation was the 19" of January, 1945.This was official date. </sentence><sentence id="100">I was two days before in Krakow, but this was the official date when Krakew was occupied do -- by the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="101">And -- and the only Polish unit was our unit that we came in and that we were the -- the first who were in Krakow, and the people looked up to us that we are the liberators. </sentence><sentence id="102">In beginning, or i-i-   8 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 in th -- in beginning of February, a group came from England, and this was the -- organization to study the crimes of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="103">And the head of this group was Hewlett Johns -- Johnson. </sentence><sentence id="104">He was the Dean of Canterbury from England. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was a archbishop and he was the head. </sentence><sentence id="106">And he had in his group mostly professors from different universities, from countries who were not a g -- who -- who didn't work with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="107">Like in Europe a lot of countries collaborated, and they had armies like Hungary, Romania. </sentence><sentence id="108">Those were professors from places that they were always against the Germans, or the Germans were occupying their countries. </sentence><sentence id="109">We had professors from Russia, from England, from -- from Argentina, from all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="110">And I was assigned that I was to prepare -- I had to prepare every day's activity for this group where to go. </sentence><sentence id="111">We went to all concentration camps, to -- like for instance, in Auschwitz, we were in Auschwitz maybe two weeks after Auschwitz was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="112">Everything was fresh. </sentence><sentence id="113">The de -- the destruction of the crematoriums, they we -- still were hot from -- from -- from fire. </sentence><sentence id="114">The clothing of the people that they were -- were killed, and they were still, the blood was still soft, because it wasn't dry up. </sentence><sentence id="115">And then th-the -- the warehouses from children's shoes, and eyeglasses, and [indecipherable] and all those thing. </sentence><sentence id="116">This was just in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="117">And we found in Auschwitz also, about 20 to thir -- 25,000 people who couldn't be sent out with the death marches like they did before the Russians occupied. </sentence><sentence id="118">So I went with this group for about four, five weeks. </sentence><sentence id="119">  9 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 Every day we -- the headquarters were in Krakew in the hotel, and my job was to prepare the itinerary for the next day. </sentence><sentence id="120">Where to go, how to go, to have the cars and the transportation for the group. </sentence><sentence id="121">And because I spoke a little English, so they picked me out and I was the one that I explained to the man who was in charge of transportation from the Dean of Canterbury, and with him, too, and I brought them over to all those places. </sentence><sentence id="122">During the times that we went to the concentration camps, there was a other aim, was the Polish government wanted, is to show them how the people are very happy with the communists who came in. </sentence><sentence id="123">Now this, everything was staged, nothing was the truth. </sentence><sentence id="124">Th -- th -- the -- Hewlett Johnson, the archbishop later had a nickname, the Red Dean, because everything -- he was very much pro-Russia. </sentence><sentence id="125">When he went, for instance to Korea in this -- later, and always he went to investigate, but he always was pro-Russia. </sentence><sentence id="126">So what my -- my job was to -- to stage -- like, for instance, we went to a place, to a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="127">On the spo -- on the way, when we saw there a group of Polish peasants, and they were dressed in the Polish traditional clothing, which i -- this was all staged. </sentence><sentence id="128">So I said to him, "Well, let's find out, let's stop and find out from the people what they think about the new regime." </sentence><sentence id="129">Because they started to take away land from the landowners, and gave them away to the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="130">So we stopped, and I asked them in Polish, and it was translated. </sentence><sentence id="131">Now those were not peasants that we met occa -- special we met. </sentence><sentence id="132">Those were people who were told to be on this spot, dressed  10 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 like peasants and they had all kind of m -- pitchforks and other things what peasants use. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I said to him, oh there are peasants, it's good to find out. </sentence><sentence id="134">Now, they were prepared, those were people who were from the government. </sentence><sentence id="135">Tho -- there were -- who belonged to the communist eg -- organizations. </sentence><sentence id="136">And they were prepared what they will be asked, and what they should a -- was -- wa -- should answer. </sentence><sentence id="137">And naturally all of them said how happy they are, that before the war they were discriminated, the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="138">And now they come in and the government is so good for the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="139">And they took away from the very rich people, who never took care on their fields, and they divided, they gave. </sentence><sentence id="140">And she -- they praised -- they praised there the [indecipherable].And this was everything -- naturally they made the film, and they made pictures, and this was later shown in -- in newsreels, how the Polish population, the peasants are very, very happy with it. </sentence><sentence id="141">But this -- everything was staged. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: I want to ask you just one more question about Krakew. </sentence><sentence id="212">You also were involved to some degree in -- in food and relief efforts, right, because [indecipherable] people were coming back </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Yeah, I was -- not officially. </sentence><sentence id="214">Officially I couldn't be ra -- i-involved because the first thing, I was not a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="215">I -- in this time I was not -- Tadeusz Zaleski, a Polish Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="216">And the second thing, our job was not to -- to give food to the people, to help people. </sentence><sentence id="217">Our job was to find out collaborators and other things, but through my future </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="223">   11 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 wife, because I started to bring her food right the next day when I met her, because there -- there was no -- you couldn't buy food, and people didn't have food. </sentence><sentence id="224">So I use -- and we had everything, because in the army we had everything, so I use -- I took my adjutant or some, and I used to send to her every day, bread and salami and butter and other things. </sentence><sentence id="225">Now, when the people who came out from hiding -- you didn't have yet people from concentration camps, because it took a few weeks til they started to come in. </sentence><sentence id="226">But people came out from hiding, they were hungry, and they were -- they were in hiding for -- for two years, for y -- year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="227">They find out that there is a -- somebody who survived and he is Jewish and he has food. </sentence><sentence id="228">So they started to come to her and asked her for -- for -- for food, and she was glad to give it to them. </sentence><sentence id="229">Now, as she gave them the food, naturally, she notified me. </sentence><sentence id="230">I didn't see her so often in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="231">She notified me she needs more, she needs more, and I n -- not officially, sent her all kind, and she just -- and she gave it away. </sentence><sentence id="232">Also, I gave her a lot of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="233">As we took over a lot of apartments, where Germans left, or people who were collaborators were arrested, we confiscated their apartments, and we had all the things from their apartments, so I could give it to her, and she used to distribute to the people who came ba -- with their -- with their concentration clothing -- they didn't -- it was winter, because this was in January, February, it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="234">So I gave it to her and I was very happy and the people find out, and wa -- once somebody find out, there  12 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 were more and more and more, [indecipherable] I gave it her, she gave it -- she give it -- give it away, and I was very happy I could do it, unofficially. </sentence><sentence id="235">Then later I also find out that there was a woman, and there is a film made about it. </sentence><sentence id="236">They called it, "My Hundred Children." </sentence><sentence id="237">And this woman collected children who were left for -- fo -- after fa -- they were hidden, and also a lot of Polish people who took in the children to hide, and they were promised money after the war, and then later they find out that the parents are killed, nobody came back, so they abandoned the children. </sentence><sentence id="238">And the children didn't have where to go. </sentence><sentence id="239">So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those children, there was one woman special, and she is in -- in the book th -- what they wrote, "My Hundred Children." </sentence><sentence id="240">She collected chil -- she lost all her family, so she collected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee, and they were on -- they had that [indecipherable], but she didn't had wa -- what -- how to feed them. </sentence><sentence id="241">So she find out about me, because when I came to Krakow, and I went right away to two leaders of Krakow, one was -- his name was -- he was involved with the Jewish committee, he was a lawyer before the war, his name was Stulbackt. </sentence><sentence id="242">And then it was a rabbi who survived the war, not from Krak6w, but he kra -- remained, and he was in Krakow, and he was like the official rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="243">His name was Steinberg. </sentence><sentence id="244">So I came to them and I told them, "Listen, I am a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="245">Nobody knows that I am a Jew, but I want you should know. </sentence><sentence id="246">Any time you have a problem, and I am in the government, and I   13 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 have a big position. </sentence><sentence id="247">If you need something, please tell me, not official, and I will do what I can do." </sentence><sentence id="248">In this what I -- they always came to me and the brought me problems, and -- and I have -- and now -- in -- in my new books that I writing now, "Treasure of Jewish Memories," I'm describing those episodes fr -- from the -- what a -- for -- from this time. </sentence><sentence id="249">So when -- when I find out that the children are there, they didn't have what to wear, they didn't have what to eat, so I sco -- I-I couldn't give them money, and I -- so we had a lot of sugar. </sentence><sentence id="250">And because sugar the Germans th -- had the sugar in warehouses and we took it over. </sentence><sentence id="251">So I told this woman, I cannot give you money, but if you have a truck -- I cannot deliver it -- you can come and pick out and I can give you as much sugar as you want, and later you sell the sugar. </sentence><sentence id="252">So this way they could support themselves. </sentence><sentence id="253">Then later they needed some clothing. </sentence><sentence id="254">And we took away from Germany two large warehouses, because the Germans had warehouses for underwear, shirts and other things, for the Germans, because everything was on ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="255">Now the Poles didn't get anything, but the Germans got -- oh, and those were I find out where the warehouses are, because when the germ -- before the Germans left, they put all this material in two houses in basements. </sentence><sentence id="256">They were big basements because this was a whole [indecipherable] and I find out about it. </sentence><sentence id="257">So we went and we confiscated everything. </sentence><sentence id="258">So I had a lot of this material. </sentence><sentence id="259">I remember there were children's socks, and children's underwear, and everything what -- so -- so I brought -- every time I came   14 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 over to them, so I brought a trunk full of those things and I gave it to them. </sentence><sentence id="260">Now, they knew that I am Jewish, those few people, but the rest, they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="261">And when I took it out from the warehouses, the people who work with me, they didn't know why I take it away. </sentence><sentence id="262">Maybe they thought maybe I take it and I sell it on black market or something. </sentence><sentence id="263">But I gave it away all to my girlfriend, or to the Jewish committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: When you think about the time today, you were very busy -- about that time in Krakow -- you were very busy, you had a lot of work. </sentence><sentence id="313">Was that special for you, that time of fo -- and if so, for what reason? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: I think this was the best time of my -- there were two times that there were the best times of my life. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I think this was the best time. </sentence><sentence id="318">One time was the best time when I -- like for instance, when I was in the woods, naturally we starved, it was cold, and it was terrible fear. </sentence><sentence id="319">But if we could do something -- there was one time that we made a raid of -- o-on -- we made a raid, there was a -- a sop -- police station from Puskov, from the SS, and we made the raid, and we killed them, all of them, so I think this was the happiest day in my life. </sentence><sentence id="320">As a matter of fact in my book there, somebody wrote, and in th -- in -- and what I explained to him it is -- it was like when I had the machine gun in my hand, it's like a lame who couldn't walk, and suddenly he -- he -- he was able to walk. </sentence><sentence id="321">To me, that I was not any more the victim, that I wasn't any more the pe -- the person who was killed, that I could pay back. </sentence><sentence id="322">And this was my life why I wanted to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="323">  15 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="324"> Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 live. </sentence><sentence id="325">To take revenge, which I did as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="326">In Krakew, it was a other, naturally we couldn't go out, we couldn't kill people any more, it was after the war. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="327">But for me to see that the people, the Jewish came ba -- the Jews came back, they had nothing, they di -- and even the Polish government was not very, very friendly with them, because individual -- maybe the government as a whole was not anti-Semitic, because in this time it was a communist government, but each individual policeman, each individual clerk, everything, he had this hate in his heart as again the same thing, they didn't change. </sentence><sentence id="328">Now, if I could do something, I was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="329">People that I didn't know, they find out -- they find out that -- that they could do -- through me they went to this rabbi, and if I could help them I was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="330">And also, also, if they needed apartments, and there was every apartment, usually there was a -- a office where they gave out the apartments. </sentence><sentence id="331">Now, if a Jew came for an apartment and even he lived before in Krakow, they wouldn't give it to him because the people were very, very against Jews. </sentence><sentence id="332">And they said, "Well, why did you come back?" </sentence><sentence id="333">And they looked at that Jew -- and now I'm writing a new book about the killings after the war, so the title of the book is what they used to say in the title is, you are still alive? </sentence><sentence id="334">I -- and the subtitle is, I thought they killed all of you. </sentence><sentence id="335">This was the first question -- the first that a Pole ask a Jew when he survived. </sentence><sentence id="336">But when -- when -- when they went to this rabbi and the rabbi knew that he could be helped through me, I did it. </sentence><sentence id="337">Now this was a very, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="338">  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion 16 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 very rewarding thing for me. </sentence><sentence id="339">Because if I started a thing, we were killed, and nobody did anything. </sentence><sentence id="340">And this time we were undress -- I'm not talking I personally, but the Jews, and we were undr -- dress over a -- a -- a ditch, and we were killed. </sentence><sentence id="341">Now if e- each one of them would think, if I would live and if I could pay them back, everybody will do it. </sentence><sentence id="342">Now, after the war, people didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="343">The war is ended, and everybody was interested to have a bread, to make a living, and to save his family if he had a family. </sentence><sentence id="344">But for me, I survived for two reasons -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: -- for me, I survived for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="346">And this, to -- to survive, you had to have a legacy, you had to have a reason. </sentence><sentence id="347">Th-This gave you strength, otherwise you couldn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="348">And I had two. </sentence><sentence id="349">One was when my father was killed, he yelled to take revenge, and I -- it is now 55 - 60 years later, I still hear his si -- his screams. </sentence><sentence id="350">This was one that gave me strength. </sentence><sentence id="351">I have to live, because I was the youngest, and I was the only one to pay back, pay back for my five sisters, pay back for my -- the sister's husbands, pay back for my nieces and nephews. </sentence><sentence id="352">Who would pay back? </sentence><sentence id="353">So this mean that they were killed, and nothing will happen to the people who did it. </sentence><sentence id="354">So this was one legacy that it gave me strength. </sentence><sentence id="355">To take back the second one was when my mother was taken away to Belzec with my five sisters to be killed in Belzec, she somehow gave to somebry -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="356">   17 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="357"> Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 body a letter, and I got the letter from this person. </sentence><sentence id="358">I was in [indecipherable] and she wrote to me, you are my ninth child, you are the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="359">You are young, you are strong, you are smart. </sentence><sentence id="360">If somebody will survive, you will survive. </sentence><sentence id="361">Because she believes that somebody will survive. </sentence><sentence id="362">She said, "After the war, go to your brother," because I had a brother in Palestine, "go to y -- Palestine, go to your brother," I had a brother in America, "and tell the whole world what the German murderers did to us." </sentence><sentence id="363">So this is the reasons that after the war, I started to tell, even in the beginning people didn't want to

realize, and they listened. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="366">Books came out, movies came out. </sentence><sentence id="367">But I started to speak the first minute I left Poland, and I told the stories. </sentence><sentence id="368">And people thought that it is something wrong with me. </sentence><sentence id="369">And this gave me strength to survive. </sentence><sentence id="370">That if we will not be alive, the whole world would know what a cruel thing happened in this time. </sentence><sentence id="371">And for this reason not only J, all survivors, their duty is to write down, and

</sentence><sentence id="374">So for this I am telling, and I am going out, if somebody asked me to go and speak, I don't care where and how and when, I never took money f-for it, and I am doing it

</sentence><sentence id="378">Te-Te-Tell us a little bit more about some time the decision was made, or you -- you and your wife talked about would you stay or would you leave. </sentence><sentence id="379">S-Say something about it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: Well, then later from Krakow, I was transferred to Breslau, and I became the head of the security for Breslau for the cow -- for the town. </sentence><sentence id="381">In Krakew wa -- I was the head for the county. </sentence><sentence id="382">In Breslau I was for the town. </sentence><sentence id="383">And again the same story, in Breslau | had a lot of work, because Breslau, first thing Breslau was 90 percent or 85 percent destroyed, and there were a lot of Germans, and we wanted the Polish people should come in, and they should show that there is -- this became a Polish town, and a -- and we then -- later we gave out in orders that all the Germans have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="384">Now they left, and they had two suitcases, and this was something for me very, very important, because this was a pay back what they did to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="385">Naturally they -- when they were sent out, when we brought them to the train, we didn't kill them th -- like in the -- in the Szeszow where I was and one day they killed 6,000 Jews, sik -- 600 Jews, then thousand Jews, by an aktia -- we call it a aktia, it means an [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="386">But by the Germans nobody was killed, they only had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="387">Now the -- their apartments were taken over by Polish people, and in -- in -- in -- but -- but one thing we s -- in this time also, the -- it started in Israel, we knew -- Palestine in    19 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 this time, and we knew Palestine will have to -- the Jews will try to have their own country. </sentence><sentence id="388">And as -- I always was a Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="389">I never became a member of the communist party, even they ask me to do it. </sentence><sentence id="390">But my excuse was that I am not in th -- I -- lam not taught enough to know the ide -- the ideology about communism, I have to learn a little more, I have to read more and this was my excuse. </sentence><sentence id="391">And my wife never wanted to stay, because my wife had very bad experience, because when the Russians came in to the -- her town in Stanislav -- in Stanislavov in 1940 -- in 1939, and they lived under co-communist regime, now the people who were well off were middle class [indecipherable] middle class they were -- th-th-the Russians tried to liquidate them. </sentence><sentence id="392">If they were Zionists they sent them to Siberia, if they were rich they took away everything. </sentence><sentence id="393">So from them they took away their apartment, they took away the business. </sentence><sentence id="394">Her father had to be a plain worker, which -- my wife wanted to study medicine, they didn't let her in because she was a daughter of a bourge -- bourgeois family. </sentence><sentence id="395">So she sa -- and then they saw the system is not for her, so she didn't want to stay in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="396">And she always said, well in Poland you got a king for a night, but the end we -- I don't want. </sentence><sentence id="397">So we started to think -- and I also, when I was in Breslau, I start -- well, even in Krakow, I started to work in that organization, a Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="398">Naturally the people from the organization knew that I am Jewish, and I gave them some protection, and they had to -- to -- to travel toward the   20 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 Czechoslovakian border, I helped them. </sentence><sentence id="399">And also, when I was in Breslau, I was still involved with this organization, and -- and -- and -- but -- but the end was that we had to leave, til it came a time that my wife said she ha -- we have to leave because the longer we will wait, it will be harder to -- to go away. </sentence><sentence id="400">Now, I left first, and I left very - - not organize in [indecipherable] because I went with that -- with a truck, through the border to East Germany, and on the way I could be caught, I we -- but it's a long story, but I left. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="547">Q: Was it Bremen or Bremenhaven? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="549">A: Bremenhaven. </sentence><sentence id="550">In Bremenhaven we were there in there they made like a staging area in a school, and the people you were staying there, they gave us to eat, but we couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="551">Now, it was also a very unpleasant place because that ger -- when -- when you got -- when you had to go to get the visa, Germans got the visa very fast. </sentence><sentence id="552">But course, by us, there was in this time, the consul and the co -- they -- they -- they didn't let the Jewish people who wanted

consul. </sentence><sentence id="558">Now people start -- who had money started to pay her, and everybody knew that she takes money. </sentence><sentence id="559">Now the first thing we didn't have the money and we didn't want to pay, why should we pay her? </sentence><sentence id="560">So because my wife spoke English, I spoke a little English, I said, we have to    26 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 take it in our hand. </sentence><sentence id="561">So there was that general consul, I remember his name was Clarke. </sentence><sentence id="562">And this Clarke, we said we have to see him. </sentence><sentence id="563">So once when he went for lunch, we stopped him. </sentence><sentence id="564">And my wife said she wants to talk to him, and she -- he explained -- she explained to him that it is impossible, there are hundreds of people who want to go to America, and we cannot go because this woman demands 200 dollars for a person to let her see -- and she -- she was a partner with one of the vice- consuls, there was [indecipherable] and she was a partner and she sent it to him and they got im -- they got the visa. </sentence><sentence id="565">So she told this -- everything to the Clarke and I was standing there and he listened and listened. </sentence><sentence id="566">So he said, well I want you should come to my office, and we went there. </sentence><sentence id="567">And we explained, and I remember that when we left, so he came to us and he put the hand on our head. </sentence><sentence id="568">He said, "Well, do you know, children like you we need in America." </sentence><sentence id="569">And he changed the whole rule. </sentence><sentence id="570">Instead before you needed -- she -- this woman said, "If you don't have the documents, I don't let -- I don't make the application." </sentence><sentence id="571">So he changed the rules, and the rules were you needed two witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="572">And when the

him, then later he was a witness for them. </sentence><sentence id="574">And then the people -- we were -- we ca -- we came them every day. </sentence><sentence id="575">Then later the people knew that we made this change, and they were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="576">Even til today some people who   27 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 are here and they always remind us that we went and we had the guts to speak up. </sentence><sentence id="577">And this way, we -- this woman was fired. </sentence><sentence id="578">They -- the -- the consul -- the visa consul was still there. </sentence><sentence id="579">It so happened that we were assigned -- I remember he had one le -- he was a -- a invalid, so we were assigned to him because the general consul didn't take care on all the children, so -- on all the people, so we were assigned to him. </sentence><sentence id="580">When we were assigned to him, and -- and he didn't ask us too many question because we had the two affidavits. </sentence><sentence id="581">Then later he said to raise the hand and he swore us in. </sentence><sentence id="582">So I was afraid because I almost burst out in laughter, because he was the one who was a partner with this woman, and now he is giving me this thing. </sentence><sentence id="583">Well, we got the visa and we had to go to Bremen, in Bremen we got stuck for six months. </sentence><sentence id="584">And then later we went on the -- on the liberty ship. </sentence><sentence id="585">Those were the ships, th-the name was Ernie Pyle. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="589">And I pray to God it's -- the ship should sink. </sentence><sentence id="590">I couldn't take it, I didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="591">So my wife, in this time she put on a woman's housecoat with the woman's pajama and the kerchief   28 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 on my head, and she took me in in her room. </sentence><sentence id="592">And the people in her room knew and -- that I am with her and I slept there, and this was a little better. </sentence><sentence id="593">But what -- we were very, very angry that the German people who went to America in this time, cause a lot of German went to America, they had family here, they had the big, best cabins, because they had money to pay. </sentence><sentence id="594">And they -- the people from the company were German, so they had cabins and they were sitting and eating and drinking and dancing. </sentence><sentence id="595">And we were laying like -- like dogs in -- in -- so this was very, very unfair. </sentence><sentence id="596">But this how they came. </sentence><sentence id="597">So mo -- not only on our ship, on all the ships. </sentence><sentence id="598">So the German people had all the privileges because they were normal people and they got people who gave them those places, and they could pay for it. </sentence><sentence id="599">So then we came to -- we came to [indecipherable] we arrived in America January the 17", and -- and -- and we were so sick. </sentence><sentence id="600">So then later, a night before, somebody said, tomorrow morning we arrive in America. </sentence><sentence id="601">So I -- I as -- how -- as sick we were, everybody di -- dragged out the -- the - - the -- the best suit, with the best coat, and we were [indecipherable] and we waited half a night, we were just staying on the deck waiting for the Statue of Liberty. </sentence><sentence id="602">And when the statue of -- when we saw the Statue of

id="604">Now wa -- wa -- wa -- this was not the end. </sentence><sentence id="605">Then later when we -- we went that -- they said to take out the valises and everything, so we took it out on the

</sentence><sentence id="617">In America [indecipherable], "I am Yagi and I find out that you are coming, so I came in here." </sentence><sentence id="618">Now he could go in -- in the -- yeah, right
