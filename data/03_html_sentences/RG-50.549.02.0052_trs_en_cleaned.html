there were some who belonged to the underground illegally, but the majority, they worked with the German -- they were collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="1743">So now we had to clean out the

leave, they want to make the uprise. </sentence><sentence id="1764">So they were in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="1765">So this was one also of the reasons that -- about the destruction, they

destroyed, so they will slow down. </sentence><sentence id="1769">The third reason was because the Germans considered Krak6ew as a German town, and they cou -- like they always -- like all the

reason was that they wanted to destroy the town, because they couldn't live with it that Poland should get the town untouched. </sentence><sentence id="1776">Because in Krakow there was never bomb, in Krakow was never the house destroyed, so they wanted to destroy the whole town. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Now, would this work, the 287 mines, Krakow would -- not one house would be left, because they -- the way they mined, and they put in the columns, it was the whole town would be blown up. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Naturally with the pe -- and people, there were hundred maybe -- hu --

because the museum actually -- this is -- it is a government institution, it is a government museum. </sentence><sentence id="5491">Now, for this reason I was very much for Dr. Royach, because Dr. Royach was very dedicated, and he wanted -- he did not need this job, because he had a very good practice, he's a psychiatrist. </sentence><sentence id="5492">But he wan -- because I know, I had discussions with him before he took the job, because he didn't want to take the job in fir-first place. </sentence><sentence id="5493">Then later -- and I talked him in -- well, in --

this job, because he wanted it should be a Jewish museum. </sentence><sentence id="5497">It should be -- it -- the Holocaust shouldn't be watered down. </sentence><sentence id="5498">Because there was a case that the -- some other nationalities or other ethnic groups came in, and they said well, we had a Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5499">Holocaust was for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="5500">The Polish people say Polish Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5501">Poland didn't have a Holocaust, because by Jews, every Jew had to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="5502">No -- in -- in Poland, if you did something wrong, they arrested you. </sentence><sentence id="5503">If you were in the underground, they caught you with weapons, they caught you with black mart -- mark --

if Arafat will come as a Head of State, they had to close the museum, and give him the VIP treatment, and he was against it. </sentence><sentence id="5511">And for this reason he was fired. </sentence><sentence id="5512">So he -- I am afraid that this will be watered down, that the Holocaust, the Jewish Holocaust will be watered down, because other people will came -- come in. </sentence><sentence id="5513">Like there was once in -- in a -- what was it, not a -- no, Croatia wanted to make a -- make something about the Holocaust, and Croatia was -- they were the worst murderers in -- in the world. </sentence><sentence id="5514">They had the Oestasha, the Oestasha killed thousands and thousands of Serbs, thousand and thousands of -- of Jews, and now they are the

collaborators, it was never occupied by Germany. </sentence><sentence id="5517">So this -- so I think that the Holocaust museum will be watered down, because it will not be strict that it's a Jewish Holocaust, where Yad Vashem is only a Jewish Holocaust, because they don't have other ethnic groups to be Yad Vashem, and to do -- to say, well, this was my Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5518">And -- so it's a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="5519">Now you have a other -- a -- a memorial museum in -- in New York. </sentence><sentence id="5520">Now this is a new story,
