<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes, I went to -- to school in Czechoslovakia, in Kosheetza. </sentence><sentence id="257">And that was quite an experience. </sentence><sentence id="258">I think I was the only Jew, besides one other, in my whole school and I'm really sad to say and til this day I -- I find it so difficult to understand why we were really so disliked. </sentence><sentence id="259">W-We looked just like the rest of the kids, we didn't publicly appear -- I mean we did not appear Jewish in any way. </sentence><sentence id="260">We didn't wear hats or yarmulkes or had long hair or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="261">My only mark was my number. </sentence><sentence id="262">That branded me a Jew, however. </sentence><sentence id="263">And this other fellow, his name was Sobol, I don't think he had a number from any camp, but he was Jewish, they knew he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="264">Maybe he looked more Jewish than I did, if there's such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="265">But th-the boys, even the -- at that age, we were like eight, nine, 10, they were -- they were out there to beat us. </sentence><sentence id="266">Every day they could catch us after school, they -- they actually waited for us and we had to run. </sentence><sentence id="267">Run for our -- not for    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 10 our lives, because we were not old enough to really do that kind of harm to each other, but we had to run, because we were going to be beaten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Do you think they knew anything about what that number meant or does it just -- number, Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: I think they just thought it was Jewish -- Jewish and -- Jewish connotation, I think, even -- even while the war was right there, still hot. </sentence><sentence id="284">And the e-extermination, I'm sure, was known about, but the hatred, I don't think was wiped out of the people. </sentence><sentence id="285">Or of this innate insensitivity to Jewishness, or anti-Semitism, whatever you want to call it, people were brought up with this sort of thing and even though the war was over and done with, it was still there. </sentence><sentence id="286">I think the Germans most probably had -- looking back now, part -- part of that is -- as -- as their plan to -- to make -- make their actions seem -- seem plausible, reasonable, even likable. </sentence><sentence id="287">So they had this propaganda machine and I'm sure that they spread very not nice things about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="288">So it just carried on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1873">A: 1 -- I don't think we bothered really to piece the memories, cause we -- we had them. </sentence><sentence id="1874">What we -- what we tried to -- to do is to -- for the few -- one specific example I can give you -- when we were in Auschwitz, after we were separated and we were -- like she was in the women's camp, I was in the men's camp and we were taking to the doctor on an individual basis, even though I guess they knew who I was -- I was a twin to the other one. </sentence><sentence id="1875">But we saw each other once, through a fence, a barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And at that eye contact, no words, nothing was spoken, but we both remembered that. </sentence><sentence id="1877">That one moment, that one instant. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And I think that's the instant that -- that gave us the -- the -- the -- the impetus to - - to say, "He's alive. </sentence><sentence id="1879">He's always going to be alive -- or she's alive. </sentence><sentence id="1880">I'm going to find her, I'm going to do --". </sentence><sentence id="1881">So we talked about that moment of recognition, cause I knew it was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 60 her, but I wasn't sure that she knew that it was me. </sentence><sentence id="1882">But we got that straightened out very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1883">So we talked, but even though we talked for the first time and we were as open as we could, Irene still held back a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And I guess I held back a lot of things, too and I'm only saying this empirically speaking now, because I know how much more information we let out since 1985. </sentence><sentence id="1885">But we talked about it and it felt good. </sentence><sentence id="1886">It was a relief. </sentence><sentence id="1887">It really was a relief. </sentence><sentence id="1888">And for -- I think from that point on, we realized we're going to have to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1889">And that it -- good will come of it. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And it -- it has to be. </sentence><sentence id="1891">Because questions are asked by people close to you, by your family. </sentence><sentence id="1892">They have to be answered, they can't be -- you -- you can't put them aside, they have to be answered. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And they -- in order to answer them, they have to be answered truthfully. </sentence><sentence id="1894">As fully and as truthfully as we can answer them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1918">Q: What happened in your family, when you begin to talk about it? </sentence><sentence id="1919">Did you do on your own, or did it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1920">A: No, no, here I -- I have to say that I allowed the Slotkins to -- to -- to -- to manipulate my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1921">Not manipulate by my -- but th-they -- I was always sort of in the same framework. </sentence><sentence id="1922">I didn't want to tell the kids about my horrors. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I never hid anything from them, conscio -- but I never wanted to either tell them. </sentence><sentence id="1924">So, as they grew older, their questions became more intense and I tried to tell them whatever I could gear to their age. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1930">You know, at -- at six, seven, eight years old, when -- you know, you -- you can tell a kid something, but you can't -- so but now it's ou -- all out and they know everything and whenever there is something that's happening, they want to be part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1931">And I think they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 61 feel sort of an honor that their father survived it all. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I -- I really do. </sentence><sentence id="1933">I think -- that's how they make me feel, anyway, so it's good. </sentence><sentence id="1934">I mean, I don't mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1941">Q: You began to speak publicly about it as well, in schools? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1943">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1944">I don't know how you knew that, but it's true. </sentence><sentence id="1945">In addition to the media exposure that -- when we were hot, in 1985 and Mengele was on the front page and we were flown out to California once, I remember, to a show -- we were on the Good Morning Show here and this and that, but, you know, this was just few short questions, answering to the people and -- and, you -- you know, you were prepped for this, basically. </sentence><sentence id="1946">You still answered truthfully, but you were prepped for it, for -- but to really get the message home, I thought -- and Irene, whenever she speaks, you can't do it as a factual thing. " </sentence><sentence id="1947">Oh yes, we went -- we were -- so many were killed, we saw people getting killed every day - - where they kept marching them to the ovens, and there were piles of bones." </sentence><sentence id="1948">Everybody has seen this. </sentence><sentence id="1949">But we thought, to bring it home, really to -- to -- to bring it home, is to personalize the message. </sentence><sentence id="1950">To -- to make you as real as you possibly can make it. </sentence><sentence id="1951">So Irene does it in a way -- she's a wonderful speaker, I -- she really is, she -- I've -- I've heard her speak to congregations and to gatherings and people are absolutely spellbound. </sentence><sentence id="1952">When she finishes, they -- they just look at each other and there's nothing to say. </sentence><sentence id="1953">I'm not that way. </sentence><sentence id="1954">I like to go to schools. </sentence><sentence id="1955">I -- I would -- I remember twice -- on two occasions, I went to schools. </sentence><sentence id="1956">I actually put the kids on the floor, in a circle around me and let them touch me, let them ask. </sentence><sentence id="1957">I didn't start telling them. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I tol -- they were prepped by their teacher, knowing that here is a man from concentration, comes from a -- and I just let them -- let USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 62 them loose. </sentence><sentence id="1959">And, you know some of them ask questions about -- kids -- some ask, you know, "Did they -- did they feed you? </sentence><sentence id="1960">Did you starve?" </sentence><sentence id="1961">And did you this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1962">These are youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="1963">But older people -- much more intelligent, much more sensitive questions, they really want to know. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And they know so little from the history books. </sentence><sentence id="1965">There's no history out there of this. </sentence><sentence id="1966">History doesn't teach this, the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1967">It's just something that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1968">And the Bronx High School of Science, that was the last one that I a-attended a class there -- a -- high school students. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And there were -- they're studying the Holocaust and they have a very extensive Holocaust exhibition down in their basement as part of their library. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Very, very intense, one of the best. </sentence><sentence id="1971">And they -- they really wanted to get into it, because they ju -- there was just no way they could get it from history. </sentence><sentence id="1972">So getting to talk to them, I got them to really feel -- I try to make them feel that I'm real, you're real, it really happened. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And I think they believe me and that was one of my greatest rewards, because today there are a lot of people out there who say it never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1974">What -- what their motivation is, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1975">But there are people listening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2010">Q: There is concern, or there -- there is concern among the Jewish community to not put so much emphasis, all the time on the Holocaust as not to take away from other Jewish experiences. </sentence><sentence id="2011">Is that something you are sympathetic with or that you have feelings about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2014">A: There is, unfortunately Jews, like all other people, we're -- we're somewhat slaves to the current markets and -- and if the pop -- the topic is popular, people get on it. </sentence><sentence id="2015">There's some people who -- who actually force a living out of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Very few, but there  ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatieraboutfistecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 63 are some. </sentence><sentence id="2017">So, all I'm really saying is that -- th-that a lot has been done, a lot has been said, because it's timely. </sentence><sentence id="2018">It seems to be the thing. </sentence><sentence id="2019">Whether you were -- you can ever totally overkill the issue, I -- I -- I don't know, I -- I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2020">I don't think that you really can, I think it's a very important part of the Jewish history, but certainly it's not the happening. </sentence><sentence id="2021">I think the happening happened a long time ago, when God took Moses and children of Israel out of Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="2022">And I think that was the happening. </sentence><sentence id="2023">And if all Jews focused on that, they would get a little better understanding of what really is worthwhile - - or what they should concentrate on. </sentence><sentence id="2024">But, certainly history -- and this is the same, it's historical, you have to look at your history in order to live today and prepare for tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2025">You just have to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2026">You have to do that and the -- the Holocaust is what happened to us, unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="2027">And it's my life, I was turtle -- totally immersed in it for awhile and I'm still immersed in it many years later. </sentence><sentence id="2028">The -- the just -- you just don't forget about it. </sentence><sentence id="2029">You know it every day. </sentence><sentence id="2030">You know that you're different. </sentence><sentence id="2031">How different, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="2032">I honestly don't know, but I know that my background is different than -- just as I'm different from any other person living. </sentence></p></dialogue>
