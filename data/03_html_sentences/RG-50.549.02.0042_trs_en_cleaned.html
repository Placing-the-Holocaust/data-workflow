<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: To Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: And at that time, your youngest sister was not with you any more, because she had already been taken away during a raid in an earlier work camp. </sentence><sentence id="29">And your parents decided -- that's what you said in the earlier interview, your parents decided that your father should stay together with your older brother and your mother should stay with you and your older sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="32">A: That is correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: And the hope was that it might be possible for your father and your se -- your brother to flee, but that hope did not come about. </sentence><sentence id="35">So, what haven -- what happened when you arrived in Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="36">What -- What do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: The -- The time when we were brought to Auschwitz was the height of the transports from all over Poland and Hungary, Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="41">And they -- the ovens were working full capacity to process all these people that were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="42">And so that we happened to have been in a holding pattern, not given the numbers on arrival,    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 4 as inmates of the camp had [indecipherable] for some week or -- or so, we were held - - kept, to be processed -- in other words, to be taken to the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="43">But somehow, we ended up getting the inmates numbers tattooed and processed as inmates of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="44">All I know is that we arrived in Auschwitz in December, somewhere around July, I believe, and not very much later, the time of the Jewish holidays -- the Jewish New Year would fall som -- at about September, when, on the first or second day, rather, of the Jewish New Year, the selection was conducted i-in the men's section of the Auschwitz camp. </sentence><sentence id="45">And there they took away all the youngsters and of course, disabled people and old men who could not work and my brother was taken away at that time. </sentence><sentence id="46">I became aware of it through my mother, who had gotten word of it through other people that had seen my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: You did mention earlier that you did eventually get a number. </sentence><sentence id="55">Would you tell us your number? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: Yes, my number is 7671, was preceded by the letter B. No, it is actually 7871. </sentence><sentence id="59">It is tattooed with a instrument like a pen and ink and it does not -- I never wash this off. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="63">You stayed with your mother and your sister in the women's block? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: I'm trying to recall whether I stayed actually with my mother for long, because I know that I ended up with youngsters even younger than myself, including some Russian children that were separated from their parents. </sentence><sentence id="67">And there were children and even babies, including babies. </sentence><sentence id="68">Now, in Auschwitz, Dr. Mengele was conducting experiments and that may have been one of the reasons that one of the -- the barracks    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 5 was filled with youngsters that did actually not work, per se, but maybe were kept for other reasons. </sentence><sentence id="69">And I was one of -- one of those kids that was kept at the children's barracks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: In the earlier videotape, you also mention that you worked as a messenger at one point. </sentence><sentence id="76">How did that come about and what exactly did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: My recollection is that before coming to Auschwitz, one of the friends of my father had made this arrangement that it would be important that I should be shown to be useful to the German commander of the camp, if I was to be like a messenger boy. </sentence><sentence id="80">And in some way, I was also found to be doing that in Auschwitz, occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="81">But it was not a job that you -- that you perform, it was -- that kapos or whatever, whoever was in charge, would need somebody to carry a message or a note, whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Did you have any -- Do you have any recollections of -- of interacting with the children in the children's barrack? </sentence><sentence id="86">I mean the -- obviously it was not a place to -- to socialize in any way, but what -- do you remember any particular relationships? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: I cannot recollect as being able to do much socializing, besides -- with the other children that were in that block. </sentence><sentence id="90">It's difficult for me to recollect what -- how we really -- the day -- from morning til night, how we spent our time, whether it was going out with the working people and being around to be sent on errands or other -- in other ways, kept busy. </sentence><sentence id="91">That's maybe why there was no social interaction with other children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Do you remember what you -- what you were given to eat? </sentence><sentence id="96">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="99"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 6 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: To the best of my recollection, it's -- on -- in the morning, we were given a brew that was like a tea. </sentence><sentence id="101">It was, if I'm not mistaken, no breakfast, no -- no bread, only at lunchtime, we may have had a slice of bread in the soup and in the evening, two slices of bread, maybe a soup, also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Were you able to see your mother and your sister after a certain point? </sentence><sentence id="105">Did you see -- Did you ever see your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: I was able to see my mother, because I -- I did, in the beginning, I was sleeping in the same barracks as my mother and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="109">The children's barracks, this came about later, when they collected the children into a separate barracks. </sentence><sentence id="110">My father, I had seen once, when -- on a working assignment, a crew of people had been brought into the women's section, where they were doing some construction or road improvement, whatever, maybe for the railroad, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="111">So, I had seen my father once during that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Now, was one incident that you talked about in the videotaped interview, that stands out with particular gravity. </sentence><sentence id="117">Would you speak about that again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Lassume that the -- the mention of -- in my tape, the -- a mention of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="123">The mention of the toy [indecipherable] by a kapo, when she wanted to hand me a toy and I refused it, because I knew at the time that my older brother had been taken away. </sentence><sentence id="124">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: That kapo played an even larger role there. </sentence><sentence id="129">Could you speak a little bit about that, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="132"> too? </sentence><sentence id="133">She gave you food, but she also requested things from you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: The -- I was only going on nine at the time, and the memory of the extra food was the one that was outlasting the other experience, even though a Freudian doctor might make a big deal of -- more of a big deal about that -- the influence of that. </sentence><sentence id="135">To me, the -- to me, the extra meal was the life sustaining part and -- and being with the kapo and seeing her, having a, so to speak, own possessions of -- a side table like, a -- a flower - - around flower table that had -- was covered with a -- a tablecloth and on the lower shelf she kept some extra food, bread and a piece of salami and she would offer me an extra meal. </sentence><sentence id="136">That's what was, to me, the -- the most important part of the memory. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: And she also molested you in the end. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: In retrospect, I -- I'm -- when I recall the experiences, when she took me to bed, the few times. </sentence><sentence id="150">What a -- That is typical of a -- a so-called pedophile or child molester or a person desperate for a male companionship, I cannot tell the difference. </sentence><sentence id="151">But she was not actually forcing herself on me, just being playful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Ho-How did you feel when that happened? </sentence><sentence id="159">Did you know what she was asking, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="162"> ultimately? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Actually, I was not fully conscious of -- I didn't really know the implications of it all. </sentence><sentence id="164">All I know is that I was more attracted to the girl that was washing me and fondling my private parts than to the woman who took me to bed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Do you know anything about her? </sentence><sentence id="170">Do you know her name, her nationality, her --    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="173"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Unfortunately I don't, and -- whether she was Jewish or Polish, I'm not sure, but there's -- someone had told me that she survived the war, but nobody -- just -- by -- by now I am sure that she is not alive, because I was -- I was eight or nine years old, but that woman must have been in her 40's. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: What language did you speak together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Ido believe that we spoke in Polish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: What -- What do you remember about the last days or the time before liberation happened? </sentence><sentence id="181">Do you remember your -- how -- how you -- in what kind of physical condition you were? </sentence><sentence id="182">Was there anything that -- that prepared you for things to come? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="186">Anything? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: At the later part, in Auschwitz, I had lost contact with that woman, or rather, she must have been sent away, onto another camp. </sentence><sentence id="188">So I was more emaciated when the Russians arrived, and the only preparation for a big change was that when I -- it was one of the children or someone who'd urged me on to hide in the bunks of the sick children and not to join the march -- the evacuation of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="189">And that was about three days before the first Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="190">As I mentioned in the previous tape, the -- the first Russians, they were haggard and themselves hungry and looking for what was in the stores and I ha -- in the -- what food or clothing the Germans may have left in the barracks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Did they provide any medical assistance, so instead of giving you food, they were asking you to help them find food, in a sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="197"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Well, it's -- was the first two soldiers who arrived, first two foot soldiers, but after they liberated, the Russians moved in in force. </sentence><sentence id="199">They did -- Or behind them, the civilian administration and aid organizations helped organize the evacuation of the children and where possible, to reunite them with their parents. </sentence><sentence id="200">There were some children so little that they didn't even know their names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Do you remember the moment when you realized that you were free -- at least free to go? </sentence><sentence id="205">That -- And what did you do, what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Unfortunately, it didn't happen that way, that the first two Russian soldiers coming into the camp, instead of hugging and kissing them, and feeling free, one said to the other the word, Evrai, which was like a bad way of saying a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="209">And it was -- it stung me as being no different than the German soldiers before them, so that myself and two other boys, we ran away to the town of Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: So you walked? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: How long did it take you, do you have any recollections? [ </sentence><sentence id="217">indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: Even -- Even though it was -- it -- it was a harsh winter, 1945, and this being in the beginning of January, but I -- I was so asteeled to bad weather, to cold, and to a lot of -- exposed to a lot of things, that I did manage to get to the town, whether is was a few kilometers or a few miles, I don't recall. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: And what happened when you got there, to the town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="221"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: At first we were taken in by a -- we were separated, I -- I was taken in by a childless couple. </sentence><sentence id="223">The childless couple, they were, during the way -- during the day they were out working, or whatever, and I was like locked in in a type of cabin, one room type situation, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: How did they find you? </sentence><sentence id="225">Did you knock on a door, or did they see you wandering around? </sentence><sentence id="226">How -- How did that happen that they took you in? </sentence><sentence id="227">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: I cannot recall how it happened that this particular couple took me in, but I presume that we did wander in the streets and that eventually we were led to that couple who had no children. </sentence><sentence id="229">But staying with that couple turned out to be a big disappointment, being that I had little in common with them and they must have realized themselves, that they cannot make of me a -- a future for that -- i-it wouldn't work unless I went for some schooling. </sentence><sentence id="230">And that's how they ended up bringing me to a monastery, where they had peep -- orphans and a school -- and a school -- in that monastery they had a school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: While you were with those two people, how did they treat you though? </sentence><sentence id="235">I mean, they locked you up during the day, but did they give you food, did they take care of -- did they give you medical attention? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: I don't think that they were able to give me medical attention at the time. </sentence><sentence id="239">It was, for them, also hard times and a matter of survival. </sentence><sentence id="240">But I did have food, everything is relative. </sentence><sentence id="241">I know that I -- I was not going around at the starvation level that I was living under in Auschwitz. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="242"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 11 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: How long do you estimate, were you with them before you went to the [indecipherable] monastery? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: It's a matter of weeks, because it was not very long from when I got into the monastery that a mass funeral was organized in Auschwitz for all those that were killed in the last minute before the evacuation of Auschwitz, and people who could not keep up with the march, they were shot by the roadside. </sentence><sentence id="245">Some brutally killed, stabbed and cut, people without limbs. </sentence><sentence id="246">So that mass funeral, it's enough for a child to -- to have nightmares for the rest of his life. </sentence><sentence id="247">But what helped me in that -- on that day I -- that I met someone who directed me to go back to the camp, that the children were being taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I left the monastery. </sentence><sentence id="249">But the thing about the -- this stay in the monastery is amazing to me, because now that -- so many years later, 40 or 50 years later, when I -- I didn't practice Polish for all these years, but I do have Polish ladies working for me and I was able to recall, in Polish language, the blessings or prayers that I studied at that time, in the monastery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: So you were -- you were attracted by the rituals there? </sentence><sentence id="257">Did you have a sense of your Jewish identity then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: [had enough knowledge of my background that I knew -- I knew who my parents were and their names, the names of my sister who survived and of course the sister and the brother who were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="261">And -- But I saw in -- at that time, anything that came across my way, to enhance my knowledge is -- was engraved in my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 12 memory, whether it was studying in the monastery, or later, given the opportunity to read books. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Could you say a little bit more about how you related with -- there were other children, of course, did you -- did you speak about what happened among each other, what -- or did you just stay quiet? </sentence><sentence id="305">What -- What -- What sort of -- How did you live in that camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Well, there were some children -- or children and the passing of time was -- would consist of inventing games, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="309">My outstanding recollection from that period is that I happened to have had a sort of a suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="310">It was a plastic container that some German soldiers abandoned, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="311">And there was this older girl who knew to read and write, that made with me a deal that I would give her that suitcase in exchange for her teaching me to read. </sentence><sentence id="312">And that's how I got into reading. </sentence><sentence id="313">The first books that I could get hold of was -- happened to be the Polish classical literature, like Kovadis and the trilogy of the Yantadoche. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: So she taught you very quickly, then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Oh yeah, I -- I picked up the alphabet very quickly, very quickly, because before I even attended school, which was a year later, I already was devouring books in Polish that the m -- all the major classical books of Polish literature. </sentence><sentence id="323">Of course the Kovadis    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0042 14 and -- and -- in original, in Polish and the Yantadoche, I find that it was written in a simple -- in a language that I could understand and not only comprehend, but also, it penetrated my consciousness, that I recall details from those books to this day. </sentence><sentence id="324">When -- The other day we were -- we were driving in the car and some Spanish person had the symbol of the fish on the back of his car, on his bumper and I asked this Polish girl, "What is -- Do you know what this is?" </sentence><sentence id="325">And she didn't even realize that it comes from Kovadis, the story of the first Christians, when they were getting together, and -- in secret communications they would -- this was a form of them to identify that they were Christian. </sentence><sentence id="326">They would draw on -- in the sand, the shape of a fish. </sentence><sentence id="327">So a-anything that I -- I read, or later, in the first years of school, it just stayed with me forever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: But there was no organized schooling at the time. </sentence><sentence id="336">Ho-How -- And how long did you stay in that camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: I was in -- in Krakew not very long. </sentence><sentence id="340">We were sent for recuperation to Starachowice, which is in Poland, a place of -- I don't know if they have spa, or whatever, but it is a place that people go for summer vacations. </sentence><sentence id="341">So they ha -- they had a villa there, where they set us up. </sentence><sentence id="342">And while I was in -- in Sacopana, my older sister was five years older than me, she came to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="343">And amazingly, I -- I did remember -- I did recognize her and know that she was my sister and that she took me to reunite with my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
