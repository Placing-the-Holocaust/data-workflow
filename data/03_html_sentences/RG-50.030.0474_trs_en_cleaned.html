<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: So, did you think that your mother and her mother-in-law spoke about -- that her mother- in-law told your mother about what her son was doing? </sentence><sentence id="203">So she -- so your mother knew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="206">Or do you think not? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: I don't think... It's interesting, when -- much later, when I went into her papers, when she died and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still kept. </sentence><sentence id="208">I don't think his name was ever mentioned in the house of his parents because they felt so shameful, but they certainly took over. </sentence><sentence id="209">They had a house in Brittany, and they spent three months of the year. </sentence><sentence id="210">The whole summer they spent in Brittany with the grandparents. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Oh, very much and intellectually. </sentence><sentence id="222">He -- my grandfather was for his job but extremely intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="223">He made his money by making up, what you would call, the New York Times crossword puzzle. </sentence><sentence id="224">And then once a year, he would go -- he never went out; they were very sedentary. </sentence><sentence id="225">But once a year he would get dressed, go out and compete, there was a competition and that made the money for the rest of the year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: So his money was made really from crossword puzzles. </sentence><sentence id="234">Either winning the competition -- that was a yearly thing -- or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them, for something that would be Le Monde, that was a great newspaper of the day. </sentence><sentence id="235">And that meant that he was encyclopedique. </sentence><sentence id="236">When he died, there was a fight over who would get his dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot. </sentence><sentence id="237">He trained us, he teached us in Latin, in French. </sentence><sentence id="238">He had groups of our little friends come every... once a week to study with him and he was great. </sentence><sentence id="239">I mean, they were just great. </sentence><sentence id="240">And it was very, very modest life. </sentence><sentence id="241">They did not have any hot water. </sentence><sentence id="242">They did not have any running water except in one faucet in the whole house. </sentence><sentence id="243">So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see now, people collect them. </sentence><sentence id="244">But for us it was a necessity of life. </sentence><sentence id="245">You had to heat your water and then have them pour it and then you had those big bowls and you wash like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: But not on a regular basis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: Oh no, it was not at all. </sentence><sentence id="272">Because the caste system is such in France that you live ina different part of the city, you never, never... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: So explain this caste system, as you understand it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Well, you have the working class; we had nothing to do with that. </sentence><sentence id="278">We were bourgeois poor, but we had a maid. </sentence><sentence id="279">We always had a maid. </sentence><sentence id="280">It was done that way. </sentence><sentence id="281">And she had what is now the students" quarters in the building where we used to live, because they had the, had the view. </sentence><sentence id="282">It was on the sixth floor. </sentence><sentence id="283">All that floor was maids. </sentence><sentence id="284">And now it's all students and they all fight... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="300">And you were not aware of it; it's built in you. </sentence><sentence id="301">You talk differently. </sentence><sentence id="302">I married a man who is that way and I mean, he spends his time watching T.V. and they say "who" when they should say "whom", and he says "whom" aloud. </sentence><sentence id="303">I can hear him from my room because he is incensed. </sentence><sentence id="304">It's built in you, that you speak well, but you wear their discard as clothes -- except for shoes; the rich never give their shoes. </sentence><sentence id="305">You can't wear other people's shoes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: Uh-huh, but you can wear other people's... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2234"> A No. </sentence><sentence id="2235">Ah, no! </sentence><sentence id="2236">Ah, no! </sentence><sentence id="2237">I know because she would have been endangered and that's the one thing I wanted to avoid. </sentence><sentence id="2238">And also she was a babbler. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2284">Q: Why do you say that you were endangering your mother? </sentence><sentence id="2285">Since she was Jewish and you had a baptism certificate and you were not suspected of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2286">Because of your activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2290">A: Mm-hmm. </sentence><sentence id="2291">If I had been caught... that would have endan-... Because I was not hiding who I was, and therefore, she as a Jew would be endangered in another, at another level. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2394">A: If it... because of the set-up of life in Paris, nothing changed. </sentence><sentence id="2395">There were no cars to be had, there were no... the great luxuries didn't exist, there were no furs...

What can you do? </sentence><sentence id="2421">There wasn't that much in the way of luxury to spend on and I had never been born or raised in luxury. </sentence><sentence id="2422">It meant nothing to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2473"> End of Tape #3 Tape #4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2476">Q: Nicole I, I don't want us to worry about whether something happened in 1941 or in 1942, because I'm not sure anybody's memory can be clear about when things happened. </sentence><sentence id="2477">But do you have any recollection of whether, when you were smuggling the guns, that you moved out from your mother, or was it... do you think it was later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2480">A: No, I think I was still living with my mother when I did it. </sentence><sentence id="2481">Because I used not to come back to the house, as I told you, not to come back to that apartment, not to involve her, not to have her know about my activities. </sentence><sentence id="2482">And so... And also for the date, I know that what really shook me was that Vel d'Hiv... when the word came out, and it came out, not that I saw the inside of the place, but rumor began circulating because, as I said it, was so close to were everybody lived. </sentence><sentence id="2483">And at that point, I thought I had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2484">But I just sort of had to do something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2490">Q: More than what you were doing? " </sentence><sentence id="2491">Cause you obviously were doing something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2494">A: Yes, but that had nothing to do with children and when they began touching children... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2496">Q: Then that bothered you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2498">A: ... which was late, then I had to step in and do something. </sentence><sentence id="2499">Because I was in a unique position to probably be able to do something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2502">Q: So, how did it happen that you started to try to save children, once you found out that they were going to take children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2504">A: My mother working with the Jewish organization had -- thanks again to the organization of the German -- an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the addresses of the specific raids. </sentence><sentence id="2505">And that's the way I knew where to go to get the children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2508">Q: But was... Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew? </sentence><sentence id="2509">Were they in some sense assisting with the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2512">A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="2513">It probably was. </sentence><sentence id="2514">There was a point there where it was unhealthy. </sentence><sentence id="2515">But for my sake, it was practical. </sentence><sentence id="2516">I think after the war, there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the relationship that they maybe shouldn't have had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2522">Q: But when your mother... Your mother would give you the information... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2524">A: I guess that's the way I got it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2526">Q: You think that's the way it came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2528">A: Because there was no other way I could get it. </sentence><sentence id="2529">And I know of what transpired after the war about the U.G.LF and how close they were with the Germans, because they knew of the German work as it took place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2532">Q: When your mother would give you this information, did she realize that you were going to do something? </sentence><sentence id="2533">I mean, at that point, is she knowledgeable? " </sentence><sentence id="2534">Cause she's just not giving it to you casually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2538">A: Probably, probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2540">Q: But you don't... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2542">A: But everything, everything was so...shrug your shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="2543">You do it and then that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2544">I thought it was normal, in other words, I never made... until you shook me up, I never thought of it. </sentence><sentence id="2545">Definitely normal behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2546">What are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="2547">Sit back and let it be. </sentence><sentence id="2548">So, I moved and in the same way, she thought it was absolutely normal that I, being the type of person that I was, would feel that I had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2549">And I was in an unusual position that I could do something. </sentence><sentence id="2550">Because of the way the French government was going to protect me, one way or the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2560">Q: So you felt... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2562">A: Compelled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2564">Q: [Coughs] I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2565">You felt compelled to do something, but you also knew that the French government would protect you, which didn't mean that you were totally protected because the Germans might do something, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2568">A: Well... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2570">Q: There was some danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2572"> A That came, that came -- for instance, when I think of it, the vivid image I have is that moment on the train in the middle of the night when a German soldier opened the compartment door, and I felt at that point, I felt a very deep fear, because if the kid or whoever it was that I was transporting -- and it was a kid capable of talking -- had given out anything to verify that I was not with the mother, I was dead -- I was just as good as dead at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2573">So, when I went into it, I didn't know the extent of the danger and most of the time, probably, I wasn't discovered, so there was no danger. </sentence><sentence id="2574">It worked well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2578">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2579">But now you're doing this in connection with the underground group that you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2582">A: No, it had nothing to do with the arms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2584">Q: So, it's a different group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2586">A: Completely different. </sentence><sentence id="2587">That had to do with the Jewish U.G.LF. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2590">Q: All of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2592">A: The, the taking care, the taking children away, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2593">Because otherwise I would not know where they were to be had, to start with, Paris being a big city. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2596">Q: So this was a Jewish underground... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2598">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2600">Q: .. organization that you were connected with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2602">A: It wasn't really underground. </sentence><sentence id="2603">It was the Jewish... administration of the Jews, at the time... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2606">Q: The U.G.LF., </sentence><sentence id="2607">yeah, but this particular action was certainly not something that the Germans... You were not doing this openly? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2622">A: They came, they came individually. </sentence><sentence id="2623">They would come to your apartment and ring, and if the bell rang at four o'clock in the morning, you knew who it was. </sentence><sentence id="2624">And what happened is that after the Vel d'Hiv -- this is when the Vel d'Hiv come in -- they would not anymore -- I didn't see it in the book -- but they would not anymore tackle young children. </sentence><sentence id="2625">So, the Germans were delighted to have somebody take them off their hands. </sentence><sentence id="2626">Because it created such an endless fear of revolt among the French that they were afraid that at some point the whole city would rebel against them. </sentence><sentence id="2627">So, in some ways, I was in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="2628">It was a sort of a cloaque, you know, of ugly things. </sentence><sentence id="2629">It was some very shady participation there. </sentence><sentence id="2630">"Cause it had, at some point, to have the German willingness to give the babies, and that happened at the very specific date. " </sentence><sentence id="2631">Enough with the babies! </sentence><sentence id="2632">If there's one thing that we don't need in Paris, it's that problem." </sentence><sentence id="2633">And I stepped in and took that problem away from their hands. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2664">Q: These people did not necessarily expect you. </sentence><sentence id="2665">You're just, you're just as surprising as the Germans knocking. </sentence><sentence id="2666">For a different reason, but you're a surprise to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2670">A: Yes, and there is some persuading to do, because the women, as we know from personal experience, do not give away their children. </sentence><sentence id="2671">So I had some persuading to do to them, which was the difficult part. </sentence><sentence id="2672">It was in two parts: first, "This is it, you are doomed". </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2676">Q: You would tell them that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2678">A: I don't know how I did, but I passed on that message. " </sentence><sentence id="2679">As far as you are concerned, let it be, there is nothing anybody can do. </sentence><sentence id="2680">But there's something that that German soldier is going to allow to be done and that can be done: that I take that child away, and your child is safe." </sentence><sentence id="2681">And then I would get the child. </sentence><sentence id="2682">And the same day, he was in Italy, he or she, I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2712">Q: You don't have that much time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2714">A: Much less, the Germans are not going to let me. </sentence><sentence id="2715">They don't have the message. </sentence><sentence id="2716">I have the message from the Germans at large; they don't. </sentence><sentence id="2717">So they are brutal. </sentence><sentence id="2718">They, they want the whole thing finished and also maybe they have some human feeling that the whole thing is ugly, so they want it over with. </sentence><sentence id="2719">So, I don't have much problem with them, I have the problems with the woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2726">Q: You don't have problems with whom? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2728">A: With the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2729">The Germans have been given the message: "No children, no dealing with children under the age of three". </sentence><sentence id="2730">So, I had no problem with the German at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2731">Iam in a small apartment in nowhere in Paris, usually a poor neighborhood, not especially a Jewish neighborhood and confronting a woman, and that's the woman that is the problem or could be the problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2748">Q: So, would it be very often very quickly that the people would say, "Okay, take the child"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2750">A: Yeah, I think when they saw Germans come in, they had a feeling that... of the ugliness of it. </sentence><sentence id="2751">Even if they were uncultured and uninformed, they would sense the enormity of it and it wouldn't be a battle. </sentence><sentence id="2752">I don't remember a battle. </sentence><sentence id="2753">And then you would have to get the identity of the child in order to after the war to be careful to have kept track. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2758">Q: Of who the child was. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2774">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="2775">They would... all of the mothers would give a chance to the child. </sentence><sentence id="2776">Immediately... what happened was that immediately they realized that there was no chance for them... with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2777">There was no chance for them and if they took the child with them, I told them in no uncertain terms "That child will not save you. </sentence><sentence id="2778">The fact that you have a child even at the breast will not save you." </sentence><sentence id="2779">And the, the ugliness of the German soldiers was such that they felt it. </sentence><sentence id="2780">And that I came from the, probably, I don't remember, but I came probably from the, from the Jewish agency, and that was reassuring for them. </sentence><sentence id="2781">I had their identity, I had their card, and they trusted it. </sentence><sentence id="2782">And then they were, were in such a....state that they had to trust somebody. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2818">Q: You did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2820">A: At that point, I had the feeling, because of the...because of the confrontation between the German soldier and the, and the women, I had the feeling that it was going to be very ugly. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2838">Q: No, see, I thought that you came prior to the Germans, that you would try to beat the timing of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2839">So you're there just as the German...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2842">A: I wouldn't have had a chance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2844">Q: Because the mothers wouldn't do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2846">A: They wouldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2847">But when they see -- saw the Germans come for the family and they're willing to let go of the child. </sentence><sentence id="2848">Then they realize the danger they were in, and they were willing to let go of the child. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2860">A: And it was not very difficult because they really banged -- they didn't knock at the door -- they really banged at the door. </sentence><sentence id="2861">And they looked... very... you would have to have a picture them -- they were Gestapo soldiers; they were not regular German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2862">Or they were French policemen. </sentence><sentence id="2863">But the whole, the whole episode was very dramatic and the women felt it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2868">Q: So, when they knocked at the door or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2870">A: They banged at the door! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2872">Q: ...banged at the door, were you standing with them? </sentence><sentence id="2873">Or did you, after they got in, you went in with...? </sentence><sentence id="2874">I mean, how... where were you...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2878">A: I guess I must have been with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2886"> A At other times, at other times, when I was taken with my mother, it was, it was another thing. </sentence><sentence id="2887">When they finally got my number and came for me early morning. </sentence><sentence id="2888">At that point, there were a lot of hysterics. </sentence><sentence id="2889">But when it was individual, the mothers were very protective of the child and if you have a young child, you don't want to be hysterical in front of the child, so they kept the face. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2894">Q: But often, the child feels the terror... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2896">A: They feel it but they freeze. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2898">Q: But they freeze? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2900">A: Which is what saved my life in the train when the Germans came in the compartment was that the reaction of fear in that child then is going to be freezing and not yelling. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2902">Q: But what happened to you when you, you... On the one hand, you're going to probably save the child. </sentence><sentence id="2903">On the other hand, you know that this child's mother is going to be killed and that the child will never see the mother again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2928">Q: So, the mother is taken, you have the child... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2930">A: Then, I give it during the day to the Jewish thing because I have to get my train ticket. </sentence><sentence id="2931">There is a procedure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2934">Q: So you go to the U.G.LF. </sentence><sentence id="2935">and they keep the children, the child. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2980">Q: And did you try to comfort them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2982">A: Sure, I was... warm and nice, but I was only 21. </sentence><sentence id="2983">I hadn't even slept with a man; I was out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2984">In the deep sense that I would have been when I had my own children in my arms, completely different, which probably helped. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3006">Q: Or did you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3008">A: At the time, you know, it was during war years, you did what you could. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And they are not that keen on cleanliness. </sentence><sentence id="3010">But the child was safe. </sentence><sentence id="3011">And I -- they had -- they had those long banks, which are fairly padded. </sentence><sentence id="3012">And I would give my warmth, in other words, I would put the baby on me so that, you know and I would wrap my arms around, so that the child felt protected at the end of a difficult day. </sentence><sentence id="3013">It was a difficult. </sentence><sentence id="3014">I, I tried to feel for the baby. </sentence><sentence id="3015">It must have been very horrible. </sentence><sentence id="3016">But they fell asleep and that's... until they stopped and they... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3026">Q: So, then you would get off at Nice, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3028">A: Yes, I had that episode when the Germans came in and the child... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3030">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="3031">And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3034">A: Because one time, the Germans, they were patrolling the train. </sentence><sentence id="3035">I don't know what for, but for... And at that time, I was frightened. </sentence><sentence id="3036">Because my life was really on the line, if the kid gave me away. </sentence><sentence id="3037">But I can remember, they absolutely froze; they never said a word, they were just stiff with fear. </sentence><sentence id="3038">They remembered the morning episode, the separation of their mother. </sentence><sentence id="3039">It was the end of a terrible day. </sentence><sentence id="3040">So, I didn't have any problem with the children, and we arrived in Nice finally. </sentence><sentence id="3041">And I still remember, I still remember the view of the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="3042">The Italians were cowards made live and had declared war with France, their neighbor, in June "40 and had moved militarily to Nice. </sentence><sentence id="3043">That's all. [ </sentence><sentence id="3044">Laughs] That's all they could manage. </sentence><sentence id="3045">And so they occupied from Monaco to Nice, which is 30 kilometers of France territory. </sentence><sentence id="3046">But for those kids it meant life and death because when you saw an Italian soldier, you knew that they were not going to kill any babies. </sentence><sentence id="3047">So that's it. </sentence><sentence id="3048">And I know that they took them to some religious institution in Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3064">Q: Now, was this established that the Italians police -- oh, not the Italian police -- the soldiers would take... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3072">A: Yes, yeah, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3073">But at that time, the, the Jewish organization in Paris must have communicated. </sentence><sentence id="3074">They had contact near the frontier, and those children were taken to convents. </sentence><sentence id="3075">And I know that because there was an enormous ruckus between those convents and Israel, at the end of the war, because Israel wanted those Jewish kids to come to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3076">And the Italians wouldn't give them. </sentence><sentence id="3077">At that point, I thought it was a huge joke, I couldn't care less... what happened, they were alive. </sentence><sentence id="3078">Whether they were Israeli citizen or Italian citizen or no citizen, they were safe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3086">Q: Now, how did people keep track of which child was, was actually who... you know what I mean? ... </sentence><sentence id="3087">the identity of the child? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3393">A: To the hotel in front of Flambaum, which is still there. </sentence><sentence id="3394">A beautiful hotel particulier. </sentence><sentence id="3395">And there, they take us to the... There that the Germans are, and then it becomes ugly, ugly, I mean, they start... My mother puts her hand on the table and they whipped her. </sentence><sentence id="3396">So, that sort of behavior I hadn't seen before. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3424">A: Yes, since they watched me wash, they watched me dress! </sentence><sentence id="3425">I was wearing the same thing I wore during the whole war years. </sentence><sentence id="3426">I spent a lot on shoes. </sentence><sentence id="3427">As I told you, the rich don't give up their shoes, so the luxury for me was to have shoes made to mesure -- custom made. </sentence><sentence id="3428">And no stockings because there were no stockings to be had during the war and, you know, I remember the coat, which was very handsome. </sentence><sentence id="3429">It was cut up from the beautiful coat of a man cousin of mine, the rich cousins. </sentence><sentence id="3430">So, I was simply well-dressed, no hat. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3454">A: They didn't speak, but they were with me. </sentence><sentence id="3455">And I came back and I snuck to the bathroom and that was so small they couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="3456">But they stayed at the door of the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="3457">I went to the bathroom and I went to my room and I got dressed and they were there when I got dressed. </sentence><sentence id="3458">Then that's when they got attached. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3464">Q: And that, in part -- they may have done it anyway -- but your mother knew that that was somehow... might, might work that they might get attached if they... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3466">A: I don't think that... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3474">A: They would have done anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="3475">I mean, that was part of the...humiliating you. </sentence><sentence id="3476">You know, it's humiliating to have somebody watch what you are washing your behind are two young people, snickering. </sentence><sentence id="3477">They didn't snicker. </sentence><sentence id="3478">They didn't say anything, do anything, just watched...but they were French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3484">Q: But they were French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3486">A: They were in a French uniform. </sentence><sentence id="3487">And then we went to the subway, in second class, not specially in a compartment. </sentence><sentence id="3488">And those were French people going to work very early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="3489">Therefore, those are not the bourgeois; those are the working class people. </sentence><sentence id="3490">And you feel that they didn't like it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3496">Q: Did they... anybody say anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3498">A: No! </sentence><sentence id="3499">That was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="3500">Those French people were a... police people are... well, they had their batons, at least, you know; it was dangerous to say anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3508">Q: And that's all they did? </sentence><sentence id="3509">They didn't, they didn't beat her; they simply didn't want her hand on the table, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3512">A: Just a whip. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3514">Q: Yeah, and it hurt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3516">A: Probably, she didn't say anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3518">Q: So, you were then put in this room with about 50 other people, mainly women -- or all women and children, no men. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3534">Q: Any windows? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3536">A: I think there was, going into the courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="3537">Nobody tried anything. </sentence><sentence id="3538">They were kind of, you go into a sort of what you would call a state of shock. </sentence><sentence id="3539">You are not quite at your most vivid at that moment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3544">Q: So, people are not talking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3546">A: People are not talking, but they are passing pieces of paper to me with their name and addresses to contact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3548">Q: But that's only when they knew that you were leaving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3550">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3552">Q: No, they just did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3554">A: From the word go, they knew I had a baptism certificate. </sentence><sentence id="3555">And my mother was flaunting it probably and talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="3556">And they knew that if one person had a chance of getting out, I was the one, and therefore I could contact, because they had no way of contacting their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="3557">So, I came out with a list of names and addresses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3562">Q: [Background person says something to interviewer] Okay, so we're now back after that little interruption. </sentence><sentence id="3563">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5415">Q: So, did you see John for about a month in December? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5417">A: Very little, very little. </sentence><sentence id="5418">1 was heavily dating elsewhere, and it was absolutely spat at to date somebody in uniform in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="5419">We were... We'd go to a theater together; we received insults when we would come down the aisle. </sentence><sentence id="5420">Really, insults. </sentence><sentence id="5421">Because I was dating a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="5422">You just did not date the conquering soldier. </sentence><sentence id="5423">It was spat upon by the French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5431">Q: In spite of the fact that these were soldiers who had... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5433">A: Oh, the French never liked to be... It is not easy to be liberated by somebody that you do not respect intellectually, and also someone so new. </sentence><sentence id="5434">To this day I'm getting the articles about how, the same thing, they think we are young and innocent in a bad sense of the word. </sentence><sentence id="5435">So, they were very... antagonistic. </sentence><sentence id="5436">So, when we would go out outside, it was courage to go out with a then-American soldier because you did get passing insults. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5441">Q: So, did you ask him not to wear his uniform? </sentence><sentence id="5442">Or he had to wear his uniform all the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5445">A: Well, of course, and I... He was liberating us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5447">Q: Did he propose to you very quickly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5449">A: He proposed to me very quickly, if you count...

He was gone by the time of 27" of January; he left around middle January. </sentence><sentence id="5451">So, if you count the time where I am very busy dating, it's December to the third week of January. </sentence><sentence id="5452">And then he said he was interested. </sentence><sentence id="5453">And then, again, we hadn't touched each other; we hadn't even kissed on the cheek. </sentence><sentence id="5454">He had sat by my bed and we had discoursed for a long time in the evening, and what happened and what is what I deeply believe in -- I don't know that my children do, but, but that's their lives -- I believe that to marry somebody you have to have the same political opinions, if not religious opinions. </sentence><sentence id="5455">We were both at ease, and both left -- not too far left, but for the poor. </sentence><sentence id="5456">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="5457">You have two things in common, you have it made. </sentence><sentence id="5458">With Toulet (ph), he was Catholic, practicing Catholic and far right. </sentence><sentence id="5459">As we said to each other, "We don't need to go out for election, we stay home" and we would cancel each other. </sentence><sentence id="5460">We cannot marry and make it, and make a 60-year commitment, as I with John, with somebody who destroys your vote when you go to the voting booth. </sentence><sentence id="5461">So that counted a lot. </sentence><sentence id="5462">We were really very close, so I said, "No, I am not going to touch, marriage-wise, anybody in uniform." </sentence><sentence id="5463">I had seen the French uniform, the English uniform, the German uniform, the American uniform.

He came back by boat; at the time we didn't have the planes -- So, he sent me a telegram and said, "Reserve the 14". </sentence><sentence id="5468">Signed, the Huron" which is the critical term that Voltaire has for guys from the Pampa. </sentence><sentence id="5469">And he came back...Oh, do my dates make sense? </sentence><sentence id="5470">He left in December, we wrote to each other, he came back on the 13" of July and the 13" in the evening we were then engaged. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5506">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5508">A: Not only out of uniform, to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="5509">So, he got a job at the same hotel where they... that had been occupied with the Germans, was then occupied by the Americans and he got a job as an assistant to the Brigadier General, whatever, in charge of American things in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="5510">And then he had a job and then the day he was back, we had got engaged. </sentence><sentence id="5511">I never believed in waiting. </sentence><sentence id="5512">As I said, there is an element of luck, and also, don't let it pass by -- grab it. </sentence><sentence id="5513">So we did. </sentence><sentence id="5514">And the 13" or the 14" we were engaged. </sentence><sentence id="5515">And when we were married, the French did not like at all officially the idea that a French woman would marry an American, not done. </sentence><sentence id="5516">So they had us wait and the first date we could get was in September, so we were married in September *45. </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="5874">Cause I think it's, I think it's more constructive for old age. </sentence><sentence id="5875">It's more stimulating for him. </sentence><sentence id="5876">I take over the cleaning up and the dishes, which is not much fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5884">Q: Was this the first time you were in a kitchen? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5914">A: It's all right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5916">Q: And why Ancient Greek? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5918">A: It was the field I was the least proficient in. </sentence><sentence id="5919">And when I came here I was so proficient in French and in Latin that it would have been ridiculous for me to... And I am glad because it's a one-on-one -- at that level, it's a one-on-one relationship for the PhD. So, it would have been devastating to have a relationship -- and they were... I didn't like them very much. </sentence><sentence id="5920">And they... the little bit of the relationship I had, they already were very resentful that I was so superior. </sentence><sentence id="5921">I mean, you think of it, I had had fourteen years of Greek by the time I reached Chicago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5926">Q: Fourteen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5928">A: Fourteen, because you start in guatorzieme, quinzieme, seizieme, philosophie and then | went through all the competitive... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5930">Q: So, you're saying that the other students were resentful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5932">A: Yes, and the teachers also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5934">Q: The teachers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5936">A: I didn't get along at all well. </sentence><sentence id="5937">You know, I had to have special -- for a PhD, you have to have, whatever you call it, in each field. </sentence><sentence id="5938">You have to have an exam and the French person didn't like it, didn't like me, I felt. </sentence><sentence id="5939">It was very difficult to teach me. </sentence><sentence id="5940">What is he going to teach me? </sentence><sentence id="5941">I remember, I showed some authors and he... he wasn't interested in them. </sentence><sentence id="5942">I wasn't the run-of-the-mill student that he was expecting. </sentence><sentence id="5943">But -- and those were the rough years. </sentence><sentence id="5944">The weather was... Talk about yesterday, you know. </sentence><sentence id="5945">That plus was the day in and day out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5956">Q: Cold, very cold. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5958">A: Oh, biting cold and we, we had to cross the Midway. </sentence><sentence id="5959">And I told you, that's one thing I don't like is cold. </sentence><sentence id="5960">And you could not escape it without a car in Chicago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5964">Q: So, Chicago was much colder, even though it was extremely uncomfortable during the war. </sentence><sentence id="5965">It was not this cold, or was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5968">A: Paris, [laughs] when they say they have a cold wave, it's a joke. </sentence><sentence id="5969">I told you, there is one inch of snow and the Luxembourg will close its gates. </sentence><sentence id="5970">And they take pictures of all the museums with the little statue with a crummy little inch on the shoulders of the statue and they have a snowstorm. </sentence><sentence id="5971">No, so even in the depth of it, Paris is livable. </sentence><sentence id="5972">Chicago was, was really biting cold. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5978">Q: Were there... I'm assuming there were very few women PhD students in 1948, even in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="5979">You must have been not only a superior student in Ancient Greek, but there weren't, women were not going and getting... a lot of people weren't going and getting PhDs. </sentence><sentence id="5980">But certainly not women, so you must have been...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5984">A: I was, we were isolated. </sentence><sentence id="5985">We were very self-sufficient and busy studying and I have pictures in that student apartment where I with my great dictionaries and John with his law studies. </sentence><sentence id="5986">We were happy and self-sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="5987">I, I don't... I had some...they had some war... He had a G.I. Bill. </sentence><sentence id="5988">We lived on that G.I. Bill. </sentence><sentence id="5989">And he had some friends in law school who lived in war... it was sort of huts in the middle of Midway. </sentence><sentence id="5990">And we thought it was paradise that they had a place. </sentence><sentence id="5991">You know, we, we had not really, in the States, a real apartment of our own. </sentence><sentence id="5992">But it never was a problem for me not having much to live on, as long as I had the books and studies and John. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6002">Q: How long did it take you to get a PhD? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6004">A: I never finished it. </sentence><sentence id="6005">By that time, I was closing in and starting having to write a thesis since I passed all the exams, and I had to pass one in French, which I remember "cause John said it was a big joke "cause it took me a long time. </sentence><sentence id="6006">He didn't realize it was a test on my English, not just my French. </sentence><sentence id="6007">Dr. Smith took off and I was left in the lurch, and at that point, I said, "Look, who needs it? </sentence><sentence id="6008">I have a certificate of proficiency in all the fields..." even in German -- that's when I studied German. </sentence><sentence id="6009">And if I had time, that's what I would study. </sentence><sentence id="6010">I'm fascinated by deepening the German language. </sentence><sentence id="6011">I had to study German for the PhD in Greek because many of the learned books on Ancient Greeks are in German. </sentence><sentence id="6012">So, I passed the German proficiency exam; it was a written exam not a spoken one. </sentence><sentence id="6013">Oh, I remember going to a course and there was a guy teaching the course. </sentence><sentence id="6014">And I was distraught at the idea of coming from the war, having to study German, and he began to say something in German to the class and I utterly disliked it. </sentence><sentence id="6015">And he sensed it and he called me after class and he said, "Don't you feel that way. </sentence><sentence id="6016">Iam a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="6017">So, you don't have to be so frightened of me." </sentence><sentence id="6018">But I was delighted that I had only to write, to know how to read. </sentence><sentence id="6019">And I love the literature. </sentence><sentence id="6020">And I love the literature... I have to find those books. </sentence><sentence id="6021">Anybody that can find those books for me is my love. </sentence><sentence id="6022">There was a series of books, nine in number, which are extremely well done by cognates. </sentence><sentence id="6023">You, you have to realize that 75 percent of all of the languages have common Greek and Latin roots. </sentence><sentence id="6024">So, you start with the literature; it's all written in German. </sentence><sentence id="6025">And you read the nine little books and at the end, you are reading German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6049">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6051">A: And there is no grammar at all; nine little books and no grammar. </sentence><sentence id="6052">You have the same in French. </sentence><sentence id="6053">I think I have the French series. </sentence><sentence id="6054">And it's a very clever way of doing it "cause you get yourself into it without noticing it. </sentence><sentence id="6055">Then you'll be able to read it. </sentence><sentence id="6056">So I read it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6063">Q: Your professor left University of Chicago and they had no replacement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6065">A: No, no replacement. </sentence><sentence id="6066">She was taking a break, but it was really not a moral thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="6067">She shouldn't have in the middle of the year then that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6071">Q: Right and with only one, one PhD student. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6073">A: [Laughs] Well, that's probably why she took the pretext that there wasn't much for her to stay. </sentence><sentence id="6074">So, I didn't miss it, you know; I always went by without...All -- It's called All But the Thesis... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6077">Q: A.B.D. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6079">A: A.B.D., whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6085">A: I always found a jobs and we moved with my jobs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6087">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6089">A: So I wrote and found and we moved wherever I found. </sentence><sentence id="6090">And I wrote to the University of Maryland and hop! </sentence><sentence id="6091">they jumped at me. </sentence><sentence id="6092">So I began teaching at Maryland and we came to the area, and that's the way we started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6097">Q: And did you love teaching? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6099">A: Not at Maryland. </sentence><sentence id="6100">I don't know if I dare say that. </sentence><sentence id="6101">The -- their student body was very poor. </sentence><sentence id="6102">And the faculty wasn't much higher. </sentence><sentence id="6103">Johns Hopkins was -- I taught at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Studies -- that was interesting -- on Massachusetts Avenue. </sentence><sentence id="6104">American U. wasn't very interesting either; the teachers were better but the students were still very mediocre. </sentence><sentence id="6105">There isn't really... It is not really an area of great universities. </sentence><sentence id="6106">It's not very stimulating. </sentence><sentence id="6107">But, by that time, I was teaching also in the daytime. </sentence><sentence id="6108">Those were only evening jobs, I told you, because by that time we supported both my mother and aunt in their retirement. </sentence><sentence id="6109">Their retirement from government was very pitiful so we supplemented it. </sentence><sentence id="6110">And I was teaching during the daytime at Mount Vernon College and I -- The Greek died, the Latin died, the French at that time began to die off. </sentence><sentence id="6111">And they said, "What are we going to do with you?" </sentence><sentence id="6112">I said, "There is one thing you don't have." </sentence><sentence id="6113">It was "63. " </sentence><sentence id="6114">It's a program of Continuing Education." </sentence><sentence id="6115">And I opened in the area the first program of Continuing Education for --I called that for women and men. </sentence><sentence id="6116">And now the whole college is living out of its programs for women. </sentence><sentence id="6117">But it, there was no program for women at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6137">Q: Then how did you come to that? </sentence><sentence id="6138">That was a very new idea at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6141">A: Because I was going to lose my job. " </sentence><sentence id="6142">How did you come to that?" [ </sentence><sentence id="6143">Laughs] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6147">Q: [Laughs] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6149">A: That is a very good incentive. </sentence><sentence id="6150">I still have the first program. </sentence><sentence id="6151">I made it, pasted it by hand. </sentence><sentence id="6152">And I was very imaginative. </sentence><sentence id="6153">I started, I had started with non-credit courses and I had the most imaginative program in the city. </sentence><sentence id="6154">I had a friend of John, and he was a builder, you know, he had built his own house. </sentence><sentence id="6155">So, I had a course. </sentence><sentence id="6156">And I had another one, he was very good with tinkering with car, a course in auto-mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="6157">I had a course in home repairs at the time when, on Foxhall Road, you had, you had people flocking for the home repair. </sentence><sentence id="6158">And people flocking for the car repair course. </sentence><sentence id="6159">And I had, you know, the bet-... and I paid them very highly as I had been highly paid in France and they enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="6160">It became humongously successful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6173">Q: It was very smart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6175">A: It was a clever idea and I enjoyed it and they enjoyed it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6177">Q: And when did you have your children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6179">A: I placed them. </sentence><sentence id="6180">I missed, I missed the summer months in both cases. </sentence><sentence id="6181">I was a teacher, so three months, that was perfect. </sentence><sentence id="6182">Missed both cases and I hit on Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="6183">So, I had two Christmas vacations and I had Silvia. </sentence><sentence id="6184">My daughter was born on the 21" of December, and I went back to school on the fourth. </sentence><sentence id="6185">I never missed a beat. </sentence><sentence id="6186">I went to the hospital -- I was so pregnant you could have pushed me I would have rolled down the hill -- and I had her without pain. </sentence><sentence id="6187">I mean, the children were the least problem of my life. </sentence><sentence id="6188">And when I had Olivier, the first one, in Paris, I was in the delivery room and John was outside and he heard the baby cry, and he stopped the nurse and said, "That was, there, there, what's that?" </sentence><sentence id="6189">and she said, ""You must be teasing me. </sentence><sentence id="6190">She's been there for 15 minutes." </sentence><sentence id="6191">He said, "Was there, is there another baby there?" </sentence><sentence id="6192">She said, "No, I checked and it was..."
