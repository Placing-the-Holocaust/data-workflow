<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2589">A: My mother working with the Jewish organization had -- thanks again to the organization of the German -- an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the addresses of the specific raids. </sentence><sentence id="2590">And that's the way I knew where to go to get the children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2593">Q: But was... Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew? </sentence><sentence id="2594">Were they in some sense assisting with the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2597">A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="2598">It probably was. </sentence><sentence id="2599">There was a point there where it was unhealthy. </sentence><sentence id="2600">But for my sake, it was practical. </sentence><sentence id="2601">I think after the war, there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the relationship that they maybe shouldn't have had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2607">Q: But when your mother... Your mother would give you the information... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2609">A: I guess that's the way I got it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2629">Q: But you don't... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2631">A: But everything, everything was so...shrug your shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="2632">You do it and then that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2633">I thought it was normal, in other words, I never made... until you shook me up, I never thought of it. </sentence><sentence id="2634">Definitely normal behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2635">What are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="2636">Sit back and let it be. </sentence><sentence id="2637">So, I moved and in the same way, she thought it was absolutely normal that I, being the type of person that I was, would feel that I had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And I was in an unusual position that I could do something. </sentence><sentence id="2639">Because of the way the French government was going to protect me, one way or the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2649">Q: So you felt... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2651">A: Compelled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2653">Q: [Coughs] I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2654">You felt compelled to do something, but you also knew that the French government would protect you, which didn't mean that you were totally protected because the Germans might do something, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2657">A: Well... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2659">Q: There was some danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2661"> A That came, that came -- for instance, when I think of it, the vivid image I have is that moment on the train in the middle of the night when a German soldier opened the compartment door, and I felt at that point, I felt a very deep fear, because if the kid or whoever it was that I was transporting -- and it was a kid capable of talking -- had given out anything to verify that I was not with the mother, I was dead -- I was just as good as dead at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2662">So, when I went into it, I didn't know the extent of the danger and most of the time, probably, I wasn't discovered, so there was no danger. </sentence><sentence id="2663">It worked well. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2709">Q: So your mother -- You recall your mother giving you the names and addresses of people you were going to be taken. </sentence><sentence id="2710">And they clearly, they were taking large groups of people at once? </sentence><sentence id="2711">Or they were taking a few at a time that they...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2715">A: They came, they came individually. </sentence><sentence id="2716">They would come to your apartment and ring, and if the bell rang at four o'clock in the morning, you knew who it was. </sentence><sentence id="2717">And what happened is that after the Vel d'Hiv -- this is when the Vel d'Hiv come in -- they would not anymore -- I didn't see it in the book -- but they would not anymore tackle young children. </sentence><sentence id="2718">So, the Germans were delighted to have somebody take them off their hands. </sentence><sentence id="2719">Because it created such an endless fear of revolt among the French that they were afraid that at some point the whole city would rebel against them. </sentence><sentence id="2720">So, in some ways, I was in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="2721">It was a sort of a cloaque, you know, of ugly things. </sentence><sentence id="2722">It was some very shady participation there. </sentence><sentence id="2723">"Cause it had, at some point, to have the German willingness to give the babies, and that happened at the very specific date.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2770">A: Yes, and there is some persuading to do, because the women, as we know from personal experience, do not give away their children. </sentence><sentence id="2771">So I had some persuading to do to them, which was the difficult part. </sentence><sentence id="2772">It was in two parts: first, "This is it, you are doomed". </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2776">Q: You would tell them that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2778">A: I don't know how I did, but I passed on that message. " </sentence><sentence id="2779">As far as you are concerned, let it be, there is nothing anybody can do. </sentence><sentence id="2780">But there's something that that German soldier is going to allow to be done and that can be done: that I take that child away, and your child is safe." </sentence><sentence id="2781">And then I would get the child. </sentence><sentence id="2782">And the same day, he was in Italy, he or she, I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
