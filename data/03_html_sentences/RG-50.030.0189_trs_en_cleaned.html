to Cohen, who considered him as his preferred nephew, who had no children, and, therefore, the close relationship. </sentence><sentence id="92">He was in reality very knowledgeable in German

modern American art. </sentence><sentence id="99">It was very appreciated. </sentence><sentence id="100">He was at home in many ways in many fields of human knowledge and endeavors.

</sentence><sentence id="113">This was the other part. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was deeply interested in politics all my life. </sentence><sentence id="115">And I saw the disappearance, slow

of the republic died. </sentence><sentence id="118">I took part in the 1925 -- I think, in the funeral in the Lustgarten with the hundreds of thousands of people. </sentence><sentence id="119">And I felt already then somehow instinctive whether we hadn't already buried the republic there. </sentence><sentence id="120">And all the more when Hindenburg, to our great disappointment, was elected president. </sentence><sentence id="121">And -- which was, of course, a terrible regressive step from the point of view of democracy. </sentence><sentence id="122">This all I lived very intensely and followed very intensely. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I saw with growing fear what was happening, and the great uccess of the racist and Nazi movements. </sentence><sentence id="124">I finished my school in 1929 with a very good examination. </sentence><sentence id="125">I went my first term -- I followed in the University in Freiburg im Breisgau -- was my first being outside the house and on my own. </sentence><sentence id="126">I continued in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="127">I went again the next summer to Heidelberg, which was perhaps the greatest experience in my university

the German people -- and you were, by the rejection which you felt -- always more separating yourselves from this milieu, from this concept of belonging to the German people. </sentence><sentence

on. </sentence><sentence id="140">But I was very conscious about -- as I said, about the going-down of the republic. </sentence><sentence id="141">When I was a student, I joined the Association of the Republican Students. </sentence><sentence id="142">And this was not an accident. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="143">In Baden, where both the University in Freiburg and in Heidelberg were located, there were still student elections. </sentence><sentence id="144">In Prussia, these elections for the student representation at universities had already been suppressed because the Nazis had gained large majorities all over. </sentence><sentence id="145">But in Baden it was still allowed. </sentence><sentence id="146">And I took part in the student elections in my first term, in my third term, made speeches, organized, cooperated at that time with people -- very interesting people. </sentence><sentence id="147">Our patron was an old German professor, von Schuelze-Gevanitz. </sentence><sentence id="148">His son was later a consul in Zurich -- very important consul, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="149">Schuelze-Gevenitz was an economist, a sociologist, a very wonderful human being. </sentence><sentence id="150">And one of the students with whom I cooperated then was a man who became very famous, had a very sad life, was Schulze Baeusen. </sentence><sentence id="151">He had just joined the democratic movement, coming from the Jungdeutsche Orden. </sentence><sentence id="152">He ended as a Communist, was one of the founders of the Rote

the elections in 1929. </sentence><sentence id="155">I would never have expected that he would go so far to the right and to be so true to his ideals. </sentence><sentence id="156">Anyhow, you see that I was involved in this. </sentence><sentence id="157">I was also involved in Heidelberg. </sentence><sentence id="158">But there -- this was 1930. </sentence><sentence id="159">There I already separated somehow and visited regularly the Zionist groups. </sentence><sentence id="160">I never joined the Zionist student groups, but I had many friends there, and even raveled on some of their

Let me interrupt for a second. </sentence><sentence id="166">Would it be fair to say that as of roughly this time, near 1930, you are still balancing in your mind the dual loyalty of being German and Jewish and trying to figure out for yourself what are the problems and where does one have to come down? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="167">A. Well, I came certainly -- I started certainly as a conscious German, but deeply offended as a Jew by what happened to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="168">And was struggling first to defend it from inside, and then I saw more and more that this didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="169">And so my way of retreating from identification with the German nation became more and more clear. </sentence><sentence id="170">I think this is as far as I can get it, but I think this is the right description. </sentence><sentence id="171">And when I finished my studies -- by the way, I would say that here, also, I am far from being only a jurist, only legacy. </sentence><sentence id="172">I was deeply involved in all kinds of other things. </sentence><sentence id="173">I followed especially the historians, Ongden, for instance, in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="174">I followed philosophers, Jaspers, Spengler, was deeply involved in all kinds of other art, history, and so on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="175">The ideal of universal Bildung, which I learned, so to speak, with the milk of my mother -- in the family, it was deeply working on me. </sentence><sentence id="176">And I took it over from my father, from my parents. </sentence><sentence id="177">And I was never one-sided. </sentence><sentence id="178">Even in my whole Jewish career, you will find in my library sections on philosophy and history and on economy and you name it. </sentence><sentence id="179">And I used my university years to the full to get involved and educated in many other fields. </sentence><sentence id="180">Now, I finished my studies with the so-called "Referendar" Exam. </sentence><sentence id="181">This is the first great examination after three, three and a half years of study. </sentence><sentence id="182">And I got a very good result, and was then named in the first days of 1933 as "Referendar," which is a kind of assistant to a judge, if you want. </sentence><sentence id="183">It's really the practical years, where you use what you have learned in a practical way. </sentence><sentence id="184">You spend time at different tribunals at various degrees in the administration, and as a lawyer, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I was in the first stage of this. </sentence><sentence id="186">I was at the Amtsgericht Weding. </sentence><sentence id="187">It's the largest tribunal of the first instance in Berlin. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="188"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="189">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="190"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="191"> And I wrote the judgments for the judge, which he signed. </sentence><sentence id="192">And active in all kinds of legal assistance, and so on, wrote what was asked for in this position. </sentence><sentence id="193">Then came Hitler to power the 30th of January, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="194">And this, of course, gave us a terrible shock. </sentence><sentence id="195">All the more -- Q. You did not expect it? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">A. Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="197">But here I would say, in the November elections, "32, you know, during that year, we had -- I don't know -- three, four elections. </sentence><sentence id="198">In the November elections the Nazi party for the first time had lost more than a million of votes. </sentence><sentence id="199">And it looked at that moment that it was not absolutely necessary. </sentence><sentence id="200">And the whole thing that he got into the place as chancellor was an intrigue started by the people around the president, Hindenburg, because of some of the scandals in the eastern Prussia. </sentence><sentence id="201">And then Papen and the other reactionary politicians combined in order, in a great miscalculation, to bring about the coalition between the Deutsch Nationale Volkspartei and the Nazi parties, believing that they would dominate Hitler, which was, of course, ridiculous from the point of view of political judgment. </sentence><sentence id="202">When Hitler came to power, I was very soon convinced that this was a decisive point in the history of Germany, and I was very soon convinced that they would not give up power, and that this would lead to terrible persecutions for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="203">I was a little -- we come back to this -- a number of these Nazi manifestations, and so on, on the 30th of January, when he took power, and the Ist of April, and the Boycott, and so on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="204">And I decided to leave Germany. </sentence><sentence id="205">We were under an illusion. </sentence><sentence id="206">We didn't know the world outside. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="207">We didn't realize how deeply the economic crisis had worked. </sentence><sentence id="208">We thought that first the younger generation should get out and then the older should follow. </sentence><sentence id="209">But the chance to build up a new </sentence></p><p><sentence id="210"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="211">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="212"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="213"> 0 existence for the younger generation was practically nil. </sentence><sentence id="214">I would have liked to go then to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="215">The Zionist ideal, as I already said, worked very strongly on me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">Q. Excuse me a second. </sentence><sentence id="217">Were there any specific events that precipitated your decision to leave, or was this just your general impression after Hitler had taken power -- A.

What happened, Dr. Riegner, to this man who gave you a prophecy about the fate of European Jewry? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1425">A. When I remembered this prophecy, I had to remember his very sad end. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And the Germans marched into Poland in the fall 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1427">There was shortly after a pogrom in Bromberg and in Poznan -- must have been in October or so -- where five thousand Jews were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And Walter Gerson, who had fled from Danzig to the Polish territories, was one of the first victims of this pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="1429">I had not forgotten this. </sentence><sentence id="1430">Now, let me tell you why I believed -- and I can I believe say also Segalovitz believed the truth of the story. </sentence><sentence id="1431">There were three major reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1432">The first was that Hitler had himself announced a number of times, usually on the anniversary of the day that he took power, the 30th of January, where there were usually a great manifestation. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And already on the 30th of January 39, before the war broke out, he threatened the Jews, whom he accused to want to push for the war, and he threatened them that if -- one thing is certain, he said.

Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1436">He repeated this threat a number of times, usually, as I said, on the 30th of January. </sentence><sentence id="1437">And I remembered this. </sentence><sentence id="1438">I was following this in "36 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1439">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

</sentence><sentence id="1442">And I was usually commenting on such speeches to a number of journalists in Geneva who followed together with me these speeches. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And I said to myself, we haven't taken Mein Kampf seriously. </sentence><sentence id="1444">He announced all what he was going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And nobody had taken it seriously. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Here again is a threat. </sentence><sentence id="1447">Nobody is taking it seriously. </sentence><sentence id="1448">But now we cannot ignore it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1449">This was the first reason. </sentence><sentence id="1450">The second reason was -- we are on the last of July, the first of August -- and as I told you before, we knew, of course, many things which happened before. </sentence><sentence id="1451">We knew of the deportations from Berlin, from Vienna, from Prague, from other places. </sentence><sentence id="1452">But something was new. </sentence><sentence id="1453">On the 14th, 15th of July, 1942, suddenly -- and nobody understood why -- tens of thousands of Jews were arrested, in all great cities of western Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1454">In Amsterdam, in Brussels, in Antwerp, in Paris, in Lyon, in Marseilles, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Suddenly, tens of thousands of people were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And in the week before already the first trains of deportations left to the east. </sentence><sentence id="1457">As I said, nobody understood why suddenly this happens. </sentence><sentence id="1458">The report of Schulte gave the explanation. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Behind all this there was a plan. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Behind all what we knew about the starvation, the terrible living conditions, the ghettoization, the deportations, the mass murders -- behind all this was one decisive fact, a decision by the Nazis to exterminate the totality of the Jews of Europe. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1461">And the third reason why I believed it has very much to do with my own origin from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1462">I knew the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1463">I knew their brutality. </sentence><sentence id="1464">I knew their fanaticism. </sentence><sentence id="1465">I knew that, contrary to all other enemies in history which we have encountered, we have here a group which is absolutely fanaticized, which is absolutely determined to live up to its aims and for whom the Jew was a personification of the devil, the personification of everything evil in the world, and that it was one -- not one, but the central aim of the Nazi party program. </sentence><sentence id="1466">It is

have already spoken about my experiences as a student in the student elections. </sentence><sentence id="1475">But I have seen it, also, in my experience, the day when they arrived to power, the demonstrations on the 30th of January, on the 1st of April, the boycotting. </sentence><sentence id="1476">I knew about who had burned the Reichstag. </sentence><sentence id="1477">When I left in May

id="1479">I knew about the torture of his political enemies which took place in the building of the former Communist newspaper, the Rote Fahne. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And everybody who was a little bit interested in the political affairs knew it. </sentence><sentence id="1481">I knew about the violence with which they fought their political enemies. </sentence><sentence id="1482">There was a famous story about the murder in a Polish -- German Polish frontier city, which -- in which they ruthlessly turned the facts upside down, and we knew that the German Nazis were full of fanaticism and did not know any ethical or moral limits to their exercise of power, that for them, good is what benefits Germany, as the Nazis understood it, was the essence of their doctrine. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And in this, the Jewish question was the central point. </sentence><sentence id="1484">Now, I did not limit myself to convincing myself that all these reasons made the report of Schulte very probable and very nearly convinced myself that it is an accurate report. </sentence><sentence id="1485">I told so, also, the American vice-consul, whom I met.

this, given some information of it -- you will see that I was very strong in my convictions. </sentence><sentence id="1514">And I told them, in spite of these words, that I was convinced that the things were serious, and I gave him all the reasons why I believed in it. </sentence><sentence id="1515">Elting must have consulted his chief, Mr. Squire, a consul, whom I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1516">Elting I had never met. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And they agreed, and he sent the text to Bern legation, and that they should forward everything to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="1518">I said, in fact, three things to Elting: "Inform your government, check the contents, what I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1519">You have the Secret Service. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I don't. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And three, give this telegram to Wise, the president of the World Jewish Congress, in Washington." </sentence><sentence id="1522">And I said the same to the vice-consul of the British, and asked him to give the -- send the telegram to Mr. Sydney Silverman, who was the chairman of the British section of the World Jewish Congress and a very prominent member of the British Parliament. </sentence><sentence id="1523">In fact, the two telegrams were identical, with one exception, and it's very typical, the exception. </sentence><sentence id="1524">The telegram to Silverman said at the end, "Inform and consult New York." </sentence><sentence id="1525">Now, as I had sent the other telegram to Wise, it doesn't make much sense, but it shows that I was not convinced that the Americans would deliver the telegram to Wise, and that I was convinced that the British, because of their parliamentary traditions, would not dare not deliver the message to a prominent member of Parliament, and my guess was true. </sentence><sentence id="1526">It happened exactly like this. </sentence><sentence id="1527">The Americans did not deliver the message to Wise and informed me so by letter from Mr. Squire, the American consul, on the date of the 24th of August, in which he writes that (reading) "I am informed that the legation at Bern transmitted the substance of this telegram to the Department of State for delivery to Dr. Wise in its discretion, but it is now in receipt of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1528"> This is a verbatim transcript of

the message in question in view of the apparently unsubstantiated character of the information which forms its main theme." </sentence><sentence id="1532">Now, I don't know what I could have substantiated more. </sentence><sentence id="1533">I know we know from some of the historians who have studied the files in the State Department that some people were afraid of Wise, and if the rabbi finds out, he will make a big scandal. </sentence><sentence id="1534">But this is only the first instance of a very unfriendly attitude of the Department of State in this whole matter. </sentence><sentence id="1535">With regard to the British, they delivered the message to Sydney Silverman, although it took ten days, and I never found out why. </sentence><sentence id="1536">Apparently they looked for him in London, but the parliamentary session was finished, and so he was at home in Liverpool and -- but it's not clear why they couldn't find him earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1537">Finally, they found him, but he didn't believe in the thing, either. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And you study today the files which have been published -- after all, this is now public -- to a great extent, at least -- public property, you will see the marks in the file of the State Department: "These are wild rumors borne out of Jewish fears." </sentence><sentence id="1539">For the first ten or fourteen days, or even more, nobody cared for the substance, what I had informed. </sentence><sentence id="1540">They only asked, "Who is Riegner?" </sentence><sentence id="1541">And my name was at that time completely unknown, for several reasons. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1542">One of the reasons, that my family was until the end of 1938 still in Germany, and I had asked all colleagues in the Congress to keep my name out of circulation and out from documents. </sentence><sentence id="1543">So nobody had seen my name. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And when they asked in London at the Jewish agency and some other places, they didn't know me, either, because I had nothing to do with them. </sentence><sentence

Yeah -- believability to these reports. </sentence><sentence id="1550">And I am -- some of the historians have shown that my telegram finally has completely changed the attitude of the British government in the case -- on the whole subject of war crimes and war criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Now, when the telegram was received by Silverman, he tried to telephone to Wise in America and was prevented by the War Department to do so. </sentence><sentence id="1552">Finally, the War Department sent a coded telegram to Wise in New York, from Silverman -- and it is only when this arrived in New York, was fully informed. </sentence><sentence id="1553">Now, the question about how did the Jews react to -- let's say the Congress people? </sentence><sentence id="1554">This is something which I am, of course, interested very much, and I have three or four witnesses on which I can report. </sentence><sentence id="1555">I asked my colleague in New York, Morris Bernzweig, who was the head of the International Affairs Department in New York -- who was British, but during the war he went to New York -- and asked him, "How did you react to this? </sentence><sentence id="1556">You were present when the telegram arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1557">Did you believe it, or did you have doubts? </sentence><sentence id="1558">What?" </sentence><sentence id="1559">He said clearly to me, "Nobody put this report into question. </sentence><sentence id="1560">We took it. </sentence><sentence id="1561">We accepted it." </sentence><sentence id="1562">As a matter of fact, Stephen Wise, when he got it, wrote two letters, deeply -- which he is deeply worried, deeply moved, deeply in despair, one to Justice Frankfurter, and he writes in a few lines that he received this message, and that he is in despair. </sentence><sentence id="1563">What could one do? </sentence><sentence id="1564">And he asked Frankfurter to inform the boss, which means Roosevelt, which Frankfurter has certainly done. </sentence><sentence id="1565">They were in very close relations. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And he underlines -- and this is very funny for me -- that the report come from one whom he names "very conservative." </sentence><sentence id="1567">Now, I have never been described by anybody as a very conservative person, but what Wise obviously meant, that I am very careful in my judgment, that I am not a "Schreier", and that I am known for my reliability and for my good judgment. </sentence><sentence id="1568">It's interesting to see such -- such words to appear when you feel you are really not a very conservative person. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1569">But -- in this sense of reliability and not exaggerating, and so on, it is very accurate.

id="1575">What's the name? </sentence><sentence id="1576">The pastor and the minister, the name -- you have to correct that -- the -- it's one of the closest friends -- a Protestant pastor with whom Wise was very close, and they exchanged the pulpit even, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1577">And there is in the letters which Foss has edited, an outburst of his despair, "What can we do?" </sentence><sentence id="1578">And sees that he is absolutely shaken at his foundations about this report, and sees the catastrophe and takes it for serious, too. </sentence><sentence id="1579">I mean, there is no doubt. </sentence><sentence id="1580">He has known me in "36 at the Congress. </sentence><sentence id="1581">He has known me on one or two other occasions when we met and had obviously great respect for my integrity and my reliability. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And Wise goes to Sumner Welles and -- not knowing, of course, that the telegram is laying in the State Department -- and Sumner Welles forbids the publication. </sentence><sentence id="1583">There are people who criticized Wise that he accepted this. </sentence><sentence id="1584">I don't know whether he was right or he was wrong. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1585">But he agreed that they will make other inquiries about the reliability of the content, the veracity of the content of the cable, and has decided to ask the Vatican and the International Red Cross for their opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1586">Now, the Vatican -- this I have described in one of my speeches in Cincinnati has a very strange attitude. </sentence><sentence id="1587">Titmann, who was the deputy to the official representative of the president to the Vatican, insists a number of times to get information of the attitude of the Vatican on this information. </sentence><sentence id="1588">And finally, he gets a wishy-washy reply: "We know, also, that there are very bad reports coming in about the treatment of the Jews, but we have no onfirmation about the story of the extermination." </sentence><sentence id="1589">And more or less this is the reply. </sentence><sentence id="1590">Very strange. </sentence><sentence id="1591">Because the -- I believe the Vatican was at least as well informed as we were. </sentence><sentence id="1592">They had hundreds of priests who came -- traveled through Europe and came to Rome and informed the Vatican authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1593">A man, historian, former priest himself, Franconi, Carlo Franconi -- writes about the hundreds of reports

where you see that a number of Nuncios had very clearly reported about what is happening to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1599">There was a special man who was active, I believe, for the Order of Malta, who was pursuing in Poland some welfare activities, humanitarian activities, who writes a number of times reports already in May, and another in October, "42, where he -- one of the reports he says something like "There are two new things. </sentence><sentence id="1600">On the one hand, the bombardment of the cities, and the other is the intensification of the extermination of the Jews. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1601">More than two million have already been killed." </sentence><sentence id="1602">I mean, this information was there. </sentence><sentence id="1603">Why the Vatican ignores it and doesn't tell it, 1 don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1604">And the Red Cross didn't give any -- any concrete answer, either, International Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="1605">Now, we will come back to the attitude of the Red Cross at a later point, where I will say what I have to say about the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="1606">Now, I see that one doesn't believe -- but doesn't believe, and there is now on -- two activities on parallel. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1607">The one activity is my own. </sentence><sentence id="1608">I try by all of the possible means to find corroborating evidence from other sources. </sentence><sentence id="1609">And the other is the activity especially of our British section, which was very active, was a wonderful group, of Lady Reading, of Silverman, of Baru(ph), of Alex Easterman, of -- a marvelous leadership group which was acting in a very fine, coordinated way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1610">And they approach all the governments in exile, the British governments, and try to work on them. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And an interesting story there is that one of their best friends was President Benes of Czechoslovakia, considered it a German provocation and didn't believe in it. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And on the other hand, the only one who believed it, accepted it as fact, was Ivan Maisky, the Russian mbassador, who probably had known by his own experience that the extermination of peoples is possible, even by so-called civilized countries. </sentence><sentence

suggested in one of my letters to Nahum Goldman -- there is an attempt to obtain a collective statement of the Allied governments on the extermination of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And this text is finally -- this is the real, immediate result of my telegram, is the declaration of the -- all the Allied governments -- which is of the 17th of December, 1942, where all the Allied governments and the French National Committee -- was not yet a government -- had solemnly denounced the extermination of the Jewish people, saying that this has been many times announced, threatened with, and now it is happening, and hundreds of thousands of people have already been killed, and they threatened with the retaliation -- with the punishment of those who are responsible. </sentence><sentence id="1619">This is a great moment. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Now the story is out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1621">And it is published all over. </sentence><sentence id="1622">And even in the very careful, neutral Switzerland, it makes the first pages in the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="1623">And one hopes now something will happen that something should happen. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And now starts a discussion between the two major Allied governments which goes on for six weeks, and nothing is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1625">You can read the pathetic appeal from the Archbishop of Canterbury in the House of Lords and this, where he accuses the governments of complete inactivity and of being responsible for their not undertaking any action. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Even if you cannot do anything, you have to try at least. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And finally, after two months practically, it is decided there will be a conference between the British and the Americans, and they decide to hold this conference in the Bermudas, in the Atlantic. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1628">Q. Let me stop you there for a minute and back up for two things. </sentence><sentence id="1629">One, the information that Washington and London were trying to get confirmed, in spite of the fact that the Vatican did not supply much information, the Americans did ultimately get additional information, including </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1630"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1631">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1632"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1633"> 3 indirectly some information from Carl Burckhardt, and I wonder if you could talk about how that... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1634">A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1635">I will come to this now. </sentence><sentence id="1636">I have skipped one thing, and that the meeting with the American minister in October 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Let me first say, when I saw that nothing was happening and that everybody was skeptical about the reports -- and this you feel, and you see that nothing is happening I was never in my life as desperate as during these weeks, when you know that the world is burning and nothing is happening, and on the contrary, I am sitting in Geneva on this beautiful lake with my view on the Mont Blanc, and the blue sky, and you know -- Q. Which you could see from your office? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1638">A. Hmm? </sentence><sentence id="1639">I saw this from my office. </sentence><sentence id="1640">I was having an office with a beautiful view, and already three, four kilometers around are the Germans and the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="1641">And the whole world is in flames, and you see this beauty of the lake and the mountains and the sky, and it's a provocation to your existence. </sentence><sentence id="1642">And I am waiting and waiting to any reaction positive, and nothing comes. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1643">So I am trying to -- to get information, other information. </sentence><sentence id="1644">But on this I must say I was quite successful. </sentence><sentence id="1645">There were four major confirmations which I obtained, direct or indirect. </sentence><sentence id="1646">The first were some letters which were addressed to the Jewish relief organization of the Aguda in Switzerland, addressed by a man who lived outside the ghetto in Warsaw, and which was sent to Lucerne, informing them in a certain coded language, with Hebrew words and other words, of the beginning of the deportation of the Jews of Warsaw, which started -- and this we know -- on the 25th of July, the day when Czerniakow, the Judenaelteste, committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1647">And every day </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1648"> This is a

Umschlagplatz to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And they write in two letters in this kind of coded language that the people are being taken day by day to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And the words are clear -- it is gayROOSH. </sentence><sentence id="1654">It is complete extermination and killing, and so there is for the first time a confirmation even from Poland that this extermination is happening there. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Number two, at the beginning of September, I believe, comes to Switzerland a young man who saw the extermination of the total Jewish population of Riga in November and December 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1656">That means nine months or ten months before. </sentence><sentence id="1657">A young man, a student of medicine, who escaped from Riga, worked for several months in a hospital as a non-Jew, and a hospital in Stettin, and finally succeeds to get a visa for Switzerland where he has some relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1658">And when he arrives in Geneva, I am informed, and I have a meeting with him, and I question him for six or eight hours about what he knew, and he gives a very detailed report of how in two nights the Nazis -- ?, </sentence><sentence id="1659">was military -- killed by machine guns -- I think thirty-six thousand or something Jews in two nights, among whom the very famous Jewish historian, Simon Dubnow, who was, by the way, very near the ideals of the World Jewish Congress and whom we revered very much. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1660">Nobody knew about this. </sentence><sentence id="1661">For nine months the world was completely silent, that you can't kill such -- do such exterminations without anybody knowing. </sentence><sentence id="1662">It showed that -- what was going on was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1663">The third was even more intriguing. </sentence><sentence id="1664">One day I get a telephone call from a doctor in the Jewish -- in the hospital, a Jewish doctor in the hospital of Geneva, very fine lady, good friend of mine, said, "Come here. </sentence><sentence id="1665">I have to show you something very interesting," and it's worth my coming. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And I go to the hospital, and she receives me -- she's dead also now -- and says, "I have here a very strange patient. </sentence><sentence id="1667">He is under police surveillance, and you are not allowed to see him, and you are not allowed to mention it, but I cannot begrudge. </sentence><sentence id="1668">You know much more the -- go and see him." </sentence><sentence id="1669">And I spent six hours in the hospital and take down what this fellow tells me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1670"> This is a

extraordinary events. </sentence><sentence id="1674">A young man who is taken in -- Antwerp or Brussels -- this I forgot -- in Belgium, in one of these mass arrests, and being sent to the camp in Malines, from where they are deported to the east. </sentence><sentence id="1675">And he gives me the exact description on what happened every day in the process of deportation, from Malines in Belgium to Krakow, Katowice, up to Russia, where he finally ends up in -- near -- the front of Stalingrad, near Rava Ruskaya. </sentence><sentence id="1676">And then he describes every station, what happened, and so on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1677">Not only he tells me he was in -- put down, put to -- engaged in works for the fortification at the front. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And one day, an officer comes and asks somebody whether -- who could drive? </sentence><sentence id="1679">He needs a driver. </sentence><sentence id="1680">And as he is a mechanic, working in -- was a Polish Jew living in Belgium, working in some mechanic(al) establishment, he offers himself, and he is taken. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And he is -- ten days going with the German officer, accompanying him in his travels in the car. </sentence><sentence id="1682">And he uses this pportunity to ask the German officer, "What happened? </sentence><sentence id="1683">What happened there? </sentence><sentence id="1684">What happened here? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1685">Why?" </sentence><sentence id="1686">And the German officer, who is fed up with the war, lost already two of his brothers, tells him, "It's very simple. </sentence><sentence id="1687">Those who are up to work, they take them to work. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Those who are not up to work, they be exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="1689">Those who are not any more up to work, they have the same fate." </sentence><sentence id="1690">So easy it was. </sentence><sentence id="1691">In three sentences, the whole tragedy of the Jewish people was described by this German officer. </sentence><sentence id="1692">And the German officer, as I said, who was fed up with the war, decides to save this Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1693">In an unbelievable story, he hides him in a train full of uniforms of people who fell in the battles around Stalingrad, and hides him in this train and gives him food and gives him occupation mark, and said, "You remain in the train until it stops. </sentence><sentence id="1694">And then you can try to get out." </sentence><sentence id="1695">And he leaves -- I don't know -- four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="1696">He didn't know himself how long it was. </sentence><sentence id="1697">And finally this train stops. </sentence><sentence id="1698">Finally, didn't move any more. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And he gets out, and he is near the Gare de I'Est in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Now, you imagine from Stalingrad

Ruskaya, to -- to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And he -- he has some occupation marks. </sentence><sentence id="1706">He finds his way, he goes to the Plaetzl, finds Jewish advice, goes to the nonoccupied France and finds the way. </sentence><sentence id="1707">He comes over the mountains of Switzerland and is arrested by some of the soldiers, and as he is typical -- as for many people deported -- swollen feet and -- and bones and legs. </sentence><sentence id="1708">They bring him to the hospital to be treated. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And there he is. </sentence><sentence id="1710">Unbelievable that such things are possible. </sentence><sentence id="1711">But I questioned him. </sentence><sentence id="1712">You know, I was a kind of a judge once -- inquisition judge in the proceedings which I had in the tribunal in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1713">And I questioned him for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Very simple person, straightforward, and there was no doubt that what he said was the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And yet he gave the whole story. </sentence><sentence id="1716">From an eyewitness who had seen it. </sentence><sentence id="1717">And then comes the fourth, the most interesting in certain ways. </sentence><sentence id="1718">When we had the idea -- we had the report from Schulte. </sentence><sentence id="1719">I suggested to Gugenheim that we should ask the Red Cross whether they had any reports which confirmed. </sentence><sentence id="1720">And making it not too official, we decided that he should privately ask the vice president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Carl Burckhardt, who is a colleague of his in the institute which I spoke, the Institute de

and -- somewhere in the beginning of September. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And Burkhardt confirms to him that his reports are very similar, that he has confirmation from two German diplomats, the one from a member of the staff of the German foreign office, the other, a representative of the military establishment. </sentence><sentence id="1723">He says "Defense Department."
