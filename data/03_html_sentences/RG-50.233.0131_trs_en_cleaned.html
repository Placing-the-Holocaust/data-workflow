<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1030">A: I'll tell you, there are some people which they say, oh when I was in that time I was thinking [Il do this and I'll do that. </sentence><sentence id="1031">To me I cannot it didn't occur to me what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="1032">Back of my mind I believed that maybe, maybe something will happen we'll get free. </sentence><sentence id="1033">But to make plans, I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1034">We didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1035">We didn't know what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1042">Q: Had you heard any rumors about other camps, worse camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1044">A: We heard rumors that when they had to leave, they liquidate the camps with the people. </sentence><sentence id="1045">This we heard later on, the end of "44. </sentence><sentence id="1046">So, many times I heard like this, my wife asked what's that, I said it doesn't look so bad. </sentence><sentence id="1047">It made her feel comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="1048">There were twice, two moments, she asked me what's that? </sentence><sentence id="1049">In my wildest imagination I couldn't see anything good, so I said I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1050">She didn't ask me anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1051">At one time all of a sudden it was at night, they shut off the lights, we were in the factory, we were working the night shift. </sentence><sentence id="1052">It was sometime in deg44, the end of 44. </sentence><sentence id="1053">What's that? </sentence><sentence id="1054">I said, I don't know, I couldn't find anything, I couldn't find any excuse. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Naturally, we thought for the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And the second time, which it was the last moment before we were liberated, she said, we were driven out to the gates from the factory with the trains were outside and all of a sudden we were pushed back, the whole mess was like pushed back. </sentence><sentence id="1057">My wife asked me that time, what's that? </sentence><sentence id="1058">This was when it went through the minds, this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I said I don't know and she didn't ask anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1060">We held on for a couple of minutes, then we could spread. </sentence><sentence id="1061">It got over. </sentence><sentence id="1062">What it was, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Some people were taken out t the train a the time and the bulk of us remained. </sentence><sentence id="1064">There were three other camps in Chestochowa, ammunitions factory. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I worked ammunitions factory and the day before we were liberated, the day when we were liberated, to me it seems to be the 15" of January, "45. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Yeah, I have to go back to a little incident before that. </sentence><sentence id="1067">The end of "44 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I was a mechanic at the machine. </sentence><sentence id="1068">There was one Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of those machines. </sentence><sentence id="1069">We had there a German boss which it didn't bother him. </sentence><sentence id="1070">He said you don't bother me, I don't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1071">I did some tailoring for him I did some fixings for him sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1072">He was foolish, but it didn't bother him any, didn't do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Then they took him away and came in another one. </sentence><sentence id="1074">They used to call him the mischugana, the crazy . </sentence><sentence id="1075">He was crazy, foolish. </sentence><sentence id="1076">You couldn't talk to him anything, couldn't talk to him, there was no way. </sentence><sentence id="1077">So the boys said let's try to bribe him, maybe we could persuade him to be a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1078">So we did whatever we could to try to bribe him. </sentence><sentence id="1079">Whenever he used to pass by my wife when she worked at the machine, sometimes a shell we would find on the floor, or whatever it was he hit her. </sentence><sentence id="1080">He passed by, because he worked on the same shift and there was another one, he hit her too, but sometimes he gave her a piece of bread too. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And this one, whenever I passed by she was crying. </sentence><sentence id="1082">One time I passed by she said was it night? </sentence><sentence id="1083">She was crying, I said what's the matter she said I don't know, everything was going perfect. </sentence><sentence id="1084">He hit me with a screwdriver. </sentence><sentence id="1085">So I go over to that boy and I said, listen you're trying to bribe him, at least let him show some decency. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Well, he said the slogan was, if not today, it will be tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Which it meant if we won't be finished today, we going to be finished tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="1088">As weak as I was I said no, not enough. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I don't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="1090">And I find in between two machines, he was a short fellow, he wasn't taller than me and I went over to him and I yelled at him. </sentence><sentence id="1091">I said why did you hit my wife for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1092">If you going to hit my wife for nothing, hit me, I'll be able to take a beating, but don't hit her. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And he started beating me up. </sentence><sentence id="1094">While he was beating me up I was screaming to him the same thing, next time do the same thing, but don't hit my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1095">It's unbelievable because he didn't have to take me out to shoot, to kill, he could kill me on the place. </sentence><sentence id="1096">But apparently, he didn't do it and since then he didn't touch her again. </sentence><sentence id="1097">This was before Christmas time "44, about three, four weeks before. </sentence><sentence id="1098">Then the 15" of January in the morning, they didn't took us out from the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1099">We remained in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1100">Like normally, we used to go out to work. </sentence><sentence id="1101">A day before, the evening before, they took out about 700 people from the shift from the night before. </sentence><sentence id="1102">At that time it looked, it didn't look good. </sentence><sentence id="1103">At one time before, like I said I had my sister in Philadelphia, America, home I never used to write the letters to her. </sentence><sentence id="1104">But when the letters used to come she used to live at 633 North 5", Philadelphia, Pa., USA. </sentence><sentence id="1105">At one time it just him me, came into my mind the address. </sentence><sentence id="1106">I used to say it in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1107">I took the address, I wrote down on a piece of paper, just like this. </sentence><sentence id="1108">When it looked so bad, I said to my wife, you see, here I give you my sister's address. </sentence><sentence id="1109">If we'll survive there we're going to meet. </sentence><sentence id="1110">This happened the 15" of January, the 15". </sentence><sentence id="1111">So in the morning we didn't go out to work because they took out the night shift the night before. </sentence><sentence id="1112">Later on around 9 o'clock or so, 10 o'clock, we had to go out to the appel and stand up in the line and the bosses came around to take us to work. </sentence><sentence id="1113">We had one boss which he was fairly a decent man. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Unfortunately one time he took, he killed, shoot a woman. </sentence><sentence id="1115">Whether he was drunk, it was a little instigation from somebody else and he passed by our group and told us in German, naturally not, it should be noticeable that he is talking to us, to take with you clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1116">To take in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="1117">Like he knew something, something is going on. </sentence><sentence id="1118">So we went in the factory, our group, and while we were in the factory, I took the coat, whatever my wife had and mine, put in a room wherever we had to do for the machines, and I'm there for a minute or two minutes, a boy comes in and says, Moishe go out take a look where your wife is. </sentence><sentence id="1119">I went out I see her come in from outside. </sentence><sentence id="1120">The boss who had the shift before, so he want to keep his women, he want to keep, and send away the others. </sentence><sentence id="1121">So she went over to him, it was the 15" of January, it was cold, she said I want go take mine coat from my husband and I will be back. </sentence><sentence id="1122">He said go, but come right back. </sentence><sentence id="1123">So naturally I went over to that boss, he knew me, not the one who hit my wife before, but the other one, higher than him, and I told him my wife they're going to take out, do something. </sentence><sentence id="1124">He said I'm powerless, there's nothing I can do. </sentence><sentence id="1125">There was, the main engineer from the whole factory there, the ammunitions factory. </sentence><sentence id="1126">So the main engineer from the whole factory, in normal times, everybody was afraid for his look. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Terrible, terrible man. </sentence><sentence id="1128">At that moment he stood with a stick and he was hitting over the head everybody whoever came to him. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Why, it was plain and simple. </sentence><sentence id="1130">They were trying to take out the people and people were running back. </sentence><sentence id="1131">Nobody wants to go away. </sentence><sentence id="1132">Everybody wants to stay in the place and they were taking them out and they were running back. </sentence><sentence id="1133">So he was hitting everybody over the head, wherever he could. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And while he stood with his stick hitting everybody over the head, unbelievable as it may sound, how I did it, I don't know, but I did something. </sentence><sentence id="1135">I went over to him and I said, engineer, I'm here from the first moment when the place started, now they're going to send out my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1136">If they're going to send her out, I'm going to go with. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I scared him off. </sentence><sentence id="1138">So he said, where is the boss? </sentence><sentence id="1139">He called over the boss, not the one who hit her, but the other one who hit her from time to time, but he gave her a piece of bread too. </sentence><sentence id="1140">He said do you know her?. </sentence><sentence id="1141">He said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Is she a good worker, he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1143">He said remain here. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Another boy did the same thing for a girl and she also remained. </sentence><sentence id="1145">How I did it, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1146">But it was a rumor just imagination it was, supposedly you're supposed to say they should have left his father that the boy should remain here. </sentence><sentence id="1147">So somehow I did it and that's how we remained together. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Later on I gave her the address from my sister and said, because it looked like something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So I said if we'll survive, there is going to be a place where we met. </sentence><sentence id="1150">O.K. Then we are still in the factory, we were going to lunch to bring the pot with the lunch and that time I went to the kitchen to bring in the lunch for the group. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Then we got a lunch and I sat down on the floor near the machine, while I was sitting eating we heard some banging, to bang a big factory. </sentence><sentence id="1152">So I didn't pay too much attention after awhile another repeat, didn't pay attention yet, but then it didn't took long another few minutes we heard more banging. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So I said that time to my wife, because she was sitting with me near the machine, I said now I'll put away the food what I had, let's pay attention what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="1154">So after awhile we saw the Germans through the window, we could see that they start running. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Then one of the German bosses came in and he said to the other one, he said what's going on with you don't you see what's doing outside already? </sentence><sentence id="1156">Stop the work. </sentence><sentence id="1157">So they stopped the work and we were driven out to the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1158">There was a factory , a munitions factory, a bigger one than ours. </sentence><sentence id="1159">When the Russians came close to that they evacuated the factory and it took about six months till the Russians came in that time. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So they were told, the rumors were going on, the Germans said they were supposed to leave the factory with the people. </sentence><sentence id="1161">The factory should be able to go till the last minute, cause it was a bigger factory than ours. </sentence><sentence id="1162">This apparently what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1163">In our place, in our situation the factory was running until the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="1164">But still we were afraid that they" ll tear off the bounty (?) </sentence><sentence id="1165">place with the people. </sentence><sentence id="1166">This was the thought what it may happen. </sentence><sentence id="1167">This is what they did in some other places. </sentence><sentence id="1168">So we were in the barracks and around it starts to get dark already, one of the Germans came in with a sack of bread giving out bread. </sentence><sentence id="1169">So whoever could reach it got bread. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Then the commander from the camp start to go around and calling the people said to go with him. </sentence><sentence id="1171">He said I was for you like a father, come with me, the Russians are coming, come with me. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And unfortunately, a couple hundred people went up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1306">A: With him. </sentence><sentence id="1307">And we remained. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1308"> TAPE 2, SIDE 1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1309">A: Around 10 o0'clock, at first we were in the barracks, then we started to move out to go out from the barracks, after that incident at the gate, the push back was like I said before and so we start to spread and we were in the barracks, we were outside, because we heard the shooting and wondered what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Around 10 o'clock the fire engines, the fire people from the fire engine company they came around and told us now you are free, just watch out from upstairs from the planes. </sentence><sentence id="1311">It was only a wild dream to be able, I don't know whether I even identify, but subconsciously there was some kind of hope in the back of the conscience that maybe, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1312">This was the moment what we heard, now you are free just watch out from the top. </sentence><sentence id="1313">So I still had my can with my lunch and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1314">So some people did smart things. </sentence><sentence id="1315">They were going around in the German homes and did whatever they could do, take whatever they could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1323">Q: These homes were empty? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1325">A: The homes were empty, the Germans were out already, they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1326">All of a sudden they disappear. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Me and my wife, may he rest in peace, another friend just passed away in Israel, we kept ourselves together. </sentence><sentence id="1328">We walked and we walked into an apartment building, Polacks were there. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And at first they hesitated to let us stay there, but we insisted and we did not let ourselves be driven out. </sentence><sentence id="1330">Till the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Talking about the friend of mine I have to go back a little while to memorialize him, cause he just passed away and we were very good friends. </sentence><sentence id="1332">He too was a tailor and while we were in the camps in the same barracks we used to make caps by hand, little caps be able to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And my wife, if she could find a potato, she cooked something, so whenever she cooked something, whatever I ate, I fall asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1334">He used to say, go ahead, go to sleep I'll finish it. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And that's what we did, we lived very close together. </sentence><sentence id="1336">Next morning, the morning we went out in the street, because the other guy, he was from Chestochowa, so how do we start a life again, we didn't know because everything was unplanned. </sentence><sentence id="1337">We came into our house, we knocked to the door and I said in Polish, naturally we just came out and we need hot water. </sentence><sentence id="1338">They didn't let us in, they didn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="1339">I went to another door, knocked on the door and told them the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1340">See the difference between one person and another one, she said come in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
