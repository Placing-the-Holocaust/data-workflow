</sentence><sentence id="877">Yeah, I have to go back to a little incident before that. </sentence><sentence id="878">The end of "44 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I was a mechanic at the machine. </sentence><sentence id="879">There was one Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of those machines. </sentence><sentence id="880">We had there a German boss which it didn't bother him. </sentence><sentence id="881">He said you don't bother me, I don't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="882">I did some tailoring for him I did some fixings for him sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="883">He was foolish, but it didn't bother him any, didn't do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="884">Then they took him away and came in another one. </sentence><sentence id="885">They used to call him the mischugana, the crazy . </sentence><sentence id="886">He was crazy, foolish. </sentence><sentence id="887">You couldn't talk to him anything, couldn't talk to him, there was no way. </sentence><sentence id="888">So the boys said let's try to bribe him, maybe we could persuade him to be a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="889">So we did whatever we could to try to bribe him. </sentence><sentence id="890">Whenever he used to pass by my wife when she worked at the machine, sometimes a shell we would find on the floor, or whatever it was he hit her. </sentence><sentence id="891">He passed by, because he worked on the same shift and there was another one, he hit her too, but sometimes he gave her a piece of bread too. </sentence><sentence id="892">And this one, whenever I passed by she was crying. </sentence><sentence id="893">One time I passed by she said was it night? </sentence><sentence id="894">She was crying, I said what's the matter she said I don't know, everything was going perfect. </sentence><sentence id="895">He hit me with a screwdriver. </sentence><sentence id="896">So I go over to that boy and I said, listen you're trying to bribe him, at least let him show some decency. </sentence><sentence id="897">Well, he said the slogan was, if not today, it will be tomorrow. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="898">Which it meant if we won't be finished today, we going to be finished tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="899">As weak as I was I said no, not enough. </sentence><sentence id="900">I don't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="901">And I find in between two machines, he was a short fellow, he wasn't taller than me and I went over to him and I yelled at him. </sentence><sentence id="902">I said why did you hit my wife for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="903">If you going to hit my wife for nothing, hit me, I'll be able to take a beating, but don't hit her. </sentence><sentence id="904">And he started beating me up. </sentence><sentence id="905">While he was beating me up I was screaming to him the same thing, next time do the same thing, but don't hit my wife. </sentence><sentence id="906">It's unbelievable because he didn't have to take me out to shoot, to kill, he could kill me on the place. </sentence><sentence id="907">But apparently, he didn't do it and since then he didn't touch her again. </sentence><sentence id="908">This was before Christmas time "44, about three, four weeks before. </sentence><sentence id="909">Then the 15" of January in the morning, they didn't took us out from the
