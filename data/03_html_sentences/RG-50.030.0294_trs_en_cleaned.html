<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in Lublin, Poland on August 8, 1920, son of a middle class family. </sentence><sentence id="14">My birth parents were fairly well to do people, not rich though. </sentence><sentence id="15">My mother was a full-time mom. </sentence><sentence id="16">She used to sing in the path when she was young, but her career ended before I was born, I understand. </sentence><sentence id="17">My dad was a locksmith and son of | of 13 children, and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of taking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="18">Naturally, he had to go to work to support his family. </sentence><sentence id="19">That's why he didn't finish school yet. </sentence><sentence id="20">Eventually when he married my mom, he graduated from high school, became a locksmith to survive and to earn a living, and then slowly in coming years he felt a need for education, and going to night school, he became an architect. </sentence><sentence id="21">So I was raised in a middle class family. </sentence><sentence id="22">Very, very happy childhood. </sentence><sentence id="23">I had a sister, was one year older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="24">We lived in a big apartment house belonged to my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="25">The entire family, over 18, 19 people lived, there all my cousins so we see each other every day. </sentence><sentence id="26">Naturally, as you live with your cousins, one try to outdo the other win, scholastically, otherwise, and this was promoted by the parents, particularly our mothers. </sentence><sentence id="27">Now, I was playing violin since I was four and a half years old. </sentence><sentence id="28">I remember my first violin was bigger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="29">I couldn't hold the violin properly. </sentence><sentence id="30">I recall the tortured nights when they put cork between my fingers to stretch my ridge of my fingers to reach the octave on the violin. </sentence><sentence id="31">Naturally, this was not very promoting to my music career. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="32"> I never forgot the tortures, but my mother was thus in heaven when I start playing particularly, the concert, or so we had a quartet; my sister playing piano, my uncle, my youngest brother of my dad playing cello, my other cousin was playing viol </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: There was four people and I was playing violin. </sentence><sentence id="34">Of course, we were playing for friends of our parents. </sentence><sentence id="35">I would rather be outside playing tennis or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="36">But this was a ritual that for years was an understandable thing that we have to do and I liked it actually. </sentence><sentence id="37">But anyway, until I reach the age of 13 I would say, I had the idea that I  want to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="38">I don't want to, would like to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="39">I don't want to be a musician. </sentence><sentence id="40">I knew I was not Heifetz or Perlman, but my mother would never understand that, and when I told her I wanted to be a doctor, this was like stabbing her in the heart. </sentence><sentence id="41">There were days I refused to practice ... and ... and with time of rebellion, a quiet rebellion. </sentence><sentence id="42">But then I had to do it, so after a day or two I start practicing again. </sentence><sentence id="43">I was going to school of music. </sentence><sentence id="44">Eventually I graduate ... in academy of music, and I was full fledged violinist. </sentence><sentence id="45">In the meantime, my father was involved in expansion of a high school. </sentence><sentence id="46">This was a Catholic high school where the principal was a bishop. </sentence><sentence id="47">I recall seeing him on occasions, walking in his robe in hallways, accompanied by a rabbi with curls, side curls, you know, and this fur hat, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="48">To me it was rather odd looking type of a connection here. </sentence><sentence id="49">We lived in the outside of area where normally Jewish people lived, what they call Aryan are </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: It was modern edifice and there were no Jewish people around there. </sentence><sentence id="51">So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there, mostly Polish though. </sentence><sentence id="52">I did understand Yiddish but I could never speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="53">And one day, going back to the principal of the high school, my dad asked him kiddingly, you know what, my son reaching the age now that you have to enter high school. </sentence><sentence id="54">What you think of my son considered being a student in your high school? </sentence><sentence id="55">He said "no problem." </sentence><sentence id="56">As soon as he passes the pre-entrance exam, he accepted. </sentence><sentence id="57">There is no problem. </sentence><sentence id="58">But then my dad replied, but this is a Catholic school and we're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="59">So, ... the principal replied. </sentence><sentence id="60">We prefer a Jewish student in a Catholic high school. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="61"> Believe it or not, I started studying hard. </sentence><sentence id="62">I was a good student and I passed exam and the reality came through. </sentence><sentence id="63">I became the first Jewish student in the highly Catholic school, high school. </sentence><sentence id="64">Well, my days in high school were extremely happy. </sentence><sentence id="65">They were the best years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="66">I never felt I'm different. </sentence><sentence id="67">I didn't look different, but on the street, kids in the area knew who I was. </sentence><sentence id="68">They called me, you dirty Jew. </sentence><sentence id="69">You filthy Jew, for no reason. </sentence><sentence id="70">But my high school I was never approached like this. </sentence><sentence id="71">I was respected by my colleagues. </sentence><sentence id="72">I think they liked me. </sentence><sentence id="73">I was excellent student. </sentence><sentence id="74">I was even assigned by teachers of certain class like French, Latin, geography, history, to tutor my colleagues from the same class that didn't do so well, and all of them went through and passed the exams. </sentence><sentence id="75">So, I was very happy to hear that I was instrumental in helping my colleagues, and it developed a certain type of rapport with them, not because they are dependent on me, but it helped us to bind us together, I would say. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="76">And, I was very active in French club which I organized. </sentence><sentence id="77">I was very active in an art club which I organized, and then musical circle too, and then eventually I was nominated by the director of the musical department school to participate in our symphony orchestra in high school, to a point on one day we had a contest in our town of different symphony orchestras in different high schools and this took place in one big theaters in the city, and won the first prize and I was playing solo forget like today and I thought, my mother was very proud of me then. </sentence><sentence id="78">She seen certain things,  you know, that she hoped maybe I would fulfill a dream, and I was glad to give her this kind of satisfaction although, innerly I felt that's not the road of my future. </sentence><sentence id="79">I was just insisting I would do something else and occasionally we discussed this and my mom didn't want me to talk about it about it. </sentence><sentence id="80">And there were different days you respected your parents more and whatever they say, really this was the way it was supposed to be. </sentence><sentence id="81">Maybe I was the first one in our generation in those days, that made quiet rebellion against, quietly, yet in the beginning but persistently pursued further. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="82"> Anyway, my school days were really fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="83">Sundays was customarily thing that all boys high school all in uniforms would marching to church. </sentence><sentence id="84">I was in front with the band. </sentence><sentence id="85">I was playing saxophone and clarinet in the band. </sentence><sentence id="86">And then when we arrived in the church, 800 or so students, went up to the church and my road led to the choir, and I was playing violin with the choir. </sentence><sentence id="87">Naturally, I was quite acquainted with the rituals with the prayers for eight years I was in school there and I felt that I'm Catholic, except I was not baptized. </sentence><sentence id="88">I had Christmas tree at home next to Hanukkah. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="89">And I had a, had a kind of natural thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="90">No one making fun of this. </sentence><sentence id="91">But then here and there in the city when I went to the park or so, I seen Anti-Semitic remarks, and knowing who I was. </sentence><sentence id="92">One day I remember I was little. </sentence><sentence id="93">We went to the park, wintertime, and one of my dad's employees took a sled. </sentence><sentence id="94">I was on the sled. </sentence><sentence id="95">He was pulling me on the sled. </sentence><sentence id="96">He was a professional wrestler, huge man, muscular man young in his 20s or so. </sentence><sentence id="97">It was a scene, a scene I never forget. </sentence><sentence id="98">Students of the local university, Catholic university attacked an older Jew, religious person with his side curls on, attacked him with sticks at the end which were razor blades. </sentence><sentence id="99">They are cutting off his side curls, and by doing this they chopped off his ear. </sentence><sentence id="100">Blood was flowing and I never forgot. </sentence><sentence id="101">I was a young kid. </sentence><sentence id="102">But they seen us watching them from a distance. </sentence><sentence id="103">They ran toward us, tried to attack us. </sentence><sentence id="104">But my dad's employee was very fast, athletic and so on, he pulled that sled fast and they were falling, you know, in distance and couldn't reach us. </sentence><sentence id="105">But eventually, they blocked our path, you know, and they pinned us against the wall. </sentence><sentence id="106">He made a mincemeat out of them. </sentence><sentence id="107">He beat them so up, you know, that eventually police came in and arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="108">The fact that we were attacked meant nothing. </sentence><sentence id="109">I think he put to jail then. </sentence><sentence id="110">This was one episode I remember. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="111">But this never happened in my school though. </sentence><sentence id="112">In school, I was person, that I was not a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="113">I was respected by my teachers, professors, by the priests, you know, by everyone. </sentence><sentence id="114">That's why my memories going back now to those days are really great. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="115"> And, I didn't realize at that time eventually, very soon afterwards this connection with my high school and friends, colleagues, classmates, professors would help me survive. </sentence><sentence id="116">So this is about my childhood, very happy with a lovely apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: When was that incident with the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: This was probably in about "32, "34, 1933, "34, about five years or so before the war. </sentence><sentence id="119">This was not an isolated incident. </sentence><sentence id="120">There were more incidents like this from then on. </sentence><sentence id="121">There was more German propaganda after Hitler came to power in "33. </sentence><sentence id="122">Then you seen people very traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="123">In front of Jewish stores, Polish people standing with signs "do not buy from the Jews, they steal your money." </sentence><sentence id="124">And in spite of this, many people going to Jewish stores, and then they are leaving the stores they were someone taking their pictures and eventually, they were using those photographs, the photographs in those and placing the propaganda with the name of the people who frequent Jewish stores. </sentence><sentence id="125">And I seen all those things. </sentence><sentence id="126">I was already confused. </sentence><sentence id="127">Here I am in Catholic high school. </sentence><sentence id="128">I thought I was Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="129">And to me, being Jewish didn't mean nothing. </sentence><sentence id="130">We are not a religious family although my parents had a kosher home, for one reason. </sentence><sentence id="131">All the Jews had kosher home. </sentence><sentence id="132">They felt that the meat was cleaner, more hygienic. </sentence><sentence id="133">Meat was not bought from a peasant who slaughtered the cattle some place in a barn, didn't know how hygienic was done. </sentence><sentence id="134">So no one got sick from eating kosher meat or so, but that's the only reason. </sentence><sentence id="135">But otherwise, we are not religious. </sentence><sentence id="136">But to explain yet my parents attitude towards me as their son, and to build up my identity although, they were not religious I say. </sentence><sentence id="137">Once a year we going to the little Synagogue was actually somebody's like apartment, where the Jews were praying all day long. </sentence><sentence id="138">I remember that I was little boy then. </sentence><sentence id="139">I couldn't wait until the service was over. </sentence><sentence id="140">There was so stuffy. </sentence><sentence id="141">There was no air conditioning and I would rather to go out and play with the kids, but here I am, stuck with older people, you know, for a whole day until you are allowed to eat. </sentence><sentence id="142">You are not allowed to eat until sundown you know, so for a child, you know, this was ... but food was not a problem really, but those scenes you know, I remember until today. </sentence><sentence id="143">And then to reinforce my identity who I was my parents hire a teacher which they call a Rebbe. </sentence><sentence id="144">Rebbe is not a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="145">It is someone whose very well versed in the Hebrew teachings, you know, and the religious laws and so on. </sentence><sentence id="146">And he was coming, I don't recall, three or four times a week to my home, and I remember he was falling asleep while he was reading to me and when he was half asleep, I was changing the book, you know. </sentence><sentence id="147">I was turning over the pages, you know, so we would get faster, you know. </sentence><sentence id="148">And when he woke up, half the book was turned over without him realizing it even. </sentence><sentence id="149">But, I got the touch of it anyway, you know. </sentence><sentence id="150">Not that I learned anything from him. </sentence><sentence id="151">But there is somethings I learned some things, prayers, you know, and but until today I was not very comfortable being in a Synagogue because I didn't grow up in that kind of surroundings you know. </sentence><sentence id="152">But I knew who I was. </sentence><sentence id="153">Then since there was a Catholic schools and there was so many other Jewish students in different schools. </sentence><sentence id="154">None Catholic but state schools who didn't had no formal Jewish education. </sentence><sentence id="155">So once a week one of the professors of Jewish, of Jewish history was coming to our school Catholic school teaching us about Jewish history, talking about the exodus of the Jews from  Egypt and all the uprisings you know, the Jewish history and we, so more or less were not ignorant about those things and then were graded on the base of his report. </sentence><sentence id="156">But I was also graded on New Testament, which I attended, so I was graded on the New Testament and also the Old Testament and religious education, and I had two grades. </sentence><sentence id="157">And this was very happy solution to me until summer of "39, prior to September 1, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="158">Rumors of Hitler Army moving, probably to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="159">We invade Poland. </sentence><sentence id="160">We on vacation at time, summer vacation and of course, most of the Jews belittle the rumors. </sentence><sentence id="161">All Jews all rumor this and that, but as a precaution they decide to cut short vacation and come home. </sentence><sentence id="162">Sure enough, September 1, "39 war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="163">Polish Army didn't last too long, Within less than two weeks, or three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="164">The whole army fall apart. </sentence><sentence id="165">Our government left Poland, first to escape, and only one that stood up yet was Warsaw, was defending self for several weeks. </sentence><sentence id="166">And Germany have a hell of a time, the whole of Poland was invaded already and Warsaw was still fighting. </sentence><sentence id="167">In the meantime the Germans entered our hometown. </sentence><sentence id="168">First thing they did, all the Jews have to register. </sentence><sentence id="169">All the Jews have to give up their possessions. </sentence><sentence id="170">Their music instruments, piano, grand piano, furs, jewelry, libraries, whatever was of certain worth to them they had to give it up. </sentence><sentence id="171">And of course, means of communications, telephones and radio. </sentence><sentence id="172">Germans were afraid of the local population listening to the radio, to BBC maybe. </sentence><sentence id="173">So we're not allowed to have the radios, and one day I remember my dad came home bloodied up. </sentence><sentence id="174">He was beaten by the Pole and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="175">He was caught on the street. </sentence><sentence id="176">He was there to do some work you know, some labor work that day and they beat him up as a prepay and sent him home. </sentence><sentence id="177">When I seen this, I seen what was to come here. </sentence><sentence id="178">| recall we sitting together, the whole family at the table, discussing what should we do. </sentence><sentence id="179">It was too late to run. </sentence><sentence id="180">West we couldn't go, wanted us to know that Russia divided Poland with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="181">The Soviet Army actually came from the East going West and they stopped at the River Bug and the German Army stopped at the River Bug too and our town was slightly west of the River Bug so we were at the fortune to be under German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="182">Some of my colleagues, Jewish colleagues, decided to go eastward, to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="183">With the blessing of my family, I took a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="184">My parents provided some cigarettes for me, for this was the best means of bribery and money didn't mean nothing. </sentence><sentence id="185">So if you want to ... were caught by anyone, especially Soviet solders, by giving a carton of cigarettes you buy your way out. </sentence><sentence id="186">There was not documents except the old Polish documents, and took me about a week to reach destination far east in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="187">A little town named Rovno. </sentence><sentence id="188">Why do you go to Rovno?Rovno was a city where my uncle, the younger brother of my father lived, and I thought at least I find somebody a relative of course. </sentence><sentence id="189">I arrived there. </sentence><sentence id="190">My ultimate goal was to enter the school there and study medicine. </sentence><sentence id="191">But I was not accepted, maybe as much as good as I thought I will be. </sentence><sentence id="192">Mainly, because food was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="193">Staying in this small, cramped quarters, you know. </sentence><sentence id="194">He was married. </sentence><sentence id="195">Had one boy, baby boy, and I know it was very difficult for them. </sentence><sentence id="196"> So I try to spare them the problem and I decided to leave and go to Lvov, the Germans call Lemberg, which was a big city, about 250,000 people, site of university, formally under the jurisdiction of Austria, Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="197">Many intelligent people spoke German, and it was just a beautiful city and I was very fortunate to take my pre-entrance exam and be accepted in medical school. </sentence><sentence id="198">Now you have to understand, that I was a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="199">I had nothing with me. </sentence><sentence id="200">I had no money. </sentence><sentence id="201">I had no clothing except what I had with me and I was hungry most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="202">But I still felt ... Lalways promised my parents I would pursue my education and that kind of an obligation I felt I should fulfill, and for myself too. </sentence><sentence id="203">I always wanted to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="204">So I was smart enough to find my way through and I was employed by the school cafeteria. </sentence><sentence id="205">I cleaned the tables. </sentence><sentence id="206">I was getting three meals and then knowing the people, then slowly, I was fortunate enough to secure myself a bed and in a room for students, like a dormitory. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I was paired with another student, also a refugee from my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="208">We became good friends and I was doing well in school. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1217">A: I heard some voices only, noises, but not very loud, and then everything was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And the next morning gates were opening and closing and cars trucks moving out, and the whole regiment of the police left the compound and there was no one left behind, and I waited until night, following night, and I through the fence I find my way back to the city, to the ghetto area. </sentence><sentence id="1219">And I approach some of the Jewish people there and they let me sleep in one the rooms there, and that's next day I went out to the ghetto with the work battalion. </sentence><sentence id="1220">And I approached one the Polish people that I knew from before who could contact my father, which I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="1221">This was on one episode. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Then when I came back home and prior to liquidation of the ghetto few days before, I did try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1223">We did know that the ghetto was going to be liquidated completely and I tried to run away, and going under the barbed wire the Ukraine were shooting at me. </sentence><sentence id="1224">I was running like a wild beast and they wouldn't have caught me if not the police dog. </sentence><sentence id="1225">He grabbed, forgive my French, my buttock, ripped a piece of flesh out and my calf and subdue me. </sentence><sentence id="1226">I was bleeding all over. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Then I was caught by the Ukrainian guards and they brought me back to the ghetto and handed over to the Gestapo, and they start beating me up. </sentence><sentence id="1228">They were beating me, standing behind me with a -- we call it a peitsche.? </sentence><sentence id="1229">What it was is actually is a handle made out of leather, hard leather, at end of which like a whip. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Actually was a hard, metal ball with points on it. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Standing behind me he was hitting me from the front so it was injured, my face actually standing behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And Ihave a

brother under a barbed wire, and you know the story then that we were hiding in the bishop palace, which I mentioned before, then went to my father's friend who hid us in a warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Then Lucine went to Warsaw to secure some papers for us. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Then she come back. </sentence><sentence id="1238">We had the papers all together but no money. </sentence><sentence id="1239">Lucine remembered her parents left some jewelry and silver, a candelabra with a neighbor and a friend who lived in the same house. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So we went to her and Lucine approached her. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Would you mind at least give us one candelabra so we can sell it, maybe find a way to Warsaw so -- and if we don't survive, whatever else my family gave you is yours. </sentence><sentence id="1242">She said, well, but, you know, I don't have it in my home everything. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Is hidden in the

for you. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I will wrap it so people won't know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Come back tomorrow at two o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1247">Having a suspicious mind, and you felt a certain extra instinct, like a hunted animal, I just felt maybe the whole thing sounded fishy. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Instead of coming two o'clock, we approached the area about noon time, 12:30. </sentence><sentence id="1249">Now, $peitche: whip. </sentence><sentence id="1250"> 7 we're locating ourself across the street from the main entrance to the building that the lady lived, and this area was bombed out, lot of ruins, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1251">You could hide very easily there, and behind us was a little street and a small apartment like a street apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Actually, that my colleague from high school lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1253">His father was a shoemaker. </sentence><sentence id="1254">I was tempted to go there, now stay there maybe and watch the house, but then I didn't want to expose them to this kind of danger either. </sentence><sentence id="1255">So I decided to wait on the street behind the ruin, and sure enough about one o'clock we see two police cars pulling over to the curb of the house and two or four Gestapo people got out of the cars and rushed up stairs. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Within about 15, 20 minutes they came out and they split. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Two people went one way, the other two people went the other way, looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="1258">I assume they meant us. </sentence><sentence id="1259">We didn't wait too long there. </sentence><sentence id="1260">We knew she had denounced us to the Gestapo because of a silver candelabra. </sentence><sentence id="1261">And I just remember now talking about Judas sold Jesus and the situation was so analogous to it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1262">But anyway, we didn't know what to do so we run into my friend's house. </sentence><sentence id="1263">The parents recognized me right away, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="1264">I told them what happened very briefly and shortly. </sentence><sentence id="1265">Gestapo looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="1266">What going to do? </sentence><sentence id="1267">And she very, old lady, you take your coat off. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Here, take your shoe off and start putting nails in your shoe, in my heel. </sentence><sentence id="1269">She gave a apron to my wife and she was cooking something on the iron stove. </sentence><sentence id="1270">Said, you pretend you cooking dinner right now and your little brother, put him to bed. </sentence><sentence id="1271">He's asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Now we'll cover him up with blankets. </sentence><sentence id="1273">There was a curtain separating a one room apartment, a curtain separating the one bed area from the work place and the kitchen, and this old lady took a blanket outside, start dusting the blanket, calmly, quietly. </sentence><sentence id="1274">All of a sudden, two people approach her. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Did you see Jews here? </sentence><sentence id="1276">So she pretended. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Jews here? </sentence><sentence id="1278">There no Jews here. </sentence><sentence id="1279">They all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1280">There not nobody here. </sentence><sentence id="1281">Whose house is that? </sentence><sentence id="1282">My house. </sentence><sentence id="1283">My father's working here. </sentence><sentence id="1284">My husband's client is here and my daughter is there. </sentence><sentence id="1285">She cooking right now, dinner, and they walked inside to see. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Didn't ask for the paper, although we did have documents, false. </sentence><sentence id="1287">They looked like they didn't believe they would be fresh enough to be so blatantly, you know, or stupid or to stay right near the scene of a crime. </sentence><sentence id="1288">And they left the house and start looking for us again. </sentence><sentence id="1289">Of course, we didn't wait too much longer. </sentence><sentence id="1290">We took off. </sentence><sentence id="1291">That's when we went back to the warehouse the same night we took that horse and buggy type of thing to the near railroad station near Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="1292">Well, going back to the ghetto area. </sentence><sentence id="1293">So, we lived in one little room and from there I had to go on to work detail. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Each morning a group of maybe 40, 50 people gathered in the ghetto area with a leader. </sentence><sentence id="1295">The leader was a friend of my father, and with him we're going to the railroad station over there. </sentence><sentence id="1296">We're unloading cars. </sentence><sentence id="1297">They didn't beat us there but didn't pay us either. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Didn't feed us either. </sentence><sentence id="1299">The only pay off was I could  8 take as much coal as I could carry on my back as my payment for days work. </sentence><sentence id="1300">So I of course, I put as much coal as I could. </sentence><sentence id="1301">I was bent over on all fours practically, carrying the big sack of coal back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1302">It was cold but we couldn't afford to heat our apartment because this was all our food depend on the coal. </sentence><sentence id="1303">I was carrying to the third story with some the richer, older Jews you know. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We were buying the coal. </sentence><sentence id="1305">With the money we collected for the coal we could buy some food. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We lived on carrots, cabbage, turnip from which, of course, we got diarrheas. </sentence><sentence id="1307">We were sick, stomachaches. </sentence><sentence id="1308">There was no bread. </sentence><sentence id="1309">We couldn't afford any bread. </sentence><sentence id="1310">There was nothing, nothing cooked. </sentence><sentence id="1311">There was nothing to cook. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And on one of my trips I notice a familiar face in a uniform of a Polish railroad man and I thought, I know this face. </sentence><sentence id="1313">And as I said before, you develop a certain instinct. </sentence><sentence id="1314">You just aware of your surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Who is around there. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Who, is he a friend or an enemy? </sentence><sentence id="1317">And finally I approach him. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I start working the area he was standing. </sentence><sentence id="1319">I said do I know you? </sentence><sentence id="1320">Aren't you from Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="1321">He looks at me. </sentence><sentence id="1322">He said, who are you? </sentence><sentence id="1323">I said my name, it is Horn from Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="1324">He said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1325">Don't show any emotion. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I know you, yes, I am so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1327">His name was Lowloc Rice (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1328">I said, I know, I thought that was you. </sentence><sentence id="1329">He said, pretend we don't know each other, and let's not talk to long. </sentence><sentence id="1330">What are you doing here?I said I wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1331">What can I do to get out? </sentence><sentence id="1332">So he said, why don't you come tomorrow again same time and we talk in details. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I can't talk to you now right now. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I couldn't wait. </sentence><sentence id="1335">I came back to the ghetto with my sack of coal. </sentence><sentence id="1336">Next day early in the morning went back to work in the detail group and sure enough he was there. </sentence><sentence id="1337">And he said, I can get you out of the ghetto but it cost a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="1338">I said, I don't have no money but, you know what before I left the ghetto in Lublin, my father show me a spot in his shop that he buried a case. </sentence><sentence id="1339">It's a steel case with jewelry, gold, watches, bracelets, my family's jewelry, and one of our friends who was a jeweler. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Whoever survivor the war, if ever then you can live the rest of your life on it. </sentence><sentence id="1341">| remember that spot. </sentence><sentence id="1342">That's the only thing I know. </sentence><sentence id="1343">I hope it's still there, but I cannot give guarantees. </sentence><sentence id="1344">But I know this spot. </sentence><sentence id="1345">If you were willing to talk to your people and they are willing to take a chance, whatever we will find, half is theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1346">I need only a little bit to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1347">You can take more than half. </sentence><sentence id="1348">I will leave it up to you, how much you want. </sentence><sentence id="1349">How much you leave to us. </sentence><sentence id="1350">He said, let me talk to my people. </sentence><sentence id="1351">I said, who are your people? </sentence><sentence id="1352">Well, I can tell you that that's Polish Underground, Armia Krajowa, or Home Army. </sentence><sentence id="1353">They need money to buy ammunition, arms, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1354">I don't know if they will go for this kind of deal because it is complicated, but if they will, I'll let you know. </sentence><sentence id="1355">I will be here in a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="1356">But I don't know what day, but I'll find you. </sentence><sentence id="1357">So I was coming to work every day with the hope, my dreams kind of encouraged, maybe he'll find him. </sentence><sentence id="1358">Maybe is something work out. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Otherwise, I see the doom. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Sure enough, one day he's there, again same spot in the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1361">He said, I talk to my people. </sentence><sentence id="1362">They went for it, and on such and such a day you lead off. </sentence><sentence id="1363">Your leader of your group is part of us. </sentence><sentence id="1364">He part of us, our group too. </sentence><sentence id="1365">He knows all about it. </sentence><sentence id="1366">So you will be snatched too. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Make sure your wife goes to work  9 too and her little brother too. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Children were going to work too. </sentence><sentence id="1369">No one question anything. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And sure enough, at that given early in the morning by carrying a sack of coal to the side, we're snatched by a group of people from the Polish Underground waiting with a car, and then a streetcar. </sentence><sentence id="1371">We change streetcars to different streetcar and people were changing to our guards. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Our guards were changing. </sentence><sentence id="1373">They all armed in case they caught us there would be a fight. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And we arrived to a house, to an apartment house which one of the -- not headquarters but one the apartments were the Polish Home Army was meeting was meeting there. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1398">For some reason they felt they should continue their orthodoxy, their sacred needs. </sentence><sentence id="1399">They want kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="1400">You know, where you going to get kosher food there? </sentence><sentence id="1401">One of the men died, older man died, but he was very religious. </sentence><sentence id="1402">What the Home Army did, they put him in a an orthodox kind of a canvas sack. </sentence><sentence id="1403">That's how the Jews are buried you know. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Not in the coffins, and they threw him over the wall in the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1405">They didn't bury him there and but left him there in the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And I think this was more than anybody could expect. </sentence><sentence id="1407">But this was just one the examples what those people did for us. </sentence><sentence id="1408">And, they described the whole plan what we're going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1409">First thing, I got the papers as a railroad man and they give me a uniform with a cap, a jacket, slacks, you know, the typical railroad uniform, with documents employed by railroads in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And he said, you going to go with a group of few people. </sentence><sentence id="1411">One is a Volkes Deutch and I don't follow, Volkes Deutch is a German who lived in Poland for generations, but he still did not lose his German identity. </sentence><sentence id="1412">He could be Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="1413">And this was, one was by your German. </sentence><sentence id="1414">He was just an excuse to get all the country German Army. </sentence><sentence id="1415">He knew where they are and he had a special privileges as a German citizen really, and he pretend to be always humiliated by the Poles and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1416">So it's special right and privileges. </sentence><sentence id="1417">He was our protector on the trip on the rail to Lublin with guarded by two Polish Underground people, armed all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1418">We arrived at the scene and sure enough, the location used to be a shack was a street now. </sentence><sentence id="1419">The shack was raised. </sentence><sentence id="1420">To explain a little  0 bit yet more about the situation, Lublin was at site where the Jewish POWs from the Polish, from the former Polish Army where stationed there, and they were doing the dirty work for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1421">They were digging in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1422">They are leveling the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1423">They were removing the door-frames, the window-frames, the door, the hinges, where the Jews were hiding gold and coins, and jewelry, diamonds, everything they could. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And they were taking everything apart piece by piece, and they leveled that hut, the little shack. </sentence><sentence id="1425">There was nothing ... but I seen the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1426">I knew the spot right way. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And I said, I'm going to stand up on that spot. </sentence><sentence id="1428">That's where it is. </sentence><sentence id="1429">But he said, that's a street now. </sentence><sentence id="1430">He said, well, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1431">We'll come back tomorrow and we left. </sentence><sentence id="1432">He took me to one of the people home. </sentence><sentence id="1433">I stay overnight. </sentence><sentence id="1434">They fed me. </sentence><sentence id="1435">They treated me nicely, and next day they took me back to same location. </sentence><sentence id="1436">What do I see?The whole street is blocked off, detour. </sentence><sentence id="1437">The signs of detour. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Broad daylight. </sentence><sentence id="1439">A tent is erected middle of the street and the a sign, and A big roll of cable standing next to the tent, the German Post Office and telegraph. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And people, helmets and overcoats are digging in the middle of the street right where this thing is, the understand was when they find the case that I described. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They lit a torch and this was a sign that they found it. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Now, I was hiding across the street and behind a door there was a little window there. </sentence><sentence id="1443">There were people passing. </sentence><sentence id="1444">It was a big apartment house and I was standing there, and looking through a little window there and watching if they lit the torch. </sentence><sentence id="1445">When this was torch be lit, this was a sign for me to get out and mean they got the case and they won't need me no more. </sentence><sentence id="1446">They will take me away and we'll go back home and, I am of course, I'm standing there, very nervous, very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1447">Don't forget, this my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1448">I could run into somebody I knew, somebody knew me, and this would be the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="1449">But I was guarded people with arms, you know, so I knew it wouldn't be easy for anybody, so they told me not to worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="1450">If this happen that Poles recognize me they will fix him right away. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Germans don't enter this area anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1452">They were not concerned at all, but I was nervous and maybe took about two, two and a half hours, I see them stopping working and one of them reaching down and then straightening out and taking a torch and lighting a torch. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And I was sweating and I thought that was a sign. </sentence><sentence id="1454">I was coming out right into the middle of the street and here is the case opened up, completely empty, open up empty. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I don't know what to say, but at least I knew this was true. </sentence><sentence id="1456">They knew that I didn't lie to them. </sentence><sentence id="1457">But where's the gold? </sentence><sentence id="1458">Where's all the goodies? </sentence><sentence id="1459">We found out later on that the Jewish POWs were digging everywhere and they opened this thing and left the empty case there and closed it up. </sentence><sentence id="1460">They didn't report to the Germans cause the same day, understand, people are selling watches in the camps of the POWs. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Watches and gold they were selling everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1462">Well, this was the end of our trip and I knew we were going back to the ghetto because they did not receive what they are supposed to get. </sentence><sentence id="1463">On the way back home on the train we talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1464">We had one compartment. </sentence><sentence id="1465">There was no other people there and I said, well, obviously we cannot afford to be out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1466">We cannot pay you people. </sentence><sentence id="1467">I want you to understanding that I didn't lie  1 to you about it. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Yes, we know that. </sentence><sentence id="1469">You going to send me back to the ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="1470">He said no. </sentence><sentence id="1471">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1472">What would you do in the ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="1473">You would perish in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1474">Maybe you can help us here on this side. </sentence><sentence id="1475">You can work for your upkeep. </sentence><sentence id="1476">We'll discuss the detail and come home. </sentence><sentence id="1477">So we turn back to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And you know the rest of the story. </sentence><sentence id="1479">That important fact I omitted that we got married in Warsaw Ghetto and my wife, with the help of the Polish Underground got us a little apartment, one little room. </sentence><sentence id="1480">I was hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="1481">I did go to a hiding place in the washroom, boarding up the walls of the washroom and creating a hiding door. </sentence><sentence id="1482">When you lifted the boards of the wall was a secret door that you open up, and behind the door was a little hiding place accommodating maybe eight or nine people. </sentence><sentence id="1483">I built a little bed so we could lie there and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1484">Now this part of the building was totally destroyed during the bombing of Warsaw, so there was a way we could have run away from this hiding place any case of a danger, if someone entered the front of the apartment, with a signal which was dissident in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1485">In case any danger, Lucine would knock on the door twice, and we would know to run. </sentence><sentence id="1486">We did have an emergency address where to go, another hiding place through the Home Army, hiding Jews in case of different location. </sentence><sentence id="1487">In case of emergency we could find a spot there until situation would clear up. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And sure enough one day the janitor became suspicious because Lucine was bringing too much food in her little basket and he thought two women living in that apartment, and she bringing food galore, and he notified the Polish police. </sentence><sentence id="1489">One day when she came in from work -- and what kind of work she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1490">She was selling women's nets on the market, flea market and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Nobody knew she was Jewish, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1492">She had good looks as an Aryan person. </sentence><sentence id="1493">She seen policeman at the door. </sentence><sentence id="1494">She didn't want to go in so she went to a store in the same building, grocery store. </sentence><sentence id="1495">First thing she did was took the key out of her purse. </sentence><sentence id="1496">She drop the key in a sack of beans and while doing this the policeman entered the store and arrested her. </sentence><sentence id="1497">They when through her purse and ask her where her key. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Oh, I guess I lost it. </sentence><sentence id="1499">They look on the street everywhere, they couldn't find it. </sentence><sentence id="1500">Which is your apartment? </sentence><sentence id="1501">What do you want?What do you want? </sentence><sentence id="1502">We understand you are hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1503">You are accused by the janitor that you bring too much food for two people there. </sentence><sentence id="1504">We want to see your apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1505">This conversation was very loud going on while they entering the apartment on the third floor, and on stairway we could hear the steps of the boots and the noise and the argumentation. </sentence><sentence id="1506">And then my wife said, there is nobody there unless my aunt is. </sentence><sentence id="1507">She working too. </sentence><sentence id="1508">She is not home yet but let me knock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="1509">She knocked twice which was danger signal. </sentence><sentence id="1510">And we also had some rabbits in the apartment, just in case some neighbors hear some footsteps, we can always say the rabbits walking around. </sentence><sentence id="1511">And they could hear some noise in there. </sentence><sentence id="1512">Is there somebody in there? </sentence><sentence id="1513">Well, maybe the rabbits. </sentence><sentence id="1514">So they broke down the door. </sentence><sentence id="1515">They look over. </sentence><sentence id="1516">They went to the washroom. </sentence><sentence id="1517">They did not discover our hiding place at all, although we are not there no more. </sentence><sentence id="1518">They seen the rabbits and said, what are you talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And they left, but they took per purse with her, took her documents with them and she stayed without any papers which was like a death sentence. </sentence><sentence id="1520"> 2 She discussed this thing with our friends from the Polish Home Army, and they suggested that one of them would go with her to get a copy of it. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And she went to the office. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Behind was a gentlemen armed just in case. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Without any difficulty she got a copy of ID and she left, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1524">During one of the trips on the streetcar they stole her purse again. </sentence><sentence id="1525">She lost the documents again. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Same history repeat itself. </sentence><sentence id="1527">She went back there and got ID, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1528">I had to occasionally had to run from place to place and I did need ID too, so the Home Army organized arranged for me to go with them to the main office there with my real birth certificate of a person that passed away, young man was two years younger than I really was. </sentence><sentence id="1529">His name was Wojick (ph), Felix Wojick. </sentence><sentence id="1530">So I assumed his identity. </sentence><sentence id="1531">So this birth certificate, I entered the main office and I received a ID without any difficulty whatsoever, with two guards behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1532">No one suspected anything and now I was equipped with real documents, and they could check it I was registered everywhere and I was not a Jew anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1533">But I had more Semitic looks than Lucine and with a man you know, it was not difficult to suspect something, stop him, put him aside, and take his pants down and know who we are. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Because only Jewish man was circumcised and this was the danger spot, but I tried to avoid situation like this. </sentence><sentence id="1535">So Lucine was working for the Polish Underground actually, indirectly, and all the hiding Jews were doing the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1536">They were taught how to make woman's hair nets. </sentence><sentence id="1537">It was a fashionable thing at that time to do. </sentence><sentence id="1538">They were taking the car inner-tubes or truck inner-tubes and cutting into small strips, very narrow strips. </sentence><sentence id="1539">Then they could buy white silk and then they are dying the silk different colors. </sentence><sentence id="1540">Was it a gold, gray, brown or black or navy blue. </sentence><sentence id="1541">So making any net color you desire with the orders they receive. </sentence><sentence id="1542">So I was taught by the group how to wrap this little string of rubber with a silk. </sentence><sentence id="1543">So I was making the elastic, actually. </sentence><sentence id="1544">The other group people were making the nets themself by hand of course. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And somebody design a little cardboard paper how to wrap it around and look very professionally. </sentence><sentence id="1546">And Lucine, as having good Aryan looks with another lady, also Jewish person, good looks. </sentence><sentence id="1547">They were spreading all over the city, market places and flea markets etcetera, and our life was more or less stable from then on except I was like a prisoner in my own house which I readily assumed and took. </sentence><sentence id="1548">I was taught how to do those things and finally our benefactor said, why do you start doing these too and do it on the side and Lucine can sell for you too. </sentence><sentence id="1549">So be it. </sentence><sentence id="1550">We did. </sentence><sentence id="1551">We started to accumulated a little money. </sentence><sentence id="1552">We felt a little more comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="1553">We were not that poor no more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1895">Q: Was Lucine's brother still living with you then or is this after. </sentence><sentence id="1896">What was it like hiding with him in that little cubicle? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1899">A: It was very pathetic. </sentence><sentence id="1900">He was little boy. </sentence><sentence id="1901">He was like a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1902">It was hard for him to understand why he was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1903">He knew he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1904">He knew he could not show  3 his face although he had good Aryan looks, but as a kid they could pull his pants down, they know who he is. </sentence><sentence id="1905">So was a sad thing to look at, him to be in hiding all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1906">He was pale. </sentence><sentence id="1907">He was deprived of the sunlight, sunshine. </sentence><sentence id="1908">He couldn't play. </sentence><sentence id="1909">I tried to be very near him, put arms around him. </sentence><sentence id="1910">He miss his parents. </sentence><sentence id="1911">He was at the age he understood. </sentence><sentence id="1912">He lost his parents and you couldn't replace it, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1913">There were times that he was questioning, asking if he ever going to see them again and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1914">He was still a child and on the other hand he was a grown-up, above his age. </sentence><sentence id="1915">The political situation just forced the people to grow up very fast. </sentence><sentence id="1916">So he was aware of what really the score is and on the other hand, he was only eight or nine years old you know. </sentence><sentence id="1917">I couldn't replace his father. </sentence><sentence id="1918">I was not old enough to act like a father, but I tried to do best I could. </sentence><sentence id="1919">I try to be the disciplinarian. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Sometimes he want to do certain things he want to do and so I say you cannot do it and I had to be firm. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And he tell, me you're not my father. </sentence><sentence id="1922">I said, I know. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I don't pretend to father. </sentence><sentence id="1924">But you cannot do it because all of us would be in danger, you including. </sentence><sentence id="1925">So it was a very tragic thing to see him going through all this thing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1926"> I did not mention that during one of those days that we were together, that we seen, when we run away from the apartment that the policemen arrested Lucine we went to emergency hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="1927">That's the time that Lucine run to one of her friends, who turned out to be the mistress one of the German Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="1928">She knew she was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1929">She said, what you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1930">She was afraid to tell anything, because we didn't know -- Lucine didn't know who she is now. </sentence><sentence id="1931">Is she pro Gestapo or is she going to tell everything where we are and then Gestapo come arrest us all. </sentence><sentence id="1932">But she finally told her, look, I am doing this because I am desperate myself to save my life you know. </sentence><sentence id="1933">But you know I remember your parents. </sentence><sentence id="1934">I can help you maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1935">So she, Lucine, told her the whole story that the problem now is we don't have apartment anymore. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1936">We stay only a few days. </sentence><sentence id="1937">We didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1938">Next we have brothers with us and she said, you know, what this was is this Hotel Polski, Polish hotel, that the Germans with a lot of money taking people and they go to southern France. </sentence><sentence id="1939">The letters arrive from those people who went on transport to southern France, writing back to their relatives in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1940">Right at the sea, sunning ourself. </sentence><sentence id="1941">Life is different. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1942">We waiting for visas to go to South America to North America, to the United States and I hope you can join us. </sentence><sentence id="1943">And Lucine seen those letters and they are truly letters, except that these people didn't realize this whole thing was a trick. </sentence><sentence id="1944">When we wanted to register they said, well, the next transport not going to a week later, but this time it was totally full but if you come up with like $5,000 actually, and we didn't have this kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="1945">So talking to her friend we said, we cannot afford this kind of thing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1946">We want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1947">She said but, you know what, your little brother can take with you for nothing, but you have to come up with money. </sentence><sentence id="1948">So we said we have no money. </sentence><sentence id="1949">So she promised to take her little boy with her, and on given day through, going through certain stages of hiding and before reaching that hotel because you went in there was only Jewish people going in and who was going out, only Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1950">You didn't  4 know if Gestapo waiting outside or not so it was a tricky thing to get in and get out of this hotel and one day we delivered the little boy to this young lady who was very nice, and took him under her protection on that trip to so called paradise, southern France. </sentence><sentence id="1951">We did receive one postcard from a train in Germany someplace that everything fine from him. </sentence><sentence id="1952">It was his writing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1953"> But did he really write what he meant? </sentence><sentence id="1954">Was he forced to write it? </sentence><sentence id="1955">We don't know, but this was the last thing we ever heard. </sentence><sentence id="1956">The final thing what we heard actually after of the war, that the whole train went to Northern Germany near Hannover someplace to a concentration camp and they were all eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="1957">So, the whole thing was a stage, a plot from the Germans who knew that some Jews were hiding and they paying for the safety to Polish people, but some running out of money so they had to sooner or later get out. </sentence><sentence id="1958">So they have some money left they could bribe their way by paying to go on transport to Southern France. </sentence><sentence id="1959">Unfortunately, we couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1960">We had no money, not that kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="1961">So we stayed without her little brother and we assumed the worst because we didn't hear nothing for months to come. </sentence><sentence id="1962">We suspected he probably perished, but for sure we didn't know at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1963">Life was going on and Lucine was selling her hair nets. </sentence><sentence id="1964">I making the hair net and off and on we lost our hiding place due to some suspicions that we had, maybe unfounded, but you couldn't take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1965">So we jumped from one place to another one, always in contact with other hiding Jews, and they had our name and addresses and we had theirs in case their apartment was suspected of being not in order they run to us. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And one day one of her schooling girlfriends notify Lucine that her apartment is no good and her husband is going to go to Polish Partisan, but he has to wait a few days and needs shelter. </sentence><sentence id="1967">So we took him to our house, our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1968">He slept to with us, one bed, all three of us. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And two days later he left us and went to Polish Underground. </sentence><sentence id="1970">I understand he perished there and his wife perished too. </sentence><sentence id="1971">So we one day we looking again for another apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1972">This was a constant situation every few months we looking for another apartment because people are not stupid and they suspect something and if unfounded even, they might suspect it and you can't take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1973">They might call the police or so. </sentence><sentence id="1974">One day she met a lady who was a nanny to one of her Jewish boyfriends when she was little yet, and she knew that the lady recognize her already. </sentence><sentence id="1975">And they hug and kiss and so and she was a widow. </sentence><sentence id="1976">They was peddling some ham, bacon, you know, from store to store. </sentence><sentence id="1977">She had one room apartment, little kitchenette, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1978">Lucine told her we're without apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1979">She said, why you don't come to me? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1980"> She said yea, but, you know who we are? </sentence><sentence id="1981">Oh, yes, I know who you are. </sentence><sentence id="1982">You know what we doing? </sentence><sentence id="1983">Oh yes I know what your doing but, I have to be paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="1984">We have little money. </sentence><sentence id="1985">What will this cost us? </sentence><sentence id="1986">Normally reasonable cost us about 50 to 100 Zlotys per month, and I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1987">I think we paid her 5 or 600 Zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1988">I'm not  5 sure exactly the amount. </sentence><sentence id="1989">That's what she requested. </sentence><sentence id="1990">She was very happy to get that kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="1991">She was struggling economically. </sentence><sentence id="1992">So we moved in. </sentence><sentence id="1993">Move in, we didn't have nothing to move in with. </sentence><sentence id="1994">A coat, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and I move my little factory with me. </sentence><sentence id="1995">I was making those little hair nets, producing. </sentence><sentence id="1996">Lucine was selling it. </sentence><sentence id="1997">Now, we have to think about safety. </sentence><sentence id="1998">I don't flush the toilet because both ladies, Lucine and this house-lady, were working so I couldn't walk around. </sentence><sentence id="1999">I couldn't flush the toilet. </sentence><sentence id="2000">I waiting until they came back home not to create suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="2001">Floors were wooden. </sentence><sentence id="2002">You afraid to put your weight down because the floors were squeaking. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2003">Be very, very, careful. </sentence><sentence id="2004">I used to walk on the board next to the wall where the floor was more solid and the planks wooden floor planks were not as flexible so without creating a noise. </sentence><sentence id="2005">Then this was in the corner of the room, there was a ceramic heater. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2006">I don't if you're familiar with European heating system. </sentence><sentence id="2007">It's made out of ceramic tiles, squares up to the ceiling almost, and connected to the chimney, and you were heating with coal there. </sentence><sentence id="2008">There was a little door, metal door you put your wood or coal this was. </sentence><sentence id="2009">Well, I decided to do to hollow out that stove. </sentence><sentence id="2010">I disassemble the whole stove. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2011">Lucine would bring me clay each day, a little bit in a bag, a little bag. </sentence><sentence id="2012">I use a fork and a knife to disassemble without cracking the tiles. </sentence><sentence id="2013">Don't forget this was old stove, and from the base on I rebuild the whole stove using clay and water. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And I remove the top, the surface, the ceramic tile and I made a wooden planking and put the tile on top of the wooden planking so I would get cover. </sentence><sentence id="2015">But you have to heat it so what are you going to do. </sentence><sentence id="2016">So we bought a little iron stove with a pipe. </sentence><sentence id="2017">The pipe was going right in the middle of the stove into the chimney. </sentence><sentence id="2018">There was a little stool and a table next to the stove in case of emergency. </sentence><sentence id="2019">I could step on the stool on the table inside the stove. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2020">I was sitting like on horseback on the pipe. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Only thing I forgot not being professional, what am I going to do if the pipe is going to be hot because the stove is being used for cooking? </sentence></p><p><sentence

not a professional bricklayer or stove layer, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2025">But it served purpose and I hope I would never have to use it. </sentence><sentence id="2026">All of a sudden one day we find out that the landlady had a cousin in the village near Warsaw, who one day came in drunk, total drunk, and when he knocked at the door, I had only maybe a minute time to get into the stove. </sentence><sentence id="2027">I got in the stove. </sentence><sentence id="2028">He came in. </sentence><sentence id="2029">They tried to get rid of him, he was so drunk they couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2030">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="2031">I stay here overnight. </sentence><sentence id="2032">I go home tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2033">So I stayed in the stove all night. </sentence><sentence id="2034">When he left following morning, I was totally unconscious, overcome by fumes. </sentence><sentence id="2035">They couldn't call a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2036">They couldn't pull me out because very awkward, was way up top to the ceiling. </sentence><sentence id="2037">They were two women, one old lady. </sentence><sentence id="2038">Lucine was young but alone she couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="2039">I was a heavyweight person and I started moving a little bit, but I was semiconscious and I got out of that stove and they try to breathe in my mouth, artificial respiration, springing water, splashing water on me, and so on, and I come to it and I recovered. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2040">This was my first experience in hiding place like this. </sentence><sentence id="2041">The other experience, I had,  6 another cousin, a woman came one day with a little poodle or a dog, small dog. </sentence><sentence id="2042">I had no time to get to the stove. </sentence><sentence id="2043">There was a cabinet against the wall so I hid in cabinet behind coats and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2044">All of a sudden, that little poodle start barking, coming toward the cabinet and barking and barking and barking. </sentence><sentence id="2045">Didn't want to leave, and this cousin of this house-lady said, what are you barking? </sentence><sentence id="2046">What do you see in that cabinet? </sentence><sentence id="2047">Oh, I probably have a little ham there. </sentence><sentence id="2048">I'm peddling ham, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2049">He probably want this. </sentence><sentence id="2050">So she brought a piece of ham to the dog, give him the ham and he ate it and stopped barking. </sentence><sentence id="2051">And there were few episodes like this where I was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2052">But each time I escape without any problems. </sentence><sentence id="2053">Until one day our benefactor from the Home Army came to me and said to me, be prepared because the Polish Underground is staging an uprising. </sentence><sentence id="2054">In the meantime, prior to this of course, we're located next to the former ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2055">We see the ghetto burning. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2056"> We see people dancing and is laughing outside the ghetto walls saying the Jewish bed bugs are frying. </sentence><sentence id="2057">Finally, we got rid of them and so on, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2058">I didn't hear it myself. </sentence><sentence id="2059">I just heard the noise. </sentence><sentence id="2060">I heard the explosions in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2061">This was the Jewish uprising and we didn't hear no cries. </sentence><sentence id="2062">Nothing, just explosions, shots, and then the fire and eventually of course, after almost what? </sentence><sentence id="2063">Less than a month, the whole ghetto uprising, went under and the Germans sealed up the area and there was no more ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2064">Then our captain came and said you better start storing some food because there is going to be uprising Warsaw proper. </sentence><sentence id="2065">We don't be able to get anything at all. </sentence><sentence id="2066">If you have any money left, any savings or so, buy something for it because the money will be worth nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2067">Prior to this, he came to us once and he took a loan from us. </sentence><sentence id="2068">He needed money to transport some Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2069">He had no money to save them. </sentence><sentence id="2070">So he was selling whatever he could, his own things to pay for the upkeep of those people. </sentence><sentence id="2071">We gave him the money. </sentence><sentence id="2072">He returned the money to us eventually. </sentence><sentence id="2073">So Lucine bought some rings that's all you could buy in the jeweler stores. </sentence><sentence id="2074">You couldn't buy nothing else but wedding rings. </sentence><sentence id="2075">We ended up with several, maybe 10 or 11 rings which we could not get rid of afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="2076">After the war they are worth practically nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2077">The uprising started. </sentence><sentence id="2078">Our Polish captain said, I want you to be part of our group. </sentence><sentence id="2079">We won't ask you to fight directly for us, it's not your fight. </sentence><sentence id="2080">I said, your fight is my fight. </sentence><sentence id="2081">You saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="2082">Whatever you want me to do, I will do. </sentence><sentence id="2083">We need somebody to attack the German warehouses to steal the provisions, food for our soldiers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2084">It's under fire. </sentence><sentence id="2085">And, I agreed to it immediately, and at night we're a group of five, six people from the Home Army ,Underground don't forget the basements were connected to each house next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="2086">They cut through the walls of each house so we did not have to be on the surface, which was deadly, but underground we moving the whole underground city. </sentence><sentence id="2087">We moving from one end of Warsaw to the other end underground. </sentence><sentence id="2088">And that's how we knew which was the exit where to go, where the warehouses were and when we grabbed the supplies, what we could of course, we didn't have no transportation. </sentence><sentence id="2089">All on our backs, you know, and pockets, pants, hands, you tied to your belt, whatever you could. </sentence><sentence id="2090"> 7 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2091"> We disappear in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2092">The German looking for us and couldn't find us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2093">We disappear. </sentence><sentence id="2094">Then that's how we brought the supplies for the fighting boys you know. </sentence><sentence id="2095">Then the Germans seen that the uprising is continuing and decided to do more drastic type of move and they decided to bomb the city. </sentence><sentence id="2096">In the meantime, the political situation change all bad. </sentence><sentence id="2097">We already knew that the Soviet troops on the other side of Wisla River, which the eastern part of Warsaw." </sentence><sentence id="2098">The name is Prague, like city of Prague in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="2099">People were hiding there that were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2100">We on the western part were not liberated yet. </sentence><sentence id="2101">Some Jews thought that in case they have to die now they try to swim through the Wisla River on the other side going east, and they caught by the German fire of course. </sentence><sentence id="2102">Some of them try to support themself with their hands under the bridge, holding on to different pipes and cables, only holding on with their hands cross the bridge underneath to reach the other side, and some of them succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="2103">Some of our friends did succeeded to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2104">It requires a tremendous physical strength to do that unless you accustomed to it. </sentence><sentence id="2105">And many people undernourished and weak and so on couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2106">Even swimming through the Wisla River in the part of Warsaw which was pretty wide and deep was suicidal, so we wouldn't dare. </sentence><sentence id="2107">So we took our fate the way it is. </sentence><sentence id="2108">So the German troops start to bombing the city and they done it systematically, street after street, so we knew which street bomb today, so we knew which street would be bombed tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2109">So running from one type of a block to another block, but the bombing caught up with us finally. </sentence><sentence id="2110">We are at our home, our home, our apartment that we stay with the Polish lady which I mentioned before selling ham and etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="2111">The bomb hit one of our wings and the whole stairway collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="2112">Lucine was upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="2113">She went right onto the main floor under the rubble. </sentence><sentence id="2114">I couldn't get to the other side to save her so I took a plank, a wide plank, maybe a foot wide. </sentence><sentence id="2115">It was a corner wing and so I put one end of the plank on the window frame, the other plank was four story and the other window, and all my fours I crossed from one wing to the other one, not looking down. </sentence><sentence id="2116">Because if I look down I probably get dizzy and go down, and I was able to reach her area and recover her by pulling her. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2117"> I see her legs sticking out and by pulling her, debris and bricks and cement and piece of wood and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2118">She sustained fairly intensive injury and her whole right side of the face, ear, neck, chest, breast, right side of abdomen, was scraped from falling debris and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Bleeding so on, I was wounded in the mean time. </sentence><sentence id="2120">I don't know what from. </sentence><sentence id="2121">It was a piece of shrapnel I thought. </sentence><sentence id="2122">My abdomen, I was bleeding a little bit but I felt good otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="2123">I put her on my back and carried her on my back to the first aid station. </sentence><sentence id="2124">There were signs in the city where the first aid station don't forget it was our </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2125"> "Wisla River: Vistula River. </sentence><sentence id="2126"> 8 area, the Polish Home Army not the German area yet, and I found my way to what they say is the lazarett.deg The lazarett and the first aid with the red cross on it. </sentence><sentence id="2127">I bring her on my back. </sentence><sentence id="2128">I crawl in practically through the door and whom do I find is a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2129">I almost fainted. </sentence><sentence id="2130">Then with together with Lucine on my back, my classmate who was my partner in crime and was supposed to be executed by firing squad, he was hiding in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2131">He finished his medical school underground. </sentence><sentence id="2132">He just whispered to me, we don't know each other, and that was all, I was the only one. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2133">Lucine was the only one who get tetanus shot. </sentence><sentence id="2134">There was not tetanus for nobody. </sentence><sentence id="2135">She was the only one who received it. </sentence><sentence id="2136">They tended her wounds and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2137">Squeeze my hands and couldn't hug and kiss each other and just wish each other best of luck and we left. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And after several weeks, few weeks, I think about a month, the uprising went down under. </sentence><sentence id="2139">German triumphed and they announced loudspeakers, all the inhabitants of Warsaw now going to be evacuated to a camp near Warsaw by foot. </sentence><sentence id="2140">We walked several kilometers by foot to a little town name Pruszkow. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2141"> I was wearing my uniform, had my bandages on. </sentence><sentence id="2142">Lucine had bandages on and at that time nobody suspected any Jews left, and we approaching the camp we see a doctor there and several nurses. </sentence><sentence id="2143">Lucine thought they were nuns. </sentence><sentence id="2144">They were not nuns. </sentence><sentence id="2145">They were nurse and I told them I am a medical student and one of the doctor said "go to the right, go to the right." </sentence><sentence id="2146">This was the building -- I forgot the number of the building. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2147">We didn't know where to go to right or not. </sentence><sentence id="2148">The first intuition was maybe we shouldn't, but why would he steer us wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2149">He is not working for the Poles, not for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2150">As we found a lot of older people meantime getting out of one barrack to another one, and we see an older lady, old lady on a stretcher lying there, moaning, and no one was there. </sentence><sentence id="2151">So I grab another guy. </sentence><sentence id="2152">Why don't you help me get this lady to the barracks, and we carry the lady that behind us and they thought that we're part of the troop over there caring for the sick and disabled, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="2153">We came to there barrack and we see a lot of elderly people, sick people and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2154">And at this time I wonder if we made the right decision cause we know from the ghetto days yet, sick and disabled people are garbage. </sentence><sentence id="2155">They going to be destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="2156">Why didn't they put us with the younger people? </sentence><sentence id="2157">We young people, young really. </sentence><sentence id="2158">Younger people just go to Germany to work, but this was no way out. </sentence><sentence id="2159">There a guard at the door. </sentence><sentence id="2160">If you want to get out, even go to the washroom or something, there some containers and the women and men together. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2161"> End of Tape #2 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2162"> "lazarett: (German). </sentence><sentence id="2163">Hospital or clinic. </sentence><sentence id="2164"> 9 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2165">A: So we looking around the barracks and seeing all the older people we don't know what we're doing there actually. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And a thought went through our minds, and maybe this a group of peoples going to go for final resolutions of their problems. </sentence><sentence id="2167">Probably Auschwitz or so, and then after two or three nights staying on straw mats on the floor, you lying down one night, you woke up the next night about three feet away because the straw mats were moving. </sentence><sentence id="2168">That's how people were talking about, lice, horrible situation there, and they one morning they decided to let us out the of the barracks and direct us toward the railroad track where open cars, cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="2169">While to me this was nothing new. </sentence><sentence id="2170">I read it very well and I knew what's happening now. </sentence><sentence id="2171">First thought was, we probably going to go to Auschwitz or one of those places. </sentence><sentence id="2172">But the young people think maybe this get to Germany for work. </sentence><sentence id="2173">But the old people, sick people, people on stretchers and so on that's what they do with us. </sentence><sentence id="2174">They seal the cars, but through the upper little windows they actually wired type of upper portion. </sentence><sentence id="2175">The car were wired. </sentence><sentence id="2176">You could see through and standing on somebody's shoulders you could see outside. </sentence><sentence id="2177">I seen there were only two guards, soldiers or what ever, Gestapo I'm not sure who they were. </sentence><sentence id="2178">One near the locomotive, the beginning of the train and one at the end. </sentence><sentence id="2179">This was not really clear to me what the purpose of this transport. </sentence><sentence id="2180">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="2181">Nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Everybody was asking the same question. </sentence><sentence id="2183">People were squashed like cattle, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2184">About maybe close to 100 people in the car. </sentence><sentence id="2185">Woman, man, there were no toilet facilities of course, and people just relieving themselves the way they were, standing and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2186">And everybody, you know, without any concentration. </sentence><sentence id="2187">The fear, you know, not knowing where we going. </sentence><sentence id="2188">I was conditioned to it a little bit, and the other Poles weren't. </sentence><sentence id="2189">The rest the Poles weren't, so that's the first experience they had. </sentence><sentence id="2190">So I was kind of over hand but the final destination was still the same. </sentence><sentence id="2191">So what am I going to win here? </sentence><sentence id="2192">We going to go together as a Pole maybe, but still. </sentence><sentence id="2193">All of a sudden one night one very important railroad stations. </sentence><sentence id="2194">The place was bombed by allies. </sentence><sentence id="2195">They destroyed the railroad lengths you know, and the train couldn't go any further. </sentence><sentence id="2196">This detained us for about two or three days until they repaired the tracks. </sentence><sentence id="2197">And to say there were no food given, no water given, there were no people outside. </sentence><sentence id="2198">There was nothing and then the car start rolling again and after unknown number of days, we are arrived in a little town. </sentence><sentence id="2199">The name was Jedrzejow a town with maybe 8, 10,000 people and all of a sudden the train stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2200">The car doors open up. </sentence><sentence id="2201">Polish Red Cross appeared. </sentence><sentence id="2202">Woman with band, red cross on it and they directing this car, this car going left, this car going straight, the other car going to the right and we found ourselves in front of many horse carriages, you know, driven by the local peasants. </sentence><sentence id="2203">And in front of the carriages there were tables and Polish woman was sitting there registering everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2204">They want your IDs. </sentence><sentence id="2205">So you give IDs. </sentence><sentence id="2206">I was in railroad uniform at this time. </sentence><sentence id="2207">My wife was with me and registered, and she assigned us to a certain village, to a peasant that was forced to take us as guests  0 and to feed us and be responsible for us. </sentence><sentence id="2208">And they let us go free. </sentence><sentence id="2209">We didn't go in any jail. </sentence><sentence id="2210">We didn't go to any concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2211">No one ever informed us what going to happen, nothing until this moment. </sentence><sentence id="2212">We're driven, by, it turn out later, by the mayor of this little village to a different farmer. </sentence><sentence id="2213">He brought us there, knocked at the door. </sentence><sentence id="2214">Here they are and he left. </sentence><sentence id="2215">Of course, we speak very fluent and clean, very intelligent Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2216">Peasant Polish is a little different Polish and they hate the city people you know, and he told me right away in slang, "I am not taking freeloaders to my house. </sentence><sentence id="2217">I cannot afford you people." </sentence><sentence id="2218">I said "I was wounded. </sentence><sentence id="2219">Lucine was wounded too, my wife, you know." </sentence><sentence id="2220">She was bandaged up. </sentence><sentence id="2221">I said, but "look, as soon as we feel better we going to help you. </sentence><sentence id="2222">We help you on the farm." </sentence><sentence id="2223">He said, "I'm not going to take no body." </sentence><sentence id="2224">And, he shut the door. </sentence><sentence id="2225">We standing there maybe, most of the day outside. </sentence><sentence id="2226">It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="2227">Mind you this was already either end of October or so, beginning of November, it was cold, raining. </sentence><sentence id="2228">We hugged each other, standing, didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2229">He refused to take us in and we stayed like this way all night under the little roof, thinking what next. </sentence><sentence id="2230">Early in the morning, the mayor of the village appeared there. </sentence><sentence id="2231">Allegedly, he knew that we were not taken in by this farmer. </sentence><sentence id="2232">He asked us to go with him. </sentence><sentence id="2233">We didn't have no luggage with us, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2234">So we walked with him. </sentence><sentence id="2235">He took us to the only building made out of brick. </sentence><sentence id="2236">The rest were huts and he say, you stay in this house now, and the people walked out, the farmer, middle age people. </sentence><sentence id="2237">Maybe she was 40, 42, he was maybe 45, with two little kids and very friendly invited us in. </sentence><sentence id="2238">Knowing that we were wounded so they give us their own bedroom and bed so we can sleep and rest. </sentence><sentence id="2239">She said she making chicken for me, chicken broth and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2240">Very, very friendly and accepting us, and feeling sorry for us probably. </sentence><sentence id="2241">Well, at this moment I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="2242">I just wanted to lie down and rest. </sentence><sentence id="2243">I didn't feel good. </sentence><sentence id="2244">I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="2245">I was weak. </sentence><sentence id="2246">I was bleeding a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2247">All the turmoil and what was happening next and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2248">I didn't look beyond that moment. </sentence><sentence id="2249">The same night I woke up with a light flashing in my face. </sentence><sentence id="2250">Who are you? </sentence><sentence id="2251">I thought maybe Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2252">Right away you know you always live with that fear it's always in your end. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And here was a man said, I am from the underground from Home Army in this area, we heard that you people were from Warsaw, uprising from Warsaw, and we just want to tell you we very apologetic we couldn't come to your help. </sentence><sentence id="2254">You know, those days you couldn't take a train or trucks or cars to Warsaw to help the other groups of the Home Army you know but he said they couldn't do nothing for us and so on but they make sure not a hair on our head here in this village. </sentence><sentence id="2255">As a matter of fact, they hear about the other farm and they took care of him already. </sentence><sentence id="2256">They went that night before they came to us. </sentence><sentence id="2257">They woke up the whole family, the farmer refuse our entry asked him to strip completely from the waist down. </sentence><sentence id="2258">Bent over a trunk of a tree and so on they beat him up with some ... branches of trees and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2259"> 1 They were bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="2260">They beat up the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="2261">The farmer, his wife, his grown-up sons and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2262">The farmer beg us to return to his home, but we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2263">We didn't have nothing to do with them beating them up. </sentence><sentence id="2264">But they aware that we're from Warsaw uprising. </sentence><sentence id="2265">They thought that we really some important people from the Home Army, which we're not. </sentence><sentence id="2266">I was a small fish there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2267">But, anyway I was proud to be one of them and he said they make sure that if we need a doctor they provide medical me care and so on and nothing would happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="2268">And believe me our care was the best care any hospital could give us and after I got a little better, I got worse again and I got sick with high fever and yellow jaundice. </sentence><sentence id="2269">My nights were horrible. </sentence><sentence id="2270">I didn't know what I was talking about. </sentence><sentence id="2271">Lucine said I was talking nonsense through my sleep and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2272">They were scared I might die, temperature 103, 104, yellow jaundice, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2273">Finally, the farmer said I take you to the doctor, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2274">Can't let you dies like this. </sentence><sentence id="2275">So he took his two horses, you know, and his wagon, you know, and took me to nearest town. </sentence><sentence id="2276">There was Polish doctor there. </sentence><sentence id="2277">This town was about 15 or 20 kilometers away. </sentence><sentence id="2278">In the meantime, Lucine was very, she recovered faster than I did. </sentence><sentence id="2279">and she was very helpful in the farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="2280">She was helping with chickens and cooking and peeling potatoes and bringing in water and whatever was necessary and feeding the pigs, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2281">And they liked it very much because they, we didn't have to be paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="2282">You know, they just supported us. </sentence><sentence id="2283">And they were very grateful for this. </sentence><sentence id="2284">It showed the way they treated us. </sentence><sentence id="2285">And I was just a victim of this. </sentence><sentence id="2286">I was in no shape to do any of it. </sentence><sentence id="2287">And I went to this doctor, was on the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="2288">I remember like today they had to practically carry me upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="2289">I couldn't walk straight. </sentence><sentence id="2290">There was a little waiting room. </sentence><sentence id="2291">There was no one in the waiting room, but I had to wait. </sentence><sentence id="2292">To my left was a little table. </sentence><sentence id="2293">On the little table was a little box, looked like from medical instrument something. </sentence><sentence id="2294">I glance at the box. </sentence><sentence id="2295">There was a label on it. </sentence><sentence id="2296">Dr. Grayefski (ph) Praga, Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2297">Just I notice this that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2298">I was still in my uniform. </sentence><sentence id="2299">That's the only clothes I had. </sentence><sentence id="2300">Finally the door opens up. </sentence><sentence id="2301">The nurse calls me in, said Mr. Wojick? </sentence><sentence id="2302">I said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2303">And she asked me my history, what happened to me and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2304">So I told her the whole story about Warsaw uprising, my wounds. </sentence><sentence id="2305">my wife being hurt and so on, I thought maybe a results of this result of my wounds, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2306">06:12: So they wrote everything down. </sentence><sentence id="2307">The doctor comes in and he said what's your name?And I said Wojick. </sentence><sentence id="2308">He looks at my uniform. </sentence><sentence id="2309">Where you from? </sentence><sentence id="2310">I said, Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2311">Are you a railroad

by any chance Dr. Grayefski?" </sentence><sentence id="2319">He said, of course I am. </sentence><sentence id="2320">You know me. </sentence><sentence id="2321">This name I memorize from this little box on the table. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And from then on was such a bond, such a contact, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2323">I didn't worry about any suspicions or so. </sentence><sentence id="2324">He gave me a shot. </sentence><sentence id="2325">I turned back, he gave me a shot. </sentence><sentence id="2326">He didn't know who was, nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="2327">Gave me some vitamins, some medications and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2328">I went back home and from then on I started my miraculous recovery. </sentence><sentence id="2329">The people were nice  2 to me. </sentence><sentence id="2330">There were some other Warsaw refugees there, Polish refugees. </sentence><sentence id="2331">One was a shoemaker and I felt very uneasy about him. </sentence><sentence id="2332">For some reason he look at me all the time and I was worrying if he maybe recognize me from somewhere or suspect who I am. </sentence><sentence id="2333">And during Easter holidays he invited us, me and Lucine to his house. </sentence><sentence id="2334">He was all alone. </sentence><sentence id="2335">I think he was single, but he was middle age person. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And we would talked. </sentence><sentence id="2337">He ask me questions, where I from and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2338">Very inquisitive you know, which school I went to. </sentence><sentence id="2339">So I told him, Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="2340">I told him the story. </sentence><sentence id="2341">I told him all these things which was true. </sentence><sentence id="2342">My Polish misled everybody because my Polish was the best, if I brag about it, one thing, I brag my language. </sentence><sentence id="2343">I speak several languages my Polish is exquisite. </sentence><sentence id="2344">Is perfect, really perfect, literately Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2345">They couldn't understand it because Jews don't speak that kind of Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2346">None of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2347">So, but he never said nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2348">He was very cordial. </sentence><sentence id="2349">Treated us, Polish sausage and this and then apologize he not a good cook, but he done what he could. </sentence><sentence id="2350">By being fellow from Warsaw and so on we have something in common, he thought he invite us be the holidays with him. </sentence><sentence id="2351">He didn't want to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="2352">And slowly I was recovering. </sentence><sentence id="2353">Then I got the idea how could I repay those peasants, for they're their ... being so good to us. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And I thought since the schools were illegal and schools closed I would organize a secret Polish school. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And I suspected that mayor of the village was somebody that maybe I don't know exactly who he was. </sentence><sentence id="2356">He was more than just the mayor. </sentence><sentence id="2357">And one day I approached him. </sentence><sentence id="2358">I said, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="2359">I feel strong enough. </sentence><sentence id="2360">I like to teach the children Polish language to read. </sentence><sentence id="2361">Little math, geography, whatever I can, and the political situation. </sentence><sentence id="2362">Let them be aware of what was going on now. </sentence><sentence id="2363">But I have no books. </sentence><sentence id="2364">How we going to get books? </sentence><sentence id="2365">The area we located was far away from our normal area where we used to live you know. </sentence><sentence id="2366">I didn't know anyone there. </sentence><sentence id="2367">0 he said, "well, I'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2368">I'll give you a name. </sentence><sentence id="2369">You can go to next village." </sentence><sentence id="2370">As a matter of fact, on Sunday I go to the town. </sentence><sentence id="2371">Maybe I take you with me, in the wagon, and then I don't know want to go with you, to this place, to that person. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Just tell them I send you and you tell them what you need. </sentence><sentence id="2373">But I said I don't have money either -- "don't worry about that, just don't worry about that. </sentence><sentence id="2374">Just tell him what need." </sentence><sentence id="2375">I will straighten it out. </sentence><sentence id="2376">And I met this person. </sentence><sentence id="2377">He looked at me suspicious look, asked for my IDs, my documents. </sentence><sentence id="2378">Asked I was from Home Army. </sentence><sentence id="2379">I said, yes, I was wounded during the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="2380">So he had no reason to doubt me, which was true. </sentence><sentence id="2381">I didn't say who I was. </sentence><sentence id="2382">He gave me about ten difference books. </sentence><sentence id="2383">Polish readings, simple arithmetics, art, crayons, all the pencils, all the little things, erasers. </sentence><sentence id="2384">Here I am, educational director. </sentence><sentence id="2385">I'm organizing a school. </sentence><sentence id="2386">I took the kids together in one house. </sentence><sentence id="2387">I told them what we going to do and I told them we have to be smart about it because if the German find out that we have a secret school, they are going to burn the village and we have to have a school. </sentence><sentence id="2388">So we taught the kids that each day, one of the kids, they were mostly boys if I remember, will stand guard outside on the top, on the roof of the house. </sentence><sentence id="2389">Our village was top of the hill so you can see the road down there in the next town. </sentence><sentence id="2390">If the Germans coming to the village, they had to come to this  3 road. </sentence><sentence id="2391">So if you watch this road, you will find out who was coming to the village. </sentence><sentence id="2392">Then you can take proper precautions. </sentence><sentence id="2393">We told the kids if anything suspicious, right away they dispenses each one runs to his own house. </sentence><sentence id="2394">Each one runs, takes the book with him right away, there not be a trace left of any educational type material on the tables. </sentence><sentence id="2395">And we conduct school very nicely with no problem, with no difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="2396">Kids were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2397">They obey. </sentence><sentence id="2398">And one day during the classes, all of a sudden a door opens up and two men with hats, long gray leather coats, boots, typical Gestapo detectives walk in. </sentence><sentence id="2399">And right away ask me, "Are you Mr. Wojick?" </sentence><sentence id="2400">Well, I don't have to tell you how I felt. </sentence><sentence id="2401">I knew this was it, someone denounces me. </sentence><sentence id="2402">You come with us. </sentence><sentence id="2403">I was ready to faint. </sentence><sentence id="2404">Try to regain my composure. </sentence><sentence id="2405">Tried to ask him what it's all about. </sentence><sentence id="2406">They said "you go with us." </sentence><sentence id="2407">I walked out into the hallway, and they stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2408">They start shaking my hand. </sentence><sentence id="2409">We came in on orders of the Polish Government Exile who found out that someone is organizing a secret Polish education for the children, and we just want to thank you and congratulate you. </sentence><sentence id="2410">We want to assure you that the end of the problem is soon. </sentence><sentence id="2411">The war is almost at the end. </sentence><sentence id="2412">The Germans are losing the war. </sentence><sentence id="2413">There was no news. </sentence><sentence id="2414">We don't know nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2415">The Russian Army is advancing and they should be here within weeks probably, and with this they left. </sentence><sentence id="2416">Until today I don't know what happened to that boy on the roof of the house, that he didn't detect the two men walking in there. </sentence><sentence id="2417">Could be Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2418">Anyway, I was continuing teaching then all of a sudden we heard rumblings from the front nearby, the noise of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2419">The explosions and the artillery was getting louder, louder every day and of course, our hope was building up each minute. </sentence><sentence id="2420">But the awareness that we could lose our lives, the end, the last hour of life was still with me. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And I decided one day one of the sons of the neighbor came in. </sentence><sentence id="2422">Was a member of the Polish Underground but a different underground what they used to call the N.S.Z.deg which a Polish nationalist alliance group, together with Polish Hitlerites, they just found in the forest a bunker, a woman, two children, hidden. </sentence><sentence id="2423">So they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="2424">He came to our house to tell us about it. </sentence><sentence id="2425">Thought we would rejoice it, and we had, I had to hear that. </sentence><sentence id="2426">And he told us that he's leaving, go west with the Germans because the Russians are coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2427">If they catch him he will be sent to Siberia because his group was cooperating with the Germans, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2428">And he left. </sentence><sentence id="2429">I talked to the peasants, my friends now. </sentence><sentence id="2430">I said, "You know, I would like to meet the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2431">Said, please, please don't, and Mr.Wojick don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="2432">They won't come here anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2433">Don't do that it's dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="2434">You don't want to go in the field of action, but I had to go there. </sentence><sentence id="2435">So I was crawling out the village on all my fours. </sentence><sentence id="2436">There was a little forest next the "N.S.Z.: Narodowe Sily Zbrojne. </sentence><sentence id="2437">Soviet backed Polish partisans  4 village and I could see the tanks for maybe, like a hundred feet away, only the Russian tanks. </sentence><sentence id="2438">I recognize the star on the tank and I recognize their faces because their head was up out the tank, you know, looking with field glasses where they are or something, and I start getting up, to try to greet them and they start shooting at me. </sentence><sentence id="2439">The tank, thank Gods, the they didn't hit me, didn't get near me. </sentence><sentence id="2440">You know, I crawled right back, right back to the village scared stiff. </sentence><sentence id="2441">Before I knew it the Russian entered the village. </sentence><sentence id="2442">They asked for the mayor and asked how many people there was in the village and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2443">And I was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2444">They asked me who I was. </sentence><sentence id="2445">I speak fluent Russian so I said, "I'm the teacher here." </sentence><sentence id="2446">Then the Russian tell him I'm also a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2447">He said, "A Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2448">You're lying, there are no Jews here. </sentence><sentence id="2449">You must be a spy. </sentence><sentence id="2450">How come you speak Russian? </sentence><sentence id="2451">Only a spy speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2452">And the Jews, there are no Jews left. </sentence><sentence id="2453">They are all killed." </sentence><sentence id="2454">I said, "That's not true. </sentence><sentence id="2455">Myself and my wife, we escaped and we hiding under false names." " </sentence><sentence id="2456">False names, you must be a spy," and I said, "No, I'm telling you lam Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="2457">And he said, wait and minute, and he called another officer. </sentence><sentence id="2458">His name was Lev. </sentence><sentence id="2459">I remember like today. </sentence><sentence id="2460">It was a typical Jewish first name in Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2461">Lev, come over here. </sentence><sentence id="2462">Take a load of this. </sentence><sentence id="2463">This guy telling me he is a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2464">Now, you Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2465">You find out. </sentence><sentence id="2466">He comes to me and about 45-year-old man. </sentence><sentence id="2467">He said, I am from Leningrad. </sentence><sentence id="2468">I'm a plumber by profession. </sentence><sentence id="2469">I'm officer in the Russian Tank Division. </sentence><sentence id="2470">"Now, you tell me you're Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="2471">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="2472">So he start talking me Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2473">I do not understand Yiddish. " </sentence><sentence id="2474">You tell me you're Jewish and you don't understand Yiddish." " </sentence><sentence id="2475">I don't. </sentence><sentence id="2476">Because my family always spoke Polish to me. </sentence><sentence id="2477">My parents spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2478">I understand Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2479">I can tell you what you say. </sentence><sentence id="2480">But I can not talk. </sentence><sentence id="2481">"There's no way. </sentence><sentence id="2482">No Jew--If you Jewish, you speak Yiddish." </sentence><sentence id="2483">I said, "Believe me. </sentence><sentence id="2484">I am a Jew but I do not speak Yiddish." " </sentence><sentence id="2485">No, you cannot be a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2486">He might be right. </sentence><sentence id="2487">You must be a spy. </sentence><sentence id="2488">How come you speak Russian?" </sentence><sentence id="2489">So, I told him my story. </sentence><sentence id="2490">I was in Lvov medical school, I learn Russian from some colleagues that spoke Russian and I told him and he said that's all baloney, I don't believe one word you say, you must be a spy. </sentence><sentence id="2491">Then .I remember a prayer in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="2492">At that time rabbi that come to my home teach me a few things. </sentence><sentence id="2493">I forgot most of it but I remember one prayer. </sentence><sentence id="2494">I said, wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="2495">You know how to pray?
