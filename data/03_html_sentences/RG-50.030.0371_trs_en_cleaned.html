</sentence><sentence id="244">Why don't you give us nothing but problems? </sentence><sentence id="245">But I would find a way to say, but you love me, don't you, things like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="246">What is your father going to say? </sentence><sentence id="247">Oh, you don't have to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="248">So, mailmen had disappeared, they were in the army, so we had mailwomen and I had developed a little relationship with the mailwoman, who taught me a little about sex and I told her, any mail that comes for me, give it to me. </sentence><sentence id="249">A letter came from Elsie, that was the girl I had left and I read, I said oh my God, put the letter in my pocket, the letter said, I'm pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="250">So I didn't quite know what to do, she needed help, but my father had come to town that day or a day earlier and my mother thought it was time to change , So they took everything out of the pocket and there was the letter. </sentence><sentence id="251">So my father woke me up, did you sleep with the girl? </sentence><sentence id="252">Yes, sir. </sentence><sentence id="253">If you're old enough to sleep with a girl, you're old enough to become a father. </sentence><sentence id="254">And my mother, I see her go to pieces, Paul, he's not even 13, how can you say that?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Yeah, I was fine, yeah it was fine because there was nothing really negative. </sentence><sentence id="301">It meant you had to go to service, I think twice a week, generally on Sundays, and the, I have to tell you another thing about another school, generally on Sundays and it was instructional and that it, you learned the Morse alphabet, or you learned the flags, in the navy, you know, a, b, c, d, x and all. </sentence><sentence id="302">It was a pre-military thing, very physical education centric and then of course I wanted to swim and the only way you could swim was by being a member. </sentence><sentence id="303">Without being a member I couldn't even swim. </sentence><sentence id="304">So I was representing now, the Hitler youth of Dusseldorf. </sentence><sentence id="305">Even though I belonged to a swim club, the swim club went into the background and I swam for the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="306">But I was in , which meant I was about 11, I think and the truth is I don't know exactly where they were , but a new kind of school had called the Adolf Hitler school. </sentence><sentence id="307">I hate to make that kind of analogy, but it was about as select as the Air Force Academy, something of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="308">A one directional school, and I was chosen to go to the Adolf Hitler school, because I had, my intelligence level was really high, physically I was in top condition and no Jewish blood for at least five generations, so I was a top candidate. </sentence><sentence id="309">That was quite an honor. </sentence><sentence id="310">But before going to the Adolf Hitler school, I was sent, with a group of other candidates to a kind of pre-screening school, where there were certain tests, physical and mental tests. </sentence><sentence id="311">I was there for about a week. </sentence><sentence id="312">When my father heard about that, he said forget it, it's out, you're not going to any, that kind of school. </sentence><sentence id="313">And I hated him for it. </sentence><sentence id="314">And he explained then, with a very few words, saying things like today you won't understand, one day you will thank me for it. </sentence><sentence id="315">So I didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="316">But I was chosen for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: What were the guards saying to you__, how were they treating you, why were they saying you were there, because , why were they saying you were there? </sentence><sentence id="540">Was  5 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="541">Q: Before we go into more detail about your time in prison, just want to return to the Edelweiss Pirates and ask you, what were you , what was the purpose of this group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="543">A: Oh, if you, well, forced to give you one word I would say anti-authority. </sentence><sentence id="544">We are going into psychoanalysis here. </sentence><sentence id="545">It may be because I hated authority of a, I really did not hate authority of a benevolent man, but authority was always, in my life, somehow related to something bad. </sentence><sentence id="546">My father's authority meant beating me up, the principal authority, there was nothing positive about that, so the guys becoming leaders, telling me what to do, that was no good, so, anti-authority is probably the answer, coupled with lust for adventure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: So it wasn't per se that you were anti Hitler, or anti what was going on with the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: I was much too young to understand that, however, after the war, there were a few members of course who were in my group, they were kind of glorified as the ones who resisted Hitler, but . </sentence><sentence id="554">That's a wild story. </sentence><sentence id="555">No, it wasn't that, but it was interpreted as such. </sentence><sentence id="556">I mean if | wanted to glorify my life, I would probably say at a very tender age, I resisted and fought against Hitler, but that would be a lie, so I was nothing but, as I told you before, it's like a gang, and like gangs fear, kind of resent other gangs and resent the police and resent authority, that's what I did, I resented authority, because to me, authority was negative. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="561">Q: Well what , because some of the things you were doing were, in a positive way, part of Hitler's plan for young people, the swimming, maybe going to a special academy. </sentence><sentence id="562">You wanted to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="565">A: True, true, I was a, let me be a little sarcastic, I was a fine German specimen, as expected by the leaders of the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="566">I just took the everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="567"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="571">Q: , 1 don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: I think I should, I should say to you with all sincerity that there's nothing normal about my family. </sentence><sentence id="574">My father a very unusual man in every sense of the word, who spent little time with me when I was a child because he didn't particularly care for me and when I was a youngster he was away. </sentence><sentence id="575">My mother didn't fit in the picture, she was probably the most naive woman of the 20th century. </sentence><sentence id="576">So we were quite unusual, and as my father was a self-made man, I definitely was self-made. </sentence><sentence id="577">Even though I had a relatively good education, but life taught me much more and my traveling around the world, much more than my education in Germany, I was well prepared, like every high school, like every high school boy. </sentence><sentence id="578">So it was my free spirit, my resentment of authority, resenting anybody who told me you have to, which prompt me to say why and that got me in trouble automatically. </sentence><sentence id="579">I sometimes ask teachers why and that was almost like a sin, you were not supposed to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="580">So I was the one who asked and looked for explanations for all kinds of things, but that does not mean that at the tender age of 14 or 15, I wanted to have a, if there is such a thing, a logical explanation to the existence of Hitler, or to the Jewish question, so no, that's, I would have been a genius. </sentence><sentence id="581">That just would have been somewhat unnatural. </sentence><sentence id="582">Would I ask, which I didn't understand why suddenly there was so much anti-Jewish feeling, then the explanation came, well because they have nothing to do but this and that, so they have taken over the university, they have taken over education, they are parasites, they are, they have white German girls, they have done this and this and that, and whether you believe all of that or not, but they're, it creates certain doubts, are they really bad? </sentence><sentence id="583">And as you grew up in this atmosphere, you don't ask questions like is that really all true? </sentence><sentence id="584">No, you accept it and it does not become a dispute within you as far as rationality is concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="597">Q: , was there some other group like yours in the city or in the country? </sentence><sentence id="598"> 7 problems, because I would have questioned the authority of my superior, unless he had treated me properly, in a justifiable way. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="599">Q: Did it ever occur to you that you might have been asked to some way be involved in </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="612">Q: Let's go back to the point you were in prison, where we were about 10 minutes ago. </sentence><sentence id="613">You've been in prison for a few days now. </sentence><sentence id="614">getting used to it, are you able to have any contact with the " </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="618">A: Oh no, I never get used to it. </sentence><sentence id="619">I think it was the third day or the fourth day when a guard came and he was from my part of town. </sentence><sentence id="620">And I assume that he disliked the fact that a member of his district of town embarrassed him in a certain way, so he came, opened the door, and I stood there, with my ceramic pot, he said, aha you, he said something like you are the embarrassment of the town. </sentence><sentence id="621">Shame on you and so on. </sentence><sentence id="622">He said empty the pot in your cell. </sentence><sentence id="623">When I come back I want this clean. </sentence><sentence id="624">There was a little piece of, of course I had the water, a little piece of cloth, and I had to clean the cell. </sentence><sentence id="625">It was my first devastating experience so to speak after I'd been beaten up before. </sentence><sentence id="626">Then I had a neighbor, I mean in the next cell, he was from morning to evening, , 1 can still here it, that makes ; , his voice was gone. </sentence><sentence id="627">And one of the prisoners told me that he  8 eaten, that I purposely wanted to get sick, that was a no no. </sentence><sentence id="628">So then I kind of gave up and said, well it won't work I have to wait for better opportunities. </sentence><sentence id="629">On April the 12th, April the 12th, 1943, I was taken to court. </sentence><sentence id="630">My trial, the state attorney I think they call it here, district attorney, state attorney, asked for the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="631">My thought is, first time I saw my father and my mother, my mother couldn't control herself, so she was crying, and my father didn't quite know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="632">There were two attorneys, when he recommended the death penalty, I know they kind of jumped over and hugged my arm and said, that's not the last word. </sentence><sentence id="633">Then kind of the judge and the state attorney and somebody else, some functionary, they kind of argued about whether it was looting, or whether it was theft. </sentence><sentence id="634">The idea was that the two had different consequences. </sentence><sentence id="635">And so they retired and when we came back, the judge decided, or had decided that it was, well before they'd had an argument and the state attorney that, I would call it theft, but this man, having had intimate contact with our enemy, and being the leader of the Edelweiss , having destroyed state goods, and state property, does not deserve any kind of consideration. </sentence><sentence id="636">So when the judge came back and said, on the grounds of his outstanding involvement in athletism, and considering age and circumstances, I condemn you to one to four years in prison. </sentence><sentence id="637">Let me explain, they said, with good conduct after one year, you may be relieved and join the armed forces, and if not, you will remain. </sentence><sentence id="638">That was it, and maybe a week later I was put in, what in prison slang is called, I was put on transport. </sentence><sentence id="639">So I was taken to the railroad station, we took a train, and at that time, I don't know how it is today, at that time, if you go let's say from Washington to California, you would not go non-stop, you would maybe go from Washington to maybe North Carolina and stay there a couple of days, three days in a prison and then join other prisoners and form another group that goes and you eventually come to California. </sentence><sentence id="640">So, first I went to Cologne, the prison. </sentence><sentence id="641">And there I was exposed to, it was a dirty prison, to bedbugs and lice and fleas and so on. </sentence><sentence id="642">And we all were set to move in the afternoon, all of us, the one side of the prison had to move to the other side, because we could look into the courtyard and they used to chop heads, so they had executions in the courtyard, if you hear ding, ding, the little bell, so we weren't allowed to witness that, so we had to go the other side. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="669">Q: Who would it be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="671">A: Well, whoever was condemned to death, but instead of electric chair they had beheading, which is really not an axe like so many people believe, but is an extremely sharp instrument that just go kind of straight through. </sentence><sentence id="672">So, from Cologne, I went to , that took two or three days. </sentence><sentence id="673">From there to Frankfurt, from Frankfurt I was accompanied to where a few of the group, was a kind of security prison for harsh criminals, I was condemned to one to three years in , which was a  9 prison, but it actually is. </sentence><sentence id="674">The front part, the administration building was once a convent. </sentence><sentence id="675">It had walls about three feet wide. </sentence><sentence id="676">And then from there you go this never-ending walk and then comes the prison. </sentence><sentence id="677">Of course most prisons are, there's a cross or there's a star so that from the center you can see all over. </sentence><sentence id="678">And well, like in most prisons you receive your uniform and then you are to go to a cell, and we had, three times a week we had school, which was limited pretty much to German history and geography, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="679">It was very limited to the new Germany, so we talk about nation. </sentence><sentence id="680">There was more indoctrination there than anywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="681">And I assumed that they found out that I was probably at the intelligence level, more educated than any of the others, so I got a job as assistant to the buyer. </sentence><sentence id="682">We bought groceries and sent to the kitchen, the kitchen was underway, it was a separate building on the way from the administration building to the prison proper. </sentence><sentence id="683">And I assure you that if I had been a good boy, I would have laughed at the war, I probably would have gained 100 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="684">And the old guard, you know to me at the time, anything that was over 50 was pretty old, like my grandfather was an antique, you know. </sentence><sentence id="685">And anyway, he was so kind, so good, that I, I was not about to escape from him, because life was a little too good. </sentence><sentence id="686">But in one day, I had to do, I don't remember what, I had to do something, and the old convent building on one side and I remember, and I discovered in one of the windows, there were three bars. </sentence><sentence id="687">Thick. </sentence><sentence id="688">You know, octagonal, they have eight corners or six comers, whatever, these bars, and one was loose. </sentence><sentence id="689">That was just too much temptation. </sentence><sentence id="690">My father was coming to visit and I wrote a little note. </sentence><sentence id="691">I will be at such and such a time at that window, please pick me up and I thought he's going to take me in a car to France and I'm going to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="692">I put it in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="693">I think I needed a key or something and the note fell out of my pocket and the guard saw it. </sentence><sentence id="694">I never got to see my father. </sentence><sentence id="695">I was taken to the warden, whom I called the spider because he looked like a spider. </sentence><sentence id="696">This immense room and I had to enter a circle, stand there. </sentence><sentence id="697">He had a big nose and his gold rimmed glasses sitting on his nose, said, well, well, mistake, mistake, mistake. </sentence><sentence id="698">I thought you were kind of a prisoner sample, an inspiration, and I thought this is probably one I will  0 guards saw me and shot me in the leg, so I fell. </sentence><sentence id="699">Back to the spider. </sentence><sentence id="700">So you have this dialog. </sentence><sentence id="701">I have prisoners who make my life difficult, I like to have a peaceful existence. </sentence><sentence id="702">I don't know why you're that way, but I think that the only way for you is to go back to the bunker, it'll do you some good. </sentence><sentence id="703">Something of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="704">So I went back. </sentence><sentence id="705">Another 28 days. </sentence><sentence id="706">By that time I thought, I picked flies, I picked anything and put it in the wound, so it would become infected. </sentence><sentence id="707">I was too damn healthy for that, | mean my immune system was too damn strong for any bug. </sentence><sentence id="708">But for a long time it stayed open. </sentence></p></dialogue>
