<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: So you're describing two people who were very much self-made, certainly self-improving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Totally, totally, but the point that I am astonished when I read what my mother wrote, it's so impeccable and so well expressed that well, it must be an innate thing with her. </sentence><sentence id="114">She was a very unusual, unusual woman who didn't fit in this century at all. </sentence><sentence id="115">To her there were only flowers and beautiful things, you know she was extremely sensitive, neat. </sentence><sentence id="116">I hear my father always complaining, why don't you leave the broom away, why don't you quit cleaning, but even the handles of the brooms had to be sanded, it was ridiculous, so. </sentence><sentence id="117">But a lovely, lovely, lovely woman. </sentence><sentence id="118">I assume, probably because she didn't ever receive much love, she wondered, she went overboard with love. </sentence><sentence id="119">I remember she was 70, over 70, I'll tell you a nice thing about her, and she told me once, you know Walter, I wish I could have another baby. </sentence><sentence id="120">When she was 75, the newspaper, the leading newspaper of Dusseldorf promoted a jogging contest, 30 kilometers, which is 18 miles. </sentence><sentence id="121">She registered and she was told, you're too  old and she protested. </sentence><sentence id="122">After her fifth victory, at the age of 81, she had a special trophy from the Secretary of the Interior, true. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Natural food, yeah, and I had to drink carrot juice and lots of fruits and the butter had to be special butter and the eggs had to be from yard, yard eggs, yard chickens who ran free and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="154">Very little meat, and she said the fact that I survived is because she nursed me 18 months and my father was, he expected me to be the way he wanted me to be and I was exactly the opposite, so not getting any attention at home, I tried to get attention in other ways. </sentence><sentence id="155">That led to a situation where, he would probably beat me up three times a week. </sentence><sentence id="156">It came to the point where we didn't speak to each other, there was no communication, and I was not allowed to eat at the same table. </sentence><sentence id="157">So it was quite extreme. </sentence><sentence id="158">I think if you had given me a gun when I was 11, I probably would have shot him. </sentence><sentence id="159">It took me many years and nowadays I miss him. </sentence><sentence id="160">It took me many years to love him dearly, I hated him. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, you know, when he looked for me, he wouldn't ask for my son, he would ask for, have you seen Walter Meyer? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: It's like it sounds like almost the two you know, very, really kind of stern and sometimes brutal father and a mother " </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Yeah, except one time I was a little surprised, I was in school, I was already 12, 13, I went to the high school. </sentence><sentence id="197">In Germany you start high school at 10, you don't have Junior High School and all of the -- and we had a teacher with one wooden foot and we call him the rhino, because when he came down the floor, it was like an earthquake and he liked to slap boys, there was no co-education, all boys and you generally had two answers to a question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="200">If you answered A, he would slap you, if you answered B, he would slap you. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I think I always in my life hated for somebody to touch me, except with a nice embrace or a kiss, and so I came home and I left a note, because I didn't talk to him, I left a note with my father, told him about the situation, that I was not going to go back to school. </sentence><sentence id="202">Well, he went, I understand, checked with others, and found out that I had told the truth, so he left me a note that said, next time he hits you, hit him back. </sentence><sentence id="203">So I told everybody in class my father told me to hit him back, so I became an instant hero and a double hero after it was done. </sentence><sentence id="204">My God, everybody was in expect, expectation and sure enough, the next day he hit me and I hit him back and ran and ran. </sentence><sentence id="205">So there was a special conference and my father was called and I think he wanted to have the privilege of being the only one to hit me and the teacher actually was moved to another school or something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Did your father support you , in that classroom? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="229"> education of everything, German and Germanic, which made you believe that we were a superior race. </sentence><sentence id="230">We learned, in an intellectual way, to recognize Jews and others. </sentence><sentence id="231">Jews were then regarded as a race, rather than a religion, were inferior. </sentence><sentence id="232">It was explained very thoroughly that even statements made by and other prominent Jews who spoke negatively about their , So to speak, so there was justification. </sentence><sentence id="233">The history of the Jews as nomads and , you learned to appreciate that Jews were inferior or no good. </sentence><sentence id="234">Maybe similar to the United States where you learn that blacks are there to shine your shoes, period. </sentence><sentence id="235">I had a little problem understanding that, because there are so many instances in my life where there are confusion, simply because I was born at a time where I played with Jewish children, I went to their houses. </sentence><sentence id="236">I loved to go to their houses because their mothers had goodies, nice cookies and they had better toys than I had, but then, there was nothing wrong with them and suddenly they kind of became outcast and they disappeared and had David stars on their clothes and so on. </sentence><sentence id="237">That was a little confusing to me, and I became, probably because I liked the attention, I became an altar boy, and I asked the priest one day, I said, why is all this anti-Jewish sentiment and Jesus was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="238">I says it says INRI, that means Jesus was__ King of the Jews, he was a Jew and the answer then was, you are not supposed to ask these questions, and to express doubt. </sentence><sentence id="239">Doubt is not a very Christian thing to do, just accept things as they are. </sentence><sentence id="240">And he called me son and I hated him because I knew he couldn't have a son and he called me son, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="241">So one day, I was just so mad I just, see the big book that you have, I just threw it on the altar steps and ran. </sentence><sentence id="242">I didn't go back there. </sentence><sentence id="243">But that was very controversial issue with me. </sentence><sentence id="244">Then of course we came to, when I was rather young, I was 12 years old, we came to . [ </sentence><sentence id="245">don't know how many times I tried to, to, to start a fire in the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="246">There was a gorgeous building, but so massively built out of, I think sandstone, that you couldn't even start a fire. </sentence><sentence id="247">So I don't know how many times they tried to burn it, and then I looked and I saw people throwing through the window. </sentence><sentence id="248">I said, why do they do this to poor people and so on, it just didn't make any sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Who was throwing the ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: The SA and SS, after a member of the German embassy in was killed by, I understand by a Jew, the Crystal night started and they just cleaned out, and told the Jews to leave because we want to have a Germany, a racially pure Germany and they were asked to leave. </sentence><sentence id="273">So I remember that very vividly, it was like an uncontrolled revolution. </sentence><sentence id="274">The mob took over, and it seems whenever there are revolutions, many people look for an opportunity to do ridiculous, nasty, violent things. </sentence><sentence id="275">It seems to be part of the German element, especially those who have been oppressed for some years, all of this is a golden opportunity to just go without asking why, they just go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Think about that night and when did you realize something funny was going on, did you hear sounds, did you smell the fire, did you run out of the house? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: As I remember it, we used to have, well every German family was supposed to have a little radio, it was called a . </sentence><sentence id="282">The Volkes receiver, like the Volkswagen? </sentence><sentence id="283">It was the Volkes receiver, which was the standard model, if you had more money, you bought a more sophisticated one, but the allowed you to listen to the news, to Hitler and so on </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="287"> . </sentence><sentence id="288">But there were many who did not have the money to buy one, so there were large radios on public squares, people stood around and listened, okay? </sentence><sentence id="289">And so the big news was that a Jew had killed a member of the diplomatic corps and of course I didn't know the name, , that came later on, but it was called the , because of all the Crystal that was broken. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then when I went through the street, you could see out of the window came things, I mean it was -- police was there and move on while they threw things out, it was a nightmare, and that went over throughout the city, especially in those areas where Jews lived. </sentence><sentence id="291">And Jews as a whole had certain areas of the city where they had their locations and was close to the zoo and the zoological garden and there were quite a few Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: How did you parents react to that? </sentence><sentence id="298">Did they try to get you to stay home, what were their reactions to the event even happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: No, I don't think we even discussed it, my mother asked questions like, asked my father, why do they do that, why are people like that? </sentence><sentence id="302">Those are the questions that I remember and my father was very short-tempered with answer, like you know people are beasts and that would be the end of that conversation, so it was not discussed widely. </sentence><sentence id="303">Discussions came a little later, after the war had started and my father would make clear that it would be impossible to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="304">He had been in World War One. </sentence><sentence id="305">Especially when the Germans marched into Russia, he said that'll be the end, that's the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="306">He had a very important position, because of his rather impeccable knowledge of France. </sentence><sentence id="307">He was sent to Liedel(ph), which is in Northern France, it's kind of the Pittsburgh of France, under German occupation, to become the liaison man and to see that things would run smoothly and he was in charge of about 750 factories, mostly iron and steel. </sentence><sentence id="308">So Liedel(ph) was his headquarters, and he was one of the few who had never become a member of the National Socialist Party, because he just hated these men who suddenly appeared with brown shirts and swastikas who became functionary with the party, and in many cases people without any outstanding reputation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="309">And I remember people coming to the house, we did not have too many visitors, but when he spoke, he really didn't care, he didn't give a damn, really. </sentence><sentence id="310">But I heard people say, Paul, or Mr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="311">Meyer, you shouldn't talk like that because you know what happens to those who talk to much, ah, he just shook it off. </sentence><sentence id="312">Anyway, he was in France and I had a letter the other day, the French government wants to decorate him posthumously for all the things he has done for the French during his stay in France. </sentence><sentence id="313">I'm in many ways, I don't know whether I hate to recognize it, but I'm in many ways exactly like him. </sentence><sentence id="314">So that's the genetic secret. </sentence><sentence id="315">Back to your question, that is what I remember, glass, broken things everywhere, furniture being thrown out of the window, to the point where it was so wild that you, you tried to stay at home, you tried to go away, it looked a little dangerous. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: What was the mood among you and your friends or other families? </sentence><sentence id="317">Okay, that there's this horror going on outside, things are being broken and thrown, people don't really understand it, there's not a lot of discussion going on at home about it, what was the mood? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="318">Did you know what was coming ? </sentence><sentence id="319">Did it surprise you that it happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: I think my generation, we were a little too young to understand, but you would hear those who would make remarks like, all this good stuff, just destroying it, makes no sense and you would hear others say, they asked for it, they asked for it, they had it coming, suits them well. </sentence><sentence id="321">So you had these two parties, and then others who had learned to shut up, to say nothing, and that party was probably the strongest one. </sentence><sentence id="322">They didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="323">Another party would say, they know what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="324">Don't forget the, well Germany's a very young country is Germany, but let's say Germanic people, for endless generations, have obeyed government, faithfully, stupidly, without asking questions, and when you read the paper, or you just read the paper in Germany and then this is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="325">Nobody would say ah they lie, papers don't tell the truth, this was the word. </sentence><sentence id="326">So there was no open rejection, resistance, uproar, , no. </sentence><sentence id="327">But you have to understand that by that time Jewish propaganda in newspapers, films, radio, schools, etcetera had already come to a high point and, but this was not the first time in German history that anti-Jewish feelings had been prevalent, in the middle ages for example, so this was just one repetition, so the Jews had always been somewhat outcast, somewhat , kind of unwanted minority, so even I remembered when I went through my father's home town to take care of the cows, which I liked, because I never had to brush my teeth or wash my face, so that I was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="328">I still love to go there today. </sentence><sentence id="329">I remember Jews coming up to buy cattle, or to advance money to the farmers, with the understanding they would, they would buy the _ from them the next year and so, and they looked a little different and well you wouldn't refer to them as Mr.Mason or Mr. Sauder, you'd say, did you see the Jew?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: had that and yet you were questioning as a child, you were asking the priest, why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Oh, I don't know, I think I'm a questionnaire, so to speak, or questioner, I like to ask questions to the point where somebody would, quit asking so many questions, I heard this all my life. </sentence><sentence id="351">It didn't make any sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="352">But that doesn't hold true for everybody else, many people don't ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="353">So I go, to Panama, I say why is it called Panama, people, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="354">Well ask until I finally find somebody, Panama means wealth of fish, ah, that's , SO I like to ask questions and I remember the time my argument was with the priest, why I asked, it just occurred to me that it didn't make too much sense, but it was not a common thing, to ask questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: Did you have discussions with friends of yours that were Jewish, do you remember them being concerned, or their parents? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: No, because when it came to the persecution, that was when they disappeared and there was no argument any more, as a matter of fact, you were not allowed to associate with them, they were not allowed to come to your store to buy, they were not allowed to attend your schools, it was suddenly a war and that was it, so you couldn't argue with them, and say what happened to you, what happened to your father and so on, you couldn't, that was it, you did not know that they were moved to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="362">You later on heard j which meant concentration camp, , you heard that, but that was more or less like hearing about, if you don't behave, you're going to end up ina , you're going to end up in a labor camp, but definitely there was nothing known about gassing people, mass executions. </sentence><sentence id="363">was a word like, oh maybe an exaggeration would be if you don't behave, you're going to go to the electric chair, something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: It was used casually? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: It was used casually, yes, it was used casually. </sentence><sentence id="367">Nobody knew, when I say nobody I mean the masses didn't know that there were as many, and I'm talking now about the early 40's, as many as there were, and nobody knew what happened in them, because the ones that were inside, couldn't talk, so you knew that it was bad, mass killing, no you didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Help us understand this, at one point you're going to the friends house, that they have great bon bons, they have great toys and then there's a shift, you don't go to their houses any more and then there's another shift and maybe these kids aren't even here any more. </sentence><sentence id="371">So how did that unfold in your life? </sentence><sentence id="372">Perhaps there's a trend. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Well, I should have explained that one of my good friends for example, his name was Winter and they had an office supply store, and he was Jewish or half Jewish, I think he was half Jewish and it's not like all the Jews or half Jews disappeared like overnight, there was a gradual process. </sentence><sentence id="377">Don't forget some of them went to England or to other places, others said Hitler's not going to last, so we're going to stick it out. </sentence><sentence id="378">So they didn't quite disappear, but since they were not allowed to go to school, you ask me an interesting question, I don't know whether I asked myself consciously the question, where are they now, I think maybe I assumed that they went to other institutions, maybe to Jewish schools or something like that, So it is not as shocking as you think it was, it was kind of a gradual process and maybe I said I wonder where they are, but you kind of assumed that they went to another school or that they, maybe a greater assumption was that they probably went to, to America, to somewhere, but I mean it was not known that -- you see in 38 they were asked to leave, and many did. </sentence><sentence id="379">And so I think that many, I don't even know that I remember that, but I assume in 38 when that happened, I was 12 years old, that was just they're unwanted here and they're leaving, and that was about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Your friend, I don't know if you were going to tell a story about the friend? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Yeah, what surprised me, that he lasted as far as I know, throughout the war there, and we had a, I never met his parents, we had a Jewish boy, but I am talking now about 43 and he  played with us, his name was Brendon Brook(ph) and I discussed it when I was in Germany with a friend of mine, he said remember Brandon Brook(ph), I said yes, whatever happened to him, I don't know, but we knew he was Jewish, I don't know what happened to his parents, but he played with us and we used to hide them, hide him. </sentence><sentence id="387">He stayed three days with me, we put him in the basement, then he stayed with my friend. </sentence><sentence id="388">We didn't want anything to happen to him, because we liked him, we always, he was a buddy, understand? </sentence><sentence id="389">And whatever happened to him I don't know, because I was arrested, I was gone, so whatever happened to him, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: Did your parents know you were hiding him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: I don't know because my father was, I was pretty much independent at the time because my father was in France and my mother, she asked me questions, where you going tonight, oh you ask too many question, I'll be back soon or something like that was the answer you see, so I was pretty much I had my bike and I was gone. </sentence><sentence id="398">I lived more, more outside that in the house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: But there was a sense that this, your friend needed to be hidden, hidden from view? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="403">A: Oh, hidden from the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="404">Oh, there was no question about it, we knew, we knew that they were picked up and sent away and assumed, not only did we, it was not so much because he was Jewish, if we had been friends with Chinese, we would have done the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="405">It was kind of an entire authoritarian thing. </sentence><sentence id="406">We would not allow the police to pick him up, he's a good kid, so let's hide him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="411">Q: Do you have a first memory of being aware of the Nazi's in uniform, seeing the swastika? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: Yeah, I think I was maybe eight or nine years old, where I saw for the first time, brown shirts and I saw a man who was frequently drunk and would abuse his family and nobody liked him very much, he became somewhat of a lieutenant or something like that with the SA and the first remarks of my father, saying something like, we don't got the kind of pigs that they recruit, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="414">He was very negative towards them, simply because the SA and later SS, or the National Socialist Party, a party affiliation that sort of everything was Nazified, so to speak, you saw too many people who were not very qualified men, became suddenly leaders within that movement and that is what my father didn't like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: So the messages you were getting from your father were very skeptical of the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="422">Q: It seemed to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="424">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="425">But that doesn't mean that it had much influence on me, first of all I didn't agree with them and secondly I was tough enough to find out things for myself. </sentence><sentence id="426">But you must turn the  page a little bit and see the part that I enjoyed and that was, first I was the , the young people, 10 to 14, that was the evolution from Boy Scouts, to the Hitler youth, which was a small step, really, even the uniform looked somewhat alike and I had been in school in Switzerland for a year, and there was part of the Boy Scouts. </sentence><sentence id="427">So the Hitler youth was 10 to 14, because of the was 10 to 14 and the Hitler youths, the HJ, Hitler youth 14 through 18 and the same existed for , the young girls and the BDM, BDM. </sentence><sentence id="428">BDM means , the association of German girls, so you had the male and the female version, but that was like going to camp, that was like having fun, that was like not having to go to church, so that was a pleasant thing. </sentence><sentence id="429">I was a drummer in the , and you have to do a lot of marching, a lot of singing, a lot of playing. </sentence><sentence id="430">That did not have an ill effect. </sentence><sentence id="431">Hitler youth, well first of all, it was obligatory, secondly, I became pretty much a star swimmer and it used to be, to make an analogy, aquatic club of Washington competing against the aquatic group of New York. </sentence><sentence id="432">became , section six, Dusseldorf, competing with , section seven, Cologne and it went then from city to city and then terminated in the Youth Championship of the of Germany, okay? </sentence><sentence id="433">So you swam for the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="434">The Hitler youths were then divided like the armed forces to infantry, , Calvary, navy and as aswimmer of course hadto__ the navy and I was trained and had become an underwater demolition expert, or a frogman, okay, which was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="435">What I didn't like, maybe that would be in front of my father, it's hard to say when you become older, what made you tick and why did you do this and so on, but I was pretty much a king on the street. </sentence><sentence id="436">If something had to be done, like stealing apples or whatever, they would call me. </sentence><sentence id="437">And I saw guys that I considered sissies and weaklings, they suddenly got a star, they became lieutenant, and I had to salute them. </sentence><sentence id="438">Well I was not about to do anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="439">That brought about the first resentment, that's how it started all. </sentence><sentence id="440">And there were others who kind of felt the same way I did, that prompted me to start a little movement, which in reality, after the war, it was called a political movement, but at the , it was nothing but a gag. </sentence><sentence id="441">Not war and not love. </sentence><sentence id="442">We were much too young to have ideological conviction. </sentence><sentence id="443">We just didn't like these crummy guys whom we didn't see as young men, but sissies and no good for nothings and so on, that they became leaders and they told us what to do and they forced us to salute them. </sentence><sentence id="444">So they brought upon this entire sentiment and it seems everything we did was negative, we enjoyed it even more. </sentence><sentence id="445">We used to put condoms on their bicycles, on the little reflector. </sentence><sentence id="446">We used to deflate the bike, steal the saddle. </sentence><sentence id="447">We did everything that would be, that would bring them physically and mental harm of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="448">Then I think I went a little too far, so. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="545">Religion was totally unimportant in my family. </sentence><sentence id="546">The Meyers were not the church going family, much to the disappointment of my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="547">My father, well let me explain in Germany, you had to pay taxes, church taxes and so you have a little book, if you don't pay for September, then they write you a little note and if you still don't pay, then you cease to be a member, so it's very easy not to be a member any longer. </sentence><sentence id="548">My father decided that he did not like all the hocus pocus and he didn't, he was a little disappointed that the churches did not do enough or presented no resistance at all to what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="549">As a matter of fact they seemed to be very much in favor of it. </sentence><sentence id="550">So he quit paying and he became a former member. </sentence><sentence id="551">My mother hardly ever went to church, but not because she didn't believe in God, or she was not a Christian, but there was too much work to do at home. </sentence><sentence id="552">Took them ___ take care of the kids and so on, especially the way she worked. </sentence><sentence id="553">Why did I go to church, well, I became not only an altar boy, but I became a prayer. </sentence><sentence id="554">That means I had to read and then the whole people joined me, so that means they gave me acquisition of some category, became a star, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="555">That was quite a bit of attention, which suited me fine. </sentence><sentence id="556">Besides they had a ping pong table there in the parish house, and they always had cookies. </sentence><sentence id="557">So those were the attractive parts and at one time they had a priest whom I liked very much. </sentence><sentence id="558">He was a good man. </sentence><sentence id="559">But you, when you ask me questions, you have to also understand that I moved around a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="560">I was not always at the same school and the same environment. </sentence><sentence id="561">And when the environment changed, I even, believe it or not, sometimes thought of myself as not being a good boy. </sentence><sentence id="562">I thought maybe I should do a little something to get better grades, or getting better -- but my gypsy blood didn't permit me to do that for too long a period of time, but there were moments that I kind of recognized that my behavior was sickening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: What do you mean by that? </sentence><sentence id="583">What were you doing that was so bad? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: Well, maybe the question should be, what did you do that was good? </sentence><sentence id="587">I'll give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="588">When things didn't work too well, and there were eventually too many complaints from my mother, and my father was already gone, I was sent to a school in Munhan(ph). </sentence><sentence id="589">The school was in one part of the city and the dormitory was in a building of four or five story building and the upper part was the apartment of the director, he lived there with his family. </sentence><sentence id="590">I lived with a boy whose father was a physician. </sentence><sentence id="591">Well-to-do family, the boy always had a little money, so we got along fine, and the food we got there was quite poor, and yet you could smell, German houses don't have ventilation systems like you have in modern structures, so you generally know whether somebody is cooking a roast a block away. </sentence><sentence id="592">So the director ate rather well, and one day, it was before Easter, or, I think it was before Easter, or around Easter time, he and his family had a baking contest of some sort, I mean they cooked cookies forever and the smell penetrated the building. </sentence><sentence id="593">The director went out in the evening to some theater function, I said this is it, so I broke in and distributed the cookies throughout the  dormitory. </sentence><sentence id="594">Of course everybody was happy with me, but I knew that somebody would sing once they asked who did, somebody would say I did it, so I told my companion, my buddy, let's get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="595">I was on the third floor, so we put sheets together, it was about 10:30 in the evening, and climbed out of the window, on the street. </sentence><sentence id="596">And I asked him to give me a little money, he did and I said, well let's go. </sentence><sentence id="597">We put the sheets in the garbage can and then he stopped and said, I won't go, my father is going to kill me, no, no, no, so he went into the front door, to wait for the director to come and I took off and I joined then with a girl I had met and that's a little story I don't know whether you want to know about it, but I met her playing hit ball, which is kind of a baseball and we had eye contact and eventually I saw a little more of her and she came to every game and I tried to sneak out and talk to her a little more. </sentence><sentence id="598">Well, I went to her house, she had a little garden and I threw a little stone at her window, she came out and we went and checked into a hotel. </sentence><sentence id="599">I wanted her to go with me, just let's go and I knew that the police would come, the police would come to every hotel to check who was living there and so on and so we took two rooms. </sentence><sentence id="600">And the police came to my room, police, I said look, and I had told her what to say, look my cousin, we went to a party and we have to go, we have to leave early, why don't you let her sleep and so on, so they left her alone, but after that, she joined me and I took her home in the morning, I explained to her parents we'd been to a party, there was no telephone. </sentence><sentence id="601">Very few people had telephones. </sentence><sentence id="602">And they understood, they knew that she was a good girl. </sentence><sentence id="603">So I didn't have enough money to take the train, I thought well, since I was rather unusual I felt, well it would be a hell of a lot of fun to take a barge. </sentence><sentence id="604">I went down and convinced the captain to take me along, I did. </sentence><sentence id="605">So I went by barge down the Rhine River to Dusseldorf, which is most unusual, but it was quite an event and I first met with the guys, they were happy to see me again, I told them what happened and my father was in France already, so I remember my mother looking at me and saying, why are you so different? </sentence><sentence id="606">Why don't you give us nothing but problems? </sentence><sentence id="607">But I would find a way to say, but you love me, don't you, things like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="608">What is your father going to say? </sentence><sentence id="609">Oh, you don't have to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="610">So, mailmen had disappeared, they were in the army, so we had mailwomen and I had developed a little relationship with the mailwoman, who taught me a little about sex and I told her, any mail that comes for me, give it to me. </sentence><sentence id="611">A letter came from Elsie, that was the girl I had left and I read, I said oh my God, put the letter in my pocket, the letter said, I'm pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="612">So I didn't quite know what to do, she needed help, but my father had come to town that day or a day earlier and my mother thought it was time to change , So they took everything out of the pocket and there was the letter. </sentence><sentence id="613">So my father woke me up, did you sleep with the girl? </sentence><sentence id="614">Yes, sir. </sentence><sentence id="615">If you're old enough to sleep with a girl, you're old enough to become a father. </sentence><sentence id="616">And my mother, I see her go to pieces, Paul, he's not even 13, how can you say that? </sentence><sentence id="617">Well, I tried selling things, toys I had, things of value, sent to the girl, who had an abortion by some kind of alley doctor and it ran into complications, my father finally intervened and , but those are the things, so it's not only like I beat somebody up, or built a fire somewhere, I mean it was just one incident after another, so I can't blame my father too much, except that with love he would have done so much more. </sentence><sentence id="618">That means, what I'm trying to tell you is that there were different environments, so I'm now going back to the school, which I attended earlier, so something new had to be created, there was a new beginning again, you understand, and that was about the time of the Hitler youth, because the Hitler  youth returned. </sentence><sentence id="619">The Hitler youth, I believe in 41. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="655">Q: Did you want to join Hitler youth, or you knew you had to, did you say uck? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="657">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="658">There was absolutely no... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="661">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="663">A: Yeah, I was fine, yeah it was fine because there was nothing really negative. </sentence><sentence id="664">It meant you had to go to service, I think twice a week, generally on Sundays, and the, I have to tell you another thing about another school, generally on Sundays and it was instructional and that it, you learned the Morse alphabet, or you learned the flags, in the navy, you know, a, b, c, d, x and all. </sentence><sentence id="665">It was a pre-military thing, very physical education centric and then of course I wanted to swim and the only way you could swim was by being a member. </sentence><sentence id="666">Without being a member I couldn't even swim. </sentence><sentence id="667">So I was representing now, the Hitler youth of Dusseldorf. </sentence><sentence id="668">Even though I belonged to a swim club, the swim club went into the background and I swam for the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="669">But I was in , which meant I was about 11, I think and the truth is I don't know exactly where they were , but a new kind of school had called the Adolf Hitler school. </sentence><sentence id="670">I hate to make that kind of analogy, but it was about as select as the Air Force Academy, something of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="671">A one directional school, and I was chosen to go to the Adolf Hitler school, because I had, my intelligence level was really high, physically I was in top condition and no Jewish blood for at least five generations, so I was a top candidate. </sentence><sentence id="672">That was quite an honor. </sentence><sentence id="673">But before going to the Adolf Hitler school, I was sent, with a group of other candidates to a kind of pre-screening school, where there were certain tests, physical and mental tests. </sentence><sentence id="674">I was there for about a week. </sentence><sentence id="675">When my father heard about that, he said forget it, it's out, you're not going to any, that kind of school. </sentence><sentence id="676">And I hated him for it. </sentence><sentence id="677">And he explained then, with a very few words, saying things like today you won't understand, one day you will thank me for it. </sentence><sentence id="678">So I didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="679">But I was chosen for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="698">Q: Did you ever talk to him about why he didn't want you to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="700">A: No, it was the other way around, he told me, you now understand why I resented, yes I said, I do and I appreciate it. </sentence><sentence id="701">So he was in many ways very far-sighted and very, very realistic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="704">Q: You disappointed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="854">A: You were, oh I remember my mother, probably I was 10 years old when my mother was trained against gas attacks to wear a mask and all this, so in retrospect, it's rather interesting to realize that that happened that early already, but you didn't see it as a threat of war, you saw it more or less as a good exercise to be prepared if ever, you understand? </sentence><sentence id="855">I remember how I laughed as a kid when I saw her with the mask. </sentence><sentence id="856">It was kind of a brutal thing to look at. </sentence><sentence id="857">Well, you heard, as I told you before, over radio, newspaper and so on, that attacks were expected, aerial attacks had taken place and of course always would be the enemy had no respect for hospitals or schools or anything, they would gladly bomb, therefore you had to be prepared. </sentence><sentence id="858">Bunkers had been built, either above ground of solid concrete, or below ground, and the siren, when the siren up and down, that meant they're coming, one tone meant they've gone, then you could get out of the bunker, see? </sentence><sentence id="859">So you kind of prepared that and well the first attacks, maybe they were a little bit too far from you, so you didn't worry too much, but by 19, by the end of 42, the beginning of 43, a great part of Dusseldorf was pretty bombed and of course eventually was bombed about 75% of Dusseldorf was destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1071">Carafe? </sentence><sentence id="1072">Carafe, carafe with water, and then you had a bed that you would push up, that had to be made properly, there was an  inspection every day. </sentence><sentence id="1073">The floor was polished concrete. </sentence><sentence id="1074">There was a lamp that you could pull up or push it, pull down or push up, had a little, little lead balls in it, for weight. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And got up early and then there was lunch and dinner, mostly soup and bread. </sentence><sentence id="1076">First time I didn't quite know what to do so there was generally a guard with a privileged prisoner, would push the cart with the bowls of food, he would open, and then you have to stand there and donk, donk, give you the bread and then he would lock. </sentence><sentence id="1077">The first time, didn't know quite what to do, so I wasn't quite ready, so they locked the door again, I had missed lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1078">In the morning they opened the door and you would have to get your big bowl, your sanitary bowl so to speak, and walk down the row and empty it, rinse it out and then you were allowed to do your business so that was the time you were able to exchange some words with fellow prisoners, although there was always the guys that shut up, but what are you here for, what's new and, but that did not teach you much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1126">A: They didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1127">You had no communication with the guard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1130">Q: What was your understanding of why you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1132">A: Thad dealt with the enemy, with the French. </sentence><sentence id="1133">I was the head of the Edelweiss " and I had quote stolen shoes, which was even worse, I had, what do they call it, after disaster? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: Looted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: I had looted. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So I knew I was guilty, there was no question about it, I just didn't think that I deserved that much for so little. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1150">Q: Before we go into more detail about your time in prison, just want to return to the Edelweiss Pirates and ask you, what were you , what was the purpose of this group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1152">A: Oh, if you, well, forced to give you one word I would say anti-authority. </sentence><sentence id="1153">We are going into psychoanalysis here. </sentence><sentence id="1154">It may be because I hated authority of a, I really did not hate authority of a benevolent man, but authority was always, in my life, somehow related to something bad. </sentence><sentence id="1155">My father's authority meant beating me up, the principal authority, there was nothing positive about that, so the guys becoming leaders, telling me what to do, that was no good, so, anti-authority is probably the answer, coupled with lust for adventure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1160">Q: So it wasn't per se that you were anti Hitler, or anti what was going on with the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1162">A: I was much too young to understand that, however, after the war, there were a few members of course who were in my group, they were kind of glorified as the ones who resisted Hitler, but . </sentence><sentence id="1163">That's a wild story. </sentence><sentence id="1164">No, it wasn't that, but it was interpreted as such. </sentence><sentence id="1165">I mean if | wanted to glorify my life, I would probably say at a very tender age, I resisted and fought against Hitler, but that would be a lie, so I was nothing but, as I told you before, it's like a gang, and like gangs fear, kind of resent other gangs and resent the police and resent authority, that's what I did, I resented authority, because to me, authority was negative. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1170">Q: Well what , because some of the things you were doing were, in a positive way, part of Hitler's plan for young people, the swimming, maybe going to a special academy. </sentence><sentence id="1171">You wanted to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1174">A: True, true, I was a, let me be a little sarcastic, I was a fine German specimen, as expected by the leaders of the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I just took the everywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1178">Q: How did you feel about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1180">A: Oh, I guess I was kind of a little cocky and proud about it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1182">I was enormously healthy. </sentence><sentence id="1183">I was strong and I would make bets for 50 cents to pick somebody up with my teeth, just picking up his belt, picking up with my, I did all kinds of crazy . </sentence><sentence id="1184">Very strong, very tough, very healthy, very yeah, and not dumb, so that combination is rare to find. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1191">Q: I'm trying to place your family, your family, to get a sense of it, how any of the rest of </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1193"> , your father didn't respect the Nazis, and yet they sort of lived during the war, your father got some good jobs. </sentence><sentence id="1194">You did and you didn't and so I'm trying to get a sense of you being... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1195">A: I think that's a little difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1196">Q: , 1 don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1197">A: I think I should, I should say to you with all sincerity that there's nothing normal about my family. </sentence><sentence id="1198">My father a very unusual man in every sense of the word, who spent little time with me when I was a child because he didn't particularly care for me and when I was a youngster he was away. </sentence><sentence id="1199">My mother didn't fit in the picture, she was probably the most naive woman of the 20th century. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So we were quite unusual, and as my father was a self-made man, I definitely was self-made. </sentence><sentence id="1201">Even though I had a relatively good education, but life taught me much more and my traveling around the world, much more than my education in Germany, I was well prepared, like every high school, like every high school boy. </sentence><sentence id="1202">So it was my free spirit, my resentment of authority, resenting anybody who told me you have to, which prompt me to say why and that got me in trouble automatically. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I sometimes ask teachers why and that was almost like a sin, you were not supposed to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So I was the one who asked and looked for explanations for all kinds of things, but that does not mean that at the tender age of 14 or 15, I wanted to have a, if there is such a thing, a logical explanation to the existence of Hitler, or to the Jewish question, so no, that's, I would have been a genius. </sentence><sentence id="1205">That just would have been somewhat unnatural. </sentence><sentence id="1206">Would I ask, which I didn't understand why suddenly there was so much anti-Jewish feeling, then the explanation came, well because they have nothing to do but this and that, so they have taken over the university, they have taken over education, they are parasites, they are, they have white German girls, they have done this and this and that, and whether you believe all of that or not, but they're, it creates certain doubts, are they really bad? </sentence><sentence id="1207">And as you grew up in this atmosphere, you don't ask questions like is that really all true? </sentence><sentence id="1208">No, you accept it and it does not become a dispute within you as far as rationality is concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1221">Q: , was there some other group like yours in the city or in the country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1223">A: Well in the country, yes, I understand, I don't know this is true, but I think the Edelweiss Pirates, they began and some of the older ones actually had ideological ideas. </sentence><sentence id="1224">This is probably why some of the guys who met with me were later kind of glorified. </sentence><sentence id="1225">So they were Berlin, Berlin was some of the cradle of things. </sentence><sentence id="1226">But why do you join an, why do you join a gang? </sentence><sentence id="1227">Because you're bored, because you don't like what goes on, in terms of some weirdos becoming lieutenants and captains and so on, and you want to have a little fun. </sentence><sentence id="1228">You get the attention that you don't get at home. </sentence><sentence id="1229">That combination makes you do certain things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1238">Q: So you had, on one level, you were this perfect specimen, as you said, healthy, incredibly strong , perfect German , everything to be a perfect Nazi, on the other hand, you have this questioning spirit, so you didn't quite fit in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1240">A: That is correct and that's why I had to suffer. </sentence><sentence id="1241">You see, I have to tell myself now, that if I had behaved the way I was expected to behave, that I would have been killed in the navy, or I would have become an outstanding officer, and there's no question about that. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Of course that is all hypothetical, we don't know about that. </sentence><sentence id="1243">But even in the navy I would have had  problems, because I would have questioned the authority of my superior, unless he had treated me properly, in a justifiable way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1248">Q: Did it ever occur to you that you might have been asked to some way be involved in </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1250"> ofJews  _? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1251">A: Ihave because it was not a navy thing to do, but killing, I have asked myself the question, I don't know the answer to that. </sentence><sentence id="1252">I wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="1253">I had to kill a few times in my life, but self defense or whatever the circumstances were. </sentence><sentence id="1254">At the time, at the age of 17, if I had been asked to kill, would I have, would I have asked questions why, I don't know that. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I do not know that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1261">Q: Let's go back to the point you were in prison, where we were about 10 minutes ago. </sentence><sentence id="1262">You've been in prison for a few days now. </sentence><sentence id="1263">getting used to it, are you able to have any contact with the " </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1267">A: Oh no, I never get used to it. </sentence><sentence id="1268">I think it was the third day or the fourth day when a guard came and he was from my part of town. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And I assume that he disliked the fact that a member of his district of town embarrassed him in a certain way, so he came, opened the door, and I stood there, with my ceramic pot, he said, aha you, he said something like you are the embarrassment of the town. </sentence><sentence id="1270">Shame on you and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1271">He said empty the pot in your cell. </sentence><sentence id="1272">When I come back I want this clean. </sentence><sentence id="1273">There was a little piece of, of course I had the water, a little piece of cloth, and I had to clean the cell. </sentence><sentence id="1274">It was my first devastating experience so to speak after I'd been beaten up before. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Then I had a neighbor, I mean in the next cell, he was from morning to evening, , 1 can still here it, that makes F , his voice was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And one of the prisoners told me that he was taken away after they had found him eating his own feces. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Whether he was a superb actor or he was insane, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1278">But as I told you before, I was going to escape somehow and putting two by two together, I said well if I get sick, they have to take me to the hospital and from the hospital I escape. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Not knowing that hospitals have certain rooms with bars for prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Anyway, said how am I going to get sick? </sentence><sentence id="1281">Well, I swallowed all of the lead pebbles in the lamp, but just as I swallowed them, they came out the other end. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Then I found some rusty nails. </sentence><sentence id="1283">It was rather difficult to swallow them, but I did. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And they came out without destroying any of my interior and finally I took a piece of the ceramic pot, from the edge, it was like a . </sentence><sentence id="1285">That didn't do any harm either. </sentence><sentence id="1286">I forgot, as part of the furniture, I had a little stool and that was probably the most difficult thing I ever did in my life in terms of concentration. </sentence><sentence id="1287">I was going to fall on my head and just pass out, because I couldn't stand it any more. </sentence><sentence id="1288">But every time I fell down, a kind of self-preservation, I put my hands up, until eventually, click. </sentence><sentence id="1289">I don't know how long I had passed out, but I had blood all over my face. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And life went on and nobody knew that it ever had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1291">Then I said okay, I'm not going to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1292">So I did not eat, I only drank water for 12 days and after 12 days, well we had, we had walking outside on the courtyard, you know, five meter distance between each prisoner, walk around. </sentence><sentence id="1293">I fell, I passed out. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Well rather than take me to the nursery or something, I was whipped half to death because it was evident that I had not  eaten, that I purposely wanted to get sick, that was a no no. </sentence><sentence id="1295">So then I kind of gave up and said, well it won't work I have to wait for better opportunities. </sentence><sentence id="1296">On April the 12th, April the 12th, 1943, I was taken to court. </sentence><sentence id="1297">My trial, the state attorney I think they call it here, district attorney, state attorney, asked for the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="1298">My thought is, first time I saw my father and my mother, my mother couldn't control herself, so she was crying, and my father didn't quite know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1299">There were two attorneys, when he recommended the death penalty, I know they kind of jumped over and hugged my arm and said, that's not the last word. </sentence><sentence id="1300">Then kind of the judge and the state attorney and somebody else, some functionary, they kind of argued about whether it was looting, or whether it was theft. </sentence><sentence id="1301">The idea was that the two had different consequences. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And so they retired and when we came back, the judge decided, or had decided that it was, well before they'd had an argument and the state attorney that, I would call it theft, but this man, having had intimate contact with our enemy, and being the leader of the Edelweiss , having destroyed state goods, and state property, does not deserve any kind of consideration. </sentence><sentence id="1303">So when the judge came back and said, on the grounds of his outstanding involvement in athletism, and considering age and circumstances, I condemn you to one to four years in prison. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Let me explain, they said, with good conduct after one year, you may be relieved and join the armed forces, and if not, you will remain. </sentence><sentence id="1305">That was it, and maybe a week later I was put in, what in prison slang is called, I was put on transport. </sentence><sentence id="1306">So I was taken to the railroad station, we took a train, and at that time, I don't know how it is today, at that time, if you go let's say from Washington to California, you would not go non-stop, you would maybe go from Washington to maybe North Carolina and stay there a couple of days, three days in a prison and then join other prisoners and form another group that goes and you eventually come to California. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So, first I went to Cologne, the prison. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And there I was exposed to, it was a dirty prison, to bedbugs and lice and fleas and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And we all were set to move in the afternoon, all of us, the one side of the prison had to move to the other side, because we could look into the courtyard and they used to chop heads, so they had executions in the courtyard, if you hear ding, ding, the little bell, so we weren't allowed to witness that, so we had to go the other side. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1355">Q: Who would it be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1357">A: Well, whoever was condemned to death, but instead of electric chair they had beheading, which is really not an axe like so many people believe, but is an extremely sharp instrument that just go kind of straight through. </sentence><sentence id="1358">So, from Cologne, I went to , that took two or three days. </sentence><sentence id="1359">From there to Frankfurt, from Frankfurt I was accompanied to where a few of the group, was a kind of security prison for harsh criminals, I was condemned to one to three years in , which was a youth place, or juvenile institution. </sentence><sentence id="1360">So left the handcuffs, harsh criminals and then I had one guard who went with me. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I went and I looked at him for a few 1 said this is my chance, but he could read me, he said, don't do anything foolish. </sentence><sentence id="1362">It's not that bad, this is better than being on the Russian front, so just behave and you'll get out. </sentence><sentence id="1363">So, I was always receptive to a kind word. </sentence><sentence id="1364">So I said I'm not going to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1365">I think he said something like, you don't want me to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="1366">So he took me to the prison, which is not too far from Frankfurt and it sounds a little funny when I say it's a beautiful  prison, but it actually is. </sentence><sentence id="1367">The front part, the administration building was once a convent. </sentence><sentence id="1368">It had walls about three feet wide. </sentence><sentence id="1369">And then from there you go this never-ending walk and then comes the prison. </sentence><sentence id="1370">Of course most prisons are, there's a cross or there's a star so that from the center you can see all over. </sentence><sentence id="1371">And well, like in most prisons you receive your uniform and then you are to go to a cell, and we had, three times a week we had school, which was limited pretty much to German history and geography, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1372">It was very limited to the new Germany, so we talk about nation. </sentence><sentence id="1373">There was more indoctrination there than anywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And I assumed that they found out that I was probably at the intelligence level, more educated than any of the others, so I got a job as assistant to the buyer. </sentence><sentence id="1375">We bought groceries and sent to the kitchen, the kitchen was underway, it was a separate building on the way from the administration building to the prison proper. </sentence><sentence id="1376">And I assure you that if I had been a good boy, I would have laughed at the war, I probably would have gained 100 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And the old guard, you know to me at the time, anything that was over 50 was pretty old, like my grandfather was an antique, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And anyway, he was so kind, so good, that I, I was not about to escape from him, because life was a little too good. </sentence><sentence id="1379">But in one day, I had to do, I don't remember what, I had to do something, and the old convent building on one side and I remember, and I discovered in one of the windows, there were three bars. </sentence><sentence id="1380">Thick. </sentence><sentence id="1381">You know, octagonal, they have eight corners or six comers, whatever, these bars, and one was loose. </sentence><sentence id="1382">That was just too much temptation. </sentence><sentence id="1383">My father was coming to visit and I wrote a little note. </sentence><sentence id="1384">I will be at such and such a time at that window, please pick me up and I thought he's going to take me in a car to France and I'm going to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I put it in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1386">I think I needed a key or something and the note fell out of my pocket and the guard saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1387">I never got to see my father. </sentence><sentence id="1388">I was taken to the warden, whom I called the spider because he looked like a spider. </sentence><sentence id="1389">This immense room and I had to enter a circle, stand there. </sentence><sentence id="1390">He had a big nose and his gold rimmed glasses sitting on his nose, said, well, well, mistake, mistake, mistake. </sentence><sentence id="1391">I thought you were kind of a prisoner sample, an inspiration, and I thought this is probably one I will release soon, but I don't think you appreciate the treatment we gave you, so I have no choice, take him away. </sentence><sentence id="1392">Four weeks in the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="1393">That means, actually 28 days. </sentence><sentence id="1394">28 days in a cell without light, without a bed, 200 grams of bread, that makes two slices of bread a day and water. </sentence><sentence id="1395">And that was a little too much. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I don't know if it was then, no it was the next time. </sentence><sentence id="1397">Anyway, 28 went by and one day a guard brought me bread and hit me in the face and I never knew why. </sentence><sentence id="1398">You have so much time to think and you become so desperate, you want to be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1399">When they released me the guard said, okay, took a shower, I said, oh God, I want a hot shower. </sentence><sentence id="1400">He turned the cold water on, thought I was going to die. </sentence><sentence id="1401">Oh. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And of course he hears those remarks, and it'll bring senses back to you. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Back to the cell. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And then nobody treats you as if you have been on a very special diet for four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Life goes on, you have to work, and when you exercise, everybody starts picking on you then, because you are an outcast. </sentence><sentence id="1406">Okay, 50 pushups. </sentence><sentence id="1407">Count. </sentence><sentence id="1408">You reach 30. </sentence><sentence id="1409">But you made a mistake, start again. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Then finally you just fall down and, get up, you're kicked and kicked again, until finally you try again. </sentence><sentence id="1411">Well, that went on for awhile, seemed like I had lost a considerable amount of weight, I said I just can't, I can't, I can't. </sentence><sentence id="1412">So from where I walked I could see that there was a pole to pull up the cable over the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1413">It was a little foggy, kind of bad weather, I tried to stay behind, everybody went in and I ran, and up the pole, there were two cables and I ran. </sentence><sentence id="1414">One of  guards saw me and shot me in

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1593">Q: You said that you were a Jew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1595">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1596">Just because I didn't want a lengthy conversation, I said if] tell him I'm Jewish, he's going to leave me alone. </sentence><sentence id="1597">So I went to Berlin, I had to change a train in Berlin and there were only five of us, and one was kind of, well we ended up being three only, eventually, and one, one prisoners made kind of serious , do you remember Einstein? </sentence><sentence id="1598">We were like the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost and we will all die and things like that and oh, quit this bullshit, we will live. </sentence><sentence id="1599">Got to Sachsenhausen and stayed there overnight, so I never went to the Sachsenhausen camp, I went to a barrack, and somebody told me that I was going to, up ina youth , and whether there was confusion, whether there was misunderstanding, I do not know, but in 1941, Ravensbruck became the most notorious women's camp, where they committed all these atrocities, these medical experiments and so on and when people hear that I was in Ravensbruck they say but you're not a woman, well in 1941, a satellite man's camp, Sachsenhausen, a satellite man's camp, Ravensbruck for men was installed, installed in 41. </sentence><sentence id="1600">It had I think, all together a little over 20,000 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1601">Anyway the next day I think I went to the, with the , we were three, and taken from Sachsenhausen to , that is really a short distance, then from you can walk, Ravenbruck is next door. </sentence><sentence id="1602">And I didn't quite understand why they didn't make us walk the short distance, they drove us, I assume because they didn't want us to happen to see much of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1603">Anyway we went to the camp, left in Ravensbruck and then I was a little confused because there was a lot of hocus pocus going on, a train had arrived, trucks arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Lot of movement and the Jew was picked up and immediately moved to the left, so I never saw him again, and the other one, there was an SS soldier, I was standing by, I didn't quite understand what, but he asked him something. </sentence><sentence id="1605">The guy gave an answer that offended the SS soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1606">He shot him right there and said to his comrade, he's too old to work anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1607">Not even worth a bullet, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1608">I said, oh my God. </sentence><sentence id="1609">Thought for a  moment. </sentence><sentence id="1610">His family, will they ever know how he died? </sentence><sentence id="1611">So then I was deloused and when I bath, when I was in there, was for the first time in a long time I saw there was a woman prisoner who took care and gave me clothes and allowed us to take a shower. </sentence><sentence id="1612">It kind of embarrassed me and I was more embarrassed to blush. </sentence><sentence id="1613">Then I was taken to an , that's one of those guards in charge, and I met the first couple, and I was told which barrack I would go to and you will be part of a commando, you'll do outside work and really there were many satellite camps all around because of all kinds of companies had established factories so prisoners would work, and concentration camps made money with the prisoners, the prisoners weren't paid, but the companies paid the concentration camps, so they had an income. </sentence><sentence id="1614">And I wasn't too long, I don't remember how many, but there were three beds, three beds, three beds, one __ the other and I learned eventually that you could buy things in the canteen if you had money and I learned that when one says, do you have any money, do you have any money, the other prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1615">I didn't have any money, why do you need money, oh, can buy things. </sentence><sentence id="1616">Somehow I was accompanied by the notice that I was a possible SKP, that was probably part of the dossier that accompanied me from the prison. </sentence><sentence id="1617">SKP? </sentence><sentence id="1618">One who likes to escape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1645">Q: SKP, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1647">A: Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1648">And so I was a dangerous one, for watching, so to tell the other guards about me, they had left a crown, like a mark, what's it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1651">Q: ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1653">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1654">I don't know how long they , probably a week there or two. </sentence><sentence id="1655">I was called, well we had a pill every day, which means the big square, you see, dance, dance. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Administration building, and barracks and then in the middle, see and the ones that we had built, there was, we had masonry walls and there was a section where the masonry were held in front with barbed wire, and it was loaded with electricity and I remember one guard, obviously didn't like one of the prisoners, took his head, we wore square hats, threw it away to the fence, or in the fence , go and pick it up and the prisoner refused. </sentence><sentence id="1657">I told you pick it up and he whipped him and by that time we drove off, so I don't know whether he ever went to pick it up, of course that would mean electrocution, or not. </sentence><sentence id="1658">There was one guard who was very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="1659">But I was old enough to appreciate he was gay. </sentence><sentence id="1660">Tried to stay away from him. </sentence><sentence id="1661">So when I heard there was a possibility to go to a satellite camp to work in a quarry, there I went. </sentence><sentence id="1662">So I went to a quarry, which was quite far away so we came only once a week to the main camp, change clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1663">Some to receive mail. </sentence><sentence id="1664">I wasn't because my parents didn't know where I was. </sentence><sentence id="1665">And also if you wanted to see the lager doctor, you had the choice. </sentence><sentence id="1666">Very few people did that because the rumor went if you're sick, they're going to liquidate you, so you didn't want to go to the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1667">On one of my trips I was asked to stay because another prisoner was ill and I was destined to clean the clinic, and I had met the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And he was not the mean SOB, he was kind of, oh I don't know whether pleasant is the word, but he was not a sadistic idiot. </sentence><sentence id="1669">So I had made his acquaintance. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And back to the camp, to the quarry, which was divided, there was a mill. </sentence><sentence id="1671">I never knew what  they did with the rocks, but the different layers, the Russian prisoners were at the bottom, the French prisoners and we were on top and what you had, you had rails going up and on top of the privileged character, I had this big, big handle that would bring the lorries, a lorry's a flat bed, these had sides on them, get them down to the mill, and pump, and empty one up and he would pick it up and then go the rail and there you had your little areas, whatever area was destined. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I had one prisoner who showed me how to cut a vein, because it's not, you can't be all day long, you have to fill 12 cars a day, that was the 5 means quota. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And boy after a few days, my hand, oh my God, it was raw meat, it was huge, and after that of course if you have time and effort become like leather. </sentence><sentence id="1674">There were two outhouses. </sentence><sentence id="1675">The outhouses had no sides so the guards could see you. </sentence><sentence id="1676">The beginning there was two guards, but towards the end of "44, the younger guards disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1677">There were older ones and one was an invalid, no dogs, everything was a little lax. </sentence><sentence id="1678">If you didn't have 12, you would get no food, so everybody worked like a little bee. </sentence><sentence id="1679">And I remember once picking up a big rock, I remember years, years, years, years later I worked picking up some rocks, I lived on a rock that was big. </sentence><sentence id="1680">I all the way down to the lake to pick up some rocks and people asked me, where'd you learn all about these rocks? </sentence><sentence id="1681">I said you wouldn't believe me. </sentence><sentence id="1682">So I know a lot about rocks, but anyway, five o'clock whistle blew and marched, marched down, there was a little camp where we slept, we were all passed out. </sentence><sentence id="1683">One thing I remember was one of the most disgusting experiences of my life, we had what we called the thunder beam, a long pole, it was lying over two barrels, it had to open the traps where we sat down to do our business one after the other, and then when it was full, you know they would and open another trench actually, like a simplified outhouse. </sentence><sentence id="1684">One of the guards had a prisoner cut the pole in half, so then when you sit on, of course it gave way with all the weight that we all __in. </sentence><sentence id="1685">There is no manure that is as bad as human manure. </sentence><sentence id="1686">Kitty cats are not as bad as human. </sentence><sentence id="1687">So that was horrible and then of course you came out of it, so they give you 10 minutes to clean up and the ones who didn't come out right again, he sent them back in, oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Anyway I worked there until January of "45, and one day I went to the camp to change clothes, I went to the public rest room. </sentence><sentence id="1689">I sat there in the normal position and I hear tick, tick, tick, tick. </sentence><sentence id="1690">Blood. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Blood came out of my mouth and my nose. </sentence><sentence id="1692">I said that's weird, huh? </sentence><sentence id="1693">I didn't get hurt or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1694">But I lost so much blood that when I got up I passed out, and this guard, he part of a little stove. </sentence><sentence id="1695">So, the other prisoners kind of liked me, I was the youngest and one cleaned me up and cleaned my uniform so that nobody would get mad at me and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1696">I began to hurt. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Like needles stuck in my lungs and I told, I had a friend, a Russian prisoner, Ivan, I don't know whether that was his real name, but they called himIvan___. </sentence><sentence id="1698">But don't ask for the doctor, it'll be your end. </sentence><sentence id="1699">Nobody has come back after they've seen the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1700">But I had to know and I just couldn't stand it and so I asked for . </sentence><sentence id="1701">Thad to see the doctor, the doctor for whom I'd cleaned before and I remember his name was Herr Mann(ph) and I said, this is what happened and I've been ____, 1 feel good and I can work and I just want to know, where's all the blood coming from and tapped my shoulders a little bit and looked at me and said, you have tuberculosis, you can't work, oh yes I can, oh yes I can, I can work, yes, oh please let me work, please let me work. </sentence><sentence id="1702">You want to work? </sentence><sentence id="1703">Yes I want to work. </sentence><sentence id="1704">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1705">So he signed and I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And there was pain, there was pain and there was pain. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And I said I'm going to get out of here, because I'm dying. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And I planned and I looked around and I said, there's just no way, but I'm  going to die. </sentence><sentence id="1709">Days passed, in a few days I thought this is it, I'm going to die, spitting blood, pain, could hardly work. </sentence><sentence id="1710">I came to the point, which is very interesting, when you're hungry you fight, you'll kill for bread. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Then comes a time where your body doesn't demand any more, you give it away. </sentence><sentence id="1712">That's when you're ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I gave away bread. </sentence><sentence id="1714">But there was this of my, my body couldn't do it any more, but the spirit was still going strong. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So one day the whistle blew and we went up. </sentence><sentence id="1716">It was the foggiest day ever. </sentence><sentence id="1717">Dogs had disappeared and you can hardly see, I mean it was not quite as dense at the upper levels. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1798">A: I knew I was dying and I didn't want to die there. </sentence><sentence id="1799">I said, I have to try to get out of here and if I get shot, well that's better than dying here. </sentence><sentence id="1800">So, looked like all the gods and all the angels looked at me and brought dense fog and to test the climate I asked the guard to excuse me, I had to go to the outhouse. </sentence><sentence id="1801">He kind of waved like, I don't care, this kind of attitude, as I said, everything was a little lax. </sentence><sentence id="1802">See, it was total fog, so I went back to work and maybe a couple of hours later, maybe three hours later, maybe enough time has spend and I asked the guard again, and he waved me along, and I looked and I couldn't see anything and in a moment of desperation, concentration, whatever, I ran. </sentence><sentence id="1803">And, of course in retrospect you think you ran 50,000 miles, but I didn't run really far because I didn't have the stamina to run. </sentence><sentence id="1804">I was coughing, but when I stopped I realized that as crazy as I was I had almost run in a circle, so I almost came back where I had started, so that gave me a certain impulse to run again. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And I ran, mostly downhill, until I saw a, well farmers have these, look like giant carports kind of, where they store hay or straw to keep it from getting wet, so I saw that, I tried to make it and </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1806"> I kind of covered myself with the last of straw and the next thing I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1807"> remember is somebody shaking me. </sentence><sentence id="1808">I was terrified, I looked into the eyes of the farmer and before I could say anything he said, don't be afraid, I know where you come from, I'm going to help you. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Well you have these mixed emotions, is he actually going to take you now to the police and he just wants you to keep quiet, does he really mean it. </sentence><sentence id="1810">But you don't have the power any more, you don't have the energy to fight so you just say oh, what the hell. </sentence><sentence id="1811">So he had two horses. </sentence><sentence id="1812">He covered me in the wagon and drove me to his modest stone little ranch house, from the stalls on one side. </sentence><sentence id="1813">He told me that he had lost his son in Stalingrad. </sentence><sentence id="1814">He was a little apologetic, because things didn't look too neat, but his wife had left already, she had evacuated because they heard the Russians were coming and that the Russians had nothing to do but rape, and that he was going to leave also in a week or two, and he, I think he did to me what he would have done for his son. </sentence><sentence id="1815">He bathed me, he put me to bed and he looked at me, I remember he asked me, how old are you?

</sentence><sentence id="1870">Because she didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="1871">And then she called the neighbors to help. </sentence><sentence id="1872">And the lady who lived above us came and she touched my legs. </sentence><sentence id="1873">I screamed, and they carried me up. </sentence><sentence id="1874">Somebody on the train had given me an apple and I had a little diarrhea, said take me to the bathroom, and then the bell rang three times. </sentence><sentence id="1875">That meant my father and my mother yelled, Walter is here. </sentence><sentence id="1876">He jumped up the steps and he looked at me, and he never stopped crying. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And they took me to the basement, because Dusseldorf was still under artillery fire, the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="1878">I think three or four, five days later, my father had been successful in getting a doctor to see me and the doctor made it clear that there was no hope. </sentence><sentence id="1879">So I don't know whose idea it was, the doctor says, I call a priest. </sentence><sentence id="1880">I received the last rites. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Maybe a day or two days later the police came. </sentence><sentence id="1882">Two police officers, one knew me, because I had made a name as a swimmer, come to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1883">We're looking for Walter Meyer. </sentence><sentence id="1884">My father said he's here, would you like to see him?He took the sheets off my body. </sentence><sentence id="1885">You want to take him like this? </sentence><sentence id="1886">And they left without saying a word. </sentence><sentence id="1887">Then a couple of weeks later, Americans marched in. </sentence><sentence id="1888">My father went to see the commandant, whomever, explained the situation. </sentence><sentence id="1889">But before that, before that I knew I was dying, I called my mother and said, come be with me, I'm leaving now. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And I really went through the experience of death. </sentence><sentence id="1891">It was rather beautiful, rather peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="1892">And then suddenly I had to vomit. </sentence><sentence id="1893">Vomit blood like from here to the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1894">Later on the doctor told me that this was a very good sign. </sentence><sentence id="1895">What it meant medically I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And then after that, it was like my body was on fire, and I had to drink gallons. </sentence><sentence id="1897">My mother had a flower vase that she filled. </sentence><sentence id="1898">The Americans took me to the German hospital occupied by a medical company and the head of the medical company was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1899">I think he didn't like anything German, which was understandable. </sentence><sentence id="1900">But after awhile the doctor came and, Wally, you have to get up today, you can't go on. </sentence><sentence id="1901">I gained about almost two pounds a day, looked like a balloon, I looked sick, abnormal. </sentence><sentence id="1902">Said your heart is not going to support all this weight. </sentence><sentence id="1903">The first time I was weighed, I weighed 76 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="1904">and so I had to get up, which believe me, was a nightmare,  and I had to jump on one foot 13 times and then the other foot and he encouraged, see, come on, good boy and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1905">Well, with the GI's, actually they drove me on a wheelchair and I used to do sketches, portraits of the GI's, I learned quite a bit of English. </sentence><sentence id="1906">I think the greatest shock was respect to you, one of the guys referred to the major, the medical, he's a Jew, he's a fucking Jew, he's no good. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And to digest that was very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I mean in retrospect I understand, I understand the world pretty well, but at the time, it was, it was, it was confused the hell out of me. </sentence><sentence id="1909">But it was shortly thereafter I received my credentials, I think I have a copy here. </sentence><sentence id="1910">It was from the, I have it somewhere, from the union , from the Union of Former Political Concentration Camp Prisoners, and political prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1911">This was to give me a seat in railroads and so on, because of TB. </sentence><sentence id="1912">This was later, from the French police, when they ask I said that I'm a Francophile who has paid for his sympathy to the French prisoners with time in a concentration camp and so on . </sentence><sentence id="1913">So the first doctor, German doctor I saw, which was the 24th of September in 1946, he said that on the 10th of April 1944, he was 174 centimeters tall and at that time he weighed 42.8 kilos, so that was under 100 I already gained, and with fever and so on and so forth he had contracted tuberculosis in a concentration camp of Ravensbruck and this is made for the military authorities because at the time my father wanted, the idea was TB, you had to go to the mountain air, they wanted to send me to Switzerland, to , which was a special hospital for TB patients. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2011">Q: When you tell this story about what's happening, it's hard to make it jive with the fact that you were a star athlete, perfect German heritage, I mean it sounds like at that point in the country, the Germans were not just persecuting Jews, but really anyone that had gotten in the way, or perceived to be in their way. </sentence><sentence id="2012">What were your thoughts on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2015">A: Almost, almost automatically, when people ask me, how long have you been in the states, oh you were , were you in the army? </sentence><sentence id="2016">No. </sentence><sentence id="2017">What'd you do? </sentence><sentence id="2018">Well, I don't volunteer all kinds of information, so I said, well actually I was a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2019">Oh, what a Russian prisoner?No, a German prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2020">Well that of course is a little shocking, I was in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Oh, are you Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="2022">That's the first thing. </sentence><sentence id="2023">Very few people know the concentrations were full of non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2024">That is not to say the majority, but yeah, quite a few, anybody who was not in agreement, or presented some sort of an obstacle to the Third Reich was put away. </sentence><sentence id="2025">Either put away for good or put away in a concentration camp, or another camp of some sort, so I was one of those, so I was, I had fallen in disgrace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2038">Q: Were there times when it was happening to you that it surprised you? </sentence><sentence id="2039">That you were being treated like that? ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2042">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="2043">No, not really, maybe what, you see, the questions always implied that one preserved this rational thinking and that rational thinking goes away pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="2044">You have all kinds of weird thoughts and you become mentally and physically a kind of wet rag, so to speak, you don't function well any more, you don't ask certain questions, in some instances you don't care any more, so you just go along and like a little robot. </sentence><sentence id="2045">So these rational questions, you may ask them in retrospect, but not so much at the time, and you look left and  right, you see people being creative, I know some prisoners who were chewing bread and let the bread dry and made little chess figures because they were more eager in playing chess than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="2046">There were others who would denounce anything in order to get a little reward from the SS or from the , so they would sell, probably even sell their own mothers for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2047">You have all kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="2048">And we arrive in a concentration camp , so things don't change much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2056">Q: The story you tell about the farmer looking at you and asking your age and saying, how could they have done this? </sentence><sentence id="2057">How do you make sense of that? </sentence><sentence id="2058">How the people who shot people in front of you, who kept sending you back to solitary confinement, how do you make sense of how they could have done that to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2062">A: I don't know whether I can makes sense out of it, but I have been in many places and I see that people kill each other like flies, in Ireland in 1996. </sentence><sentence id="2063">People put bombs there, people put bombs on airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="2064">Half a million people died in Rwanda, others are going to die maybe in Burundi, so have things changed? </sentence><sentence id="2065">No they have not. </sentence><sentence id="2066">Is there any country that can say we have never done anything wrong? </sentence><sentence id="2067">No. </sentence><sentence id="2068">I think the Germans are the only ones who did it in the most systematic way. </sentence><sentence id="2069">Others have done it in a more, I mean, the Spaniards have killed probably six million Indians and brought all kinds of diseases over here. </sentence><sentence id="2070">The Americans killed all the Bison so Indians didn't have anything to eat and force marched them all the way to Florida from Oklahoma and so on, so forth, not to speak about the Negroes. </sentence><sentence id="2071">And it's a disgusting chapter in the history. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Look at the French with the, look at the British, first concentration camps in South Africa. </sentence><sentence id="2073">So I don't know what happens in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2074">So if 1 were to accuse, I would accuse humanity, but I wouldn't pick one in particular. </sentence><sentence id="2075">There are people who think that Germans were born to be sadistic, that's not true at all. </sentence><sentence id="2076">They're good ones. </sentence><sentence id="2077">What has happened is a, I think I would be more interested in looking at those who could have prevented and didn't and one of those is these United States of America. </sentence><sentence id="2078">I look at Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="2079">I look at Switzerland, who made billions and billions of dollars taking advantage of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="2080">Turning Jews back after they had successfully escaped. </sentence><sentence id="2081">Shiploads of Jews who tried to come to America, the chosen land, and were rejected. </sentence><sentence id="2082">Those are a little more interesting to me. </sentence><sentence id="2083">I know what happened, I was there. </sentence><sentence id="2084">Could it happen anywhere else? </sentence><sentence id="2085">Yes it could. </sentence><sentence id="2086">There is the part that is sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2087">That is the part that is tough to understand how humans become such atrocious beasts. </sentence><sentence id="2088">That is tough to digest, to understand. </sentence><sentence id="2089">No, it's not that hard to understand, but to understand the German question, like that, you have to go almost into the history before Christ and definitely bring in the church and definitely bring in whatever that contribute to factors. </sentence><sentence id="2090">Treaty of Versailles, anti-Jewish sentiment at different times in the world, not only in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2091">How one can do certain things. </sentence><sentence id="2092">How can a man rape an innocent girl? </sentence><sentence id="2093">The simple answer is you have to be sick, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2094">Unfortunately a lot of it's probably like when you go to high school, if you say one day, hey guys, why don't we get together this weekend and help some elderly people in a rest home? </sentence><sentence id="2095">Nobody shows up. </sentence><sentence id="2096">But if you say hey I got a little grass, let's smoke some joint and raise some hell, and screw some girls. </sentence><sentence id="2097">So the negative seems to be more attractive to people, especially those who don't have a very healthy foundation, and so there is no way in the world I can excuse, I cannot justify. </sentence><sentence id="2098">Can I understand? </sentence><sentence id="2099">Yeah, I can understand. </sentence><sentence id="2100">I really resent the fact that I can understand. </sentence><sentence id="2101">I  wish I couldn't, but I can. </sentence><sentence id="2102">The first time, after I left Germany, in a cargo train, so here I am escaping again. </sentence><sentence id="2103">After seven years I returned to Germany and I had prepared how to go back and kill the spider. </sentence><sentence id="2104">I remembered him more than any SS guard, especially the Lithuanian SS guards who were the most sadistic ones. </sentence><sentence id="2105">No, the spider, the spider was on my mind day and night. </sentence><sentence id="2106">I had a gun and I went to the village in which he lived, the village was right next to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="2107">And I kind of had rehearsed with myself, nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="2108">I said, do you remember me? </sentence><sentence id="2109">I'm the one who stood in the circle four or five times, I'm the one you let suffer. </sentence><sentence id="2110">I'm the one this and this, you remember me now, does it come back to your senses?Then I would have killed him. </sentence><sentence id="2111">I went to the house. </sentence><sentence id="2112">The lady came to the door and I said I would like to speak to Dr. , that was his name. </sentence><sentence id="2113">Oh, I'm sorry, but he moved about a month ago, he went to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="2114">Well, I didn't go after him in Hamburg because after that came the moment of reconsideration. </sentence><sentence id="2115">What do I do, what do I do by killing him, what do I establish in that, so then you kind of put it behind. </sentence><sentence id="2116">But that was, that was a moment I will always remember, I went to the door and I hoped I would see him. </sentence><sentence id="2117">God, I hated him. </sentence><sentence id="2118">Because you just don't have a right to make a human or an animal suffer to that point. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Unfortunately there are people who derive pleasure from doing that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2183">A: Getting a power trip. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2185">Q: I think what I'll do is , but before I ask you this, we just don't have the time to go into the post war experience , so I don't think I'll really move into that, so instead of doing it separately, we do want to in on the picture and maybe piece of paper you showed us. </sentence><sentence id="2186">because that's going to take a little time , So before I do that, just in this section we hear something, is there anything that might have to your mind in the last couple hours that you thought, well I'll have to make sure I tell, tell that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2189">A: Oh well, there are so many little episodes, but it's not really enjoyable to talk about them. </sentence><sentence id="2190">It's a little tough so I think, but I told you enough really and I was asked before I gave the interview to bring pictures and I'm very sorry to say that the only picture I could find is a picture of me when I was 15 and you see me in the uniform of the Hitler youth and that was I at 15 and I know that this is true, because my mother wrote on the back this is Walter and the picture was taken by my brother Paul in the spring of 1941, so this is two years before I became a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2191">I think the certificates have very little value, I just brought them along. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2195">Q: Do you that closer or just ? </sentence><sentence id="2196">Why don't you just show us that one certificate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2199">A: Well this lives any more, but this is a copy, this you'll see is the barbed wire here, this is an organization that sprung up, about right after the liberation and it became known as the Union of Former Political Concentration Camp Prisoners and Political  Prisoners and this simply asked the railroad and buses and so on to give me a seat and be nice to me because I had TB. </sentence><sentence id="2200">This is mainly it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2203">Q: The TB cleared up? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2207">Q: Your TB cleared up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2209">A: Yes, except when I was admitted to the United States, then an x-ray was taken and I was told, well I'm very sorry but we cannot give you your final documents because we have to take another x-ray and see whether what we see on the x-ray is scar tissue, or whether it's active. </sentence><sentence id="2210">So [had to go to a quarantine station in Staten Island I think. </sentence><sentence id="2211">They took another x-ray and compared, there was no change, so that meant it was just scar tissue. </sentence><sentence id="2212">So other than that, I'm pretty healthy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
