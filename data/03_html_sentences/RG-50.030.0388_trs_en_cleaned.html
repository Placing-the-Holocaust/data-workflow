<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: And you probably didn't think that that would affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: No, till -- till the -- when the war started, yes, we wonder -- this is why when -- I try to go toward -- toward Warsaw when the war started, because I thought I -- maybe there will be a fight, and I'1l not be on the side with the Germans, but I'll be in the -- where the pol - - Polish are, and -- but unfortunately on their way, the Germans went faster toward -- came faster toward -- to Warsaw, to -- practically to -- see, they didn't take Warsaw, but  close to Warsaw, so that I was under the Germans, and -- and decided to go back to our city. </sentence><sentence id="110">When I came to our city, was about a few days, the commander of the city, a ger -- the German, told all Jews to come out one day. </sentence><sentence id="111">It was about the 15" abou -- of -- of -- of September, and put all the Jews in trucks and took them out towards the Russian border. </sentence><sentence id="112">Left us in a place where the Polish army used to exercise. </sentence><sentence id="113">The next morning they came again, and told us to walk toward the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="114">And we walked over there, and they took away everything what we ha -- what we still had, if they saw anything valuable. </sentence><sentence id="115">Like, my father forgot to hide his golden watch what he had from his father, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="116">And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw. </sentence><sentence id="117">And while the German were talking to us in such a derogative way, he was so nice, and said something, and I didn't understand a word what he said. </sentence><sentence id="118">My father understood Russian because as a child, Shasnich was under the Russian, and he learned Russian. </sentence><sentence id="119">So he said, "Oh, he told us to go over there, where there is soup for us." </sentence><sentence id="120">Alright, we went there -- the Jewish population of this small place me -- pr-prepare soup -- soup for us. </sentence><sentence id="121">For we a-ate something warm, and after that they took us to Bialystok. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Couple questions. </sentence><sentence id="136">First, I'm sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward Russian territory rather than just taking care of you themselves, and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood, what it -- what this all felt like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="139"> A As a whole, we were scared all the time, because we did not -- we knew that they hate Jews, as a fer -- a matter of fact, they -- this is why they took all the Jews and send them out, because they said that our city will be incorporated in the -- in the Reich, and they did not want to have Jews, the addition of Jews in the -- in the Reich, so they sa -- told us to go. </sentence><sentence id="140">And from the Russian point of view it was very nice [indecipherable] let us come in, as a matter of fact, for approximately two months, it -- borders were opening, everybody who came, who could -- who took advantage, and cou -- and came, survived. </sentence><sentence id="141">More Polish Jews survived after that in Russia than in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="142">The mood was of unknown. </sentence><sentence id="143">We don't know what expects us. </sentence><sentence id="144">We know that after that -- after [indecipherable] already in Bialystok that we are free to do various things, that nobody persecute us as Jew. </sentence><sentence id="145">If there is something, a lack of certain things, because we saw how eagerly the j -- Russian soldiers is buying various things on the market. [ </sentence><sentence id="146">indecipherable] So it is because everybody -- or nobody has enough, but not because we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="147">So from this point of view I felt a -- it was good and we thanked th-the -- th-the German officer did not like to have Jews in hi -- in [indecipherable] in the -- in th-the matter of fact, in comparison is all the cities around Shasnich, more Jews survived Shasnich than all the -- in the cities around it, because they were completely destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: Was there a risk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: Oh yes, there was a risk, because there were a lot of people killed, I mean, but my brother-in-law even -- when -- later when the slats went even into -- into -- to villages. </sentence><sentence id="439">He went out of the city 10 - 20 miles, and there exchange it, and bring it back, were two guy. </sentence><sentence id="440">I went a few times, but since I wear glasses, they immediately recognized me as a Jew, and -- because Russians usually don't wear glasses. </sentence><sentence id="441">So I used to walk without glasses, and without glasses I don't see anything. </sentence><sentence id="442">So I couldn't go too much -- too often. </sentence><sentence id="443">Once or  twice I went -- once or twi -- a number of times I went out. </sentence><sentence id="444">There was one family was working the place where they were making vodka. [ </sentence><sentence id="445">indecipherable] but he used to bring us so and so many bottles vodka, and we had a steady guy who was giving us food, either flour, or various kind of -- various kind of other -- other food for the -- for the vodka. </sentence><sentence id="446">We were a steady supplier, and we were giving them, and a little bit leaving over for us. </sentence><sentence id="447">And once I remember I went over and a policeman caught me, with a ra -- another guy and I -- and I was thinking a -- I was looking for a stone to hit him, because I -- you know, I will not go into the -- into the police station, because if somebody was taken to the police, he never came back. </sentence><sentence id="448">But he went with me, he saw where I came from, and he saw there the bottle vodka was still on the table, what I left, and there -- and they took me out into the - - took me back to the border and said, don't -- to the -- go -- go back to ghetto, don't ever come back, and that was strange. </sentence><sentence id="449">And after that, the guy with who [indecipherable] I saw him in -- in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="450">And I thought that it was two policemen. </sentence><sentence id="451">I said, "What are you doing?" </sentence><sentence id="452">He said, "I am a -- 1am a Jewish guy, and I was outside, and this policeman caught me. </sentence><sentence id="453">And then we saw you, walking with a bottle of vodka. </sentence><sentence id="454">So we went to this place, and I paid for the vodka so that he can take the vodka, and he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="455">And he let you go, too." </sentence><sentence id="456">So this was anything, this is how we were trying to get out. </sentence><sentence id="457">It was no problem to go out, because we always -- we're -- we're walking around with something to cut the wires, in order to be able to pass. </sentence><sentence id="458">But the question, well what you do after that?Everybody was -- most of the people were scared. </sentence><sentence id="459">There was one family to -- I used to go there to ask them for a piece of bread to bring to my sister, or -- and after that he begged me not to come, because he didn't open the door, because he said the neighbors know, they noticed it. </sentence><sentence id="460">Because they were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="461">They did not want to be killed just because I came there. </sentence><sentence id="462">So we were going -- we were taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="463">At work we were getting -- men were ge -- getting some food at work. </sentence><sentence id="464">And there I was always either begging, if it was a - -a-- if] -- if 1 cleaned the rooms of soldiers, begging them if they have a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="465">A good -- a good German was giving me a piece of bread, or something else to eat, and if he was bad, he gave me a kick. </sentence><sentence id="466">So if it was outside the cities, I was -- there were always something growing, so we're stealing a few -- a few carrots, or a few potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="467">And if the -- in the worse case, when they didn -- when I didn't have what to take, so I was taking even the clippings from potatoes from the -- from where we worked, for it was -- my sister used to wash the clipping, and make -- make from this potato latkes. </sentence><sentence id="468">And this is on what they lived. </sentence><sentence id="469">Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of, and his name was Gorajetski. </sentence><sentence id="470">He was a -- he had written on the -- belina politsi was written. </sentence><sentence id="471">He spoke Russian and German, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="472">And he could not eat breakfast without killing a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="473">And once we -- he got us, and we worked for him, my brother-in-law and myself, and we said never again. </sentence><sentence id="474">And this was not work, it was just making fun of us. </sentence><sentence id="475">Trying to catch -- to carry -- and running and beating us while we were carrying it from place to place, and then another group was taking it further, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="476">This was fun for him. </sentence><sentence id="477">So -- and after that, he organized like a -- a camp separate. </sentence><sentence id="478">The people could not come from [indecipherable] outside the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="479">They were there with a group of Ukrainians were guarding it, and these people could not come home to the ghetto, they were sleeping over there. </sentence><sentence id="480">So whenever we saw him we did not go to work, because normally people -- other workers were coming, looking for people to work,  taking to work, doing either construction work, or cleaning, or whatever, and in the evening coming back at home, you know. </sentence><sentence id="481">This we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="482">In order to avoid, since they were looking for work -- were looking for workers each time, and looking for people to this camp -- it was on Schirrocca Street, I remember, we -- in order to be able to hide, we built a double wall. </sentence><sentence id="483">A very -- we moved the wall in our apartment, made it a little narrower. </sentence><sentence id="484">Since we worked in construction, I went to the neighbors room and covered it, a -- because otherwise we could -- you could see through. </sentence><sentence id="485">And in our place was just wood. </sentence><sentence id="486">So we could open, go in, hide, and -- and talk to neighbors, they realized, hey, whenever they're looking for -- for men, you are running home. </sentence><sentence id="487">Where do you hide in the -- in there? </sentence><sentence id="488">And then they saw the -- the Ukrainians are going in and coming out empty, no wa -- nobody -- they don't catch you. </sentence><sentence id="489">They looked -- they told us, they look for where we're hiding, and they didn't no -- they didn't no -- notice that we had build this -- this double wall to hide. </sentence><sentence id="490">Other people were hiding behind -- under the floor -- the fir -- floor, there was a place to crawl in, and they were hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="491">So this was as long as they were looking just for men, and once we saw e -- they were taking whole families. </sentence><sentence id="492">Since we lived all in a place where the street was a free, for Aryan, not for Jews, on the other side was ghetto, on this side was a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="493">And so we saw they were -- they take -- they took whole families, a few thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="494">And taking them out and then they never came back. </sentence><sentence id="495">And they shortened the ghetto, they made the ghetto smaller. </sentence><sentence id="496">So we start to think, what do we do for -- if -- if they come here? </sentence><sentence id="497">In addition to wait, we started to hear that they have automobiles where they put in people, and put the gas in -- in automobile, and they gas the people in there. </sentence><sentence id="498">So whenever we heard -- heard cars coming, we started to hide. </sentence><sentence id="499">What to do with the -- your little girl, the little girl that we too -- took her in between the wall, was crying there. </sentence><sentence id="500">So we cided -- decided to build something on the first of this -- we lived on the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="501">On the first floor, there was one part which was not finished. </sentence><sentence id="502">In one of the not finished room, they build a deep, in the ground, we put wa -- tube, so to -- so they'll get air, and there we saw, when the little girl was crying, outside you didn't hear. </sentence><sentence id="503">So the next time there was a thing where we had to hide, I was taking my brother-in-law, sister, and the child to this, lay down, and I was covering it with sand. </sentence><sentence id="504">Sand made it even so that you don't see that anything is there. </sentence><sentence id="505">Then I was going up and hiding in the -- between the door. </sentence><sentence id="506">And this way how we were all kind of -- we call it pogroms, we survived the pogroms in this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: Talk a little bit about these pograms, what you saw, what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: Mostly it was the -- the killers were Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="580">They were -- they surrounded a -- a -- an area, took the Jews out, into the forest nearby. </sentence><sentence id="581">In most of the cases, we knew that there will be a pogrom, because there are people who worked for the ge -- for the -- in the city, and they heard a -- a group sondercommander came in. </sentence><sentence id="582">And when a sondercommander came in, means something will be happening -- will be happening in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="583">And indeed, they used to use Ukrainians or Latvians, and encircle a certain area, one street, or two street, take all the people out in the morning, and lead them out from the city. </sentence><sentence id="584">In most of the cases, we saw them through this way, between the ghetto, wik -- which was a -- a passage from north to south. </sentence><sentence id="585">So we su -- sometime when we looked, we saw hey, they are  taking out a group of people, a number of people. </sentence><sentence id="586">And once they have circled also, the people from the other side of the street, and they emptied there. </sentence><sentence id="587">So I thought they" make the ghetto smaller. </sentence><sentence id="588">And they -- instead of this, they brought German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="589">Jews from Hamburg, Jews from Czechoslovakia, they brought there, and they were there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: In the other side? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: In the other side. </sentence><sentence id="604">So, to go over there wit -- there was one place near the Judenrat, where there was a door -- a door to go across the street and go to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="605">In the middle we were not allowed because we had to wear a -- what -- we would -- we did not have a Star of David like Jews in Poland or in Germany had, but a round yellow -- yellow -- a y- yellow circle. </sentence><sentence id="606">In the beginning I used not -- not to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="607">But then -- and I heard that several people were caught and they were shot because they did not have the yellow sign, so I started to wear the yellow sign here. </sentence><sentence id="608">If I wanted to go into the Aryan side, I covered it, and in ghetto I was going like this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: Did you see -- did you feel safe walking on the streets of the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: In the ghetto, in most of the cases yes, except when this Gorajetski was -- was in. </sentence><sentence id="618">Then -- he was coming in always with a group of y -- of Ukrainians, and then definitely, men were not saved. </sentence><sentence id="619">Often during the time when the men were at -- at work, this Gorajetski used to come into the ghetto and circle two or three street, take all the women out into the -- into a place, and ask for gold. </sentence><sentence id="620">In the beginning nobody was giving him, but -- so he took two women and shot them. </sentence><sentence id="621">So then everybody who had all their rings, and wedding rings, he used to collect in -- in -- in suitcases, and was getting suitcases from the rooms, going around. </sentence><sentence id="622">So if he survived, he had a lot of gold, because each time he was taking a different -- a different area. </sentence><sentence id="623">You know, somehow, Russian Jews had also gold rubles from the last time, they had hidden. </sentence><sentence id="624">He wa -- he was collecting everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: Was there any logic to who was taken out? </sentence><sentence id="634">Did they go for certain types of people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="637">A: No, when they were taking out, they were taking out whole families. </sentence><sentence id="638">They were taking areas. </sentence><sentence id="639">They had an area a -- the main street, the -- the ghetto, two or three streets shorter, till one da -- this was all -- yes, till it was summer "42. </sentence><sentence id="640">We had to stay at work for four days. </sentence><sentence id="641">Once I remembered exactly the date. </sentence><sentence id="642">I think it was in July, but I don't -- I don't recall now. </sentence><sentence id="643">And at that time, they took all the women and children out, and killed them. </sentence><sentence id="644">And I remember after four days we were going back, and everybody was crying, being sure that his relatives, his wifes, children, or mothers are -- are gone. </sentence><sentence id="645">And we thought so too, my brother-in-law and myself, I went. </sentence><sentence id="646">And then we came and my sister and the child were alive. </sentence><sentence id="647">And she said on the third day after she saw that we did not come, she wanted already to go out. </sentence><sentence id="648">What she did is, she was going in -- into -- sitting in th -- in the hiding place without cover. </sentence><sentence id="649">And she was -- and why didn't I -- the Germans not come, I can't understand. </sentence><sentence id="650">And after this [indecipherable] because we wanted the Germans not to come, so we Started to use the approach to it as a toilet, because we wanted not people to come. </sentence><sentence id="651"> Once I -- I -- | heard Germans were saying -- came in and I did not run up to, yet, to my door. </sentence><sentence id="652">When they were downstairs, "Och, this smells like urine, the -- the -- the dirty Jews." </sentence><sentence id="653">So they use [indecipherable] especially use it -- use it [indecipherable] all. </sentence><sentence id="654">So I assume that this is when -- so the approach to the -- to the hiding place was dirty and had to -- you had to go in -- in through -- in the -- and they did not want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="655">So this is how she survived. </sentence><sentence id="656">And she thought that we were probably all taken out to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="657">So she wanted already to go out, and then she says she waited, and then we came. </sentence><sentence id="658">When we walked out in the street, my little niece was the last Jewish child in -- in -- in Minsk -- in the ghetto Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="659">Cause you didn't see, and everybody looked. " </sentence><sentence id="660">Hey, a child." </sentence><sentence id="661">Because, yes, women survived, either they were working, or they were hiding somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="662">But children were not -- she was the last one alive. </sentence><sentence id="663">And this was a time when already we started to get contact with people who knew something about partisans. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2271">A: I cannot think, because I had all the time -- had to adjust each time, to adjust to a different language, or to -- because in the beginning everything was -- let's say I was raised in Poland, Polish, and after that to adjust everything in Russian, then I was adjusting back to Polish, then to German, and after that were ex -- exa -- to -- to -- to English. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And -- so it was adjusting was constantly. </sentence><sentence id="2273">I was doing it all the time, till here I thought I am now -- I am here, I am an -- an American now. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2325">A: In the beginning it was a will to survive, so see again my -- my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2326">To see my brothers and sister. </sentence><sentence id="2327">At a certain time it was -- a certain amount was a desire to re -- of revenge. </sentence><sentence id="2328">And not only it was expected to me -- from me, I remember in the Red army, when we entered the first German village, and there were only a couple of old people remained in the village, how everybody else ran away. </sentence><sentence id="2329">And the soldiers come me, "Sam, there are the -- they are still Germans, we should go kill them." </sentence><sentence id="2330">And I asked them, [indecipherable] I say, should I? </sentence><sentence id="2331">I told them, "Why should I kill them? </sentence><sentence id="2332">They didn't do anything bad to me." </sentence><sentence id="2333">They says, "You are Jewish, didn't they kill all Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="2334">And I told them, "So, what do you want me to be like the -- like the German SS, do the same thing?" </sentence><sentence id="2335">Within myself I saw a -- I cannot do what they did. </sentence><sentence id="2336">So I had opportunity to kill Germans, but I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2337">But there was a certain -- during the war, there was a certain amount of desire for revenge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2351">Q: Was there anything in your upbringing that kind of gave you the s -- the strength you needed to -- to get through this? </sentence><sentence id="2352">Were there things that you thought about while you were fighting, or that you dreamed about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2355">A: No, I would not say this, because my father always wanted me to be kind, and -- and -- and -- and -- and understandable of other people need. </sentence><sentence id="2356">No, I would not say that upbringing did it, it is the experience during the war which made me. </sentence><sentence id="2357">It is only -- it was one thing that I -- when I was as a partisan walking through the -- at night sometimes, somewhere through the village, and I thought, hey, why did -- how come -- why -- why did not -- I not have a rifle when I was in ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="2358">I would have felt differently. </sentence><sentence id="2359">That it will cost somebody s-something to kill me, that they cannot kill just people for -- for nothing, and without paying any -- a price for it. </sentence><sentence id="2360">So this -- and this is sometimes left -- sometimes when I think about people here having so mu -- so mu -- rifles, and they causing here death, I still sometimes think a -- but if Jews had rifles during -- in 1939, many more Germans would have paid with their life, or Ukrainians for -- for killing  them. </sentence><sentence id="2361">So it's -- it affects today my thinking that I am not so against -- so much against the National Rifle Organization as may be if I would have not had my experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2369">Q: What else did you think about while you were in the forest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
