<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="64"> 3    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Closer, but I really mainly, that close to one, who she worked with me in the kitchen, who I still keep contact with, who lives now in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="66">She was from Yugoslavia, actually, from the town of Isad (ph), which nowadays is very much in the news. </sentence><sentence id="67">And she's really the one, who I kept close. </sentence><sentence id="68">If you would ask me what were the other girls" names, I do not remember, and I do not know, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Do you know what became of them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="76">I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our hometown. </sentence><sentence id="77">And I don't even believe we worked in the kitchen together, but towards, during the Death March, we ran into each other. </sentence><sentence id="78">She was older than I am. </sentence><sentence id="79">She used to be a seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="80">And in my stories, I think it's mentioned that on some of the train rides, after we were already liberated, we were together. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I do know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="82">And she lives, she remarried. </sentence><sentence id="83">She had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="84">And he died in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="85">I think he was an artist. </sentence><sentence id="86">And although I never thought I want to go back to Germany, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in Germany, which took us to Berlin, too. </sentence><sentence id="87">And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her address and phone number. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="89">That's the first time I have seen her after Auschwitz times. </sentence><sentence id="90">And she still lives in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="91">She's much older than I am, so at times I've heard that she's kind of ill. </sentence><sentence id="92">So, I don't know what she's doing. </sentence><sentence id="93">I have a feeling her husband was originally from Berlin and then, you know, I think they were getting money after the Holocaust and they made their home there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: What was her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Rosenfeld, Bezsi. </sentence><sentence id="116">Bezsi's like Elizabeth and Rosenfeld was her last name. </sentence><sentence id="117">That was actually her name from the first marriage. </sentence><sentence id="118">That's the way we always knew her and I do not know what her next husband's name was. </sentence><sentence id="119">So, we called her Rosenfeld, B6zsi and she was from Eger. </sentence><sentence id="120">So. </sentence><sentence id="121">And that's all. </sentence><sentence id="122">I never kept up with anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="123">I don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="124">But I agree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="125">And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good. </sentence><sentence id="126">Certain things are very vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened. </sentence><sentence id="127">So, I can't give you any names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: How did you become so close with Ilus!? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: She worked... yeah, I remember, she worked in the kitchen and we met. </sentence><sentence id="144">And she's exactly my age and somehow we liked each other. </sentence><sentence id="145">And then what has happened, that after that people were separated a lot, transports were leaving, and my husband's two sisters were in Auschwitz, but they were taken away to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="146">And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in factories or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="147">But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so- called loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn't know exactly what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="148">We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other. </sentence><sentence id="149">And we did become good friends to the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="150">And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the video, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe because of me. </sentence><sentence id="151">But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and " Born Ilus Fleischman; later lived in Israel and changed her name to Ilana Fried. </sentence><sentence id="152">4    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 5 therefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called Death March. </sentence><sentence id="153">She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she remembered and I never remembered myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Was her situation similar to yours, in that she had lost her parents, she had been separated from her parents in Auschwitz, and they were... ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I assume. </sentence><sentence id="168">But I do not recall it. </sentence><sentence id="169">Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don't even remember if she was taken out with her parents together or not. </sentence><sentence id="170">So, I cannot give you any information about that. </sentence><sentence id="171">Then later she got married and they moved to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="172">And we kept up. </sentence><sentence id="173">In fact, last year I was in Hungary and she came to Hungary, to Budapest and spent a week. </sentence><sentence id="174">So we saw each other then. </sentence><sentence id="175">And unfortunately now, she lives in Netanya. </sentence><sentence id="176">Have you ever been in Israel, yourself? </sentence><sentence id="177">And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a car. </sentence><sentence id="178">And she doesn't have any family anymore, because she never had any children. </sentence><sentence id="179">Her husband died years ago. </sentence><sentence id="180">She might have a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already during concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="181">And she was first in the hospital for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="182">Then she was in some sort of a nursing home situation, because | think she had a broken hip and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="183">And in that age, she's very little and fragile. </sentence><sentence id="184">And then she is now back in her apartment. </sentence><sentence id="185">She doesn't like to write, but she calls once in a while and I write. </sentence><sentence id="186">I write more than I call, because in a short conversation you cannot... but she's somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="187">Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her except nurses would come to the place. </sentence><sentence id="188">And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say that and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do you have to have? </sentence><sentence id="189">And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly wasn't looking forward to. </sentence><sentence id="190">That's all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: You mentioned about that time that you were in Auschwitz, that you didn't fully believe what was happening there. </sentence><sentence id="216">And as far as... as far as your relationship with Ilus, did she believe, was she more informed than you were on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my kitchen work. </sentence><sentence id="220">Later, because I worked first in one part of the kitchen, then in another part. </sentence><sentence id="221">And I think we met a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="222">But I don't know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don't know whether I'm just so naive or I was so naive at the time. </sentence><sentence id="223">Because you know, I even read right now, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel. </sentence><sentence id="224">Have you read that book? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: I actually have only read parts of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Well, it's a very easy. </sentence><sentence id="234">And I read that just in Nashville, while, you know, I had a little time to read it. </sentence><sentence id="235">And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would see the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is. </sentence><sentence id="236">Or maybe if somebody told them, they believed it. </sentence><sentence id="237">Well, I am either very naive... I could never have believed anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="238">We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the first two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="239">They were from Poland 5  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 6 or Russia and they would tell us. </sentence><sentence id="240">But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were coming just in the last minute of the war. </sentence><sentence id="241">See, they were already suffering for three years and suffered quite a bit, you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="242">And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty tough and kind of mean. </sentence><sentence id="243">Because a lot of the kapos in the barracks were Jewish refugees, I mean not refugees, but prisoners from way back. </sentence><sentence id="244">And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or they tell us stories which is so unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="245">So, I never thought about that since my parents disappeared that first day, that they would have been burned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Do you think that was important for your survival that you didn't believe it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Well, [hope so. </sentence><sentence id="264">It could be. </sentence><sentence id="265">And we didn't read about this that much, you know like I listened or read different kind of stories about people. </sentence><sentence id="266">Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in Hungary they did not know anything about Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="267">We did not know anything about Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I don't think my parents did. </sentence><sentence id="269">At the same time, my parents were very protective, too. </sentence><sentence id="270">They were the type of people that they didn't want to scare you. </sentence><sentence id="271">Even if they would have known a little bit more, they did not discuss that. </sentence><sentence id="272">And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in my interviews before about what's going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling. </sentence><sentence id="273">The concentration camps were not... we did not know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="274">Like when we're in the train, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it's going to be Auschwitz, because I did not know anything about that. </sentence><sentence id="275">And I am talking only about myself. </sentence><sentence id="276">You can talk to somebody else maybe and they have an entire different... and you want to know my feelings. </sentence><sentence id="277">We were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn't know where. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Can you tell me, can you trace in your memory, how it happened that you became aware of what Auschwitz meant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: I mean, later in... when we would have believed that they really...? </sentence><sentence id="296">I can't remember when that came to our mind, you know. </sentence><sentence id="297">For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are somewhere in another camp and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people. </sentence><sentence id="298">Well, I was the youngest, and I didn't have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister- in-laws had little children, a four and a six year old. </sentence><sentence id="299">Well, they wouldn't have imagined that they were burned in the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="300">They would have thought that the mother was taking care of the kids in a different kind of a camp. </sentence><sentence id="301">When did we came to the realization? </sentence><sentence id="302">Toward the very end. </sentence><sentence id="303">I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over again, we assumed maybe. </sentence><sentence id="304">But it wasn't that it just happened one day. </sentence><sentence id="305">And I never remember really, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore. </sentence><sentence id="306">It is just... everything was so gradual that I couldn't recall anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="307">And I wanted to get back to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="308">By then, I kind of knew that I'm not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I would find my brothers, because I didn't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="309">Of course, I didn't find them either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews. </sentence><sentence id="310">But when did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="311">I don't really know. ( </sentence><sentence id="312">Doorbell rings.) </sentence><sentence id="313">Oh gosh, would you turn that off for a minute? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: Well, I wondered if you got to any point where you, even if it was years after the war, where you cried for them? </sentence><sentence id="334">That it hit you or that you felt safe enough to really mourn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="337"> 6    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it is, that what amazes me, that during that time that we were in that camp and so many horrible things were going on, I don't remember really ever crying. </sentence><sentence id="339">You know? </sentence><sentence id="340">The shock was so great. </sentence><sentence id="341">And afterwards, see, when I got back to Hungary, there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like you were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you all at once. </sentence><sentence id="342">And so, I don't, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I couldn't find my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="343">But it's funny, I wasn't... it's not funny at all, but I apparently didn't cry that easily. </sentence><sentence id="344">I mean I might have held it back more. </sentence><sentence id="345">And the tears come now, for example, I see a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting hurt or little... I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event what happened, that was just so much, that I... I didn't... like that we go to the cemetery when we are in my hometown, because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a special one for the kids. </sentence><sentence id="346">My family's names are on it. </sentence><sentence id="347">And it's just, you know, you're just under, it's a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know? </sentence><sentence id="348">Then I had other traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not. </sentence><sentence id="349">But I don't want to jump ahead of myself. </sentence><sentence id="350">You ask me the question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Okay, well I'm not concerned about sticking to a chronology, so you can talk about...We'll just get back to the chronology when... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: I don't know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough. </sentence><sentence id="367">Or maybe I was brought up in a nice family home and I didn't have any upsetting situations. </sentence><sentence id="368">But I think it has a lot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong. </sentence><sentence id="369">And I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic and I could do it. </sentence><sentence id="370">So, it must be my personality that I was able to... to survive, no. </sentence><sentence id="371">No? </sentence><sentence id="372">Because you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you. </sentence><sentence id="373">But maybe the feeling that you don't give up easily. </sentence><sentence id="374">Or it's like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we would spend hours trying to get rid of the lice. </sentence><sentence id="375">Or if we were starving, you know, I was able to... then I was lucky that I didn't get really sick. </sentence><sentence id="376">I mean, that I don't think has anything to do with one's personality. </sentence><sentence id="377">You may be stronger, and I'm a pretty strong person. </sentence><sentence id="378">But in those days, you know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="379">And that I considered luck. </sentence><sentence id="380">I don't think that it's a personality. </sentence><sentence id="381">Somebody who is stronger, maybe can endure all that. </sentence><sentence id="382">So I'm not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I was able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe... I hate it that they have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things. </sentence><sentence id="383">I think about it a lot and I remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn't me. </sentence><sentence id="384">That had to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can't believe and can't understand how in the world somebody can survive it. </sentence><sentence id="385">And then talk about it later in life. </sentence><sentence id="386">It's... I have a hard time understanding that and I still feel that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: And somebody pretty young... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: I was not that young, you know. </sentence><sentence id="411">I really not a 15-year-old kid. </sentence><sentence id="412">I was in my 23s or 24s. </sentence><sentence id="413">So, I was mature enough to deal with it, but I worried about... see after the... and as of today, I'm going to say something to you, I just thought about that. </sentence><sentence id="414">They died the way, you know how they did. </sentence><sentence id="415">And at the same time I tried to compromise with it. </sentence><sentence id="416">I mean, I'm not trying to forgive Hitler 7   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 8 ever, or what happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="417">But if I saw younger people with their mother doing the same things I was doing and they would beat that mother or that mother was starving, you know? </sentence><sentence id="418">Just the thought of that for me would have been horrible. </sentence><sentence id="419">So, the way I think now that they suddenly were killed and they didn't suffer. </sentence><sentence id="420">That makes me feel almost better than if I would have gone with them maybe for half a year and then slowly they would have died. </sentence><sentence id="421">Because they were in their sixties, they weren't young. </sentence><sentence id="422">Some people were only maybe in their forties. </sentence><sentence id="423">But when I was born, my mother was already forty years old, so she had to be 63 some years old. </sentence><sentence id="424">And in those days those were already old people, but they were healthy people. </sentence><sentence id="425">I never seen them sick or, you know, in bed, in fact, with a sickness. </sentence><sentence id="426">So, to me, seeing them suffer right next to you would have been almost worse. </sentence><sentence id="427">I mean, I don't know if anybody ever felt that way. </sentence><sentence id="428">Because if they could have survived the whole thing, that's a different story, but at that age, not many older people could survive it. </sentence><sentence id="429">So. </sentence><sentence id="430">End of Tape 1, Side A 8   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 9 Tape 1, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Ann Low Klein. </sentence><sentence id="456">Well, let's, I have some questions about the things that you brought up, but let's try to get back to them later and we" ll get back right now to the summary, to just finish saying what happened to you during the wartime. </sentence><sentence id="457">I believe when we left off, we mentioned that you were on a Death March. </sentence><sentence id="458">You were forced to go to Ravensbriick with this group of other girls and then we went off talking about what had become of them. </sentence><sentence id="459">So, you were in Ravensbriick for about three weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Ravensbriick for three weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: And then to Malchow for about two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="468">And then there was a lot of traveling around to various places. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="923">A: See, then, in concentration camp and I told you that, we only thought about food and never about boys. </sentence><sentence id="924">And after I got back, it wasn't very much after I arrived, see, that I got those letters from my sister-in-laws. </sentence><sentence id="925">And the first time that he wrote to me, which I still have that letter, in which he asked me and gave me the choice of, that he thought about that he wants his sisters come... I think I mentioned that he went to Bergen-Belsen to get his sisters. </sentence><sentence id="926">And he took them to Casablanca, because he was stationed in Casablanca at that time. </sentence><sentence id="927">And then he wanted to have the girls come to the United States, which didn't work out, because one went back to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="928">The other one stayed and married somebody there. </sentence><sentence id="929">But he kind of thought that I could come out and we all could live together. </sentence><sentence id="930">We would get married. </sentence><sentence id="931">If it works, fine. </sentence><sentence id="932">If it doesn't, we could always separate. </sentence><sentence id="933">See that was ten years after and you know a lot of things happen during ten years. </sentence><sentence id="934">So, when I got that letter, you know, I never had a second thought that that ought not to work out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="996">A: Well, the first thing, for example, was tremendously strange, but I do remember that we had help in our house, when I was growing up, and my mother tried to make me once in a while to, to help a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="997">I think she wanted to train me to become eventually a good housewife. </sentence><sentence id="998">I think all mothers like to do that. </sentence><sentence id="999">And I remember that one day she was making me dust the furniture in the bedroom, although all my friends were downstairs already, down on the main street walking. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And I kept on looking out and I was just upset that I couldn't be there. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I could have done dusting the furniture in two seconds, but instead of that, I was fooling around and I wished I would be down with my friends. </sentence><sentence id="1002">So anyway, I was procrastinating that kind of stuff apparently, like many other kids, I didn't want to maybe do what my chore would have been. </sentence><sentence id="1003">After I came back and I had that big apartment, and I remember I worked like a dog. </sentence><sentence id="1004">You know, we had hardwood floors. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And at that time, you know, you didn't have the kind of waxers and the facilities and the vacuum cleaners like they have them now. </sentence><sentence id="1006">I remember I had a brush I put on the one foot and I waxed the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And under your other foot, you have a rag. </sentence><sentence id="1008">I mean, you never saw anything like that, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1022">Q: Had anyone lived in that house during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1024">A: Well, yes, different people lived in it and then they moved out and when I came back, my uncle was there. </sentence><sentence id="1025">But I tried to get the house back in the shape like I remembered that it was before. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And all I could, always, and I think I cried at that time, if my mother just would see now, how I'm trying to take care of the house, when earlier I wouldn't even want to dust the furniture. </sentence><sentence id="1027">So, I was very proud of myself. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And you know, I mean, I don't remember the crying spells, but I would get very emotional, even now that I'm talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="1029">If she just could have seen now what I'm doing, when I really didn't have to, but I did it for myself or maybe to just the way the place looked like before. </sentence><sentence id="1030">I wanted to put it back into that same shape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1114">A: Well, I have also managed...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1157">A: Yeah, yeah, so I don't want to repeat it again, but to me that's a hardship. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I mean not...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1362">Q: Was he named after your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>

I remember we were renting in Marion, a National home for 92 dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1740">And I was sick one time with strep throat. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And Sandy got a call somewhere about some pay raise, something. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And he got so excited and he was doing the laundry. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And we had some sort of washing machine that you had to stop it in between all the periods. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And suddenly the water overflowed and the water was coming all over the whole National home, you know, it's...
