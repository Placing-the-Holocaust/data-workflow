<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1433">A: Yes, I was -- as the raw flax, which -- which made sores on my hand because they are stalks, and you had to be fast putting it into the machine. </sentence><sentence id="1434">My hands were always bloody, and injured from this job. </sentence><sentence id="1435">And the seeds went into a bucket used for something else, and the stalks w-were put through other machines, and refined towards cha -- changing it into a material. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1439">Q: And this was pretty hard -- you know, difficult labor, would you say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1441">A: It was very difficult labor. </sentence><sentence id="1442">I was on one of the worst machines. </sentence><sentence id="1443">My friend Ruth Wertheim was lucky, she was actually in a part of the sewing part, where they already mixed the nylon, or whatever they had, some synthetic type of process, with the flax material. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And it was easier. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So, actually, I was on the worst end of the labor. </sentence><sentence id="1446">That's why I got sick very fast. </sentence><sentence id="1447">The -- the door was always open for the flax to be thrown in, which was also done by girls, and some French prisoners brought the heavy bundles. </sentence><sentence id="1448">And this went for eight -- almost eight months, from October to May, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1449">We almost worked towards the very, very end of April in -- fully on these machines. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1460">Q: Were you hearing any news about the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1462">A: Yes, we heard that they were coming nearer, nearer. </sentence><sentence id="1463">The French soldiers warned us that they might blow us up, so one morning all of a sudden, all the Germans were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1464">They were -- the factory was locked up, all Quonset huts were locked up, and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1465">We thought they are going to blow us up, but nothing happened, nobody was around, nuth -- nobody came. </sentence><sentence id="1466">That went on for 24 hours, and we searched for food, and there was really nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And then finally we saw a Russian soldier come on the bicycle, and s-somebody yelled out of a window, or whatever, and he came and alerted the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And the first thing the girls did -- I was too sick, slaughter a cow, or sa -- or a -- or something, or [indecipherable] just to get some f -- real good food into us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
