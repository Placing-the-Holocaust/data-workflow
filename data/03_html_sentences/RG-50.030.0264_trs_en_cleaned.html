of the Netherlands. </sentence><sentence id="344">She was not going to let anything happen to her children. </sentence><sentence id="345">She was a very dynamic person and she knew that she was going to do everything for us not to have to through a concentration camp because somehow people say they didn't know about the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="346">We did know about it because every threat was if you don't do this, you are going to a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="347">So we knew there was a camp. </sentence><sentence id="348">We didn't know where, but we knew there was a camp. </sentence><sentence id="349">And at one point my uncle, one of my uncles came and to tell us goodbye, and my mother said, "Where are you going." </sentence><sentence

harm." </sentence><sentence id="354">My mother said, "You're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="355">Don't go." </sentence><sentence id="356">One thing I do want to bring out that 80 percent and I don't thing this is known...80 percent of the Jewish Dutch population were blue collar workers. </sentence><sentence id="357">They were poor people, and to get out and escape cost a lot of money because most people escaped with the help of passeur, and they charged tremendous amounts of money. </sentence><sentence id="358">And my mother was working in that store day and night to make enough money for us to get out and to pay a passeur. </sentence><sentence id="359">To make a long story short, it was the most freightening time. </sentence><sentence id="360">From December to July was very, very freightening. </sentence><sentence id="361">All the telephones were censored. </sentence><sentence id="362">All the newspapers were censored. </sentence><sentence id="363">In the morning we would call

id="395">I had I should have taken that card that my girlfriend had given me and torn it up and she should have claimed that she had lost it. </sentence><sentence id="396">One of the young men on the

the card from me. </sentence><sentence id="402">He was very, very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="403">And they put her in jail. </sentence><sentence id="404">And she was kept there for a whole week, and the only reason why she was let out was she kept insisting that I had stolen it from her. </sentence><sentence id="405">She never said she had given it to me. </sentence><sentence

away in that shoe store. </sentence><sentence id="438">And that is a long story how she made it, and Iam not going to go into that right now. </sentence><sentence id="439">But when we left with the

his money and he left us. </sentence><sentence id="442">And we knew nobody in Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="443">My mother approached somebody on the street who wore a star, the Jewish star, and

passed away and my Father would have lived, we would never have gotten out of the Netherlands, because my father became very depressed from the whole situation and he didn't see a way out.

circumvented Paris, went through Douai and Lille on the western side of France, northwestern side of France, and then we took a train to the Demarcation Line. </sentence><sentence id="456">It was scary because we saw the Germans on the platform of the railroad stations. </sentence><sentence id="457">They were in the trains. </sentence><sentence id="458">But nobody ever checked our papers. </sentence><sentence id="459">As a matter of fact, we had no paper. </sentence><sentence id="460">We were there as non-entities. </sentence><sentence id="461">And when we crossed the Demarcation Line

</sentence><sentence id="464">We made it to Nice. </sentence><sentence id="465">We did go to the Consul, the Dutch Consul, and asked for papers. </sentence><sentence id="466">The Dutch Consul said,

and there was a lot of snow on the mountains and everybody said, "You cannot risk your life on the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="497">You cannot go that way." </sentence><sentence id="498">So we went back to the Dutch Consul. </sentence><sentence id="499">He said, "Now if you can get a transit visa through Spain and Portugal, you can go to Dutch Guyana or Surinam as it was called.

to do...and I did...but it was to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="508">We even tried to change my brother-in-law's age on his passport with some ink iradicator, but it was so bad it made a hole in the paper. </sentence><sentence id="509">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="510">We didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="511">My brother-in-law stayed in Marseille. </sentence><sentence id="512">My mother kept calling and said, "You must come. </sentence><sentence id="513">We have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="514">The Germans are about to march in." </sentence><sentence id="515">My mother, my younger sister and I, we went to the Spanish border. </sentence><sentence id="516">We went to Papinvon and we...I left my brother-in-law in Marseille. </sentence><sentence id="517">My mother had left my brother-in-law quite a bit of money to see if he couldn't buy himself a transit visa. </sentence><sentence id="518">When we arrived across the border, there was a lot of cheering and I think it was November the 10, 1942, when we arrived across the border in Spain. </sentence><sentence id="519">And all the Spainards were cheering. </sentence><sentence id="520">And there was a Dutch representative from the consulate of Madrid at this station who apparently came and met many of the trains to see if there were any Dutch people on

they took it. </sentence><sentence id="539">And he couldn't get a train out any more to Spain. </sentence><sentence id="540">He made it to the Spanish border and he walked a lot of pyranees...there was a tunnel, and somehow from there, he was taken to Barcelona. </sentence><sentence id="541">Going without a visa woud have been the same as death because in Spain they put all the people who did
