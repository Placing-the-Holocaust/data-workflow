<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Tell us about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: The Germans marched in with song. </sentence><sentence id="174">They sang their Nazi army songs and they marched through the streets and then, of course, we encountered individuals...Germans marching walking on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="175">In the beginning, they were very subdued. </sentence><sentence id="176">They did not bother people individually except the first major...uh..thing that happened is that they wrote in the newspaper and announced on the radio that all the citizens of the country have to come to the city hall for identification papers. </sentence><sentence id="177">And if you were Jewish you have to tell that because they knew who was Jewish because they got all the lists from the synagogues, and if you did not tell them you would be sent to a concenration camp. </sentence><sentence id="178">And that was the first I heard about concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="179">So we were aware that there were concentration camps because every time they wanted us something to do, we were threatened with being sent to a concentration camp if we didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="180">So we went to the city hall and we got an identification paper and it had a J on it and that was the beginning of the end because there they had us. </sentence><sentence id="181">No matter what we...what happened afterwards, there was nothing we could do because we had that identification card with the J on it. </sentence><sentence id="182">And after they .the...the very first months were after the identification card were quiet. </sentence><sentence id="183">Then the edicts came, and we read about it in the newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="184">Every time there was something new, a law against the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="185">First of all they told us we could not go into the parks. </sentence><sentence id="186">That was forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="187">Jewish people could not go into parks. </sentence><sentence id="188">And it became increasingly worse. </sentence><sentence id="189">We could not travel by train anymore. </sentence><sentence id="190">In other words, we could not leave the city. </sentence><sentence id="191">We could not use the street cars. </sentence><sentence id="192">We could not use the buses, and to make matters, we had to deliver our bicycles to them. </sentence><sentence id="193">Now our bicycles were our life line. </sentence><sentence id="194">It's like a car in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="195">So we were virtually shut off from everything. </sentence><sentence id="196">Wherever we went we had to travel...we had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="197">So matters go worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="198">We...and we read about the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="199">Then, of course one day there was a edict that we had to leave...all the Jewish children had to leave the public schools and </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: How old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="230"> A; I was 15 when the Germans marched in. </sentence><sentence id="231">By the time I left the lycee...when I was forced to leave the lycee, I was at that time...it was Dec...it was about December 41, about December 41 or it could have been November. </sentence><sentence id="232">I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="233">And then the Jewish teachers who were also forced out of their jobs, they organized a Jewish gymnasium or lycee for the children who were on that level. </sentence><sentence id="234">So I did attend that school for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="235">One morning we read in the newspaper that all the Jewish people had to come to a certain place and to collect their stars that we all had to wear a star, and it had to be sewn on without any spaces in between. </sentence><sentence id="236">If they could put their finger through it, we were going to be sent to a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="237">I stilll remember my mother sewing and sewing and sewing all night long all those stars that she collected. </sentence><sentence id="238">And in our school, the Jewish sense of humor prevailed. </sentence><sentence id="239">One of the kids wrote on the board, "Tomorrow morning, come an half an hour early. </sentence><sentence id="240">We are going to have a star parade." </sentence><sentence id="241">We sort of tried to make fun out of it. </sentence><sentence id="242">| uh one of the edicts was that we could only go grocery shopping between 3 and 5 in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="243">Now there was already very little food. </sentence><sentence id="244">Some of the merchants tried to put food away for the...for their Jewish customers under the counter so that we had some food. </sentence><sentence id="245">Uh and there were...it seemed that every time there was something else that we had to adhere to. </sentence><sentence id="246">We could, for instance, one evening we were told we could only walk behind each other. </sentence><sentence id="247">We could not walk next to each other anymore. </sentence><sentence id="248">So when I was on the street walking with my mother, I had to walk behind her. </sentence><sentence id="249">My sister had to walk behind me. </sentence><sentence id="250">My other sister had to walk behind her. </sentence><sentence id="251">So that's the way we all walked. </sentence><sentence id="252">December of 40 it was Pearl Harbor Day. </sentence><sentence id="253">We didn't know it was Pearl Harbor Day, but it was December 7 and we were not allowed to be on the street anymore after 6 in the evening and the other...the non-Jewish people I believe could be on the street till 8. </sentence><sentence id="254">So when you heard a knock on the door, you always knew it was a German. </sentence><sentence id="255">So it was very freightening. </sentence><sentence id="256">But one evening it was December the 7th, my father had a coronary in the middle of the night, and Jewish doctors could not practice medicine anymore, and non-Jewish doctors could not attend to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="257">My mother sent...we had a telephone near my father's bed, but she didn't want to alarm him and she told me I had to go downstairs into the store where there was another telephone and to call somebody. </sentence><sentence id="258">And there was always a number in the newspaper, a medical number to call. </sentence><sentence id="259">Now I had to go with a flashlight because the store was not black, there was no blackout in the store and you could...were not allowed to put any lights on. </sentence><sentence id="260">So I went there with a flashlight looking for the newspaper and looking for a number and finally I called the number and they said, " What religion do you have?" </sentence><sentence id="261">I said, "We are Jewish." " </sentence><sentence id="262">Sorry, we can't come." </sentence><sentence id="263">They did come hours later to declare him dead. </sentence><sentence id="264">And one of the bad things that, of course, we...we were besides ourselves because he was not an old man. </sentence><sentence id="265">He was only 53 years old. </sentence><sentence id="266">And he left my mother who was in her 40s with three children. </sentence><sentence id="267">My older sister. </sentence><sentence id="268">was engaged, or she was going with a son of their best friends, and they did want them to leave earlier because the men were already being picked up at that...in the...near 1941. </sentence><sentence id="269">So they were they married. </sentence><sentence id="270">They had married before my father passed away and they were hiding in a room somewhere till they found a way to escape which they did. </sentence><sentence id="271">They escaped before we did. </sentence><sentence id="272">And one of the bad things was that my father died without a will and his bank account was closed right away which left my mother almost indigent. </sentence><sentence id="273">The theaters had been confiscated before...and the day they were confiscated the Germans came in and beat up my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: Did he also own the theater? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: My father owned the theater. </sentence><sentence id="322">My father owned one theater and two theaters were rented. </sentence><sentence id="323">But they came into the theater where he was. </sentence><sentence id="324">They beat him up, and some of the people who worked for him brought him home. </sentence><sentence id="325">And he was bleeding from his nose and from his head. </sentence><sentence id="326">But he recuperated. </sentence><sentence id="327">Was nothing serious. </sentence><sentence id="328">And but, of course, we lost him in December of 41.My mother stilll had the shoe store. </sentence><sentence id="329">She had always been very active in business and so she knew exactly how to handle it, and she knew she had to get out of the Netherlands. </sentence><sentence id="330">She was not going to let anything happen to her children. </sentence><sentence id="331">She was a very dynamic person and she knew that she was going to do everything for us not to have to through a concentration camp because somehow people say they didn't know about the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="332">We did know about it because every threat was if you don't do this, you are going to a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="333">So we knew there was a camp. </sentence><sentence id="334">We didn't know where, but we knew there was a camp. </sentence><sentence id="335">And at one point my uncle, one of my uncles came and to tell us goodbye, and my mother said, "Where are you going." </sentence><sentence id="336">He said, "I am going to Westerbork," which was a...a camp which was a way Station before you were sent to the bad camps in the eastern part of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="337">My...my mother said, "Are you crazy? </sentence><sentence id="338">Why...why are you going." </sentence><sentence id="339">He said, "If 1 do what the Germans tell me to do, they are not going to do me any harm." </sentence><sentence id="340">My mother said, "You're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="341">Don't go." </sentence><sentence id="342">One thing I do want to bring out that 80 percent and I don't thing this is known...80 percent of the Jewish Dutch population were blue collar workers. </sentence><sentence id="343">They were poor people, and to get out and escape cost a lot of money because most people escaped with the help of passeur, and they charged tremendous amounts of money. </sentence><sentence id="344">And my mother was working in that store day and night to make enough money for us to get out and to pay a passeur. </sentence><sentence id="345">To make a long story short, it was the most freightening time. </sentence><sentence id="346">From December to July was very, very freightening. </sentence><sentence id="347">All the telephones were censored. </sentence><sentence id="348">All the newspapers were censored. </sentence><sentence id="349">In the morning we would call friends to see if they were stilll there because during the night they came and picked us up. </sentence><sentence id="350">And we never knew who was stilll there and who was already picked up. </sentence><sentence id="351">My...and my mother was working against time to make the money. </sentence><sentence id="352">Now we had about 20 friends who all decided they wanted to leave the Netherlands and try to escape rather than to go to a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="353">They got a passeur together and it was decided that on July the 14, 1942, we would be going and try our escape. </sentence><sentence id="354">We never knew if the 20 were going to be all there because of the of the nights where the people were being picked up. </sentence><sentence id="355">As it happened, we were all there July the 14th. </sentence><sentence id="356">We lived in a totally Catholic street. </sentence><sentence id="357">My mother had confided to one family that we were going to try to leave the following day, and they had seven children. </sentence><sentence id="358">They made all the children go to church that morning to pray for the welfare of all the Jewish people and especially for their neighbors, the family Pajgin, but they never told them why although the parents knew. </sentence><sentence id="359">And we took the star off our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="360">We put on two dresses on top of each other and we had nothing else and we left. </sentence><sentence id="361">It was the day of my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="362">My mother felt terrible that she couldn't make me a really nice birthday party, which she had always done. </sentence><sentence id="363">And she got up at 5 o'clock in the morning...that morning and she went to the market and boughtt me some hugh peaches, and that was my birthday present and I ate those for breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="364">And we went to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="365">Of course, we took our life into our hands because we...the trains were spot checked. </sentence><sentence id="366">I did not take my identification card with us and neither did my...I left with my mother and my younger sister who was...at that time she was 16. </sentence><sentence id="367">I had borrowed from a girlfriend of mine an identification card without a J on it. </sentence><sentence id="368">She had given it to me. </sentence><sentence id="369">We didn't look at all alike. </sentence><sentence id="370">Her picture was...she was blond, and I had black hair. </sentence><sentence id="371">But she gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="372">She wanted me to have it. </sentence><sentence id="373">Fortunately, we were never checked on that train, and we were supposed to go to a farm house in the city of Brada which was near the Belgium border. </sentence><sentence id="374">When we got there and we were going to meet all 20 people there. </sentence><sentence id="375">We did leave...that time we left in the day time. </sentence><sentence id="376">And at night there were about something like 17 who who made it. </sentence><sentence id="377">Three of them were caught. </sentence><sentence id="378">We don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="379">I had I should have taken that card that my girlfriend had given me and torn it up and she should have claimed that she had lost it. </sentence><sentence id="380">One of the young men on the train...in the farm house. </sentence><sentence id="381">was going to The Hague the next day, and I told him, "Would you take this card and give it to my girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="382">Give it back to her." </sentence><sentence id="383">He said, "Sure." </sentence><sentence id="384">As it happened, that train was being checked, and he became flustered and they took him off the train and searched him and found that card. </sentence><sentence id="385">The first thing that they did they went to my girlfriend's house and they put her in jail and he sort of confessed that he had gotten the card from me. </sentence><sentence id="386">He was very, very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="387">And they put her in jail. </sentence><sentence id="388">And she was kept there for a whole week, and the only reason why she was let out was she kept insisting that I had stolen it from her. </sentence><sentence id="389">She never said she had given it to me. </sentence><sentence id="390">What happened to the young man I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="391">He was in a cell next to hers and she told me later that he was being beaten every single day and she heard him scream but otherwise I don't know what happen to the family his family or to him. </sentence><sentence id="392">Now we stayed a few days at that farm house and the the passeur who my mother had paid to bring us to Antwerp he would cross the border and see if it was safe for us to leave. </sentence><sentence id="393">And one night he said it was safe. </sentence><sentence id="394">So we left in groups of...1 only can remember that I left with my mother and my younger sister, and then other...the other people would leave at a different hour. </sentence><sentence id="395">We made it to Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="396">We walked across the border in the dark. </sentence><sentence id="397">We went through rivers. </sentence><sentence id="398">We...we were a mess when we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="399">We made it to Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="400">We did go from the border on a little bus to Antwerp and the passeur had all...arranged all that. </sentence><sentence id="401">I had an uncle in Antwerp and we stayed in his house. </sentence><sentence id="402">We could not leave his house for about...about a week because the Germans were checking identification cards after we had arrived. </sentence><sentence id="403">This...during this whole trip we were so lucky. </sentence><sentence id="404">The luck was with us. </sentence><sentence id="405">If it was unlucky that I had to leave my wonderful home in the Netherlands, there was something that was so lucky. </sentence><sentence id="406">We...we were never checked. </sentence><sentence id="407">We were never...we were...we just were never caught. </sentence><sentence id="408">And to..to tell you that of the 20 people, we...we were the only three who were not caught. </sentence><sentence id="409">Everyone else was caught at different stages. </sentence><sentence id="410">Even if you know in the Netherlands from one city to the other, they know exactly where you come from because your accent is different. </sentence><sentence id="411">Here you have greater territory so this country and people maybe will not so readily recognize what city you come from. </sentence><sentence id="412">There even if I go back to the Netherlands today, people say, "I know you're from The Hague." </sentence><sentence id="413">But so when we came to Belgium even though they spoke "Flamish," we could not speak to anybody because they would know we were from The Hague. </sentence><sentence id="414">But we stayed for a week in my uncle's house and he arranged to find us a passeur to take us to the southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="415">We knew we wanted to eventually go to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="416">We did not want to stay in the southern part of France but my uncle got this passeur for us, and he was going to take us to Nice in the southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="417">My paid him ahead of time. </sentence><sentence id="418">I understand...my mother told me later...that the whole journey to the southern part of France cost her something like 60,000 dollars...the equivalent of 60,000, which was a fortune in those days. </sentence><sentence id="419">And she made it all after my father passed away in that shoe store. </sentence><sentence id="420">And that is a long story how she made it, and Iam not going to go into that right now. </sentence><sentence id="421">But when we left with the passeur to go back to go to the southern part of France, we went through Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="422">In the middle of the street, he left us. </sentence><sentence id="423">He had received his money and he left us. </sentence><sentence id="424">And we knew nobody in Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="425">My mother approached somebody on the street who wore a star, the Jewish star, and just took her life in her hands and told him the story. </sentence><sentence id="426">He took us to his house and we slept on the floor of his living room for about I would say 4 or 5 days. </sentence><sentence id="427">And this man was absolutely a Godsend. </sentence><sentence id="428">He found us another person to take us to the southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="429">The whole story was just plain luck. </sentence><sentence id="430">It was not brain power. </sentence><sentence id="431">It was luck. </sentence><sentence id="432">I do have to give my mother credit for all this because with her she never took no for an answer as I said before. </sentence><sentence id="433">We...my sisters and I have often spoken to...if God forbid my Mother would have passed away and my Father would have lived, we would never have gotten out of the Netherlands, because my father became very depressed from the whole situation and he didn't see a way out. </sentence><sentence id="434">My mother was always the optimist and she knew we were going to be...uh..going out. </sentence><sentence id="435">She was not going to go just lying down for...for anything. </sentence><sentence id="436">Now this...the next passeur who took us out of Brussels brought us to Nice. </sentence><sentence id="437">We...we did some walking over...we went...we circumvented Paris, went through Douai and Lille on the western side of France, northwestern side of France, and then we took a train to the Demarcation Line. </sentence><sentence id="438">It was scary because we saw the Germans on the platform of the railroad stations. </sentence><sentence id="439">They were in the trains. </sentence><sentence id="440">But nobody ever checked our papers. </sentence><sentence id="441">As a matter of fact, we had no paper. </sentence><sentence id="442">We were there as non-entities. </sentence><sentence id="443">And when we crossed the Demarcation Line between Dijon and Lyon, we sighed a sigh of relief. </sentence><sentence id="444">We thought we had it made. </sentence><sentence id="445">But the southern part of France was very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="446">We made it to Nice. </sentence><sentence id="447">We did go to the Consul, the Dutch Consul, and asked for papers. </sentence><sentence id="448">The Dutch Consul said, "What is your religion." </sentence><sentence id="449">My mother told him, "We are protestants." </sentence><sentence id="450">My...So the Counsul said, "Why did you leave." </sentence><sentence id="451">And my mother made up a wonderful story that her daughter who was 18 years old, namely I was followed by a German soldier...soldier and that she feared for my safety and that's why we left. </sentence><sentence id="452">We changed our name from Pajgin to Pogan because my older sister who had preceded us to Nice had told the Dutch Consul that she was Jewish and so we had to change our name a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="453">Our being Protestant...so called Protestant saved our life in the southern part of France because had made an arrangement with Hitler to send all the Jewish refugees back to occupied territory. </sentence><sentence id="454">They came to search our room in the hotel where we stayed every single night for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="455">I remember them looking under the beds. </sentence><sentence id="456">They looked in the cupboards. </sentence><sentence id="457">They looked everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="458">And this went on every single night. </sentence><sentence id="459">When they saw that our papers had "Protestant," they excused themselves for waking us up. </sentence><sentence id="460">As long as I live, I will never forget the screams of the Jewish people who were taken out of their rooms. </sentence><sentence id="461">This hotel was a small hotel. </sentence><sentence id="462">It had a circular stairway in the middle of the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="463">So I don't remember that there was a elevator, but all these people were taken down from their rooms on that circular stairway which passed our room. </sentence><sentence id="464">The screams of those people I will never forget as long as I live. </sentence><sentence id="465">We were spared because we were Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="466">Now we had heard that the Germans were trying to march into the southern part of France and we were trying to march into the southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="467">And we were trying to go to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="468">Switzerland would not let anybody in if you didn't have papers. </sentence><sentence id="469">If you made it beyond 20 feet of the border and they caught you, you were safe. </sentence><sentence id="470">They would not send you back. </sentence><sentence id="471">But many people lost their lives over the...on the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="472">There was already....this was...we arrived in in the southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="473">We left the 14th of July, 42 from The Hague. </sentence><sentence id="474">We left about...we arrived in the southern part of France about a month later. </sentence><sentence id="475">It took us about a month to get there. </sentence><sentence id="476">And by the time my mother very seriously thought that we should leave, that was already September, and there was a lot of snow on the mountains and everybody said, "You cannot risk your life on the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="477">You cannot go that way." </sentence><sentence id="478">So we went back to the Dutch Consul. </sentence><sentence id="479">He said, "Now if you can get a transit visa through Spain and Portugal, you can go to Dutch Guyana or Surinam as it was called. </sentence><sentence id="480">Now I persuaded the policeman that he should give me a _ which was a permit to go on the train to Marseille to go to the Spanish Consulate there and try to get a transit visa. </sentence><sentence id="481">I went there and...went with my brother-in-law, my older sister's husband, and there was no problem getting a...a....a transit visa for my mother, for my two sisters, and for myself. </sentence><sentence id="482">They would not give it to my brother-in-law because Hitler had made a pact with with Franco that no military age person would go through because they knew they would join the Allied Armies. </sentence><sentence id="483">So my brother-in-law couldn't get it. </sentence><sentence id="484">We tried and tried and tried. </sentence><sentence id="485">They wouldn't give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="486">I tried my best. </sentence><sentence id="487">I flirted with these Spanish people in that consultate which my mother had told me to do...and I did...but it was to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="488">We even tried to change my brother-in-law's age on his passport with some ink iradicator, but it was so bad it made a hole in the paper. </sentence><sentence id="489">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="490">We didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="491">My brother-in-law stayed in Marseille. </sentence><sentence id="492">My mother kept calling and said, "You must come. </sentence><sentence id="493">We have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="494">The Germans are about to march in." </sentence><sentence id="495">My mother, my younger sister and I, we went to the Spanish border. </sentence><sentence id="496">We went to Papinvon and we...I left my brother-in-law in Marseille. </sentence><sentence id="497">My mother had left my brother-in-law quite a bit of money to see if he couldn't buy himself a transit visa. </sentence><sentence id="498">When we arrived across the border, there was a lot of cheering and I think it was November the 10, 1942, when we arrived across the border in Spain. </sentence><sentence id="499">And all the Spainards were cheering. </sentence><sentence id="500">And there was a Dutch representative from the consulate of Madrid at this station who apparently came and met many of the trains to see if there were any Dutch people on the train. </sentence><sentence id="501">And I asked him...1 couldn't understand Spanish...and I asked him why are they all cheering. </sentence><sentence id="502">The Consul said, "Don't you know. </sentence><sentence id="503">This is the last train that is coming out of the southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="504">The...the Germans have invaded and taken over the southern part of France." </sentence><sentence id="505">So, of course, we felt good that we were out, but my brother-in-law was stilll back there. </sentence><sentence id="506">We took the train to Madrid, and my sister...my oldest sister was at the station. </sentence><sentence id="507">She had preceded us to Madrid because my mother thought maybe she could do something in Madrid to get her husband a transit visa. </sentence><sentence id="508">I said to my sister, "How did you know that we were here, that we were on this train?" </sentence><sentence id="509">And she said, "I know I have met every train that came from the border, and I am so happy to see you because I know I will never see Bob again." </sentence><sentence id="510">Now about that evening, we received a phone call from Barcelona or the Dutch consulate in Madrid received a phone call from Barcelona that my brother-in-law had made it safely out. </sentence><sentence id="511">The Germans marched into the southern part of France on May the 8th, and they came...they came from the north and they marched down through the south. </sentence><sentence id="512">By the time they had...they hadn't reached Marseille yet, but they were well on the way. </sentence><sentence id="513">My brother-in-law went back to the Spanish consul and said, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="514">The Germans are about here. </sentence><sentence id="515">Why don't you give me a visa and I give you all this money." </sentence><sentence id="516">And they took it. </sentence><sentence id="517">And he couldn't get a train out any more to Spain. </sentence><sentence id="518">He made it to the Spanish border and he walked a lot of pyranees...there was a tunnel, and somehow from there, he was taken to Barcelona. </sentence><sentence id="519">Going without a visa woud have been the same as death because in Spain they put all the people who did not have a transit visa or a visa, they put them in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="520">We knew of one that was called Miranda and the situation was so bad that few people survived that camp. </sentence><sentence id="521">They did not give them any food. </sentence><sentence id="522">They...the people were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="523">It was the worst and worse situation. </sentence><sentence id="524">As a matter of fact, there were two friends of my parents who had landed in that camp and who had never come out. </sentence><sentence id="525">Now we stayed about 4 days in Madrid and then we went to Lisbon where the Dutch government in...Dutch government was in exile in London at the time and they had arranged for a ship to pick all the Dutch people up and bring them to Dutch Guyana Surinam. </sentence><sentence id="526">And we were in Lisbon for few weeks, and we were about 75 Dutch people. </sentence><sentence id="527">We were put on this neutral Portugese ship and we were taken to Surinam. </sentence><sentence id="528">It was...I think it was something like a 3 week journey. </sentence><sentence id="529">The ship was only that because it was a neutral ship. </sentence><sentence id="530">We passed all the dark ships that were they were either German ships or and they were black...black out. </sentence><sentence id="531">About a day and a half before we got to the harbor of Paranami Surinam, we we could not go with the same ship into the harbor. </sentence><sentence id="532">The ship was too large for the harbor there. </sentence><sentence id="533">And we were taken off the ship and put on a Dutch ship that was considerably smaller. </sentence><sentence id="534">Everyone got seasick again because the ship was shaking so badly. </sentence><sentence id="535">We were on that ship for about this was the middle of the night that we were taken off the Portugese ship onto the Dutch ship and about 3 hours after we were on the ship, the ship was stopped by a German U-boat and some German soldiers came on board and at random took two of our Dutch people off. </sentence><sentence id="536">They just took two off. </sentence><sentence id="537">There was no reason at all. </sentence><sentence id="538">They was just being vicious. </sentence><sentence id="539">And...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="822">A: Yal. </sentence><sentence id="823">The two Dutch people were taken off this ship and we went on to Paramia. </sentence><sentence id="824">I remember it was morning and they played Dutch National Athem for us when we arrived, and everybody was crying. </sentence><sentence id="825">We were very emotional when we heard that because many of us never thought we would ever hear it again. </sentence><sentence id="826">The Governor of that Dutch Guyana was at that time a man by the name of Mr. Kilstra. </sentence><sentence id="827">He was not very keen on having 75 Jewish people come, which was unusual, because the Dutch people had always been very good to their Jewish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="828">And we had never felt any anti-Semitizm in the...while we lived in the Netherlands. </sentence><sentence id="829">But he was not very happy, and he had built what he called a refugee house for us. </sentence><sentence id="830">The refugee house was a hugh camp with barbed wire around it, and we were not allowed out. </sentence><sentence id="831">I was in the camp for 6 months. </sentence><sentence id="832">We...all the women were put in one great big room, on army cots, and all the men were sleeping in another room on army cots. </sentence><sentence id="833">They separated married couples, some of them for about a year because my mother was in the camp for a year. </sentence><sentence id="834">I was in there 5 months because a family had asked my mother if they could have my younger sister and myself live with them. </sentence><sentence id="835">And my mother...mother consented to that. </sentence><sentence id="836">So we were 6 months in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="837">We were made to do kitchen work which was unusual in a tropical country at that time because...not that there was anything wrong with doing kitchen work, but at that point the Governor made us do it because it was degrading. </sentence><sentence id="838">White people did not do any kitchen work at that time. </sentence><sentence id="839">Nobody minded all that much, but it was just a sign how he was trying to degrade us. </sentence><sentence id="840">We as I said...1 came out of that camp after 6 months and lived with a school teacher and his wife. </sentence><sentence id="841">The Dutch government in exile in London arranged for me to have private lessons because I had | more year to go to finish my lycee education and which after I would have finished that education I could have entered graduate work in a university. </sentence><sentence id="842">I got private lessons for about...uh..6 months and then the government, the Dutch government in exile set up an examination in London, sent it to the Minister of Education in Dutch Guyana and I took it in his office and was very happy that I passed. </sentence><sentence id="843">The reason why I had to take private lessons because they did not have a school there that was on the same level as a lycee. </sentence><sentence id="844">They had lower level high schools. </sentence><sentence id="845">After that I worked for a year with the Dutch customs office in Parimiabol, and I was then asked by the Netherlands Embassy in Washington, D.C., would I come to work there. </sentence><sentence id="846">My mother was very much opposed to it and at prior time I had wanted to train as a nurse and go with the Dutch with the Allied Army into the Netherlands with the occupation forces and to be trained in England, but my mother would not give permission be...and I had to have her permission because I wasn't 21 yet. </sentence><sentence id="847">And at that time she had said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="848">If you wanted to go to the United States, that would be something different. </sentence><sentence id="849">At least you would be in a safe country, but I do not want you training in England." </sentence><sentence id="850">And she did not want me to go with the occupation forces as a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="851">I did she did give the consent and I did leave for Washington, D.C. I was connected with the Dutch Embassy there for...for 2 years. </sentence><sentence id="852">It..it was a difficult period. </sentence><sentence id="853">I came withi 40 dollars in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="854">I had no clothes to speak of. </sentence><sentence id="855">Some seamstress in Dutch Guyana had made me some so-called gorgeous dresses, and when I arrived I looked absolutely hideous. </sentence><sentence id="856">My salary was not very high, but I made ends meet. </sentence><sentence id="857">I lived in a girl's hotel, Meridian Hill Hotel on 16th Street, which was at that time across the street from the Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="858">I did slowly get to know some Americans. </sentence><sentence id="859">I could not speak English. </sentence><sentence id="860">I had had 1 year of English and when the Germans marched in, they did away with all the English in the Netherlands and increased my German courses. </sentence><sentence id="861">I was...I had...when I was at the lycee, I had 3 hours of German and 3 hours of English and 3 hours of French a week, and they increased it to 6 hours of German and no English. </sentence><sentence id="862">So my German was quite good at the time, but my English was not. </sentence><sentence id="863">When I met some Americans it was interesting the advice I would receive from them. </sentence><sentence id="864">At that point I had hidden my Jewish identify for so long that I was actually afraid to tell people that I was Jewish, and I did not tell them either. </sentence><sentence id="865">So they would ask me why did I leave the Netherlands, and I had the same story that the German soldier was running after me, conditions were very bad, and we left it at that. </sentence><sentence id="866">They...the American people I met were all very kind and nice people and they had some very good advice as far as they were concerned for a 20 year old girl who came to this country all by herself. </sentence><sentence id="867">One of the things they told me, and this was told to me at least 10 times by 10 different Americans, that this is a good country, but I better watch out because there is a group of people I want to stay away from because they will cheat you and they will lie to you and I will be the worse of it if 1 believed and got in touch with these people. </sentence><sentence id="868">And I asked them who are these people. </sentence><sentence id="869">And they told me they are the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="870">I was flabbergasted that in a free democratic society they would just lump a whole group together and believe the lies that Hitler was trying to promote. </sentence><sentence id="871">I did argue against them from which I thought was a point of strength because they didn't know I was Jewish and so maybe I thought I had more clout arguing with them from that point of view. </sentence><sentence id="872">But I was, of course, very insecure in my religion. </sentence><sentence id="873">I...uh..I had written to my mother that I...was no way I was going to stay in this country because it was not democratic and it was very prejudiced against Jews and other minorities and that I absolutely could not live here. </sentence><sentence id="874">Now at that time I did have a very poor point of view of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="875">I had never studied American history. </sentence><sentence id="876">I did not know much about the geography of the United States because in the Netherlands the emphasis was on job. </sentence><sentence id="877">And I believe I learned more about the Far East than I did about the United States of America there. </sentence><sentence id="878">You cannot appreciate a country if you do not know the history of the country, and I didn't know the history of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="879">I felt that there was no democracy here. </sentence><sentence id="880">What changed all that I did get married, and I married a wonderful man. </sentence><sentence id="881">My husband came originally from Toronto, Canada, and he was...he was...when I met him, he was a resident in Surgery at Gallinger Hospital which is now I understand the District of Columbia Hospital. </sentence><sentence id="882">And he changed my whole way of thinking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
