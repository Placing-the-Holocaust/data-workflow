<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="14">Would you give us little information about your background and your childhood in Defiance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, I would say that my background is that of a normal school child, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="18">I played, participated in all sports. </sentence><sentence id="19">I lived with my father and mother. </sentence><sentence id="20">My father was born and raised in Germany, came to this country when he was 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="21">My mother is a native Ohioan from Defiance, her ancestors were some of the original settlers in Northwest Ohio. </sentence><sentence id="22">I spent my entire life in Defiance. </sentence><sentence id="23">I was the director of purchasing at a factory in Defiance when I was ordered to active duty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Do you have brothers and sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Yes, I have two brothers, and they are both deceased now. </sentence><sentence id="34">In fact, they both died in the same week. </sentence><sentence id="35">And so I had a funeral for each one of my brothers in the same week. </sentence><sentence id="36">Prior to that I had another brother and sister but they were deceased when they were very young so that I never knew them. </sentence><sentence id="37">They were about 2 years old, I guess, when they died. </sentence><sentence id="38">I spent my entire life...I joined the reserve unit and somebody said, "Why did you ever join the reserve?" </sentence><sentence id="39">And I said, "Well, I felt 1 owed an obligation to my country and my family and my God and that's the reason I was in there." </sentence><sentence id="40">They said, "Yeah, but if you hadn't been in the reserve, you would have never been in combat and war two." </sentence><sentence id="41">I said, "Well, that's beside the point." </sentence><sentence id="42">I joined the Reserve, no prior military experience and I did it all by correspondence, if you will, and association with the Ohio National Guard. </sentence><sentence id="43">And I received my commission as a Second Lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="44">And that was in 1934. </sentence><sentence id="45">And then I remained in the Reserve, which was nothing at that time, until I was ordered to active duty on June, the 9th, 1941, 6 months before Pearl Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="46">I was then ordered to Fort Knox, Kentucky, which was quite an experience, I can assure you, because it was the training center for all of the selective service people. </sentence><sentence id="47">We trained all of these people for a period of 13 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="48">Then comes Pearl Harbor, and the roof fell in, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="49">Things changed completely. </sentence><sentence id="50">All the guards that had been on duty in the camp previously had only blank ammunition, and from that time on, they were issued ball ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="51">All civilian clothing was sent home, and the entire training was stepped up and it was changed from 13 weeks to 11 weeks because we were in a hurry, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="52">And that is when the entire military concept of training and combat and everything else changed, from that time on. </sentence><sentence id="53">I was sent on a troop train shortly after Pearl Harbor, probably 2 weeks after that to Fort Ord, California, with, as I recall, about 250 trainees who were being deployed to the Pacific. </sentence><sentence id="54">And the West Coast, they were scared to death. </sentence><sentence id="55">Believe you me, they were. </sentence><sentence id="56">They  felt that the submarines were going to come in, but they never did, of course. </sentence><sentence id="57">And so that was the beginning of extensive training for combat in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="58">Shortly thereafter, I was ordered to Camp Poke, Louisiana, to a new division, the 11th Armored Division. </sentence><sentence id="59">We started training in Camp Poke, Louisiana, with all new troops and from thereon, we went to Louisiana maneuvers and from there we went to the desert for desert training, and from there to Fort Ord...or Camp Cook, California, and then from there overseas to England, and from there to Continental Europe to meet the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="60">That is briefly my background and our training in England was prior to crossing the channel for combat, and we were ordered in the combat...we had crossed the Channel and landed at Cherbourg, and we were supposed to go to Nancy, to come up from the south, and that's when the ball changed. </sentence><sentence id="61">And so we were immediately changed from going to Nancy to go through Paris and up to the Meuse River to prepare the Meuse...all the bridges on the Meuse River for demolition. </sentence><sentence id="62">We were not to contact the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="63">The Combat Command A on our left was supposed to probe, and not to meet them in any fire fight of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="64">So we then crossed, and we went in through Neufchateau, Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="65">And it was shortly thereafter that we hit that Bulge head on and we got hurt. </sentence><sentence id="66">I don't mind telling you. </sentence><sentence id="67">But we had good people in our organization, well trained, and then we caught our breath, if you will, after that first engagement and continued on, and when through Luxemburg and Belgium, France, Germany, into Czechoslovakia, a short distance and back out, and into Austria, and that's when we wound up with Mauthausen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: When did you first arrive in Austria? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: In Austria? </sentence><sentence id="106">I don't know for sure. </sentence><sentence id="107">01:08 It probably was the latter part of April of 45 because we were stopped, and it was May the 5th, when the restraining line stopped us which is across the river from...we were across the River from Linz, Austria, in the vicinity of Erfurt, which was Hitler's birthplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: What did you say...what caused your stop at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: The international restraining line the agreement was made at Yalta between Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt where they divided Europe which Berlin Wall was a result, plus the occupation of all of Eastern Europe by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="114">That, in my humble opinion...of course, that's all changed now, was that's the worst thing that even happened in Europe, was that international restraining line. </sentence><sentence id="115">01:09: </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: How did it come about that you came across the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: We sent a patrol out in a effort to keep in contact with the enemy or to contact the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="122">And since we couldn't go any further than the restraining line which was approximately a  mile or so on the other side of Mauthausen that's how we found it, because we were probing and that's about the best I can say is that in our attempt to keep contact with the enemy or contact the Russians, here was Mauthausen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: What happened after you came across the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: We had this patrol and the patrol leader called in by radio and said that we have across something that we are not sure what it is. </sentence><sentence id="128">It's a big prison of some kind, and there are people running all over. </sentence><sentence id="129">I said, "Well, is there any combat or shooting of any kind?" </sentence><sentence id="130">He said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="131">I said, "Well, you return. </sentence><sentence id="132">Bring the patrol and come back." </sentence><sentence id="133">And they reported into the headquarters and told me roughly what it was, and so I reinforced the patrol and I went back to Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="134">And that is when I made a complete inspection and came back and reported into General Degar, our division commander and told him what it was, and it was shortly after that report that he said to me on the telephone, "Dick," he said , "You will return to Mauthausen and take command." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: What did your patrol tell you they found? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Just a lot of people, lot of bodies, lot of people running around. </sentence><sentence id="146">There was no control of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="147">These people were strictly on their own and no one knew what was going on or what the situation was. </sentence><sentence id="148">Really and truly. </sentence><sentence id="149">They were like lost sheep. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: So you went back to the camp yourself for the inspection. </sentence><sentence id="156">What did you see and what did you inspect? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, first of all, all of these dead bodies piled up, like cord wood if you will. </sentence><sentence id="160">Sick people, dying people, starved people. </sentence><sentence id="161">And you take to an American such a sight as that, you can't imagine it. </sentence><sentence id="162">Things like that don't happen, but they did. </sentence><sentence id="163">And so we were actually and truly...the people that were with me, they were all dumbfounded. </sentence><sentence id="164">And when we went back the second time, I went in and went into the headquarters and the Russian major who had been a prisoner in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="165">He was sitting behind the desk and through an interpreter, I asked my interpreter to ask him what he was doing there? </sentence><sentence id="166">And he said well, they were in charge of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="167">They were going to run it, and they had all ready established a tribunal for the death of certain people. </sentence><sentence id="168">I said, "Will you please tell him that this is in the American zone, and that we are here and we are occupying the camp and it's our responsibility and we're going to run it." </sentence><sentence id="169">And he still wouldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="170">So I (laughing) I pulled my pistol out and I reached across the desk and I pointed it right in his face and through the interpreter I told him to tell that so and so that ifhe didn't get out of there, I was going to shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="171">And he and his party left immediately. ( </sentence><sentence id="172">Chuckle) And so that was our initial on the takeover of Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="173">My interpreter who lives in London, England...he's a Czech. </sentence><sentence id="174">His name is Primisol Dovias, and he remembers that to this very, very day 01:14:  because he and I correspond rather frequently and he a short time ago was telling one of his Canadian friends about what had happened, and I had letter from this (laughing) Canadian relative to our takeover and Primisol's part of the takeover. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Did you inspect the physical surroundings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: What were they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Terrible shape. </sentence><sentence id="199">The SS, when they left they disrupted the power plant. </sentence><sentence id="200">We had no lights, no power, no water, no sewage, no sanitation of any kind, and that is exactly what we found and we had to get that cleared up fast because of the health of the prisoners of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="201">Not only that, but my own people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: What did you do to straighten it out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: I wouldn't allow any of my people to handle any of these bodies or clean up any of the feces that were around or anything of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="209">I had all the prisoners do it, and I got one person from each nationality. </sentence><sentence id="210">There were 21 nations represented in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="211">I got a representative from each nation to pass on my wishes and desires, if you will, to the people of his own nationality so that they knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="212">Now, I think it was the second day. </sentence><sentence id="213">I'm not sure about this, but a fellow came in...one of my people came in and said, "You better come quick. </sentence><sentence id="214">There's trouble out in the main compound." </sentence><sentence id="215">I went out and here's four bodies on the street with their throats cut. </sentence><sentence id="216">There was fighting among people so there was only one thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="217">We got everybody inside the buildings by force with bayonets if you will to clear the streets, to get inside. </sentence><sentence id="218">We started at 8 o'clock in the morning and with a representative of each nationality, we segregated that entire camp by nationality, got them...Germans altogether, the Russians together, the Poles together, the Czechs together, the Spaniards, the Italians, all of the Slavic countries. </sentence><sentence id="219">That stopped the political problems that we were having with the people in the camp because they were fighting among themselves, and so we put a stop to that real quick. </sentence><sentence id="220">We, fortunately or unfortunately, we segregated in internal prisons inside the main compound all the Russians and all the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="221">We would not let them associate with anybody else because they were troublemakers. </sentence><sentence id="222">And so ...there was a Russian General came in into the camp and he asked me why I kept our Red brothers locked up. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I said, "Well, General, ...by an interpreter.., of course, I said, "You tell your people when they learn how to act, then they can get out, but not before." </sentence><sentence id="224">So that's some of the problems that we ran into which we never expected because we thought we were the great white liberators you know, and we're doing a tremendous job for these people, but it took them a long time to realize that we were there to help them, not to hurt them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: How many people did you have to administer in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Eighteen thousand in the camp at that time. </sentence><sentence id="245">We gathered up about 700 bodies, which we had  to bury. </sentence><sentence id="246">We had no identification of any kind, and we buried them in the old Sports Platz, which was the recreational area for the SS, playing soccer and baseball or whatever they played. </sentence><sentence id="247">The bodies, there were no identification on any of these people, and no one could identify any of them because some of them were in terrible condition. </sentence><sentence id="248">So we buried them in amass grave, about 700. </sentence><sentence id="249">We put a cross up over each grave. </sentence><sentence id="250">Of course, they were buried without benefit of casket or anything because we had to get rid of those bodies. </sentence><sentence id="251">And from that time on, anyone who died in Mauthausen received a cross or a Star of David, with their names on it, and they were thoroughly and totally identified, but prior to that we couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="252">| would guess that there was something like 1300 people died while we were there, and they were all identified properly so that all records maintained their nationality and their name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Did you bring in medical facilities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: We brought in two field hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="265">Huge installations! </sentence><sentence id="266">And anyone who had to be taken care of was assigned to these hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="267">Our medical records show that we had hospitalized, while we were there, about 5,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="268">And as soon as they were able to leave the hospital they left. </sentence><sentence id="269">And that's what we did until until the bulk of the people in the camp had gone home. </sentence><sentence id="270">Now when I left there and my people and I left, there was only about 3,000 or 3,500 people left. </sentence><sentence id="271">And they...the bulk of those people didn't want to go home. </sentence><sentence id="272">And there were quite a number of Jewish people left in the camp that did not wish to return to their homelands. </sentence><sentence id="273">In checking with these people, the older Jew wanted to go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="274">The younger Jews wanted to go to the United States, to England, or to France. </sentence><sentence id="275">And so those...I don't recall how many there were, but those were the ones that were left and the other people just didn't want to go home. </sentence><sentence id="276">Period! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Were these Jews that didn't want to go home or were these other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Other people that just didn't want to go back to their homelands. </sentence><sentence id="293">A lot of them were afraid to go because of what had just happened and what they had been through. </sentence><sentence id="294">Until it settled down. </sentence><sentence id="295">Now I don't know...I do not know the results of the 3,500 people, but I know that I was told that they had in Paris, I think it was Paris, a displaced camp for Jews, and all the Jews that were left in the camp were all sent to this displaced camp in I believe it was in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="296">At least it was in France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Were there any special problems that related to the Jewish inmates particularly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: No. [ </sentence><sentence id="305">had no problems at all. </sentence><sentence id="306">In fact as I mentioned to you previously I did not recognize a Jew as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="307">He was a human being just like anybody else and therefore he was treated as such. </sentence><sentence id="308">We did our dead level best for him to forget his past We put all of the Jewish  population in with their own nationality because I didn't feel that they should be segregated like they had been previously and so mistreated, that we put them in with their own people, all the Germans, the Hungarians or whatever they might be, whatever their nationality. </sentence><sentence id="309">They went in, but they didn't go in as Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Did any of the Jewish population have any feeling about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: They did, but then they got over it. </sentence><sentence id="319">I had a lot of pressure put on me from the Zionist organization from Zurich, why did I do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: And I told them very plainly why I did it. </sentence><sentence id="323">And but they couldn't quite understand that. </sentence><sentence id="324">And I said, "Well, may I say that you people have been persecuted for which I am very, very sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="328">But I don't want that to persist in this camp or have any feelings of persecution previously. </sentence><sentence id="329">I want your people to be a part of the rest of the world. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: You told me a little story about a Hungarian Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Oh ..Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="333">A Hungarian came in. </sentence><sentence id="334">He spoke excellent English and he asked me, he said, "I want to ask you why the Jews are not kept by themselves in this camp." </sentence><sentence id="335">And I told him, I said, "Well you people lived outside the main compound in tents, cold and you were treated very, very poorly." </sentence><sentence id="336">And I said, "I don't want that to happen." </sentence><sentence id="337">I said, "You are human beings just like anyone else," and I said, "What's your nationality?" </sentence><sentence id="338">He said, "I'm a Hungarian." </sentence><sentence id="339">I said, "Therefore, you will be housed with the Hungarians, not with just Jews." </sentence><sentence id="340">Well, it took a little time for him to let that soak in. </sentence><sentence id="341">I told him, I said, "Now, I want you to understand this." </sentence><sentence id="342">I said, "I'm from the United States America." </sentence><sentence id="343">And I said, "If you lived in the United States, you would be an American." </sentence><sentence id="344">In my book, you'd be just an American. </sentence><sentence id="345">You're not a Jew, because this is your religion. </sentence><sentence id="346">Judaism is your religion. </sentence><sentence id="347">If you are in the United States, you'd be an American. </sentence><sentence id="348">Period!" </sentence><sentence id="349">Well, it took him a little while but he finally recognized my feelings and whether I was right or wrong, I stuck with it right down to the very end, and I would not change my position at all. </sentence><sentence id="350">Even though a lot of pressure was put on me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: Were you aware of any dissention among the survivors in the camp within each nationality? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="354">The politics that existed between the different nationalities was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="355">I couldn't believe it and the rest of my staff, we couldn't understand why they were so-called fighting among themselves when they'd been under this horrible oppression, and here we thought we were doing them a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="356"> good turn. </sentence><sentence id="357">We were saving them from the horrible atrocities within the camp. </sentence><sentence id="358">And it took us quite awhile to get that over, but finally ...finally they realized that the Americans were there to help them the very best they could possibly could. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: You said when you originally went into the camp you did an inspection. </sentence><sentence id="360">Did you find any hospital supplies? </sentence><sentence id="361">What kind of food supplies did you find? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: Nothing! </sentence><sentence id="363">We didn't find anything. </sentence><sentence id="364">We found no supplies of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="365">No food. </sentence><sentence id="366">Fortunately, they were able to lead us to the potato, or the Kartoffel storage and that's the first food that we had served...was weak potato soup, the same as they've been getting, but we didn't have anything else. </sentence><sentence id="367">No medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="368">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="369">No clothing. </sentence><sentence id="370">Not a darn thing. </sentence><sentence id="371">So here we are, combat troops faced with a situation like that and it was very difficult for us I can assure you. </sentence><sentence id="372">In the camp was a very famous Czech surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="373">His name was Dr. Poloho. </sentence><sentence id="374">The Czechs told me that he was one of the most prominent and emminent surgeons in all of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="375">A fine gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="376">And they told me a story about Dr. Poloho. </sentence><sentence id="377">He was called into the camp commandant's office. </sentence><sentence id="378">He was working practically as an intern. </sentence><sentence id="379">The commandant of the camp said, "I have a lieutenant who is seriously ill, and I would like to have you operate. </sentence><sentence id="380">And Poloho told him, he said...well, he said, "Gee, I haven't done anything like that in a long time." </sentence><sentence id="381">And he said, "I'd need some time to prepare myself for this operation." </sentence><sentence id="382">This lieutenant had something wrong with his stomach. </sentence><sentence id="383">Zierice who was the commandant of the camp, told him: "Well, you have 15 minutes to prepare yourself." </sentence><sentence id="384">He said, "Now, if this lieutenant lives, I will put you in the base hospital which is strictly for military personnel and you will be in charge of that, but if he dies, so do you." </sentence><sentence id="385">And so Poloho operated and he was successful and the lieutenant lived and Poloho was then transferred to the base hospital which was a permanent building in the main compound. </sentence><sentence id="386">He's a fine gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="387">I remember him well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: Do you remember the conditions of the buildings that were in the camp and approximately how many people were living in them? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: You mentioned that there was a gas chamber; there was a crematorium, and there was administration buildings. </sentence><sentence id="472">Was there any other buildings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: Those were the only permanent buildings. </sentence><sentence id="476">The camp headquarters...I'm trying to recall in my mind now, as you went down the main street on the righthand side, there was a brick building and beneath that brick building was the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="477">The crematorium and believe it or not, a refrigerated room, and I said, "What in the world they have a refrigerated room here for?" </sentence><sentence id="478">They said, "Well, they would gas approximately 125 at a time in the shower room, and of course they were all dead in 15 or 20 minutes and they brought them out and the crematorium couldn't handle them that fast. </sentence><sentence id="479">So they had a refrigerated room where they put the bodies so that they wouldn't spoil. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="538">(laughing) He volunteered and they wouldn't take him. </sentence><sentence id="539">In fact, he showed me his leg. </sentence><sentence id="540">He's got a hole in his leg where one of the SS guards kicked him and badly injured his leg. </sentence><sentence id="541">They didn't take him. </sentence><sentence id="542">And he was so disappointed because he thought, "That's a way to get out of here." </sentence><sentence id="543">So they took 10 of them. </sentence><sentence id="544">They left the stone quarry and went toward this farm. </sentence><sentence id="545">And they got outside a distance and the machine guns on the tower opened up and 01:37: killed all 10 of them. </sentence><sentence id="546">He says, "Now, I'm glad I didn't go." </sentence><sentence id="547">But the stone quarry was really a hard labor place. </sentence><sentence id="548">The stones were used in buildings and...and transported out of Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="549">Oh, incidently, outside of...between the...the gas chamber and the crematorium was a small room. </sentence><sentence id="550">And that was a special execution chamber for Seereiss(?), </sentence><sentence id="551">the commandant of the camp, and Eichgruber, who is a Gauleiter of upper Austria. </sentence><sentence id="552">When they had somebody that they wanted to hang or kill, they had it in their own private execution room. </sentence><sentence id="553">The guard...the fellow who is a Pole, who ran the refrigerated room as well as putting the bodies in the crematories, gave me a ring. </sentence><sentence id="554">It was an army ring. </sentence><sentence id="555">And he said it was from a lieutenant that had been executed by Seereiss and Eichgruber, and wanted to know if I would accept it and return it to...well, there was no identification, but I did take the ring and I turned it over to proper elements of the 3rd army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="575">Q: Were you able to tell any difference between how the Jewish population and the non-Jewish population was treated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="577">A: (Sigh) Prior to our being there, I would say that the Jewish element in the camp, they were brutalized far worse than the rest of the population. </sentence><sentence id="578">That would be my humble opinion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="581">Q: Did you have any forewarning that you were coming upon the camp at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="583">A: None. </sentence><sentence id="584">None at all. </sentence><sentence id="585">We had no idea that there was on there, or what a concentration camp truly what it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: Unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="592">It's hard for me or any of my people who were with me to express how they felt to see man's inhumanity to man if you will. </sentence><sentence id="593">Unbelievable! </sentence><sentence id="594">As I mentioned before, I'd seen dead people, but never anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="595">It's absolutely and totally unbelievable that people could treat people like that. </sentence><sentence id="596">And I guess a lot of it's still going on today. </sentence><sentence id="597">I don't know why or how people can be so brutal. </sentence><sentence id="598">After all, we're all God's children and to treat one another the way they treated people and supposedly 6 million Jews and supposedly another 6  0 million non-Jews for a total of 12 million. </sentence><sentence id="599">That's a lot of people! </sentence><sentence id="600">That's a lot of people! </sentence><sentence id="601">And they were (sigh) I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="602">That...today I still do not...even after all this length of time...anybody mentions SS to me, I have absolutely no regard, respect or anything for anyone who is an SSer because you didn't have to be an SSer. </sentence><sentence id="603">That's a volunteer outfit. </sentence><sentence id="604">And they...they had strong backs and weak minds in my humble opinion. </sentence><sentence id="605">I have no love...I've been involved in a few things. </sentence><sentence id="606">In fact one time I got a call from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles wanting to know if I would, by telephone now, agree to speak to reporters from the Sun Times in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="607">They had called the Simon Wiesenthal Center. </sentence><sentence id="608">They called me. </sentence><sentence id="609">| told them that I would be happy to talk to them, so they called the Sun Times back and then they called me. </sentence><sentence id="610">They had found a person in Chicago who had been a former guard at Mauthausen and they picked my brains, of course, over the telephone, but asked me what my feelings were and, of course, they published in the paper. </sentence><sentence id="611">But I absolutely have no sympathy whatsoever for any SSer. </sentence><sentence id="612">The German Weirmacht altogether different. </sentence><sentence id="613">That's a German GI.He was a soldier doing a job just like any American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="614">Not brutal, like the SS. </sentence><sentence id="615">I probably should mention this that in Mauthausen we needed help and lots of it. </sentence><sentence id="616">So we found out that there was a German POW camp outside of Linz, Austria. </sentence><sentence id="617">So we sent back and asked for specialists. </sentence><sentence id="618">Electricians, plumbers, sanitation people, mechanics and all that sort of thing to send up to help us. </sentence><sentence id="619">We got about 400, brought them up, and we housed them, took care of them; classed them as German prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="620">Had a captain. </sentence><sentence id="621">I'll never forget his name. </sentence><sentence id="622">Captain von Brum we started to utilize these people, and the first time that they showed they were attacked by the prisoners and therefore again we had to take some very positive action and explain to these people that they were there to help us to help them. </sentence><sentence id="623">That they didn't know any more about a concentration camp than we did. </sentence><sentence id="624">So that calmed down. </sentence><sentence id="625">But those German Wehrmacht...I told this Captain, I said, "Any of those people who do not behave themselves as soldiers, get rid of them." </sentence><sentence id="626">So he did. </sentence><sentence id="627">And he sent back...I don't know, 50, 60 of them. </sentence><sentence id="628">The rest of them all did a fine job, and they were dumbfounded actually at what they saw in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="629">That was an experience with the German Wehrmacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: They were...I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="675">But they were not up to the Captain's wishes and desires, so he got rid of them, sent them back. </sentence><sentence id="676">What they did I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="692">A: Terrible. </sentence><sentence id="693">Same as ours. </sentence><sentence id="694">Now that's a German regular army soldier. </sentence><sentence id="695">And they didn't understand it all why such a thing existed. </sentence><sentence id="696">They'd heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="697">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="698">But not to the extent that they saw it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="712">A: 35 days. </sentence><sentence id="713">I spent in the camp right there for a solitary 5 days. </sentence><sentence id="714">I was not exactly a prisoner in the camp, but I was there and I knew exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="715">And relative to food, when we started out they have huge steam vats over in this one building, and the soup that they were serving was thin, watered soup. </sentence><sentence id="716">Well, my doctors told me, said, "Now look. </sentence><sentence id="717">These people have been on a severe diet, and you cannot feed them very much to start off with." </sentence><sentence id="718">So, as I mentioned, we found the potato storage, so we started out making very thin potato soup, same as they'd had previously. </sentence><sentence id="719">The most precious item in their diet was bread. </sentence><sentence id="720">You could get your throat cut for a piece of bread so big. </sentence><sentence id="721">They guarded a little bit of bread with their lives. </sentence><sentence id="722">We found an old bakery and we got some prisoners who had been bakers before and (laughing) you won't believe this, but you know all the Hullaballoo these days about oat bread and oats and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="723">Well, I think we originated that. </sentence><sentence id="724">Because we didn't have any wheat 01:47: and we didn't have yeast. </sentence><sentence id="725">But we started making bread out of oats. </sentence><sentence id="726">And we baked thousands and thousands of loaves, but, of course, when it first came out of the bakery or off and out of the ovens, was just a mass of dough, not having any yeast or any curing agents of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="727">So we put it in a big warehouse and let it age until it dried out. </sentence><sentence id="728">As soon as that happened we started giving each prisoner a slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="729">Oh, my. </sentence><sentence id="730">The most precious thing they could have had. </sentence><sentence id="731">Well, we kept building up our bread supply, so finally we got to the point where we gave them two slices. </sentence><sentence id="732">And then a quarter of a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="733">And then a half a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="734">And (laughing) they...they came in and said, "We don't want any more bread. </sentence><sentence id="735">We got enough." ( </sentence><sentence id="736">laughing) We got a tremendous charge out of that, but then we found in Linz, Austria a warehouse of dehydrated vegetables which we started adding to the potato soup which enhanced it a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="737">Then the doctor said, "Well, they're coming along pretty good." </sentence><sentence id="738">So we started butchering horses, and we feed them horse meat, bread, dehydrated vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="739">Not soup, but dehydrated vegetables, and potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="740">And my oh my, what a change in their diets. </sentence><sentence id="741">And fortunately, none of them got sick, but yours truly, I sampled every meal of food that was served in that camp to make sure that what they were getting was good because I had supervisors in the kitchen, but the prisoners in the camp were doing the cooking. </sentence><sentence id="742">But my mess people, they were supervising so I wanted to make sure that what they were getting was good so I had a sample of every bit of food that was served in that camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: Where did the horses come from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="777">A: The countryside where...in fact, there were a lot of German army horses that had been driven ahead of the combat. </sentence><sentence id="778">And I was surprised to learn that the Germans used hundreds or thousands of horses in their units for transportation. </sentence><sentence id="779">The first time that we found that out was  2 when we were going toward the Rhine River and all of these horses, just hundreds and hundreds of them had come up to the river and, of course, the Germans took off and went across the river and here's all these horses. </sentence><sentence id="780">That was long before we got to Mauthausen, but that's where a lot of the horses came from, and plus any that we decided that we needed to take care of our people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="785">Q: Did any of the surrounding civilian population help? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A: They didn't help a nickel's worth except when we started burying all the bodies that we found, we went to the people in town and around and got their services to handle these bodies and bury them. </sentence><sentence id="788">And oh my or my, did that create 01:51: a terrible outcry among the people and I know there was a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="789">One of them was a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="790">And my chaplain was my chief burial officer, and this dentist was giving him a bad time. </sentence><sentence id="791">He said he wasn't going to do anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="792">Now, Dave Kinsler was the Chaplain (Laughing). </sentence><sentence id="793">He hauled off and hit him. ( </sentence><sentence id="794">Laughing) When Dave told me about, I said, "That's all right." </sentence><sentence id="795">But some of the people objected because it was a lousy job. </sentence><sentence id="796">Really and truly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: You said you were there for 35 days. </sentence><sentence id="810">What caused you to move on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: We were transferred out from that particular part and I can't think of the name of the infantry division that came in and took over after we left, but we were moved down into the Austrian Alps to be on so-called combat occupation because the Werewolves were supposed to be starting up again down in the valley where we were going and we were to combat them if necessary, but it never happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: The new unit that came in, did they administer the camp as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="817">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="818">I lost all contact with it after...after we left I knew nothing of what went on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="821">Q: Any final comment you'd like to make? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: No, except that I'm terribly sorry that it happened and I don't know how you can stop it really and truly. </sentence><sentence id="824">They're having miserable problems in the Middle East now and I'm a little worried as to what might happen there. </sentence><sentence id="825">The treatment of the Jew, I don't understand it to this day. </sentence><sentence id="826">Why? </sentence><sentence id="827">Just because a person was a Jew, why they were segregated. </sentence><sentence id="828">While we were there, there was a special ambassador by the name of Edward Pauling who was sent by President not Roosevelt, Truman to contact and make a survey, if you will, of the Jewish population and the elements around, and it was in Germany in particular. </sentence><sentence id="829">I have a letter from him at home thanking me for what...all the information and everything that went on while he was there. </sentence><sentence id="830">He spent a whole day interviewing the Jews in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="831">And he told me that in all of Germany, the best they could estimate, there were only 25,000 Jews left in the whole  3 country. </sentence><sentence id="832">That's that's extermination wholesale really. </sentence><sentence id="833">To this day, there are a lot of people that do not understand what the Holocaust was. </sentence><sentence id="834">A lot of them don't want to know. </sentence><sentence id="835">It's not very pleasant history. </sentence><sentence id="836">School children. </sentence><sentence id="837">My goodness gracious, I have spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school children about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="838">Showed them pictures and everything else, and it's kind of hard for those children to believe that actually and truly happened. </sentence><sentence id="839">But somehow or other, the children of this world and the young people of this world have to be apprised of what happened so that it never happens again. </sentence><sentence id="840">It can't happen again because 01:55 it...it more like...I just can't describe it. </sentence><sentence id="841">I... truly can't because until you have been involved with a thing like the Holocaust it's very difficult to explain it to people and have them understand. </sentence><sentence id="842">Another thing that happened at Mauthausen with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="843">They brought about 700 of them in and said that they were all dirty and they needed a shower. </sentence><sentence id="844">So they took them in a big shower room and they all had nice, warm showers and they brought them all out into the compound, the main compound. </sentence><sentence id="845">Nude and squirted them with a fire hose in very, very cold weather until they all died. </sentence><sentence id="846">And if they didn't die from exposure and shock the first time, they took them back in and give them more showers and brought them back out until they were all dead. </sentence><sentence id="847">Now, again, I didn't see that, but that is official testimony and I'm sure that if you're to check with any former prisoner of Mauthausen they could verify what I have said. </sentence><sentence id="848">A gentleman from New York...he is a Czech by the name of Boshak, who is a prisoner in the camp, a Czech, a very intelligent man, came to Defiance to see me. </sentence><sentence id="849">He'd been a prisoner there. </sentence><sentence id="850">He was a Czech and I think he was an attorney and he had married a lady and they lived in New York. </sentence><sentence id="851">But I had an interview with President Benes of Czechoslovakia, a wonderful discussion with him. </sentence><sentence id="852">And he was talking about Hitler and all the rest of the things and they used Mauthausen...they had sent a lot of radio and press people, magazine people to Mauthausen to write about it and question everybody and they used Mauthausen as a horrible example of Nazi atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="853">He was rather flowing and enjoying in his admiration for the American people. </sentence><sentence id="854">And this I gotta say. </sentence><sentence id="855">Do you know that there wasn't one solitary person, except two French nurses, that came into the camp that ever lent a hand. </sentence><sentence id="856">Not one other country in this world never helped at all in Mauthausen with any assistance of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="857">That's kind of hard to believe. ( </sentence><sentence id="858">laughing) These two French nurses came in one night about 2 O'clock. ( </sentence><sentence id="859">Laughing) I couldn't speak French and I had a heck of a time. </sentence><sentence id="860">Finally, some...found somebody that could interpret, and they were there to help with the hospital and the sick people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="902">A: I don't have anything else. </sentence><sentence id="903">I trust I haven't bored anybody with what I'm speaking of, but it's a long time ago and people have asked me, "How can you remember all of these things so vividly?" </sentence><sentence id="904">I said, "Well, it only happens to you once in your life time, and you can't forget a thing like that." </sentence><sentence id="905">People said has it affected you mentally or otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="906">I said, "No, I just...just one of those memories that you let go by." </sentence><sentence id="907"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
