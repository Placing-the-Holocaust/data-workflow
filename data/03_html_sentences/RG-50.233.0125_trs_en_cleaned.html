<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1762">A: I have no -- that you would have to check records. </sentence><sentence id="1763">Because all I could see that one little piece, that one little street, I never knew the leader, any second names. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I knew one face, one man and suspected another, so if I was caught I could be tortured to death, I had nobody to tell on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
