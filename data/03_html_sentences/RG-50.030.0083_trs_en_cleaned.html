<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: With my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="145">And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a...a prayer shawl, a tallis [NB: tallith] they call it. </sentence><sentence id="146">So they made these men put on these _tallisen, these prayer shawls, and they told them to start praying. </sentence><sentence id="147">And while they were praying, they started beating on them and they started cutting their beards. </sentence><sentence id="148">So my poor grandfather... and my...my mother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his rescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...if you go near there. </sentence><sentence id="149">So this poor old man had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of the beard. </sentence><sentence id="150">And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard. </sentence><sentence id="151">So he continued crying for a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him. </sentence><sentence id="152">So she told...she gave him a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on his hat, you know. </sentence><sentence id="153">The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats. </sentence><sentence id="154">And that's how he walked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard. </sentence><sentence id="155">First of all, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to see himself. </sentence><sentence id="156">So we stood in the ghetto for a few weeks and then when they got enough people into the ghetto for a train, for a full train load... It took about another six weeks to get these people together from all these little towns into this ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="157">And they gave us...they lined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the train and they told us they're relocating us. </sentence><sentence id="158">They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work. </sentence><sentence id="159">And they gave us a bucket there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these cattle cars, it was so packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person on...on him. </sentence><sentence id="160">So...then when we were packed into this cattle car they locked the door from the outside and we stayed in this cattle car until it...it was midnight and midnight the train started going. </sentence><sentence id="161">You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children. </sentence><sentence id="162">It was really, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="163">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="164"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection really chaotic there inside. </sentence><sentence id="165">We didn't know where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="166">So it...you know, it was so noisy and it was so tense. </sentence><sentence id="167">I...[ don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of older people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill. </sentence><sentence id="168">So they were laying there with us. </sentence><sentence id="169">When we got to Auschwitz, and we really didn't know about Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="170">The thing is that they...these cattle cars, they had windows on top, small windows. </sentence><sentence id="171">So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's shoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is. </sentence><sentence id="172">So as we were driving through the country side I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see what's going...what's...what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="173">And I saw the farmers showing to me like this (finger across throat). </sentence><sentence id="174">I...I really didn't know what they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="175">And...and a young adult it just didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something. </sentence><sentence id="176">But it was strange to see these farmers. </sentence><sentence id="177">They were all showing like this (finger across the throat). </sentence><sentence id="178">I told my sister. </sentence><sentence id="179">I told my mother that that's what they were showing me. </sentence><sentence id="180">Well, anyway when we got to Auschwitz it sort of didn't sink in. </sentence><sentence id="181">I didn't expect that I was brought to a death camp. </sentence><sentence id="182">I just didn't. </sentence><sentence id="183">But when I got to Auschwitz and they opened the doors and the SS with the dogs were standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the camp, a very big flame. </sentence><sentence id="184">And it smelled. </sentence><sentence id="185">It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something. </sentence><sentence id="186">And the SS were screaming, "Heraus! </sentence><sentence id="187">Heraus! </sentence><sentence id="188">Heraus!"
