I was together with my family and with my neighbors and everybody else there. </sentence><sentence id="54">But then we were occupied by the Hungarians and a few years later we were occupied by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="55">So when the Germans came in, this is when I started seeing and feeling different things. </sentence><sentence id="56">Now the difference was that we weren't allowed to go out at night anymore. </sentence><sentence id="57">We weren't allowed to go shopping, only at a certain time. </sentence><sentence id="58">But it didn't take long, maybe six weeks after the occupation by the Germans, that we were rounded up and we were taken to a...uh....ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="59">And that is to Uzhgorod [Czech: U_horod]. </sentence><sentence id="60">That was the capital of Carpathia. </sentence><sentence id="61">Now that was something that was horrible in my life and actually what happened was maybe four weeks after the Germans were there, they took my brothers and my father away and they told us that they're going to be in a work camp. </sentence><sentence id="62">You know, that they weren't going to be in the army, but they gonna be working. </sentence><sentence id="63">So my mother and, and us children--my grandparents were there--left. </sentence><sentence id="64">A few weeks later after they took my father and my two brothers away, this is when they rounded us up and...and took us to that ghetto actually. </sentence><sentence id="65">In the ghetto it was, you know, we were sleeping on the floors, on concrete, but we had blankets that we took from home when we left the house. </sentence><sentence id="66">They ...uh...told us that we can...we've got to leave everything except only what we can take with ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="67">So I remember my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="68">He was...uh...a very old man. </sentence><sentence id="69">He was past 80. </sentence><sentence id="70">And he had a box...he had a Torah. </sentence><sentence id="71">I don't know how to explain it. </sentence><sentence id="72">The Ten Commandments or whatever...a Torah. </sentence><sentence id="73">And he did not want to leave it because he felt that wherever he is going to be, we will be needing it. </sentence><sentence id="74">How can we live without it? </sentence><sentence id="75">So, we had to deal with that. </sentence><sentence id="76">We...we wrapped that Torah up and we carried it with us. ( </sentence><sentence id="77">Sigh) When we got to...uh...the ghetto, the older people were using it. </sentence><sentence id="78">You know, they were still very religious and they felt that this Torah perhaps is going to save us or the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: How did they carry the Torah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: We carried it in...by...in our hands. </sentence><sentence id="110">You know we wrapped it up in sheets and whatever we had and we just carried it with us. </sentence><sentence id="111">But when we got to the...when we got to the...you know, into the ghetto, every day it was somehow worse. </sentence><sentence id="112">Sometimes they wouldn't let us have water. </sentence><sentence id="113">Sometimes they wouldn't let us get out of the barracks and what we lived on is on soup. </sentence><sentence id="114">They gave us soup and...and bread. </sentence><sentence id="115">So that in itself was a horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="116">But still you were with the family, especially me as a young adolescent. </sentence><sentence id="117">I wasn't paying much attention to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How old were you at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: I was between 13 and 14 in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="130">But then all of a sudden they, the Germans, you know, came on the loud speaker and they told that every older Jew that has a beard and he's got to report to a certain barrack. </sentence><sentence id="131">And, of course, we didn't know what will happen there with them. </sentence><sentence id="132">So my mother went along with him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: With whom? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: With my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="140">And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a...a prayer shawl, a tallis [NB: tallith] they call it. </sentence><sentence id="141">So they made these men put on these _tallisen, these prayer shawls, and they told them to start praying. </sentence><sentence id="142">And while they were praying, they started beating on them and they started cutting their beards. </sentence><sentence id="143">So my poor grandfather... and my...my mother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his rescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...if you go near there. </sentence><sentence id="144">So this poor old man had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of the beard. </sentence><sentence id="145">And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard. </sentence><sentence id="146">So he continued crying for a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him. </sentence><sentence id="147">So she told...she gave him a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on his hat, you know. </sentence><sentence id="148">The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats. </sentence><sentence id="149">And that's how he walked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard. </sentence><sentence id="150">First of all, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to see himself. </sentence><sentence id="151">So we stood in the ghetto for a few weeks and then when they got enough people into the ghetto for a train, for a full train load... It took about another six weeks to get these people together from all these little towns into this ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="152">And they gave us...they lined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the train and they told us they're relocating us. </sentence><sentence id="153">They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work. </sentence><sentence id="154">And they gave us a bucket there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these cattle cars, it was so packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person on...on him. </sentence><sentence id="155">So...then when we were packed into this cattle car they locked the door from the outside and we stayed in this cattle car until it...it was midnight and midnight the train started going. </sentence><sentence id="156">You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children. </sentence><sentence id="157">It was really, really chaotic there inside. </sentence><sentence id="158">We didn't know where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="159">So it...you know, it was so noisy and it was so tense. </sentence><sentence id="160">I...[ don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of older people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill. </sentence><sentence id="161">So they were laying there with us. </sentence><sentence id="162">When we got to Auschwitz, and we really didn't know about Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="163">The thing is that they...these cattle cars, they had windows on top, small windows. </sentence><sentence id="164">So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's shoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is. </sentence><sentence id="165">So as we were driving through the country side I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see what's going...what's...what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I saw the farmers showing to me like this (finger across throat). </sentence><sentence id="167">I...I really didn't know what they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="168">And...and a young adult it just didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something. </sentence><sentence id="169">But it was strange to see these farmers. </sentence><sentence id="170">They were all showing like this (finger across the throat). </sentence><sentence id="171">I told my sister. </sentence><sentence id="172">I told my mother that that's what they were showing me. </sentence><sentence id="173">Well, anyway when we got to Auschwitz it sort of didn't sink in. </sentence><sentence id="174">I didn't expect that I was brought to a death camp. </sentence><sentence id="175">I just didn't. </sentence><sentence id="176">But when I got to Auschwitz and they opened the doors and the SS with the dogs were standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the camp, a very big flame. </sentence><sentence id="177">And it smelled. </sentence><sentence id="178">It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something. </sentence><sentence id="179">And the SS were screaming, "Heraus! </sentence><sentence id="180">Heraus! </sentence><sentence id="181">Heraus!" " </sentence><sentence id="182">Get out! </sentence><sentence id="183">Get out!" </sentence><sentence id="184">Some of them were trying to go out and whoever couldn't go out, they were helping each other. </sentence><sentence id="185">Like my sister...I had two sisters coming with me. </sentence><sentence id="186">One was holding on to my grandmother because she was old and she couldn't walk very well, so she was trying to help her out. </sentence><sentence id="187">My mother was holding onto my brother and sort of trying to hold on to me to. </sentence><sentence id="188">But what they did is they pulled my brother away from her. </sentence><sentence id="189">They...they pushed my brother to the left and my mother and my other sister and me to the right. </sentence><sentence id="190">So my little brother noticed that my mother is going a different way so he started running after her and they started beating on him. </sentence><sentence id="191">And my mother    heard his voice so she was...she looked back, so she was running back to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="192">And then they started beating on her. </sentence><sentence id="193">So she was pleading. </sentence><sentence id="194">She went on her knees pleading to that SS man to please let me go for this is my child and he won't be able to survive without me. </sentence><sentence id="195">He's so little. </sentence><sentence id="196">He was six years old. </sentence><sentence id="197">So after they beat her up, they pushed her to the left with my brother and there I remained with my sister. </sentence><sentence id="198">We were trying to run with my sister...my mother too but they wouldn't let us because when we got to Auschwitz they already needed a manpower. </sentence><sentence id="199">Of course, at that time we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="200">So they wouldn't let us. </sentence><sentence id="201">And we looked pretty...you know, we looked pretty healthy yet. </sentence><sentence id="202">So they wouldn't let us run to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="203">So they started beating on us, on my sister and me. </sentence><sentence id="204">And my sister says to him, "You know, something smells terrible here." </sentence><sentence id="205">He says, "Well, we're just roasting pigs." </sentence><sentence id="206">And...uh...then you see these mothers coming down with little kids and they're...they're trying to pull these kids out of their mother's hands. </sentence><sentence id="207">And, you know, when you try to separate a family, it's very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="208">It's very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="209">People put up fights. </sentence><sentence id="210">It...it was so much screams. </sentence><sentence id="211">So there was a truck. </sentence><sentence id="212">I remember that truck. </sentence><sentence id="213">So the parents, the...the mothers that wouldn't give up these children and they were beaten up and the kids got hurt, so they grabbed these kids and they threw them on the truck and they really didn't look how they throwing them on the truck. </sentence><sentence id="214">So at that time we saw that something horrible is happening the way these people were behaving to little children, to little babies. </sentence><sentence id="215">And, of course, on that truck there were people, you know, very sick people going, you know, they were throwing sick people there and...and...and these children that gave them a tough time. </sentence><sentence id="216">They were just thrown on the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="217">And there were so many mothers that were running after the trucks, and of course they beat them and they pushed them back. </sentence><sentence id="218">So that was the opening of these...of these train doors. </sentence><sentence id="219">This is the first thing that I have seen there. </sentence><sentence id="220">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="306">Keep talking. </sentence><sentence id="307">Tell..tell me more about...tell me more about what happened at Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="308">What happened with the--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="314">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="315">So...uh...that...that big fire so maybe being that my sister and I was so young, it was like scary. </sentence><sentence id="316">It was...felt like you're going into the fire. </sentence><sentence id="317">And as we were walking, the people that worked there, they told us... they told us that they're gas...you know, they're...they're gassing more people than they can burn in the crematorium so they had to...they have to burn them in the pits. </sentence><sentence id="318">And we still...we thought that some person is just being cruel telling us that. </sentence><sentence id="319">So...and we walked, we walked, you know, they had a long line of young people walking and as we were approaching these barracks there, there was...we heard music. </sentence><sentence id="320">There was a man is telling us that they are burning people because they can't burn them in the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="321">They can gas more than they can burn. </sentence><sentence id="322">And here we hear music! </sentence><sentence id="323">It was very, very confusing to us. </sentence><sentence id="324">When we got closer, our room...a...a... a barrack or whatever you want to call it, opened up and they told us to undress. </sentence><sentence id="325">And, of course, you know, the SS were walking around there and there was so many girls that didn't want to underess completely and they started beating on them and they had to get undressed. </sentence><sentence id="326">And then they started shaving our heads and...uh...1 remember staying there and these SS walking around us and if the girls would put down their heads, just trying to, just trying to hide, they would come up and they would take their whip and they would pull their heads up like this with the whip and they would look at us and then they would start whipping us. </sentence><sentence id="327">So we...we felt that there is something terrible going on but we didn't, still didn't think that maybe people are being put into a gas chamber either. </sentence><sentence id="328">So then we took a shower and they gave us a...uh...a striped dress and they gave us wooden clogs and that striped dress had a number. </sentence><sentence id="329">And that took place during the night. </sentence><sentence id="330">We kept on asking where's...where's my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="331">Where's my mother? </sentence><sentence id="332">Where's the rest of them? </sentence><sentence id="333">Because we thought we'll meet someplace. </sentence><sentence id="334">They didn't...you know we...they separated us right and left, my mother and my brother and my grandmother and my grandfather, my family went to the left and my sister and I were the only one from my family that I found myself with so we kept on asking each other where...where is the rest of them. </sentence><sentence id="335">Nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="336">Nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="337">Nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="338">And then when they gave us the dress and they lined us up after a long, long time. </sentence><sentence id="339">You know, by the time they shaved a thousand girls" heads, it takes a long time. </sentence><sentence id="340">And...uh...it was...it was at night. </sentence><sentence id="341">I remember it was at night. </sentence><sentence id="342">And they let us into our barrack. </sentence><sentence id="343">They...you know, they took us to our barrack. </sentence><sentence id="344">When we got to that barrack, there were, you know, like on the bottom there was three...uh...three different parts to that...to where we had to go and sit down or lay down. </sentence><sentence id="345">So I was on... remember, on top of that thing...on top of that bed or whatever you would call it. </sentence><sentence id="346">And I would just sit there and my sister and we...we had...we were six girls to a place...uh...maybe that...that wide, and we would have to just lay there and we were just wondering what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="347">We just...we couldn't figure it out. </sentence><sentence id="348">So these barracks were made...they were made out of wood and there were cracks between them. </sentence><sentence id="349">So early in the morning they took us out around 4 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="350">It was dark yet and I wasn't looking around too much. </sentence><sentence id="351">So they let us stay there for an hour and they were counting us and...uh...after they count us they told us we can go back in there. </sentence><sentence id="352">That was the first night. </sentence><sentence id="353">That was the first morning. </sentence><sentence id="354">When we got back in it was already about, you know, daylight and I took a look through the cracks and I saw people hanging on these wire fences. </sentence><sentence id="355">It was such a terrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="356">I wasn't...I just wasn't prepared for all that. </sentence><sentence id="357">And I say to my sister, "Look what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="358">You know, look what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="359">People are...are hanging on these fences. </sentence><sentence id="360">They're dead." </sentence><sentence id="361">They were got electrocuted because many of them...some of them were aware of the electric fences and some of them thought maybe they want to escape or to go look for their parents or go look for their family. </sentence><sentence id="362">So they...they were hanging there. </sentence><sentence id="363">We were    in all day. </sentence><sentence id="364">All day we were in. </sentence><sentence id="365">In the morning they gave us some soup and all day we were there and wondering what will happen. </sentence><sentence id="366">And, of course, we were locked in from the outside so there was no way to get out to see where we are, what's happening, what's going on because... because whatever happened, whatever they did with us, it was always during the night. </sentence><sentence id="367">So at night they...they brought in some bread and they gave us a slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="368">And again during the night they were taking us to the bathrooms. </sentence><sentence id="369">It was also again a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="370">So we got to this bathroom everybody in... There was water. </sentence><sentence id="371">So everybody was trying to wash their faces or go to the bathroom, but it was...those... those Kapos...you know, these Kapos were people that were taking care of us, watching over us. </sentence><sentence id="372">They started beating us like if...you know, I remember I sit down to want to go to the bathroom like a human being. </sentence><sentence id="373">It was...and she started beating on me because she thought I was there too long. </sentence><sentence id="374">I was black and blue from her. </sentence><sentence id="375">My sister got me to..to where the water was running and she was trying to wash me up. </sentence><sentence id="376">And that was the experience the first day, first... second day. </sentence><sentence id="377">And...uh ... finally, you know, after everybody sort of got their beating, knowing, you know, saw how we were treated, they lined us up again and they took us back to that barrack. </sentence><sentence id="378">And that was during the night. </sentence><sentence id="379">The next day, again, they got us out at 4 o'clock and they told us to stay for an hour. </sentence><sentence id="380">So the next day, the people that were a little bit weaker couldn't stay for an hour. </sentence><sentence id="381">It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="382">They couldn't stay for an hour so they sort of like collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="383">So what happened was they came and they pull these girls out, these people out and they...also a truck came and they threw them on the truck. </sentence><sentence id="384">And...uh...when we were in Auschwitz, we never...we never knew where these people are going once they were on the truck. </sentence><sentence id="385">Because I think if a lot of people they would have known once they get on the truck that they'll never see the light again, I think maybe they would have tried harder right at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="386">But...uh... they didn't know so they...that's how it was going on for about...1 was in Auschwitz for about five weeks with this routine. </sentence><sentence id="387">And...uh...every morning, they just pulled other...other people out because they    just..they just ...some of them were just giving up somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="388">You know, they ...the beating was...was so bad that I think they just didn't wanta live right of death. </sentence><sentence id="389">They just didn't wanta a go through everyday this...this beating. </sentence><sentence id="390">So...so we were weeded out, but thank God, one day a Kapo came in and said that we have to line up again. </sentence><sentence id="391">That was after already we were lined up. </sentence><sentence id="392">And they looked everybody over. </sentence><sentence id="393">Whoever looked strong enough to them, they again put them to the right and me and my sister was put to the right and then other girls were put to the left and they...the girls from the right were taken away, and the girls from the left stayed...stayed where they were. </sentence><sentence id="394">And they put us in another barrack with...by the time we got there, there were already other girls there. </sentence><sentence id="395">And during the night, they took us to the...to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="396">But we recognized the railroad station because when we got to Auschwitz, I remember the sign. </sentence><sentence id="397">The sign said...uh..-uh... "Arbeit macht das Leben siiB."_ I don't know if you understand. </sentence><sentence id="398">It said that "work makes...uh...uh...life happy [sweet]"...something like that." </sentence><sentence id="399">So when we got to the station, we were glad that...we felt we were going to get out of this place; because, as you know, I mean, getting out from Auschwitz by a gate and not by chimney, I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="400">So we were...we were maybe a thousand girls there. </sentence><sentence id="401">And they...again they put us into...uh...to cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="402">And we stayed in these cattle cars, you know, the rest of the night and during the day. </sentence><sentence id="403">The cattle cars didn't move, but we were locked in. </sentence><sentence id="404">Yal, they also gave us a bread. </sentence><sentence id="405">And during the night...during the night, we heard like bombs were exploding and that noise. </sentence><sentence id="406">We were...we were...we were kinda happy. </sentence><sentence id="407">We were...we were figuring maybe they're going to bomb the tracks and these people aren't going to be coming. </sentence><sentence id="408">Because I left some uncles and aunts in the ghetto and a lot of my family in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="409">So I...you know, I was talking to my sister and the other girls and we were saying, "Oh, My God, they're gonna...they're bombing the tracks." </sentence><sentence id="410">We weren't deg Possibly "Arbeit Macht Frei"; "Work makes one free." </sentence><sentence id="411">   moving. </sentence><sentence id="412">The bombing the tracks in...you know, the family we left behind isn't going to come here. </sentence><sentence id="413">But...uh... that...that was maybe for an hour, an hour and a half, that noise constantly...constantly. </sentence><sentence id="414">And all of a sudden it stopped. </sentence><sentence id="415">It stopped and we're sitting there in that railroad...in that car. </sentence><sentence id="416">In the middle of the night all of a sudden...and we thought that maybe that...that it was bombed and that's why they're not taking us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="417">But in the middle of the night, again, we started off. </sentence><sentence id="418">We went...they ...they...you know the train started moving. </sentence><sentence id="419">And so when we also didn't know, you know, where we're going or what happens. </sentence><sentence id="420">Nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="421">They didn't tell us what was happening to us, what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="422">So...uh...but we were stronger people. </sentence><sentence id="423">We were, you know, we were weeded out. </sentence><sentence id="424">We were healthier. </sentence><sentence id="425">We were healthier. </sentence><sentence id="426">So we were just trying to talk and figure out what this world is coming to, what's happening, and that...you know, you didn't see anybody saying anything except the beatings and...and the brutalities and...(sigh)... Finally, after a couple of days we wound up...it...it was in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="427">They took us to Germany and, again, we were walking from these trains and they took us in again to barracks like in Auschwitz but...but it was smaller. </sentence><sentence id="428">It was a smaller camp. </sentence><sentence id="429">It was a smaller camp. </sentence><sentence id="430">And they put us into these barracks again and they gave us some soup. </sentence><sentence id="431">And the next day, again, they putting us out and they told us to get out again. </sentence><sentence id="432">For a hour we had to stay in line and they were counting us. </sentence><sentence id="433">And after that they gave us a slice of bread and some soup and they told us to march. </sentence><sentence id="434">We should go. </sentence><sentence id="435">And we...we marched and marched maybe for an hour and we got to a munition factory. </sentence><sentence id="436">When we got to the muniton factory, they took these girls and placed them in different places. </sentence><sentence id="437">And they placed me near a... uh... near a...uh...like...it was like a pump, to pump the explosive into bombs. </sentence><sentence id="438">They were maybe [motioning] that tall. </sentence><sentence id="439">And I had to do it so fast that it was going with the machine and as the machine was working, I had to work with the machine. </sentence><sentence id="440">So, of course, in the beginning it was okay because I still wasn't that weakened. </sentence><sentence id="441">But after awhile, you know, the little bit of hair that we had became red from the poison,    from that gunpowder. </sentence><sentence id="442">Our eyes were yellow. </sentence><sentence id="443">Our bodies were yellow. </sentence><sentence id="444">The reason why is because we worked night shifts and day shifts. </sentence><sentence id="445">So the night shift, and we worked the night shift, they closed the doors and the windows so we had no circulation. </sentence><sentence id="446">So this poison was going into our system. </sentence><sentence id="447">When we worked during the day, it wasn't too bad because the doors and the windows were open. </sentence><sentence id="448">So there weren't that many girls that were falling, but during the night is when a lot of girls just fainted and just... just died because the body was full of poison. </sentence><sentence id="449">Well, anyway, we were working there for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="450">We got weakened and my sister...she's two years older. </sentence><sentence id="451">And at that time I just felt mentally that I can't go on anymore. </sentence><sentence id="452">Besides physically...1 was physically broken. </sentence><sentence id="453">So what she would do is she would give her slice of bread and she would...uh...she would say, "No, you're not gonna die. </sentence><sentence id="454">You're not gonna leave me here alone. </sentence><sentence id="455">Your not gonna die." </sentence><sentence id="456">She...uh ...she was like afraid of being alone. </sentence><sentence id="457">So...so I was trying to hold on to my life because I saw what she care...you know, the way she carried on. </sentence><sentence id="458">When we were walking back and forth to work...you know, it was an hour's walk, maybe more...and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="459">So whenever we could pick up, like a rotten potato or something we would pick it up. </sentence><sentence id="460">Or if we would find paper...if we would find paper, we would put in into the...uh...into that dress that we had so that we should keep warm. </sentence><sentence id="461">And, of course, if we could find a rag on the road sometimes, we would secretly want to pick it up and tie it to our clogs because at that time it was already snowing there in eastern Europe and the clogs were falling off our feet and we ...if we wouldn't pick them up quick enough, then we would be walking barefooted. </sentence><sentence id="462">So...uh...1 remember one time...uh...we were walking on one side of the street and Russian soldiers and French soldiers... The reason why you knew they were Russian and French soldiers is because they let them...they were prisoners and they let them wear the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="463">It's just that the buttons I remember were off. </sentence><sentence id="464">They had no buttons. </sentence><sentence id="465">And...uh... the men...they were...uh..., you know, big men with these big hats and we...we were trying to figure it out. </sentence><sentence id="466">We thought they were Russian. </sentence><sentence id="467">So...uh...believe me they    looked like they suffered, but evidently what happened was they must have gotten more food than we did. </sentence><sentence id="468">So a French soldier threw some bread across the street into our group. </sentence><sentence id="469">So the girl that was lucky was there and she picked it up, but the SS saw that she grabbed that bread and he started beating on her and beat on her and beat on her until she no longer could, you know, so she fell to the floor. </sentence><sentence id="470">And we just walked away, and we never saw her. </sentence><sentence id="471">But that would even happen if some girl would pick up...1 mean when we...when we wanted to pick up something from...that was laying on the road, that... that would have to be like, you know, that the SS shouldn't see. </sentence><sentence id="472">You would have to look around and see because if they found you picking this up, you know, you were beaten up and it depended how strong you were whether you can take that beating or you can't. </sentence><sentence id="473">So...uh...and the girls were starting to get weak. </sentence><sentence id="474">You know, after...after awhile, you just can't take that punishment, the physical and the mental it's just...it's just you can't go on. </sentence><sentence id="475">We were there for a long, long time...for a long time going on. </sentence><sentence id="476">It was may...it was maybe 500 girls left at that time in our bunk...in our...in our,...uh...you know, in our group. </sentence><sentence id="477">And as weaker as we were getting, we were trying to...we were trying to help each other sort of. </sentence><sentence id="478">So...the S...so the SS had one kitchen that the girls worked in...in the kitchen, cooking for the SS people and us, we had another kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="479">It was, you know, cooked soup. </sentence><sentence id="480">So there was a girl in..in my...happened to be in my bunk there. </sentence><sentence id="481">She had a sister. </sentence><sentence id="482">She was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="483">She worked in the SS kitchen so, you know, she...she was surviving all right. </sentence><sentence id="484">But her sister wasn't surviving too well. </sentence><sentence id="485">So she sneaked some bread and brought it to her sister and they sort of...the Kapo caught her taking that bread to her sister. </sentence><sentence id="486">Well, they were both...both beaten up right there. </sentence><sentence id="487">And then they ordered all of us to come out and they took both of these girls and they hung them there on the gallows. </sentence><sentence id="488">I remember. </sentence><sentence id="489">L...I remember I still if | have nightmares, these faces come in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="490">If I think back on them I just, you know, I think they were trying so hard to survive and, therefore, they were punished. </sentence><sentence id="491">And they were so young. </sentence><sentence id="492">They were so young. </sentence><sentence id="493">And that was going on, but...uh.... Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="494">I don't want to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="684">Q: Take your time. </sentence><sentence id="685">Take your time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="688">A: I'll take a little bit of water. </sentence><sentence id="689">I feel we were still perhaps treated better than a lot of them because we worked...because we worked, but still, you know, after awhile you just can't take it. </sentence><sentence id="690">You know, you can't take it. </sentence><sentence id="691">So again, 1... couldn't get up in the morning anymore. </sentence><sentence id="692">And my sister would come and just literally stand me up because she knew that if I'll remain in the barrack that I'll just disappear...that, you know, she'll never see me again. </sentence><sentence id="693">So she would stand me up and she would hold me up for the hour that we would have to stay outside in the cold. </sentence><sentence id="694">It was so cold. </sentence><sentence id="695">And then she would drag me to work. </sentence><sentence id="696">She would actually drag me to work. </sentence><sentence id="697">And she would do her work and she would try to do my work. </sentence><sentence id="698">And...uh...it was...I just felt that I am not going to make it there in the end. </sentence><sentence id="699">But then all of a sudden, it was a long time. </sentence><sentence id="700">It was maybe nine months, a year, and we were already...we didn't look like people. </sentence><sentence id="701">We looked, you know, with...with deep red hair. </sentence><sentence id="702">I...It was like an orangey red hair. </sentence><sentence id="703">Our bodies were yellow. </sentence><sentence id="704">We were very skinny. </sentence><sentence id="705">I weighed maybe 70 pounds, 60 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="706">You know, I just didn't look human anymore and I was burned up with that gunpowder. </sentence><sentence id="707">It was hot. </sentence><sentence id="708">That gunpowder is hot. </sentence><sentence id="709">So I was...my body was burned with the gunpowder. </sentence><sentence id="710">And one day...one day they came...they let us stay inside. </sentence><sentence id="711">They didn't take us to work. </sentence><sentence id="712">So what happened was they bombed. </sentence><sentence id="713">Every night when we were there, we were praying, praying they should bomb this factory, this munition factory. </sentence><sentence id="714">Even though we were there, they never let us out when the bombing was going on. </sentence><sentence id="715">They never let us out. </sentence><sentence id="716">They just locked the doors. </sentence><sentence id="717">But we...we didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="718">We almost felt well, you know, we...we won't live through it anyway, might as well go. </sentence><sentence id="719">But...uh...one day, it just so happened when we weren't there, that factory was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="720">So that was the day when they gave us off. </sentence><sentence id="721">And next day they took us to...make... they told us that we're not going to work anymore in that. </sentence><sentence id="722">They didn't tell us it was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="723">But they told us we won't...we won't be able to go there, but we're going to work someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="724">So they took us to work on a road, to build a road. </sentence><sentence id="725">Which was better because on a road you were on the fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="726">And...uh ...you know, you tried doing as much as you can and even...you know, even if sometimes you got a...a...a whip, you could have, you know, you...you sort of overcome it faster than working constantly in this poisoned atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="727">But still we worked on that road maybe...uh...you know, a...a few months and again they locked us in. </sentence><sentence id="728">They locked us into this barrack. </sentence><sentence id="729">We were...we were very few left. </sentence><sentence id="730">We were maybe 200, maybe 200 left. </sentence><sentence id="731">And...uh...we were locked in from the outside and...and nobody came at 4 o'clock to open up this barrack. </sentence><sentence id="732">So...uh...we...we got scared. </sentence><sentence id="733">We figured what they'll do is just destroy us in this barrack. </sentence><sentence id="734">And...uh...nobody came and nothing is happening. </sentence><sentence id="735">The SS we don't...we looked through the cracks and we don't see a soul. </sentence><sentence id="736">And we were there a day and a night. </sentence><sentence id="737">Nobody bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="738">Then middle of the day we see some civilians came with a truck, with an open truck and they opened up our..uh.... you know, our...uh...barrack and they said that we weren't needed there anymore and they're taking us to another place. </sentence><sentence id="739">So they put us on that open truck and as I said, we got there, there was maybe about...maybe a thousand, twelve hundred girls. </sentence><sentence id="740">When we...when we left there, there was an open truck full, maybe 200 girls, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="741">And they didn't tell us where we were going, but they put us in that open truck and that was civilians. </sentence><sentence id="742">There...there were no SS men, and they took us to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="743">When we got to Bergen-Belsen...uh...you know most of the people would have to stay in. </sentence><sentence id="744">And we were thrown in in a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="745">My God! </sentence><sentence id="746">There were all kinds of dead people laying there and the smell of dead people...uh... People that lost their minds from all this going through already....uh...the way they looked. </sentence><sentence id="747">I mean we didn't look so good either because we...we were a different color. </sentence><sentence id="748">We were yellow and we had orange red hair. </sentence><sentence id="749">We...we... we looked like to them probably also like we're not from this planet. </sentence><sentence id="750">Well, anyway they were infected with typhus already. </sentence><sentence id="751">So we were laying there and...uh...also got you know, we also got soup in the morning, but we didn't get the bread anymore in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="752">And we were there for a few weeks, a month. </sentence><sentence id="753">Uh, my sister got sick. </sentence><sentence id="754">She was the strong one and I was the sick one and she got sick. </sentence><sentence id="755">Evidently what happened she was... she was infected with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="756">She got the typhus, got to her faster than to me. </sentence><sentence id="757">So she had high fever and...uh...and I saw that she was talking deliriously. </sentence><sentence id="758">She...she...she no longer spoke, you know, normally and she was laying near the floor and she says to me, "You know I... see tanks coming down." </sentence><sentence id="759">And I thought she was sick. </sentence><sentence id="760">I thought she was sick. </sentence><sentence id="761">She was dreaming...she's delirious. </sentence><sentence id="762">I did...wasn't moving. </sentence><sentence id="763">I wasn't moving because....then all of a sudden, the noise from the tanks, that scared me actually. </sentence><sentence id="764">So I moved over to see through these cracks and when we saw it was tanks and that was the English...the English with tanks and with cars and with trucks. </sentence><sentence id="765">And they opened up these barracks. </sentence><sentence id="766">And when they opened up these barracks, you know, they were just staring at us there. </sentence><sentence id="767">We stared at them. </sentence><sentence id="768">A lot of them...the...the girls that had the strength to get up did and were running over to these soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="769">Prob...you know, probably a lot of them got scared because we looked so horrible. </sentence><sentence id="770">And a lot of them were sick, you know, going... So they were looking at us. </sentence><sentence id="771">We were looking at them. </sentence><sentence id="772">We didn't know what to make out. </sentence><sentence id="773">We didn't know it was the liberation army. </sentence><sentence id="774">We just didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="775">But they weren't hitting us, so we...we thought at least, you know, they're not hurting us. </sentence><sentence id="776">And my sister...uh...was laying there. </sentence><sentence id="777">She..she wasn't happy. </sentence><sentence id="778">She wasn't sad. </sentence><sentence id="779">And I was looking at my sister and I saw the end is coming to...you know here. </sentence><sentence id="780">And then I looked at these people and I felt My God, there're not hitting us. </sentence><sentence id="781">Maybe they can help us. </sentence><sentence id="782">But I saw that time is going out. </sentence><sentence id="783">So what happened was they took...you know, after a day or so, they...they made hospitals, you know, on the premises. </sentence><sentence id="784">They took barracks and they made like hospitals and they were trying to save the ones that are still breathing. </sentence><sentence id="785">So they came and they picked...they came with these red, you know, there were    little cars with red...red crosses and they picked my sister up and there here I wanted to go with her but they wouldn't let me go with her because she was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="786">And...uh...they took her away. </sentence><sentence id="787">So, there I was by myself and I couldn't move too much, but the English were starting to give us already at least food. </sentence><sentence id="788">And I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="789">I couldn't eat much so I...1 maybe would eat a slice of bread, but I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="790">But the people that could...you know, that they wanted to eat. </sentence><sentence id="791">They wanted to save themselves. </sentence><sentence id="792">They starting eating and then they got sick. </sentence><sentence id="793">They got sick and they got diahhrea and oh, what was going on there. </sentence><sentence id="794">So finally when I...when I saw my sister isn't coming, I felt that I need to go and look for her. </sentence><sentence id="795">I...1 wanted to take a walk. </sentence><sentence id="796">And there were, you know, there were mountains of corpse just laying there. </sentence><sentence id="797">But what...what's happening when we got liberated, there were...uh...organizations like the Hias, they asked us our names and so I figured...and we gave them our names. </sentence><sentence id="798">So I figured I am going to find my sister's name somewheres because when they had these mass graves after the liberation, they had there a plaque with names, the ones they knew that they died after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="799">So I...so I went over to one big, you know, it was like a mountain with corpses and I started reading hopefully that I will find my sister's name. </sentence><sentence id="800">At least I will know where she is, you know, and...uh...1 didn't find it. </sentence><sentence id="801">And that's what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="802">I just remember all these corpse. </sentence><sentence id="803">This mountain of corpse. </sentence><sentence id="804">And I evidently blacked out because that's all I remembered from there. </sentence><sentence id="805">What... Shall I continue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="926">Q: Go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="928">A: What they did after they got themselves a little organized is that they...they went around with these cars and they picked up everybody that was breathing, hopefully that they will save and they probably picked me up but I don't remember where it was and how it was. </sentence><sentence id="929">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="930">But I was in this makeshift hospital for weeks with a high fever. </sentence><sentence id="931">I also got typhus and...uh...after a few weeks, you know, they did. </sentence><sentence id="932">I sort of...uh...was surviving. </sentence><sentence id="933">I was surviving. </sentence><sentence id="934">And the first thing when my fever broke a little bit, my...my first question was, "Where is my sister?" </sentence><sentence id="935">So they started asking me...uh.... what happened to her? </sentence><sentence id="936">So I told them that, you know, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="937">They came and they just, you know, she was very sick and they took her away. </sentence><sentence id="938">And after awhile, after, you know...uh...I remember it was a week or so, maybe more, somebody...and I was getting a little better, they came and told me that my sister did survive from all...from.... So anyway, then they right away reunited us. </sentence><sentence id="939">So we were together. </sentence><sentence id="940">So we were in that place still for a long time because we were very, very sick and...and that was in Bergen-Belsen in this makeshift hospital. </sentence><sentence id="941">And then all of a sudden they came to tell us that...uh...if we wanta go back to Czechoslovakia, we could go back to Czechoslavakia. </sentence><sentence id="942">But we were very weak and we were very...uh...we just...we didn't know what we want. </sentence><sentence id="943">We didn't know what we want. </sentence><sentence id="944">And we knew we couldn't go there on our own because we were very weak, so we didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="945">So we remained in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="946">And then the Swedish Red Cross offered to take in some survivors, the sick ones, the real sick ones and...uh...they...they took us to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="947">When they took us to Sweden...uh...we still looked like...like corpse. </sentence><sentence id="948">We still didn't have hair and I was full of sores. </sentence><sentence id="949">Uh...And people were coming over to...uh...to us...to...to...to comb...to...to touch us and we...we again would look at them like: "My God, aren't they afraid of us? </sentence><sentence id="950">Look how we look." </sentence><sentence id="951">They were very kind. </sentence><sentence id="952">They were... they were just very nice people. </sentence><sentence id="953">And we were in a hospital there. </sentence><sentence id="954">We were in a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="955">I remember they gave us root beer to drink and I didn't want to drink it and they said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="956">Drink it. </sentence><sentence id="957">Drink it. </sentence><sentence id="958">That'll make you feel better." </sentence><sentence id="959">And, you know, a person that wants to survive, I was drinking the beer. </sentence><sentence id="960">So it's in Sweden where I really came to myself at ..at... You know I felt again like I...uh...1 am sort of human. </sentence><sentence id="961">And I think...uh...and, of course, at that time I was already, you know, a little bit older and I started looking at this world and trying to figure it out, what had...what has happened. </sentence><sentence id="962">So picking up the pieces here and there,    I recognized that we were there alone. </sentence><sentence id="963">We knew...at that time we already figured out what has happened to my family. </sentence><sentence id="964">But up until then, to tell you the truth, we didn't allow ourselves to think that they would take all these kids that came with me to the gas chamber...my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother and the family that came with me, that these were the ones who went to a gas chamber to be gassed for no sin committed. </sentence><sentence id="965">So that was difficult for me in Sweden to deal with. ( </sentence><sentence id="966">Sigh) They put me into a place where they start, you know, we were... It was like a school. </sentence><sentence id="967">We worked a half a day and a half a day we...we studied. </sentence><sentence id="968">And life was very good, but it was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="969">So we had some people talking to us and we had so many questions. </sentence><sentence id="970">They...uh...they were doctors who were talking to us. </sentence><sentence id="971">They were very careful on how they are letting us in on it, but still the bottom line was that we lost. </sentence><sentence id="972">We lost everybody. </sentence><sentence id="973">So my sister and I was left and then, again, they were trying...what they were trying to do after the war is get families together and I remember...1 remember a...when I was little that I had a sister that went to America. </sentence><sentence id="974">So they asked me do I know about a family. </sentence><sentence id="975">I says, "Yes, I had a sister, that she went to America and she lives in Brooklyn." </sentence><sentence id="976">And I gave them their names. </sentence><sentence id="977">And...uh...they put our names in a paper in here...in the United States so...probably in the Brooklyn paper or whatever, and a friend called up my sister that she...because my sister would talk about her family. </sentence><sentence id="978">She wonders whether she'll see them or anybody will be left or what's happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="979">And...uh...that friend calls her up and says, "You know, I saw two names--Liebowtiz names--in the papers. </sentence><sentence id="980">Maybe you should call up the Red Cross and they might be able to give you some information where they come from." </sentence><sentence id="981">And my sister did that and they were in touch with us. </sentence><sentence id="982">And...uh...after a short while they got us reunited. </sentence><sentence id="983">They brought us here to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="984">And this is how we...I got here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1044">Q: Where did you come to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1046">A: We came to Brooklyn and with my sister, and we lived with my sister for awhile and then, of course, I got married. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1048">Q: Was your sister married? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1050">A: My sister was here was married. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Uh...what I have is a lot, you know, being that I speak...I couldn't talk about it for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1053">I did not talk about it for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And...and I...I think...I...[ made a decision when I had my first child that I will not talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1055">The reason why I didn't want to talk about it is because I was afraid I will talk about it so much. </sentence><sentence id="1056">What L..I...1 am telling you is just highlights of certain days, not day by day. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And...and to me it was if..if my kids will hear what I have gone through that Hitler will get to them too and I wanted sort of like save them from, from that and, therefore, I didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1058">I didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1059">They...uh...they guessed. </sentence><sentence id="1060">They... they knew that something isn't right because during the day I could control my emotion and I was busy. </sentence><sentence id="1061">I was very busy. </sentence><sentence id="1062">I worked. </sentence><sentence id="1063">I was trying to raise a family and so I could control what's there behind my head, the past. </sentence><sentence id="1064">But sometimes I would just go in and cried for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1065">That there was nothing to...I could do stop and they always felt well did they do something. </sentence><sentence id="1066">DId they annoy me? </sentence><sentence id="1067">And I kept on reassuring that they didn't do. </sentence><sentence id="1068">It's just that I just don't feel good when they were little. </sentence><sentence id="1069">So they knew that it...it wasn't...that I wasn't sort of completely a normal... It wasn't a normal situation because they couldn't figure out why I would be like that. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And then sometimes which you cannot control is the nightmares, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1071">The nightmares you can't control. </sentence><sentence id="1072">So...uh...in the beginning we lived in a small apartment and...uh...you know the kids could hear me scream and my husband would wake me up. </sentence><sentence id="1073">But at...but by the time my husband got me up...really got me up so I don't really that I should be up. </sentence><sentence id="1074">It took a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1075">In the meantime the kids heard my screams. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And so. </sentence><sentence id="1077">But they knew that they cannot talk to me about it. </sentence><sentence id="1078">So this is how they knew what was happening, but I didn't talk about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1109">Q: When you came to Brooklyn, did you talk about it with your sister who lived here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1111">A: To my sister, it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1112">What happened was when we came here and we saw children on the street and they were free. </sentence><sentence id="1113">They were running around and they played in the playgrounds. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And we say the people and they...you know, I keep on asking are they Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1115">Are they Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="1116">Because I thought all the Jews...that happened to all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And they says, "Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="1118">So, you know, we had to deal with that. </sentence><sentence id="1119">You know that there are Jewish kids that survived. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And...uh ...it...you know, it also...I...you know, I had to have help because of the nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="1121">The nightmares were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1122">The nightmares were very exhausting. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And you can't control them. </sentence><sentence id="1124">You cannot control a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And, again, I stayed with my sister and she had two children. </sentence><sentence id="1126">So it was like a...like a continuation. </sentence><sentence id="1127">It was like a continuation of it. ( </sentence><sentence id="1128">long, long pause) So that's...that's the way I lived until, you know, I got married. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I met my husband and started having my own family. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And...uh... I said I have to be strong and...uh...you know, L...I made a comm... I feel I brought my children into this life that I owe them something that I need to bring them up. </sentence><sentence id="1131">And to tell you the truth, I was so many times past my...you know what what was passing my mind is I'll bring up my children that will be different than the people with dealt with me because the people that dealt with me reacted like not people. </sentence><sentence id="1132">Not human! </sentence><sentence id="1133">And I worry...I mean...I.... really thought about it all the time how my kids will be brought up. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Will they be different people? </sentence><sentence id="1135">Will they be different? </sentence><sentence id="1136">And I so much wanted them to be different than what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="1137">So I think I concentrated on that a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1138">I really did. </sentence><sentence id="1139">I, because it was with me constantly. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And L..I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I...L..1 do have...uh...I brought up three children. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I don't know if I should talk about them or I shouldn't? </sentence><sentence id="1143">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1185">Q: We have a little bit....We have a little bit longer. </sentence><sentence id="1186">You have talked for a little over an hour. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1208">A: Well, what I would like to..uh...say is the reason why IL...uh...decided talking about it because I really think it's important. </sentence><sentence id="1209">I know I cannot bring back my family, my little brother, the million and a half children that were destroyed, that were gassed, but perhaps maybe I could reach some people that make them understand that this did happen and it can happen again if we are not going to be if we are not going to be aware of our surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="1210">I...1 think that every person...every person on earth should examine this, what has happened in the Holocaust because a thing like that can happen again and we need to watch that it shouldn't never happen again to no minority, to no minority. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And therefore I feel I need to get this across to the world, maybe to...even to our future generation and tell them that this cruelty has been done to people from other people and to watch out. </sentence><sentence id="1212">L..uh..I have nine grandchildren and there're all great, but one of them is a little bit gifted and when I look at him and I say to myself, "I have so much hope in him that he might do something good with being that he's got so much ability, something good for society.". </sentence><sentence id="1213">And then when I look at him and then I think of my brother, little brother and all these other kids, I say to myself, "My God. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Who knows what these kids would have been...what they would have accomplished if they would...if they would be given a chance just to live...just to live." </sentence><sentence id="1215">So therefore I think every child on earth should be given this chance just to live and prove itself and not so brutally being destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1225">Q: Thank you very very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1227">A: I also would like to add to this. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I speak in the Children's Center and I come up with many children and they have many questions and I like children. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Children are curious. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And they also come in with mothers or with some chaperons and I talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="1231">So after I get finished talking to the children, the parents or the chaperons come over to me and they ask me questions. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And the reason why I want to tell this little story is because I feel I reached a person. </sentence><sentence id="1233">A lady came over to me and she says to me, "You know my father was a SS person and he said it wasn't that bad. </sentence><sentence id="1234">So I looked at the lady and I felt that I need to get something across to her and she should make her own mind on how bad and how good it was so I stopped for a second and looked at her beautiful children. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And I said to her, "You know the SS people were volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="1236">They were volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="1237">The SS were the people in Auschwitz that lived on the premises with their families. </sentence><sentence id="1238">They had better housing and nobody threatened their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1239">But they were...their job was to take innocent kids and older people ...sick people, all kinds of people, escorting them to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And then after the job was done, they went home to play with their children. </sentence><sentence id="1241">So what can I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1242">You'll have to figure it out how bad it was." </sentence><sentence id="1243">And I could see... really have a lot of respect for that lady that she was trying to find the truth I feel. </sentence><sentence id="1244">She was searching. </sentence><sentence id="1245">She was trying to hear everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And I am hoping that she found the truth and that she...uh...will be able to make decisions accordingly and for the people around her you know that she...and with her children. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I...I feel that it can be done when you raise children to bring them up and show them right from wrong because my kids they would tell me always, "Well, Mom when I grow up, you'll be so proud of me." </sentence><sentence id="1248">I says, "Honey, I am already proud of you, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1249">You...you're the best and the finest." </sentence><sentence id="1250">And...uh...we never told them what they should do in their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1251">We never did because we felt they are individuals and they need to do what they need to do. </sentence><sentence id="1252">So the oldest...the oldest one is doing research and even today, when she...you know, she does something good...something comes across, she loves to share it with me. </sentence><sentence id="1253">She says, "You know, Ma, I told you I will try, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1254">We'll do something to better humanity." </sentence><sentence id="1255">And...uh...my younger daughter, she...uh...teaches children that have...uh...have a problem and she too tries so hard...I think she too tries so hard to...uh...to make me feel that she is doing something good or right or whatever you would call it. </sentence><sentence id="1256">And...uh...my son..our son...he...uh...he is a gastroenterologist; and so I feel like God took away a lot from me, but God gave me a lot back. </sentence><sentence id="1257">And in...and what I wanted to achieve in life after the Holocaust I hope and I think I maybe achieved it by looking at my kids, what they do. </sentence><sentence id="1258">And...and you know, having my grandchildren and they...they too are nice and hopefully, they'll...they'll do something good for humanity and not for destruction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
