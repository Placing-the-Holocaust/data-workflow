<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1300">A: No, an undershirt [talkover]. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And I tore it up to strips in order to help one of the women to cover her back. </sentence><sentence id="1302">There was no salve, no medicine, no nothing and the groaning and the moaning I have still in my ears. </sentence><sentence id="1303">From there we went then on Wieherachen, there was another big place and some other prisons which I do not remember into Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Berlin Alexanderplatz. </sentence><sentence id="1305">This was the, the big prison in, in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1306">While we were there, bombs were falling. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Bedbugs were one of the first things. </sentence><sentence id="1308">You could hear them when they came down and fell on you. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And the stench, unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And while we were there, the bombs were falling and people were praying. </sentence><sentence id="1311">Some were crying and I always told them, "Don't worry, we'll get out of this." </sentence><sentence id="1312">We did get out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1313">We came to Ravensbruck and until today, I do not know how we get from Berlin to Ravensbruck. </sentence><sentence id="1314">I know we got there because I was there but I couldn't tell you how. </sentence><sentence id="1315">I only know when we arrived in Ravensbruck we were had to stand in formation, two holes deep. </sentence><sentence id="1316">And all the time in the prison and on the trip from the prison to Ravensbruck I, I always had the feeling it's not I that's happening to, somebody else, and I was outside just watching what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1317">When we came to Ravensbruck I learned, I had to wake up. </sentence><sentence id="1318">While we were standing there, there were two witnesses of Jehovah coming and they had a big basket in between them. </sentence><sentence id="1319">They were walking on the street the so-called Lagerstrasse and a big truck was coming. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And the truck would, was going so close that the mirror that a side mirror that he had, hit one of the women. </sentence><sentence id="1321">The women fell and the rear wheel went over her. </sentence><sentence id="1322">All the people who were standing there in formation searched for what. </sentence><sentence id="1323">But the overseers right away did sick the dogs at us. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And this was the moment when I awoke and knew, I can't dream anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1325">That's I, that's not somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1326">So sometimes I think that that woman died so that I can live, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Now while I was in Vienna there was a girl there who told, who had come in from Ravensbruck for an interview of, at the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And she had told me when you come to Ravensbruck I'm sure that's where you're going, ask for so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1329">She will be able to help you. </sentence><sentence id="1330">She is a very tiny dark-haired girl and she has, she is in the, in the receiving line    for all the people who come in. </sentence><sentence id="1331">And she'll help you. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And this is what I did and the girl told me, "Tl come visit you in the block in the evening," and this is, this is what she did. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I stayed at the receiving block who was run by a Viennese prostitute. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Everybody went into this block first. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And we stayed there, we, there were the bunks. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And every bunk was supposed to hold one person. </sentence><sentence id="1337">There, in every bunk were at least three. </sentence><sentence id="1338">Two this way and one this way. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And in the morning when I woke up I noticed that my cloths were missing and I couldn't go for to a in clothes without shoes so I, I called and the block, the Blockalteste, the leader, this prostitute she came and she said to me, ""You are Viennese?" </sentence><sentence id="1340">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1341">She said, "Wait." </sentence><sentence id="1342">And a few moments later she came with other, with other clothes, not with my own so I was saved for the moment. </sentence><sentence id="1343">And for the while, I think for about three or four days we stayed in this block which was horrible because there was really everybody in there. </sentence><sentence id="1344">And then we were separated and I went into block number one, the older, not old but some political prisoners were. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Rosel Jochman who became a member of Parliament in Austria after the war, she was there. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Helena Popptetts(ph) who became also some kind of big wig in the Austrian government after the war, she was there. </sentence><sentence

the few hours, a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1349">And then a door was opened and I was pushed into a room. </sentence><sentence id="1350">The room was, you couldn't make out anything, it was so full of steam, of smell. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Everything was kind of hazy and out of this haze somebody came towards me and said, "Don't cry, it isn't so bad." </sentence><sentence id="1352">And this was a former teacher of mine. </sentence><sentence id="1353">Muti Tiechman was her name. </sentence><sentence id="1354">She also had helped Jews and this was, was, was the reason why she was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And when I came to Ravensbruck, she already was in Ravensbruck, also into, also in this number one block. </sentence><sentence id="1356">And there we, we kept up very much contact. </sentence><sentence id="1357">I was her former pupil, she was my former teacher and somehow a bond was formed. </sentence><sentence id="1358">After the war, she adopted Saul whom you met now as her grandson. </sentence><sentence id="1359">And she came to visit us in America twice. </sentence><sentence id="1360">When we went to Europe we always visited her. </sentence><sentence id="1361">Then she died. </sentence><sentence id="1362">Now. </sentence><sentence id="1363">The number one block, is that all? </sentence><sentence id="1364">No.
