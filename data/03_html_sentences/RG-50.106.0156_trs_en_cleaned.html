<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: In the Netherlands there was -- my father had a brother by the name of Emil, Emil Munzer. </sentence><sentence id="38">And I think that that's -- that's really an -- all we had in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="39">There were some close friends. </sentence><sentence id="40">There was another Emil, an Emil Landau who I subsequently met because he happened -- he lived in the United States and you know, he happened to -- to marry, actually, someone who became a part of our life much, much later on. </sentence><sentence id="41">And so we became very close friends with him. </sentence><sentence id="42">But he was very close with -- with both my father and with my Uncle Emil. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: But -- but he was not a blood relative? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: And on your mother's side there was no rela -- there were no relatives? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: And wh-what do you know of the conditions in Holland before you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="77">Did your mother tell you about any tightening restrictions or any sense of danger? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Certainly the -- you know, she did tell me about the -- the -- the -- the gradual tightening of the screws after the invasion of Holland by the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: Which was May 1940. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: That's right, May 1940 and the confiscation of -- of Jewish property, the banning of Jews from -- from various positions in the arts, or in -- in -- in business. </sentence><sentence id="83">Just a very -- I think actually the first thing that happened was the banning of shechitah, ritual slaughter and then just things got tighter and tighter. </sentence><sentence id="84">And I think they try -- my -- my perception is that they really tried to go on with their lives as -- as normally as possible in Holland, and I'm not sure how directly threatened they felt in Holland, actually. </sentence><sentence id="85">My feeling is that for a long time they somehow felt safe. </sentence><sentence id="86">As far as I know, my father never made any attempt to -- to emigrate, for example, to the United States or anywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="87">I think they -- they -- they really felt very secure in Holland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="95">And then your mother became pregnant with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Certainly by the time my mother became pregnant with me, conditions in Holland had really deteriorated a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="99">By then the -- the occupation was in full swing, and this was an unplanned pregnancy. </sentence><sentence id="100">And my mother was advised in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="101">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="102"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Munzer deg August 4, 2002 very strong terms by her obstetrician to have an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="103">He told her that it would be immoral to -- to bring another Jewish child into the world. </sentence><sentence id="104">And my mother, this is one of the times when she did turn to the Bible, and she read the story of Hannah, who desperately wanted to have a child, and it was in reading that story, my mother told me, that she decided that she could not possibly have an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="105">As aresult of that, her obstetrician refa -- refused to have anything further to do with her, and so I was -- I was born not in a hospital, but I was born at home actually, with th -- with the help of -- of a nurse, rather than attended by an obstetrician. </sentence><sentence id="106">And I was born actually one month prematurely, November, as I said, November 23", 1941. </sentence><sentence id="107">And this led to another dilemma at the time, actually, and that's whether to have a -- a bris or a circumcision. </sentence><sentence id="108">Again my -- my parents friends advised very strongly against it because that would identify me as being Jewish and then the pediatrician who examined me after my birth came out and told my father that I -- that I would need a circumcision, that there was a medical need for it, and my father at that point of course made the decision that we would have a regular bris. </sentence><sentence id="109">And I have some wonderful photographs of -- of that bris. </sentence><sentence id="110">They're very remarkable photographs, they're very, very tiny, they're only about one by one and a half inch in size, but my mother was to keep them hidden on her body for the year -- subsequent years when she was in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="111">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="112">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="113"> Interview with Alfred Munzer " August 4, 2002 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: So you were born, you were circumcised and then the next development? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Well the next development, I -- I was born, as I said, in November, and by the following May is -- is when it became apparent that the family would have to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="134">That's when Jews began -- were deported openly in Holland and the -- the first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father, to -- to go to a so-called work camp. </sentence><sentence id="135">What he initially did was he -- he scheduled a hernia operation, which he had postponed previously, went into the hospital, had the operation and that delayed his -- his going to the concentration camps for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="136">And then the next thing that happened was that he had a mock suicide attempt, which gained him admission, like many other Jews apparently, to a psychiatric ho- hospital near The Hague, called The Remarkkliniek. </sentence><sentence id="137">And that's -- so he entered there, basically under the pretext of being a patient. </sentence><sentence id="138">My mother, in the meantime, began to look for hiding places for my sisters and for myself. </sentence><sentence id="139">The f -- my father -- my parents decided that we should not go be hidden together, but that we should -- should hide in -- in different places, so that if -- if one person were killed or found out, at least someone would survive, one person in the family would survive or the others would survive. </sentence><sentence id="140">My sisters were placed -- we have very close friends among our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="141">The Van Luhrmann sisters, they were two sisters, Jo, J-o and Ko, K-o were their first names, Jo and Ko Van Luhrmann. </sentence><sentence id="142">They were very, very close This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="143">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="144"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Munzer deg August 4, 2002 to us, very religious Catholic and they were instrumental in several things. </sentence><sentence id="145">First they -- they had my sisters -- facilitated the enrollment of my sisters in a Catholic school, and that was sort of the first attempt, really, at hiding their identity. </sentence><sentence id="146">And then through their church in The Hague, a church which I have visited since then, on the street called Alonstraat, and through the intervention also of two priests, a father by the name of -- one father was Schulling, S-c-h-u-I-l-i-n-g, and I right now can't remember the name of the other one, but anyway, these two priests were instrumental in finding a Catholic family that was willing to take my sisters. </sentence><sentence id="147">The woman in that family was also very religious, very devout Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="148">She had had a vision telling her -- where the Virgin Mary told her to take in Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="149">And th-that's what led to my sisters being placed with this woman. </sentence><sentence id="150">Subsequently, my mother asked a neighbor across the way from us, where we lived, to -- to take me in. </sentence><sentence id="151">And th-the plan, apparently was for me to place -- be placed with her, and then eventually to be transferred to a safer place somewhere in the Dutch countryside, where most Jewish children apparently were hidden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: What -- where -- what -- what was the address of your family's house? </sentence><sentence id="173">Wa -- you're talking about neighbors -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="175">It was 100 Zoutmanstraat in The Hague, and I don't recall exactly, but they lived on the same street, on Zoutmanstraat, right across the street, actually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="178">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="179">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="180"> Interview with Alfred Munzer deg August 4, 2002 Her name was Annie Madna and that's -- that's the woman I was -- I was placed with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: And your family knew her because she was a neighbor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: They were very -- they were close neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="188">She was divorced from her husband, Tole Madna, who was of Indonesian background. </sentence><sentence id="189">She herself was Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="190">And they had had -- they had tw -- three children, and the three children really were apparently in and out of my mother's house all the time. </sentence><sentence id="191">It was a very, very close relationship. </sentence><sentence id="192">They also played with my two sisters and knew them very well. </sentence><sentence id="193">So it was -- it was a logical thing for me, you know, to be placed with her initially, certainly. </sentence><sentence id="194">That probably was in September 1941, because I -- I think I was nine months old at the time when I was placed with Annie. </sentence><sentence id="195">And at that point my mother sold most of our furniture and belongings and placed a lot of items in hiding with our neighbors, basically emptied the house and she too, she joined my father in -- in hiding at the same psychiatric clinic, the Remarkkliniek and -- but sh -- in her case, she worked there as an attendant, as a nurse's aid, basically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Was she known as his -- his wife? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: I don't think so. " </sentence><sentence id="208">m not sure. </sentence><sentence id="209">I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="210">There were quite a few Jews who were hiding there in the same way, although I never asked my munther -- my mother exactly how many people. </sentence><sentence id="211">She did tell me about the shock it was to her to -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="212">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="213"> Interview with Alfred Munzer " August 4, 2002 to -- to be in a -- inas -- in a hospital where people had been confined -- and psychiatric hospitals at that time were quite different from the clinics we are accustomed to. </sentence><sentence id="214">So these people had been confined for -- for much of their lives and it was a tremendous shock for her. </sentence><sentence id="215">My father apparently adapted much better and he found a little clique of -- of Jewish men who were in hiding and they played cards. </sentence><sentence id="216">But for my mother it was -- it was much more difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Did she have contact with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: She did have contact with him. </sentence><sentence id="231">As a matter of fact, for Christmas day 1942, the - - in Holland Christmas is celebrated for two days, but the -- on Christmas day, the - - my two sisters were brought to the Remarkkliniek to visit my parents. </sentence><sentence id="232">I'm not sure whether that was actually Christmas day, it may have been in -- and I have some notes somewhere -- it may have been the feast of Santa Claus, which is also a big deal in Holland, which is the sixth of December, but I think this was actually f- for -- for Christmas day. </sentence><sentence id="233">Yeah, it was Christmas day. </sentence><sentence id="234">And they -- so that that part of the family at least, was reunited that -- one last time. </sentence><sentence id="235">This was December 25", 1942.The following day the clinic was invaded by the Germans and apparently was emptied not only of all the Jews who were hiding there, but also of all the patients and the entire staff, they were all taken prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="236">And my parents were taken, first to a -- a temporary prison in The Hague, the former home of the philosopher, Dutch This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="237">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="238"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Munzer " August 4, 2002 philosopher Spinoza had been converted into a prison. </sentence><sentence id="239">And then, just within a matter of days really, early in January they were transferred to the first concentration camp, and that was Westerbork. </sentence><sentence id="240">Westerbork, which is located in the northernmost part of -- of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="241">Westerbork, my mother told me, initially had been built actually as a receiving center for Jewish refugees fleeing eastern Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: And -- and so they were together in Westerbork for how long? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: They remained in Westerbork, I believe for sev -- for -- for several weeks, not a very long period of time. </sentence><sentence id="259">My mother was put in charge of the nursery there, of taking care of -- of young children, and it gave her, she said, a sense of security that -- that her own children were not there. </sentence><sentence id="260">She was really quite glad of that, actually and very grateful that -- that there ha -- was -- that we had found sa -- that she had found safe refuge for all three children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Once she was in Westerbork, was there any contact with -- where y -- where you all were placed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="267">I don't think -- there was no contact. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I -- I think at that point every attempt was made probably, to keep things as secret as possible, so she did not disclose. </sentence><sentence id="269">There was some contact later on, and I can mention that now, is actually my mother, on -- on her way subsequently to -- to Auschwitz, wrote a little This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="270">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="271"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Munzer @ August 4, 2002 note on a piece of -- of toilet paper which said, en route to Auschwitz, all is well. </sentence><sentence id="272">And she dropped that on the railroad tracks and she put an address on it, not -- I -- probably to my mother's neighbors, not to where my sisters were or I was. </sentence><sentence id="273">And a railroad worker in Holland found the note and it did make its way back. </sentence><sentence id="274">I've never seen the note, I'm not sure whether my mother saved it or not, but there is a very similar note in the museum in Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="275">So I -- I assume that this was really s- something that was done fairly commonly. </sentence><sentence id="276">But in any event, from Westerbork, my -- my parents were deported to the next concentration camp, which was Vught. </sentence><sentence id="277">And Vught is -- is a -- is a camp located in northern hol -- northwestern Holland -- northeastern Holland, sorry, not far from the city of Eindhoven, and it was home to the Philips factory. </sentence><sentence id="278">And both my parents were put to work in the Philips factory. </sentence><sentence id="279">And at that time they still had contact with each other; although they were separated in the camp, th-they saw each other and still had contact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Did your mother talk about her state of mind at that time or your father's state of mind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Just an extreme hope for peace. </sentence><sentence id="298">One of the things that my mother told me that, you know, they had these -- these morning line-ups, and -- in the camp, in Vught. </sentence><sentence id="299">And at one point actually they were -- they were visited there by -- by Himmler himself, who told them that as long as they worked, they were in no danger, nothing This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="300">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="301"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Munzer 8 August 4, 2002 would ever happen to them. [ </sentence><sentence id="302">indecipherable] Whether it's at that same line-up or one of the others, I mean, very humiliating experiences. </sentence><sentence id="303">She saw a little church way in the distance in the du -- Dutch church on the horizon, and she wondered how -- how wonderful, how it would be if peace would break out at that moment. </sentence><sentence id="304">And she said she would just run to that church, she didn't care if it was a church or a synagogue and just thank God for -- for being freed. </sentence><sentence id="305">So she did maintain hope. </sentence><sentence id="306">I think that's -- that's really what kept my mother going then, and -- and subsequently. </sentence><sentence id="307">She never lost hope. </sentence><sentence id="308">She -- she always tried to -- to -- to really make the best of -- of the situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: She was in her -- in her 30's at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: One of the things which -- which happened really a bit later was -- but which sort of says something about her state of mind I think, is when she was in one of the cattle, the infamous cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="329">She -- she looked outside, she was able t-to -- to look at the -- the countryside, the German countryside and -- and realize -- this was springtime and she realized how beautiful it was and she -- she said to herself that after the war we probably would not have much money, but that this still was one way that the family could actually go around and see Europe and still admire the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="330">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="331"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Munzer " August 4, 2002 beauty of -- of creation. </sentence><sentence id="332">So that's -- I think that says something about her state of mind. </sentence><sentence id="333">This was much later, when things were much worse for her. </sentence><sentence id="334">Much worse than they were when she was at -- in Vught. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: And did she talk about what your father's state of mind was, there at the factory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Not at that time, but she -- she did tell me about my father's state of mind actually, earlier. </sentence><sentence id="346">He kept hoping that the Germans would be defeated by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="347">He had -- he had great faith in th-the -- in history and what happened during the Napoleonic wars, and he -- he felt that when -- when Russia entered the war, he -- he felt it was a strong possibility that the Germans would be defeated in Russia and that that will be the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="348">But that, of course, was not to be for a long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="354">And then how long did they stay at this factory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: I'm not entirely sure. </sentence><sentence id="358">I do have some documents that I could refer to, okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
