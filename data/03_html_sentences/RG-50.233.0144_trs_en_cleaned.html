<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: Well, you did not go out in public. </sentence><sentence id="428">You were afraid to go out. </sentence><sentence id="429">You never knew when the Germans would come through the gate and attack and capture people. </sentence><sentence id="430">And a lot of people were captured. </sentence><sentence id="431">I remember seeing children dying and begging for food. </sentence><sentence id="432">I also remember my father taking me to a woman who myself and four other little girls we used to be taught how to read and write. </sentence><sentence id="433">So he used to take us, maybe once or twice a week, in the evening, walk over and take another little girl, I don't know who she was, maybe she was a neighbor, and take us to this woman who used to teach us how to read and write for about, this went on for six months. </sentence><sentence id="434">I would say I was being taught to read and write for the first six months maybe. </sentence><sentence id="435">And even that stopped because I was beaten up once in the street. </sentence><sentence id="436">I was wearing a little jacket and somebody wanted my jacket so they ripped my jacket off and they hit me and I came home bleeding and this was the end of my education, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="447">Q: Or the beginning of a new education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="449">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="450">You don't go out anymore. </sentence><sentence id="451">Because at that time even there were hours, there were times you knew when you were safe to go out in the street. </sentence><sentence id="452">And she was only like maybe about a block away, I remember it was only about a five minute walk. </sentence><sentence id="453">So that's the reason why my father would take me or pick me up or I would walk back. </sentence><sentence id="454">And that was the end of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: This was inside the ghetto after the wall had been built? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: Yes, inside the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: I don't remember the face. </sentence><sentence id="468">I know I remember somebody hitting me and ripping off my jacket and I had something in my hand, maybe it was a little briefcase or something was grabbed. </sentence><sentence id="469">Maybe somebody who was starving, maybe he thought I had food. </sentence><sentence id="470">Maybe his child was cold and he needed a jacket or something so he took it off me. </sentence><sentence id="471">9    </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: Yes, it was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="484">You saw a lot of these things happening. </sentence><sentence id="485">You were afraid to carry something. </sentence><sentence id="486">If you had something to carry, you usually carried it inside your coat so nobody would detect it, or else you were attacked by other people if they suspect you have food on you, they'd do anything. </sentence><sentence id="487">I guess when your stomach is growling and you're starving you know no honor, you know no shame, you know nothing, you just know one thing, you have to eat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q: The few times that you did go out with your father, for that matter, did you wear any kind of armband or star or anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="624">A: She also brought food. </sentence><sentence id="625">So we had food and nobody bothered her. </sentence><sentence id="626">Because nobody after awhile knew who she was. </sentence><sentence id="627">As people were dying out and, of course the crowds in the very beginning were all gone already and there were very few people now in the streets and those that survived already at that point were hidden in their apartments or in basements trying to scrounge food, together mainly. </sentence><sentence id="628">The ghetto was getting smaller at that point, we had moved several times already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: So you were forced to move out of the apartment? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="686">He was watching my sister and me while my mother was the one looking very Polish. </sentence><sentence id="687">Because as you can see on the photograph she did not resemble a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="688">That's the reason why she got away. </sentence><sentence id="689">So she would get dressed up, she bought herself a coat, a hat to make sure she looked as elegant as possible. </sentence><sentence id="690">Because if you look ragged you know, you would have been stopped right away. </sentence><sentence id="691">Like this if you walked with your head up high and very positive nobody bothered you. </sentence><sentence id="692">I guess your attitude was very important. </sentence><sentence id="693">That's why she survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1337">Q: Did your mother survive and escape by herself or was she with others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1339">A: No, I think they could not go in groups. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Everybody went their own way, because in a group it is more dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1341">Singularly it always easier to escape when a single person runs. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I don't know, maybe they started as a group and they wound up individually, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1343">She never talked about that particular incident. </sentence><sentence id="1344">It was a very painful incident in her life. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Very painful. </sentence><sentence id="1346">And even though she used to talk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small ghetto, at one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I were gone and my father was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1347">It seems like the Germans came, they were coming and they said we're going to put the building on fire whoever's there doesn't run away or doesn't give themselves up they're going to get burned alive. </sentence><sentence id="1348">So I don't know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my father, where was my father, I'm trying to think, he was also gone in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1349">He did not go to work, but my mother went to work and he went someplace and my sister and I were left alone. </sentence><sentence id="1350">And when the Germans came, we looked at each other, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace. </sentence><sentence id="1351">So, we went downstairs to the cellar and from the cellar we found there was a hole in the wall there to go to the next building and the next building, so we escaped through a few other buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1352">They were also empty, so we didn't know what had happened to the building we were originally. </sentence><sentence id="1353">I don't know if they put it on fire or they didn't put it. </sentence><sentence id="1354">But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another 21    building and the first thing we started doing is running from apartment to apartment which was all abandoned and there was no food nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="1355">We turned quietly every drawer and every closet, we looked all over and then we hear Germans marching downstairs and they're entering the building and here's my sister and I alone in this apartment and it's all empty. </sentence><sentence id="1356">I remember I took her and I put her inside a cabinet, a kitchen cabinet. </sentence><sentence id="1357">I pushed her inside the kitchen cabinet and I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the cabinet and I hid behind a chest that stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest. </sentence><sentence id="1358">I squished in the back of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in they" ll think there are rags there. </sentence><sentence id="1359">And I took a blanket and covered myself and the two of us stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1360">We heard the German footsteps and we heard them getting closer and closer and then they kicked open the door and they marched in this apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1361">They must have been looking for Jews from apartment to apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1362">This was their preoccupation and that's how I know this, and they walked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="1363">They were shooting in every apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1364">All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1365">I guess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them or something. </sentence><sentence id="1366">So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I heard them talking loud and clear I didn't understand what they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Then I heard them walk out. </sentence><sentence id="1368">And when they walked out and they left the door, my first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister's name, are you alive? </sentence><sentence id="1369">She says Yes, are you alive? </sentence><sentence id="1370">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1371">So we got together again, she came out of the cabinet and we decided we're going to hide in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="1372">From now on it was no good in the apartment because they are shooting and they may shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="1373">So we'll go in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="1374">We go all the way up in the attic and there's a lot of furniture and we hear voices. </sentence><sentence id="1375">So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were people hidden in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="1376">We started moving the furniture away and the people outside didn't know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let us in, let us in, we got to hide with you. </sentence><sentence id="1378">So my sister said, well, I'm going to cry so loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I'm going to tell them that you're hiding there, so let us in there. </sentence><sentence id="1379">We came in over there, we sat with them, they had water, so we drank a little water with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
