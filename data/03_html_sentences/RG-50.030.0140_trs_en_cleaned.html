curfew because the front doors were always locked, and they might let me in, but I remember coming into the stairs. </sentence><sentence id="400">There were like ten, twelve stairs going like this.

off. </sentence><sentence id="408">It was unbearable and they...they must have been fearing for their safety and they came up. </sentence><sentence id="409">They say you have to leave because we are

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="563">A: This was not. </sentence><sentence id="564">From Blechhammer in Gleiwitz. </sentence><sentence id="565">In Gleiwitz they were building a factory, so we were put to work. </sentence><sentence id="566">The work consisted of twelve hours a day, and you cannot rest. </sentence><sentence id="567">You start with a shovel from the first minute on up and the man stays over you whether whether he got a handle from a broken shovel or some kind of bat and hit you constantly over the head. </sentence><sentence id="568">The first day, we were carrying so many dead people where they would mostly die from beatings and so on and when I got back into the prison camp, I ne...1 was...I was going to school. </sentence><sentence id="569">I never held a shovel for so many...ever. </sentence><sentence id="570">But the first twelve hours when I got back, my hands were full of blisters. </sentence><sentence id="571">Not only had blisters here. </sentence><sentence id="572">I had blisters between my fingers and I felt if I go next day, I won't be able to hold nare a feather, not just a shovel and work twelve hours. </sentence><sentence id="573">And I spotted...they had some women in the in the office, and one was...my brother was older from me, seven years older so he he had some friends and I spotted her and I came...she worked in the office...and I said to her, Lola. </sentence><sentence id="574">I said look at me. </sentence><sentence id="575">I will not survive tomorrow one day cause I cannot work. </sentence><sentence id="576">I would like to, and it was lucky for me again. </sentence><sentence id="577">I always happened to be very fortunate that she had some pull and put me on a sick room, Krankenstube where they made, falsified that I had fever. </sentence><sentence id="578">The only time you could stay in the sick room if you had fever, and I stayed there for a few days and they bandaged my hand and put some grease and she managed to give me a job when I got back. </sentence><sentence id="579">They were looking for steamroller operator and me being...I always had a knack for mechanics and I was...and when I came up and I told the man that I would like to learn, he...and it didn't take me long and I was rolling this steamroller that that's why I was at a cushy job. </sentence><sentence id="580">I remember I was driving that steamroller down the road. </sentence><sentence id="581">It was a very heavy big equipment and it was an old piece of equipment. </sentence><sentence id="582">It didn't have up-to-date hydraulic brakes, had mechanical brakes. </sentence><sentence id="583">I'm trying to making a right turn going down hill. </sentence><sentence id="584">I've been pushing hard with my foot to the brake. </sentence><sentence id="585">I've been trying to make the right turn at the same time and I couldn't do it because the the the weight of my steamroller was greater than I can hold with my my foot and instead of making a right turn, I went straight, and I pulled down the the curb on the other side...just completely flattened it out. </sentence><sentence id="586">When the German...there was a civilian German...he he got angry and he took the shovel and he broke the shovel on the side of the wheel and he kept on hitting me and the soldier stood there with a gun just waiting for me to try to make some kind of move when he would kill me, so all I could do is just put my arms over my head and protect myself being hit so many times over my head, and he kept on hitting me so long till he got tired. </sentence><sentence id="587">I almost lost my eye. </sentence><sentence id="588">I had a big gash over my head and got my teeth...front teeth knocked out and a big cut in my lip and L...next day I went back to work. </sentence><sentence id="589">I couldn't see my front eye, my left eye. </sentence><sentence id="590">It's funny...the episodes what we went through. </sentence><sentence id="591">Then the people everyday coming in from from work detail and the prisoners would bring other dead prisoners every single day into the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="623">Q: Can you tell me about your living conditions? </sentence><sentence id="624">Did you...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="627">A: The barracks were just bunk beds. </sentence><sentence id="628">One big barrack could contain about a hundred and some people, and we'd get up early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="629">Again we'd get counted and we'd get a black whatever it was, like coffee. </sentence><sentence id="630">We'd go out on detail work. </sentence><sentence id="631">We'd get beaten by the guards, by the kapos, and you you go out on work detail. </sentence><sentence id="632">Again you get beaten. </sentence><sentence id="633">On on the work at lunchtime you get like a seaweed soup...just brown soup with some seaweeds in it. </sentence><sentence id="634">At night, we get a square piece of bread like that and the bread you could not eat like a bread. </sentence><sentence id="635">It was made like a clay. </sentence><sentence id="636">Every time you eat, you take a bite, you have to...you have to kind of remove it. </sentence><sentence id="637">The bread it stick to your the roof of your mouth because stuck like clay and Sunday used to get a little small piece of margarine and sometimes a spoonful of meat, and in the beginning when we left there were still some people left in the ghetto, when I was there, so they had like a that you could put a piece of bread into an envelope and treat it as such and mail it, like an envelope, and some people who had parents would send...would take a dried piece of bread and put in 01:48: envelope like and send it to them. </sentence><sentence id="638">I remember in the beginning we used to get some mail like this, right in the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="639">The reason I'm saying that because I knew I didn't have anybody home anymore and I would sit and stare, you know, go outside looking at the other guys getting some...something from the home and I would never even go...expect anybody to send me, because I didn't have any parents anymore. </sentence><sentence id="640">That was 1942. </sentence><sentence id="641">But then that stopped because they they liquidated the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="642">There was...there was some Polish people who were in forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="643">They had to work but they could go home. </sentence><sentence id="644">They would tell us now there's no more ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="645">It's all liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="646">We would...sometimes some Polish people would get paid by our parents to bring some letters home while the ghetto was there and they would bring them back to us, but then we heard the news there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="647">There was complete liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="648">And after the steamroller job, the road finished, we built a factory, fairly big factory which was called Deutsche Gas(aus?)werke. </sentence><sentence id="649">We were manufacturing raw material for tires and it's like soot. </sentence><sentence id="650">It's carbon. </sentence><sentence id="651">It's a black carbon which was manufactured and packed in like cement bags and and then they needed mechanics to to build the factory and then I was leaving there again and they needed welders so I became a welder. </sentence><sentence id="652">Just...I just could pick up anything and I was a welder and we were building the factory. </sentence><sentence id="653">That was 1943 that we became part of the Auserkommando under 01:50: Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="654">The SS came in. </sentence><sentence id="655">We all got stripped naked and we all got tattooed. </sentence><sentence id="656">Completely naked. </sentence><sentence id="657">Men, women separate of course. </sentence><sentence id="658">The being tattooed...it's not the pain. </sentence><sentence id="659">The pain is just to being branded like a like an animal. </sentence><sentence id="660">It's it's a it's a terrible thing to think that you don't have a name anymore, that you are being branded. </sentence><sentence id="661">That was a...quite a shock for all of us, especially...we had the women's camp and the men's camp separate, and I understand there was much more of a shock for for young women standing in front of the SS completely stripped naked. </sentence><sentence id="662">After...well, after we built the factory I stayed with that for quite a while and I said well, then I I counted some some Germans who who were sent from the factory to run the the building of the of this factory and certain specifications and I remember I was sitting in the corner and I was at that time welding pipes. </sentence><sentence id="663">I would...the the master would...call him master...he's overhead. </sentence><sentence id="664">He was a German. </sentence><sentence id="665">He would eat and then he...at the time he would feel sorry because he saw me all day long. </sentence><sentence id="666">I was there twelve hours with no food. </sentence><sentence id="667">He would...sort of afraid to give you a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="668">He would point with the eye whatever he left or he couldn't eat and he would lay it down and he walked out and I would I would get a piece of bread, because he saw that I would try and I worked and I also been sometimes in there I was a human being. </sentence><sentence id="669">Then after this factory was built up, they needed prime mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="670">We had big like Toledo scales where we would weigh that factory...I want to describe the factory, the condition we worked in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="671">In order to produce the carbon soot, it had to be a certain temperature on the...in the in the factory grounds. </sentence><sentence id="672">It had to be like between a hundred to hundred ten degrees. </sentence><sentence id="673">If it got cooler, the machine would not produce as as much soot, carbon than it's hotter hotter temperature, and we would get stuck with clothes like you would freeze and there were people who wouldn't and I don't think and not being a prisoner like we were, and free work...could work without having a mask on their face, and a lot of people would die from lung diseases because we were spitting out...we'd we'd come in. </sentence><sentence id="674">We were completely black and the women got some soap but the men hardly got any soap. </sentence><sentence id="675">You could scrub your...your body was hurting just from scrubbing your your body just with a brush without any soap, but then they they needed prime mechanics for those scales. </sentence><sentence id="676">There were like the big Toledo scales where we would weigh the production, the the soot and I volunteered that I I will repair this. </sentence><sentence id="677">What happened those scales would get stopped up by the 01:54: accumulation of carbon and I was issued a lot of tools and an electric car so I would pick up from one part of the factory to the other and bring it to my workshop and clean them and put them back in place. </sentence><sentence id="678">And I worked twelve hours a day, twelve hours a night. </sentence><sentence id="679">One day I noticed they built a kitchen on the grounds factory for the Germans and they unloaded a truckload of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="680">I remember driving by in my electric car. </sentence><sentence id="681">It smelled so sweet like, like you go to te best bakery. </sentence><sentence id="682">It smelled that good to me, so the next shift at nighttime I decided to go inspect the cellar where the potatoes were. </sentence><sentence id="683">I thought maybe some potatoes would drop down accidentally. </sentence><sentence id="684">I would pick up and there was a big iron door with a big padlock. </sentence><sentence id="685">I put the padlock in my hand and I looked at it. </sentence><sentence id="686">I went back to the shop and I made a key. </sentence><sentence id="687">I was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="688">I wanted to eat, something to eat, and to my biggest surprise I opened up that lock and I just got in on the first try, just like that. </sentence><sentence id="689">I opened the heavy door and (sniffing) took that deep breath and the next day I told my buddies from work...I said hey, we're going to get some potatoes, so we took some empty bags from cement and we loaded them. </sentence><sentence id="690">But you don't think and you don't realize that if one eats and other people, hungry people know it, everybody got to eat, so I couldn't hide it. </sentence><sentence id="691">Everybody worked in this compound had to go get the potatoes at night because if I would not let them, then they would tell on me and I wouldn't have anything, so first night we went like twenty of us. </sentence><sentence id="692">Next night went thirty of us and load potatoes, sneaked out one by one, so the Germans noticed that the heap got to be smaller, so one night I opened the door and they planted SS and they caught me. </sentence><sentence id="693">I got beaten on the... by the SS Wacht Stube, then come into the camp on the big appell. </sentence><sentence id="694">I got on my naked behind beaten twenty-five with the bullwhip. </sentence><sentence id="695">The first three, the man hit you as hard as a man can hit you. </sentence><sentence id="696">The first three whips...that's all you feel. </sentence><sentence id="697">Later...later on it's just like novocaine. </sentence><sentence id="698">You can hit a hundred times. </sentence><sentence id="699">You don't feel any more. </sentence><sentence id="700">It was ___ when the bullwhip goes around here and hits you right here, and I was all bloodied up from hard hitting and I remember they dragged me. </sentence><sentence id="701">I could not walk and all these guys who I helped carried potatoes, they carried...they had cold compresses putting on me to to keep me cool and the next day I had to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="702">I literally would not...could not walk. </sentence><sentence id="703">They actually picked me up and dragged me to to to work next day, and when I came in, my my German master saw me and since I had a cushy job he let me there stay a few days, but that was a bad experience because I couldn't walk, I couldn't bend down for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="704">A matter of fact, this small piece of margarine we used to get on Sunday, all my buddies donated and put it on on my skin so my skin would kind of soften up. </sentence><sentence id="705">Had a big scar. </sentence><sentence id="706">That's one of the things you have to go through. </sentence><sentence id="707">Also there were constant beatings and you had a krankenstube, a sick room, where for anybody would get sick again they would once a week come in a truck and load these people straight to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: I want to also mention that besides being hungry and work hard, we also had a lack of vitamins. </sentence><sentence id="804">All of us had those terrible boils all over your body...big boils on the arms, all over your knees, so on, which was very painful. </sentence><sentence id="805">I want to mention we had a French doctor who they pressed into as a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="806">He he didn't have any medication. </sentence><sentence id="807">He would cut open the boil, clean it and then all he had is like toilet paper, would wrap it up, and then you you just make first move and it breaks and falls off on you, and you go into such a dirty work with open wounds...we all had a lot of wounds because of lack of vitamins. </sentence><sentence id="808">That was another, another hardship we we had. </sentence><sentence id="809">No medical treatment whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="810">If you had a toothache or something like this was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="811">He had a layman pull tooth...a tooth without any, any kind of pain killers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="812">During my imprisonment in Gleiwitz, I had electric car where I was transporting those scales and the women would work on at service those machines, Jewish women prisoners, and I had...I I was the only one from the from the few men...I could talk to Jewish girls which was a...and I would befriend my wife. </sentence><sentence id="813">We talked once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="814">We would get...talked with hands or would write a big letter, take a big bag from the from the cement and write a big love letter and throw it over the fence to each other, and it gave a little bit of sparkle to your life and that you talked to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="815">We never touched...could never touch. </sentence><sentence id="816">God forbid if you would. </sentence><sentence id="817">It would be a death sentence. </sentence><sentence id="818">But I would drive by and talk to her on the side and she would smile and talk to me and it would kind of felt like we were for each other but not in...and I would write her love letters and maybe someday we'll...which I I believe I didn't believe that we would live the war through 02:03: because we used to get some scraps of newspapers, German papers, that the the German people would throw out their food into the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="819">During the war you wrap all the food in old newspapers, and I would understand some German. </sentence><sentence id="820">The Germans were winning the war. </sentence><sentence id="821">Not only this, I remember they would describe that they had shot down so many Allied planes and all their planes would come back, and of course already went to France and they and they were doing good in Africa and also there was like a death sentence from what I read, from the scraps of paper, they were doing very well and they they were winning the war and just like a death sentence because you know if they if they're winning the war, sooner or later you'll have to die. </sentence><sentence id="822">And many times I would lay on my bunk bed and I would try to picture myself how I'm going to die, what's going to be like, and then I would say to myself, maybe I won't die. </sentence><sentence id="823">I'll keep on fighting it as much as I can, and for a young person it's a horrible feeling to have like a death sentence, not knowing what's going to be and especially we did not have no inkling that how how the war was going. </sentence><sentence id="824">That was 1943 and I understand after the war that the Russians, they had such a great victory over the Germans and we didn't have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="825">In 1943 when the Germans were loosing on the Stalingrad and so on, they took us, took more revenge on the Jews than ever before, what I read after the war. </sentence><sentence id="826">I...I...and continues like this. </sentence><sentence id="827">We were in the Gleiwitz prison camp for two years. </sentence><sentence id="828">A lot of people die. </sentence><sentence id="829">A lot of people were sick, were driven off to Auschwitz, and I kept on, continued writing letters and seeing my girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="830">At one time an incident...on Sunday we'd get close to the fence. </sentence><sentence id="831">There was a fence separate us, and I would speak to her from far away and then the Wachte, the soldier would see us and then we would run away into respective barracks, and the head, the German head of the compound, went on the German, on the women's barracks and he wanted to know who was seeing the Maenner, and nobody came out. </sentence><sentence id="832">Well, then he said, if nobody comes up, every tenth girl is going to get...the women had some hair, short, but they didn't had their hair shaven completely, so he said every tenth girl going to have her head shaven for punishment, so my wife thought why some women who never went up, talked to a man, why should they have their heads shaven so she volunteered, and she came up...yes, I have been the one that spoke to the man. </sentence><sentence id="833">And to show him that...to show the other girls that she was so brave, he said because you came up so brave, you go back out. </sentence><sentence id="834">You're not going to get your head shaven, and then he took every tenth girl and got her head shaven. </sentence><sentence id="835">The next morning we were...the girls were working three times eight hours. </sentence><sentence id="836">We worked twelve hours. </sentence><sentence id="837">The women worked eight hour shifts, so sometimes we would pass each other coming into camp and other and I I wasn't sure whether...I didn't know whether they had her hair shaven or not because they were all wearing scarves over over their heads because the work, it was so...the girls who did not, did have their head shaven, they would put a piece of hair just in front of it to show they had some hair, and I wasn't sure whether my friend at that time had had her hair shaven or not. </sentence><sentence id="838">Later on I found out she was the 02:07: brave one. </sentence><sentence id="839">She

figured my girlfriend must be there, so I plough on through, stepping on all kinds of people and everybody cursing and so on, and I finally found her. </sentence><sentence id="849">It was January

us. </sentence><sentence id="859">Well, I 1 was always trying to figure out better way how to build a better mousetrap, so I got on on the side the the open cattle wagons so I'll be higher than

next train, say give it to Helen. </sentence><sentence id="860">You have to deliver it in your own hands, otherwise they'll never see the bread, so the train was moving and I went over to the side and

run on the bridge, and the one bomb fell next to me and I got half-way buried with dirt, and I been screaming and yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Some other guys would pull me up, but I left one shoe inside and on that shoe I I was mourning so much because I could not walk without shoes and it was a big loss just to lose that one shoe. </sentence><sentence id="1035">Later on I retrieve from somebody who who I found laying there dead and I put the shoes on. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Laying there in the in the (sniff) theater, we were completely covered with lice, you know, laying with each other. </sentence><sentence id="1037">We didn't have any kind of hygiene or any kind of water to wash for so many weeks and we were completely overrun with lice that our flesh were eaten with lice and you couldn't get rid of it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1038">There was no, nothing provided for us. </sentence><sentence id="1039">When we were marching, everybody been trying to march next to the curb because as much the Germans didn't have cigarettes, they smoke up to a little small stump, so when sometimes the wind would blow the stumps next to the curb and you would pick up that stump and I found this can from shoe polish and I would loosen it up and put it in there and sometimes I would find a piece of newspaper or a piece from a telephone book like, fine paper, and I would get up in that movie house like three o'clock in the morning when everybody would sleep and I would roll up a big cigarette and that was my biggest pleasure and I would smoke that cigarette and one day I came in and a big, big guy...kapo, a German prisoner also...he smelled it and he came in. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Not only he took the cigarette away from me, I got a terrible beating from him, not...I don't know all the reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1041">He just took, took his anger for some reason out on me because I was... was brave enough to get up three o'clock in the morning and smoke a cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="1042">There was a buddy system (cough). </sentence><sentence id="1043">We would sleep two, because everybody had one blanket and it was cold, so if you find...you always find somebody, a buddy. </sentence><sentence id="1044">It was always the buddy system. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Nobody would walk alone. </sentence><sentence id="1046">You always go together, two. </sentence><sentence id="1047">When you sleep you put one blanket under you and the other blanket you cover both of us and from breathing you keep warm that way. </sentence><sentence id="1048">One night I was...I don't know who the person is...all I knew is that he was another prisoner and I slept and then I touched him, and he died right sleeping with me. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And although I've seen so many people die around me, that was a terrible experience that I slept with somebody that died right next to me. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And next morning I was standing alone and somebody else looked for for buddy system and we would pair up again and we walked together. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Just unknown...just anybody...just being together. </sentence><sentence id="1052">After a few weeks in Regensburg, apparently the Allies must have been pushing, unknown to us...we were we were marching nights and I guess the reason they didn't want to go daytime maybe the planes would spot us. </sentence><sentence id="1053">We would sleep whenever we would stop close by...in a barn or whatever and work, walk nights. </sentence><sentence id="1054">My feet were swollen so I couldn't take my shoes anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1055">I was afraid...be afraid take my wooden shoes

the SS that she want to feed us and they wouldn't let us to feed us, but finally she won and they they boiled the potatoes, you know, and peeled, and they were peeling it, and the farmer stood there with a big pan and gave everybody a pan full of boiled potatoes and she would stay with a big loaf of bread and cut a big loaf of bread and give everybody a slice of bread, and I guess the woman never seen human beings like this because even being German, she stood there. </sentence><sentence id="1062">She had tears in her eyes and gave everybody a big slice of bread, because she'd never seen human

anymore and I was walking like my nerves were carrying me. </sentence><sentence id="1066">I was 02:33: just, just going like this and the way you march is when you look around, you find yourself to be the last one in the column. </sentence><sentence id="1067">You don't want to be the last one because you get the last one, you mostly get shot, so you push forward. </sentence><sentence id="1068">You
