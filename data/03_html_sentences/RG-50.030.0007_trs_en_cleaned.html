<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: My father was a chemical engineer. </sentence><sentence id="32">My mother was a housewife. </sentence><sentence id="33">Uh we all went to school and uh we had a very comfortable existence. </sentence><sentence id="34">It was good living in those days in in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="35">It was really was a good life, a good wholesome life. </sentence><sentence id="36">And uh we had a good social life and uh my brothers were...I'm the youngest of the boys and had three little sisters, and uh we all loved one another. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="39">Come on home and and uh when you go to the schul (ph), the temple, come right back home and we kept the holidays and we had a all around good life and uh people were

everybody was served. </sentence><sentence id="46">We were always the last one to get what we want, if we were lucky enough to get it. </sentence><sentence id="47">And by by the time I was eleven, twelve years old, I was thrown out of school. </sentence><sentence id="48">Well, there there was a Jewish school in my uh hometown, in Leipzig (ph), but there were so many Jewish kids that they didn't have enough room for all the kids. </sentence><sentence id="49">So we only could go to school maybe two hours a week or three hours a week in shifts. </sentence><sentence id="50">And we had all this...I took stride. </sentence><sentence id="51">I just didn't...1 really didn't understand this whole thing, and nobody else really explained anything to us. </sentence><sentence id="52">They would try to keep it away from us...until uh 1938. </sentence><sentence id="53">The week before Kristallnacht when they start to arrest all the Jews of Polish background origin, they deported them. </sentence><sentence id="54">Uh the children were in school and the fathers were at their place of work and the mothers were in in the houses cooking and things, and just were arrested, one after another, put to...not not given time uh to pack anything. </sentence><sentence id="55">Took them to trains...the father in one train, the mother in the other train. </sentence><sentence id="56"> Nobody knew where anybody was and the children came home from school. </sentence><sentence id="57">The place was padlocked. </sentence><sentence id="58">They sat outside, didn't know what was happening to them. </sentence><sentence id="59">Then they grabbed the children, put them on another train until they they worked it out, what was happening and everybody started running for the em...consulate, the embassies, because the embassies...they couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="60">They were safe there. </sentence><sentence id="61">So they went to the French Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="62">They went to the American Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="63">They went to the Russian Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="64">They went to the Danish, Norwegian, Swiss...anything that was near. </sentence><sentence id="65">So our job was to bring food to these people and take messages, because if the wife was in the Danish Embassy and the husband was in the in the French Embassy, we just took messages back and forth trying to seek the families out to tell them that their loved ones were alright. </sentence><sentence id="66">That went on for a couple of days, and uh the night...the 8th of November...I believe it was the 9th or the 8th...8th or 9th of November I believe...I never forgot...the uh the uh Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="67">That is when I really really was hit with the uh with the happenings there. </sentence><sentence id="68">They came to our house. </sentence><sentence id="69">They broke everything up and like that in every other house. </sentence><sentence id="70">They were raping the young girls in the streets and and dragging men by their beards through the streets and burning down the temples and and and and and

blood and honor, and punks, bands of punks and they're beating everybody up, taking people to concentration camps, arresting people and it was just a terrible, terrible night. </sentence><sentence id="72">It started about three o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="73">That night they arrested my brother Paul. </sentence><sentence id="74">My brother uh Bernie (ph), he had left. </sentence><sentence id="75">Of course, there was still home...I was still home, my three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="76">We were hiding in one of the beds but they dragged us out, beat up my mother and the next day it was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="77">The smoke was still coming out of the buildings of the temples and the schules and houses and there was still blood in the street. </sentence><sentence id="78">Now I knew...now I knew...something terrible is happening. </sentence><sentence id="79">But I didn't know what to do about it. </sentence><sentence id="80">1 had my mama. </sentence><sentence id="81">I had my mother. </sentence><sentence id="82">She was always taking care of us. ( </sentence><sentence id="83">Sigh) Well, my brother Paul to Buchenwald (ph). </sentence><sentence id="84">My other brother went to Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="85">They were taken, and a few days later they came to our house from a Jewish organization and they said we can save one child. </sentence><sentence id="86">Which one is going to live and which ones are going to die? ( </sentence><sentence id="87">Sigh) My mother had to make a choice and by the time the choice was made and everything, the other one was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="88">Was just left me and my three little sisters. </sentence><sentence id="89">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="90">A couple of months passed and my mother sent me out for a loaf of bread and I never came back. </sentence><sentence id="91">A car came screeching to a halt...are you a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="92">I was sixteen years old...fifteen, sixteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="93">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="94">I didn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="95">These were mean looking men. </sentence><sentence id="96">They put me into the car and I found myself in prison. </sentence><sentence id="97">No explanation was given. </sentence><sentence id="98">None was asked. </sentence><sentence id="99">I remember the cell, cell number ten. </sentence><sentence id="100">My mother wondered what happened to me...send me out for a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="101">I was in jail about...I would say about two months, three months...till May, approximately May. </sentence><sentence id="102">Suddenly they let me go free. </sentence><sentence id="103">I had to sign a paper that I was going to leave Germany within forty-eight hours...they will let me go, and that I was treated well. </sentence><sentence id="104">Again I didn't know what I was signing. </sentence><sentence id="105">They told me to sign. </sentence><sentence id="106">I signed. </sentence><sentence id="107">And I went home. </sentence><sentence id="108">I remember to this day...my mother stay...stood at the door of our apart...our house. </sentence><sentence id="109">She had ten marks...that was all we were allowed to take. </sentence><sentence id="110">Ten marks. </sentence><sentence id="111">She must have had this in cash laying around because all our money had been confiscated by the  state, and we had nothing left and she said to me, you have to leave home. </sentence><sentence id="112">Don't even go into the house. </sentence><sentence id="113">You have to leave home right now. </sentence><sentence id="114">Here is ten marks. </sentence><sentence id="115">She says go to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="116">Italy was the only country that had open borders because they are friends with . </sentence><sentence id="117">Hitler was the leader. </sentence><sentence id="118">They were friends. </sentence><sentence id="119">They had no closed border. </sentence><sentence id="120">And that was the only country that had an open border for Germans. </sentence><sentence id="121">I had no passport. </sentence><sentence id="122">I had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="123">I had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="124">Here...take the train, she says. </sentence><sentence id="125">Here is a card, a railroad ticket I got for you. </sentence><sentence id="126">Take the train and go into Italy and just one by one...don't ever look back. </sentence><sentence id="127">So I said to her where are my other two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="128">I had three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="129">She said they're on their way to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="130">I sent them with some people, with some friends to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="131">Only Toni (ph), the little one, she had in her arm. </sentence><sentence id="132">Must have been about...I don't know...four, three, four years old. </sentence><sentence id="133">So I said goodbye...I was a good boy so I said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="134">Mamma said go...I go. </sentence><sentence id="135">And uh that is when my life started. </sentence><sentence id="136">I went to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="137">I took a train into Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Where was your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: When did...where did he go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: He went into a camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: When he was taken there...Kristallnacht? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="257">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="258">Now my mother was alone with my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="259">How my mother ever got me out of that jail I will never know to this day. </sentence><sentence id="260">I am sure she must have bribed a lot of people to get me out. </sentence><sentence id="261">But she saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="262">So where does one go? </sentence><sentence id="263">One goes to Milano (ph), Italy. </sentence><sentence id="264">In Milano, arriving in Milan...we had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="265">I wasn't the only one. </sentence><sentence id="266">There were hundreds...men, women, children...anyone who could themselves, they went down there. ( </sentence><sentence id="267">Sigh) We had no food to eat. </sentence><sentence id="268">We had no place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="269">We slept on park benches, in doorways, in parks, and we like a hole, like rats. </sentence><sentence id="270">So the Jews of Milan, they got together and they opened up soup kitchens and they got organized and so at least we could have one meal a day, somewhat of a meal a day. </sentence><sentence id="271">That was done for a while, a week, two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="272">Then the Germans found out that the Jews are treated to some...to a meal a day, and they they made arrangements with the Italian authorities because we told the Italians that we were tourists, otherwise you couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="273">We were tourists. </sentence><sentence id="274">So they let us in. </sentence><sentence id="275">And now they said if you're tourists, then you've got to have money and if you have money, you don't need any soup kitchens, and if you're not tourists, then we have to send you back where you came from. </sentence><sentence id="276">Made a lot of sense to them...didn't make any sense to us though. </sentence><sentence id="277">They closed up the soup kitchens. </sentence><sentence id="278">That was the end of food. </sentence><sentence id="279">more than one meal a day. </sentence><sentence id="280">So another few days and uh like I always was, I used to climb into the tree, some backyards, and pluck some fresh figs. ( </sentence><sentence id="281">Laughter) I...I stole some olives from trees, but there was to steal. </sentence><sentence id="282">It was edible and to stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="283">Then the word got around that France will let anybody in. </sentence><sentence id="284">The men have to go to the French Army,  because war was eminent, and the women had to volunteer for the French Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="285">We said wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="286">We all went to the French Embassy, and we all got that...the one day flag they call it. </sentence><sentence id="287">We got a visa to enter France that was good for 24 hours only. </sentence><sentence id="288">Well, there was only train going to the French border because the war broke out quite a few weeks after that. </sentence><sentence id="289">We had to get that train and they gave us a train ticket so we went for that train. </sentence><sentence id="290">Now what that train looked like you will never know. </sentence><sentence id="291">They were hanging out of the windows. </sentence><sentence id="292">They were laying on the roofs...inside...outside. </sentence><sentence id="293">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="294">They...they...they held children out out the windows. </sentence><sentence id="295">There was room for them. </sentence><sentence id="296">They were suffocating inside. </sentence><sentence id="297">There must have been a thousand people or maybe fifteen hundred people on a on a train that is good for three hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="298">The train took off. </sentence><sentence id="299">It couldn't go very fast because people were on the roofs. </sentence><sentence id="300">They were hanging out windows. </sentence><sentence id="301">Outside...inside and they were hanging on their fingernails. </sentence><sentence id="302">People fell off, actually fell off the train while the train was moving so the train conductor didn't go to fast because he saw what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="303">By the time we got to the Italian/French border, it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="304">The French had closed the border and there's a little piece of land called no man's land and the Italians wouldn't let us back. </sentence><sentence id="305">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="306">So we laid on that little piece land...there was a fishing village. </sentence><sentence id="307">.St. </sentence><sentence id="308">Reno__...it's right on the border. . </sentence><sentence id="309">It's right on the border, and these old fishermen with these old boats...they saw a way to make money. </sentence><sentence id="310">Now these were impoverished people that never had anything except to catch a few fish now and then. </sentence><sentence id="311">So they said to us, we'll take you around the bent...it's a big rock...and you had to go around the bent onto the beaches of France if you give us everything you have and uh pay us whatever you can pay, and we'll load up the boats. </sentence><sentence id="312">We'll take you. </sentence><sentence id="313">But what they didn't tell people, that the boats were old and that the breakers in the ocean were very strong onto the onto the uh __, unto the stone, unto the uh onto the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="314">The mountain came back out of the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="315">The waves were high and very strong and very uh uh dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="316">So as greedy as they were, they overloaded the boats. </sentence><sentence id="317">Some people had a wedding band, an engagement ring, maybe a few francs, maybe a few lire, maybe a little piece of jewelry that they saved, that they smuggled out. </sentence><sentence id="318">They overloaded. </sentence><sentence id="319">They gave them everything they owned. </sentence><sentence id="320">They overloaded the boats. </sentence><sentence id="321">They went out a little bit, and the boats broke in two. </sentence><sentence id="322">They capsized. </sentence><sentence id="323">They broke in two. </sentence><sentence id="324">The fishermen swam back. </sentence><sentence id="325">He has been fishing...he has been swimming since he was two years old, so there were people that couldn't swim. </sentence><sentence id="326">Now you tell me...who do you save when you're a father and and your little girl says Daddy, save me, and your little boy says Papa, save me. </sentence><sentence id="327">And your wife is drowning. </sentence><sentence id="328">Who do you save...and you can't swim, and the waves are high. </sentence><sentence id="329">The next day the the bodies came washing ashore. </sentence><sentence id="330">And there were two boats out there, two uh gun boats. </sentence><sentence id="331">A French one and an Italian gunboat. </sentence><sentence id="332">And the the personnel on these boats, they were looking out and they saw the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="333">Nobody lifted their finger to help. </sentence><sentence id="334">The screams of help, please help, help my children, help my wife, uh save us...still ring into my ears to this day. </sentence><sentence id="335">Nobody cared. </sentence><sentence id="336">I met somebody there that knew my family and they said to me, you know about your brother Paul. </sentence><sentence id="337">I says what. </sentence><sentence id="338">He got out. </sentence><sentence id="339">He went to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="340">The word got out. </sentence><sentence id="341">He was married. </sentence><sentence id="342">He had a twenty year old wife and he had a one year old baby. </sentence><sentence id="343">I said you know what happened to Judy (ph). </sentence><sentence id="344">Have you heard and had any word. </sentence><sentence id="345">He says yes. </sentence><sentence id="346">He tried to smuggle them out into Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="347">He paid smugglers to bring them out. </sentence><sentence id="348"> The smugglers took all their...what they owned in the middle of the woods and abandoned them. </sentence><sentence id="349">The baby started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="350">The Germans got them and hang them. </sentence><sentence id="351">They hang _ fromthe _ wife and baby next to her. </sentence><sentence id="352">They were found like that. </sentence><sentence id="353">I said anything you know about my brother Paul. </sentence><sentence id="354">He says yes. </sentence><sentence id="355">He went half crazy. </sentence><sentence id="356">So the word got out and he went into France. </sentence><sentence id="357">That's the last we heard of him. </sentence><sentence id="358">Because here and there, here and there, you found people that knew something about somebody. ( </sentence><sentence id="359">Sigh) Now we're stuck there on this piece of land there, and we had to...well not much of a chance to tun to...to one side you had the French with their guns looking at us, and on the other side you had the Italians with guns looking at us, and to the front you had the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="360">There was nothing you could do with the ocean and in the back of you, you had a mountain. </sentence><sentence id="361">The highest mountain we ever saw was the garbage dump in our city. </sentence><sentence id="362">I never saw a mountain in my life before. </sentence><sentence id="363">How do you get out? </sentence><sentence id="364">A little boy hung on to me. </sentence><sentence id="365">He was twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="366">His name was Heinz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="367">He got lost, someplace along the the running, he got lost from his family. </sentence><sentence id="368">He says he wants to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="369">I said hang on, and then a few days passed by and the only help you got was from a few monks that used to come and used to give us a little milk and a little piece of bread, a few figs, a few uh uh olives and things. </sentence><sentence id="370">It was a pitiful sight. </sentence><sentence id="371">And yet I wasn't really worried. </sentence><sentence id="372">I just absorbed all this like matter of fact, and then said well, I'm going to do something about this. </sentence><sentence id="373">And I looked around, tried to make up my mind which way to go, and uh I said wouldn't the best approach be just go right up to the French border, crawl through the barbed wire there, and get inside. </sentence><sentence id="374">Now wouldn't that be just just a crazy thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="375">Said to Heinz, look...we can't take the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="376">We can't go back to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="377">We can't officially go to France. </sentence><sentence id="378">We can't go the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="379">We'll never...never make it. </sentence><sentence id="380">I have an idea. </sentence><sentence id="381">Let's do the crazy thing that nobody expects us to do. </sentence><sentence id="382">He says, what? </sentence><sentence id="383">I said let's go right through the barbed wire into...let's go right into France. </sentence><sentence id="384">He said, you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="385">I said yes, that's why...that's what everybody thinks...I'm crazy. </sentence><sentence id="386">Let's do the crazy thing. </sentence><sentence id="387">That's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="388">I said we're going to die. </sentence><sentence id="389">We're going to starve to death here, and there must have been about a thousand, maybe fourteen hundred people lying on this ground. </sentence><sentence id="390">I don't know ever what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="391">I don't...never found out what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="392">We went through the wire, and I said you just follow me. </sentence><sentence id="393">What happen will happen. </sentence><sentence id="394">What have we got to loose? </sentence><sentence id="395">And I wasn't worried really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="396">| was maybe too young to worry about things and too ignorant. ( </sentence><sentence id="397">Laughter) We did that. </sentence><sentence id="398">Coming out on the other side I was looking up and I looked into the barrel of a gun. </sentence><sentence id="399">There was a French guard there and border guards there. </sentence><sentence id="400">He looked down at me. </sentence><sentence id="401">I looked up at him, and Heinz stopped crawling and I stopped crawling, and he had the gun aimed at us, so I said to him in German...shoot me but let him live. </sentence><sentence id="402">He's only twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="403">So it was that somebody something in French. </sentence><sentence id="404">I could not speak it. </sentence><sentence id="405">He...he called something back in French, and he says...he spoke broken German...he said to me, see that train over there. </sentence><sentence id="406">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="407">Get in it. </sentence><sentence id="408">It's going to go to Nice, into France. </sentence><sentence id="409">uncivilized person. </sentence><sentence id="410">We went in. </sentence><sentence id="411">We were very tired and we fell asleep, two of us. </sentence><sentence id="412">Dirty, bloody, hungry, thirsty, cold...went to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="413">We woke up in Nice. </sentence><sentence id="414">We got out in Nice and we dragged ourselves through the streets. </sentence><sentence id="415">I spoke no French. </sentence><sentence id="416">We had...we'd never been in a French country. </sentence><sentence id="417">We didn't know what France was all about, and we went to a doorway and went asleep, and they arrested us, the gendarmes. </sentence><sentence id="418">That is when I first met the gendarmes, the guard du  mobile (ph), and let me assure you the gendarmes and the guard du mobile, they are not the gentlest of people. </sentence><sentence id="419">They really are nasty dogs. </sentence><sentence id="420">They grabbed us. </sentence><sentence id="421">They called us spies, spies there. </sentence><sentence id="422">I was a spy and they threw us in jail. </sentence><sentence id="423">Now in France if you're caught about illegally, they...that's the law. </sentence><sentence id="424">You'll get one month in jail, before they even talk to you. </sentence><sentence id="425">I learned to understand what jail is in France. </sentence><sentence id="426">Jail is a dirty cell with roaches and rats and and you get a drink of water a day and a piece of bread full of ants. </sentence><sentence id="427">In order to eat the bread full of...and you knock out the ants as best you can...you break off a piece of bread and throw it in the corner, let the rats fight over it while they let you eat...quickly eat the other piece. </sentence><sentence id="428">That's is jail in France. </sentence><sentence id="429">After one day, took me out and they put me into a open car, like they called that the commando, like with eight people could sit there, like a long open van or something...I don't know what you call it. </sentence><sentence id="430">Eight guard du mobile, eight of them...they put me in chains. </sentence><sentence id="431">My...my legs and my arm in chains, and it took eight guards du mobile...guard du mobile is the French police and gendarmes...to guard me, after they chased me down, after I was already down to nothing from lack of food and lack of sleep and and and I had no more tears left to cry. </sentence><sentence id="432">I don't know what happened to Heinz. </sentence><sentence id="433">And they took me out. </sentence><sentence id="434">Nobody told me where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="435">Nobody told me anything. </sentence><sentence id="436">We went to Entibe (ph), a place called Entibe. </sentence><sentence id="437">Entibe is outside Nice, a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="438">They call it internment camp, but don't you believe it. </sentence><sentence id="439">Don't you believe internment camps. </sentence><sentence id="440">Resettlement camps. </sentence><sentence id="441">Don't you believe it. </sentence><sentence id="442">These are concentration camps, in the sense of the word...concentration camps with all their pitfalls, all their filth and all their dirt and and and and and and all their...all their

id="964">We went to little villages, French villages, you know where the bakers put their long breads in baskets outside the store. </sentence><sentence id="965">I was a good runner, and I was a good thief. </sentence><sentence id="966">I learned as I went along. </sentence><sentence id="967">I was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="968">So I said to the guys, get me a few guys, good, the best

id="985">We couldn't speak French. </sentence><sentence id="986">We couldn't speak no other language. </sentence><sentence id="987">Nobody talks because if you speak German, the French hate the _, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="988">They're going to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="989">Nobody talked. </sentence><sentence id="990">We get caught, nobody talks. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="994">The farmer came out. </sentence><sentence id="995">Two farmers came out in fact, with pitch forks. </sentence><sentence id="996">They found us. </sentence><sentence id="997">They would have put those pitch forks right through us because food was always scarce. </sentence><sentence id="998">They didn't...they didn't appreciate anybody stealing their eggs or chickens for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="999">I tell you we never run so fast in our lives over the fields. </sentence><sentence id="1000">After a few miles out there, we start eating some of the wine, the grapes that grow in the fields, but the farmers put a chemical on those grapes uh so the flies and things don't uh spoil them. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They gave us diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="1002">We got sick from them. </sentence><sentence id="1003">It was a bad situation, believe me. </sentence><sentence id="1004">We finally made it to Neim (ph), and we went to Langlade two at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1005">The others stayed in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1006">Only two at a time traveled. </sentence><sentence id="1007">We went to Langlade. </sentence><sentence id="1008">There was a small village, small French village, and...a deserted village, nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Empty...just the houses stood there. </sentence><sentence id="1010">We went in there. </sentence><sentence id="1011">We saw a guard, one our people, one of the crowd, and they took us in. </sentence><sentence id="1012">We joined them.

surrounded...somebody must have gotten wind of it...by the gendarmes, the French gendarmes, and they asked us to give up. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Well,  0 we knew we were in the south of France, and you remember well that France was occupied only half and the other one was Vichy controlled, Marshall and 3 you know about that. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So at least we knew we were in the south of France. </sentence><sentence id="1017">You always had to go south. </sentence><sentence id="1018">So we got together, said look, all the young guys, guys like, you know, fifteen, sixteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two...make a run for it over the field. </sentence><sentence id="1019">We're going to shoot out at the gendarmes on one side, and you run on the other side.

</sentence><sentence id="1023">We are older guys. </sentence><sentence id="1024">We expect it...we expected this anytime to happen, so it happen now. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Maybe we'll get away too. </sentence><sentence id="1026">But we'll fight it out. </sentence><sentence id="1027">We...we're going to give them a run for their money. </sentence><sentence id="1028">In the meantime you make a run for it, all the young kids, make a run for it, because you're the ones that can run. </sentence><sentence id="1029">We can't. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And believe me, we got good at running. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Sure enough, they started the firing and he says go and we went, and we run over the fields while they keep the gendarmes busy. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And the French aren't anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1033">We found that out. </sentence><sentence id="1034">They they're not too bright. </sentence><sentence id="1035">They're cruel. </sentence><sentence id="1036">They're barbaric, but they're not bright. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And where will you go? </sentence><sentence id="1038">You're running through the fields. </sentence><sentence id="1039">Where will you go? </sentence><sentence id="1040">Naturally...Nice. </sentence><sentence id="1041">That's the answer...Nice, toward the Italian border. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Nice is toward the Italian border. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I end up in Nice and what the French did...they would close up a part of the town. </sentence><sentence

you, the only way we kept our sanity was we knocked on the wall and the other guy knocked back. </sentence><sentence id="1284">That was the only outside contact we had. </sentence><sentence id="1285">It was a little cell that you could hardly lay down your blankets. </sentence><sentence id="1286">No bed, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1287">We had to lay on stone. </sentence><sentence id="1288">We had very little water. </sentence><sentence id="1289">We had very little food, and there was just no way that we ever found out what was going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1290">We lost...we lost uh uh track of time. </sentence><sentence id="1291">We didn't know what day of the week, what month we be...we just didn't any more uh uh mentally uh whether it was day or whether it was night or what. </sentence><sentence id="1292">It was dark in there with a little tiny window where they pushed the stuff going and and a little pot to uh uh

don't...you didn't care anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1294">There was just so much you could absorb. </sentence><sentence id="1295">There was just so much abuse and beatings and and and starvation and and thirst and cold and heat that you could ab...that you could take. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And this was just enough. </sentence><sentence id="1297">You just...many times you thought I wished I don't get up tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="1298">The hell with it. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I don't care anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1300">You didn't give a damn any more, but finally one day they took us out and they put us...took us to the railroad station and put us into a cattle train where they transported camels and donkeys, and they packed us in there. </sentence><sentence id="1301">We had no idea where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And they said well, you'll never make it. </sentence><sentence id="1303">By the time we get through with you, there won't be much left of you. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Nobody answered. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Nobody said anything. </sentence><sentence id="1306">There was nothing...there was

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1348">Q: Did people share? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1350">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1351">We all kind of...you know, if you're so hungered and so thirsty that you that your tongue swells on, you know, when you're very, very thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="1352">I mean very thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="1353">Your tongue has a tendency to swell out and you choke on your own tongue. </sentence><sentence id="1354">It happened to people. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And when you see a drink of water, believe me, you go for it. </sentence><sentence id="1356">When you see a piece of bread, you go for it. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Well, after about three days in that...it's about two hundred miles into the Sahara, through the desert...the desert as well as swamp land and nothings...I would call it a barren desert...so finally the train stopped and everybody out. </sentence><sentence id="1358">They had the Spahice (ph) watching us now. </sentence><sentence id="1359">The Spahice is an elite Arab police force, called the Spahice. </sentence><sentence id="1360">They have sabers and they are on horseback and they are vicious. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I mean vicious. </sentence><sentence id="1362">They were guarding us. </sentence><sentence id="1363">When we were dragging ourselves, we saw a few miles down the road we saw a few tents, tents and barbed wire around it in the middle of nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="1364">That was Camp Djelfa (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1365">Little did we know...we dragged ourselves through the sand to get into the camp, all chained together. </sentence><sentence id="1366">Oh the the French are famous for chaining you up. </sentence><sentence id="1367">We were real dangerous people...half-dead, half-starved...I mean half- sick...all kinds of dangerous people...so we dragged ourselves and we dragged the ones that couldn't even walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1368">We dragged dead ones with us that were chained to us. </sentence><sentence id="1369">They were dead. </sentence><sentence id="1370">We had to drag them along the sand, and we could hardly ourselves walk. </sentence><sentence id="1371">We got into Djelfa very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="1372">They were beating us all the way down, with whips, with horse whips. </sentence><sentence id="1373">Uh on their horseback they had these long whips. </sentence><sentence id="1374">They were whipping us all the way down and if you fell down, they would beat you till you got up,  5 and it hurt. </sentence><sentence id="1375">It really hurt. </sentence><sentence id="1376">We got there into the camp and we had to stand at attention for the camp commander to come to address us, so we stood there for hours till he finally showed up. </sentence><sentence id="1377">He showed up with his German Shepherd and uh he had somebody with him and they pulled out a great big steak and they gave it to the dog and we had to watch how the dog ate that great big steak, and then you heard a speech, and I will never forget if I were to get a thousand years old which will never happen but that's just __...he says...alright, he says. </sentence><sentence id="1378">| am your camp commander. </sentence><sentence id="1379">You all came here to die. </sentence><sentence id="1380">It's just a matter of time. </sentence><sentence id="1381">If you do what you're told, you live a little longer. </sentence><sentence id="1382">If not, you die sooner.(Cough) Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1383">He said but you all came here to die. </sentence><sentence id="1384">Sooner or later, you all die. </sentence><sentence id="1385">None of you will come out alive. </sentence><sentence id="1386">That is my job, to see to that, and I'm very good at my job. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Now get into the tents. </sentence><sentence id="1388">So they unchained us. </sentence><sentence id="1389">He had an adjutant with him. </sentence><sentence id="1390">Now the camp commander...let me explain this to you...he was a...the book will tell you that...the guy that wrote that book...he was a sadist and a drunk. </sentence><sentence id="1391">And the adjutant...he had an adjutant with him, his right hand...he was also a sadist. </sentence><sentence id="1392">They would put people up for no reason. </sentence><sentence id="1393">So we didn't know how bad it was. </sentence><sentence id="1394">We found out later that Djelfa was the the worst camp...there were many other camps, _, , Djelfa...there were many other camps there, but Djelfa was the worst concentration camp in all of Africa. </sentence><sentence id="1395">The only people that were sent to Djelfa were the ones they rounded up in France and anywheres they could find them, the most dangerous people to France, the most dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1396">That's the ones they sent like a . </sentence><sentence id="1397">That's the ones they sent to Djelfa, to Africa, to isolate them from the rest of the world and eventually kill them. </sentence><sentence id="1398">We found out later. </sentence><sentence id="1399">We went into the tents and we waited, and the next day, the next day we had to work. </sentence><sentence id="1400">Now they were trying to build a trans-Saharian (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1401">They were trying to build a railroad through the desert. </sentence><sentence id="1402">The location of the camp was at the foot of the Atlas (ph) Mountain. </sentence><sentence id="1403">That means that at night, the nights were so cold that your teeth would chatter, and the days were so hot that you almost died from the heat. </sentence><sentence id="1404">It must have been a hundred and forty degree heat in the day, a hundred and fifty, in the shade. </sentence><sentence id="1405">There was no shade. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And during the night you were so cold that you couldn't sleep because you had...you had no control of your teeth that would...that that would...you know, uh uh make such noise. </sentence><sentence id="1407">We had nothing to cover us ourselves with except the rags that we wore. </sentence><sentence id="1408">They gave us one bread a day for a tent, and a cup of coffee in the morning which was black water and a half a liter of soup and a half a liter of soup at night. __-- </sentence><sentence id="1409">soup. </sentence><sentence id="1410">We were full of lice, bugs, and then you started dysentery. </sentence><sentence id="1411">All your blood came out. </sentence><sentence id="1412">There were vipers that would bite you... in one hour, you're dead. </sentence><sentence id="1413">We were full of scorpions. </sentence><sentence id="1414">You know, there are bad things in the sand there. </sentence><sentence id="1415">And we were laying in the sand. </sentence><sentence id="1416">There were forty, fifty people in a tent made for eight and uh you had only lay on your side, and if one had to turn around, the whole tent had to turn around, and uh turn around...if something...something bite you, there was nothing you could do. </sentence><sentence id="1417">You you couldn't do a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1418">Even if it was a scorpion or a viper or a snake, there...then you die. </sentence><sentence id="1419">That's it, and they were building that front area into the desert and you had to work on it ten hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="1420">We had to drag sand from two miles down the road, uh down...two miles down the other road to clear the dunes. </sentence><sentence id="1421">And the Spahice would keep whipping you. </sentence><sentence id="1422">You must have

know...a strict rule...unless they get up and work, they could get no nourishment. </sentence><sentence id="1627">So what we had to do is from the piece of bread that we got, we broke up a little piece into...well, a bowl, whatever you had there, and we collected and we gave it to them...a few pieces, just from a few pieces from the little that we had and gave them a drink of water from mine, a drink of water from the other guy's, and we we made another cup full like from the little bit that we could afford to...you know, that we gave. </sentence><sentence id="1628">And our... remember our

order came down. </sentence><sentence id="1630">Anybody who can't get up, they're going to come around and cut their vein. </sentence><sentence id="1631">So they came around and with their

dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1648">Like Mr. Sadowsky (ph) that wrote that book, he says we lived mostly on rats, snakes and dog. </sentence><sentence id="1649">That is...that's what kept us alive. </sentence><sentence id="1650">That's the desert rats. </sentence><sentence id="1651"> 8 They jump like kangaroos. </sentence><sentence id="1652">You've never seen one? </sentence><sentence

tell him. </sentence><sentence id="1660">You got use to it. </sentence><sentence id="1661">That's what kept us alive in there. </sentence><sentence id="1662">They would...they would just beat you up for the hell of it, just to have fun. </sentence><sentence id="1663">This camp was about the worst bit of hell on this God's earth. </sentence><sentence id="1664">In the rainy season, the tents would fall apart. </sentence><sentence id="1665">They would sink into the ground and tip over. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And the rain wouldn't stop for six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1667">There was a flood out there, and we would lay in the mud for six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1668">Just lay in the mud. </sentence><sentence id="1669">Just no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1670">You couldn't put a tent back up again. </sentence><sentence id="1671">It would sink right back in again. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And we had no way to take a bath. </sentence><sentence id="1673">We didn't take a bath in two years. </sentence><sentence id="1674">We didn't get a haircut in two years. </sentence><sentence id="1675">We didn't get...we didn't brush our teeth in two years. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Just try to stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="1677">Some of...who worried about brushing their teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1678">It was just about like this, like he said in the book, the worst camp in all of Africa. </sentence><sentence id="1679">That's where they put the most dangerous people. </sentence><sentence id="1680">I stayed two years in that camp, from 1941 till 1943. </sentence><sentence id="1681">How I survived that camp, I will never know. </sentence><sentence id="1682">What frightens me the most during those two years, and what I feel guilty about (coughing)...I never thought about my family. </sentence><sentence id="1683">I was so busy worrying about myself, I never worried about any of my family. </sentence><sentence id="1684">That scared me the most. </sentence><sentence id="1685">I was so detached from my family, from life, from the outside world, from life itself, that 1 never thought about them. </sentence><sentence id="1686">I never thought about my home, until I finally got out and I took my mother's picture, and I I wrote down, . </sentence><sentence id="1687">Lescaped death. </sentence><sentence id="1688">We will meet again. </sentence><sentence id="1689">I wrote that down on that picture in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="1690">On the other side was a little space and I wrote down there, luck doesn't seem to like me very much, but I'll make do. </sentence><sentence id="1691">In 1943, in 1942, if you remember well, the Americans had landed in North Africa, and they took over the Hotel which was the biggest hotel in Algiers and they were having a good time already. </sentence><sentence id="1692">They were dancing in the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1693">They were eating and drinking and having...smoking cigars, and we were still in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1694">When the message got...finally got through...there's a camp over there. </sentence><sentence id="1695">Why don't you let these people out? </sentence><sentence id="1696">They're dying there everyday. </sentence><sentence id="1697">They're on their last leg, on their last bit of breathe. </sentence><sentence id="1698">The answer came from the high command...we have our own problems. </sentence><sentence id="1699">What are we going to do with these people? </sentence><sentence id="1700">Where are we going to put them? </sentence><sentence id="1701">How are we going to take care of them? </sentence><sentence id="1702">We have our own uh headaches? </sentence><sentence id="1703">We'll figure out what to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="1704">Leave them there for the time being.(Pause) Now...we stayed there another five months after Algiers was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1705">Five more months in the camp, and died more and more and more in these five months. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Finally the British came and got us out. </sentence><sentence id="1707">They came down the dunes with their their tanks and half-trucks and they saw a bunch of sick people, dragging them...themselves around, naked and half-naked with long hair, unshaven, dirty, filthy, sick, weak. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Who are they?Who are you people? </sentence><sentence id="1709">And we had a man in the camp...he was a professor of at the Vienna University...Professor Dr. Pick (ph)...and he spoke oh something like ten languages, and he went forward and he told them who we are. </sentence><sentence id="1710">So...but they had their guns pointed at us and all sides surrounded the camp and the machine guns pointed at us, and the big guns pointed at us and__ with their hand guns pointed at us. </sentence><sentence id="1711">They're not...why are you pointing guns at us? </sentence><sentence id="1712">We are still dangerous people? </sentence><sentence id="1713">Look at us. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Look at us. </sentence><sentence id="1715">We are the one end of a of a persecuted people that just tried to stay alive, abused and beaten and persecuted and hunted people. </sentence><sentence id="1716">Have you no pity? </sentence><sentence id="1717">You too. </sentence><sentence id="1718">And so they  9 said alright. </sentence><sentence id="1719">By tomorrow you'll all be out, and they got the trucks down through the desert and they picked us all up, on stretchers, carrying us. </sentence><sentence id="1720">There were still people dying. </sentence><sentence id="1721">In the truck there were people dying and we went into Algiers...outside Algiers, a place called which was the 96th General Hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1722">Never forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="1723">They put us into the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1724">At the hospital they tried to get to us to take blood or give us blood or something. </sentence><sentence id="1725">They couldn't get needles through. </sentence><sentence id="1726">Our skin was like leather, so dried out and and thick, so hard from lack of food and lack of uh whatever you normally would have had to stay healthy, so they had to take knives and cut through with knives to give us blood. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And after a month at the hospital, they said now what are we going to do with you people. </sentence><sentence id="1728">They had some intelligence officers talk to us. </sentence><sentence id="1729">Are you going...what do you want to do? </sentence><sentence id="1730">And they called me in. </sentence><sentence id="1731">They said I'll tell you what...you can go anywhere in the free world and you want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1732">We'll give you transportation. </sentence><sentence id="1733">We take care of it. </sentence><sentence id="1734">If you want to go to school, we'll send you to school. </sentence><sentence id="1735">If you want to go to England, go to England. </sentence><sentence id="1736">If you want to go to Israel, go to Israel, anywhere you want to go, go. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And we kept looking behind us because we were looking for the guards to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1738">We were so used to looking behind us because everytime in the camp we had to go to the latrine, we had to call out, latrine. </sentence><sentence id="1739">And the guards would come with this cocked gun...go. </sentence><sentence id="1740">You went to the latrine. </sentence><sentence id="1741">They would stay behind you with a cocked gun, wouldn't know whether he's going to shot you in the back or whether you fall into the you know what. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And we were so used to this, that we couldn't believe there was no one behind us. </sentence><sentence id="1743">So I said to .... couldn't speak a word of English...I said tell you what, I said I feel better now. </sentence><sentence id="1744">You give me a gun. </sentence><sentence id="1745">Now it's my turn to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1746">Now this is my time to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1747">They had...they had their fun. </sentence><sentence id="1748">Now it's my turn to have fun. </sentence><sentence id="1749">They looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="1750">After all this, you want to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1751">I said yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1752">I said look, I left home. </sentence><sentence id="1753">I lost my family. </sentence><sentence id="1754">I lost my country. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I lost my home. </sentence><sentence id="1756">I lost everything that was dear and close to me, everything I loved. </sentence><sentence id="1757">I was hunted like an

hanged by my arms until they was out of their sockets. </sentence><sentence id="1766">I was hosed down with ice water in the cold of night. </sentence><sentence id="1767">I...1...I have seen just about everything. </sentence><sentence id="1768">I have absorbed just what everything that this world threw at me. </sentence><sentence id="1769">There was no help from anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1770">No help came. </sentence><sentence id="1771">Though I begged for help, no help came. </sentence><sentence id="1772">We licked the walls of the prisons for a little bit of moisture. </sentence><sentence id="1773">We knocked on the walls to get the answer to keep our sanity. </sentence><sentence id="1774">They have thrown just about everything at us but the kitchen sink. </sentence><sentence id="1775">They have taken everything from us including our dignity. </sentence><sentence id="1776">What more is there? </sentence><sentence id="1777">What more is there left to live for except having a little fun with them now? </sentence><sentence id="1778">I said can you understand that, sir? </sentence><sentence id="1779">And he just looked at me. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1788">He called in the other __ sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="1789">He says give this man a uniform and give him the regular gun. </sentence><sentence id="1790">I says no. </sentence><sentence id="1791">I want a machine gun. </sentence><sentence id="1792">He says why. </sentence><sentence id="1793">It kills more people in a shorter period of time. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Just give him the plain gun and teach him how to use it. </sentence><sentence id="1795">They gave me a uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1796">You saw the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1797">I had a little training. </sentence><sentence id="1798">I started learning English, the most important words, and I went into battle. </sentence><sentence id="1799">That
