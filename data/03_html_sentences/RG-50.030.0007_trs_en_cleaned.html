id="137">By the time we got to the Italian/French border, it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="138">The French had closed the border and there's a little piece of land called no man's land and the Italians wouldn't let us back. </sentence><sentence id="139">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="140">So we laid on that little piece land...there was a fishing village. </sentence><sentence id="141">.St. </sentence><sentence id="142">Reno__...it's right on the border. . </sentence><sentence id="143">It's right on the border, and these old fishermen with these old

</sentence><sentence id="152">That's the last we heard of him. </sentence><sentence id="153">Because here and there, here and there, you found people that knew something about somebody. ( </sentence><sentence id="154">Sigh) Now we're stuck there on this piece of land there, and we had to...well not much of a chance to tun to...to one side you had the French with their guns looking at us, and on the other side you had the Italians with guns looking at us, and to the front you had the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="155">There was nothing you could do with the ocean and in the back of you, you had a mountain. </sentence><sentence id="156">The highest mountain we ever saw was the garbage dump in our city. </sentence><sentence id="157">I never saw a mountain in my life before. </sentence><sentence id="158">How do you get out? </sentence><sentence id="159">A little boy hung on to me. </sentence><sentence id="160">He was twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="161">His name was Heinz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="162">He got lost, someplace along the the running, he got lost from his family. </sentence><sentence id="163">He says he wants to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="164">I said hang on, and then a few days passed by and the only help you got was from a few monks that used to come and used to give us a little milk and a little piece of bread, a few figs, a few uh uh olives and things. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was a pitiful sight. </sentence><sentence id="166">And yet I wasn't really worried. </sentence><sentence id="167">I just absorbed all this like matter of fact, and then said well, I'm going to do something about this. </sentence><sentence id="168">And I looked around, tried to make up my mind which way to go, and uh I said wouldn't the best approach be just go right up to the French border, crawl through the barbed wire there, and get inside. </sentence><sentence id="169">Now wouldn't that be just just a crazy thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="170">Said to Heinz, look...we can't take the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="171">We can't go back to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="172">We can't officially go to France. </sentence><sentence id="173">We can't go the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="174">We'll never...never make it. </sentence><sentence id="175">I have an idea. </sentence><sentence id="176">Let's do the crazy thing that nobody expects us to do. </sentence><sentence id="177">He says, what? </sentence><sentence id="178">I said let's go right through the barbed wire into...let's go right into France. </sentence><sentence id="179">He said, you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="180">I said yes, that's why...that's what everybody thinks...I'm crazy. </sentence><sentence id="181">Let's do the crazy thing. </sentence><sentence id="182">That's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="183">I said we're going to die. </sentence><sentence id="184">We're going to starve to death here, and there must have been about a thousand, maybe fourteen hundred people lying on this ground. </sentence><sentence id="185">I don't know ever what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="186">I don't...never found out what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="187">We went through the wire, and I said you just follow me. </sentence><sentence id="188">What happen will happen. </sentence><sentence id="189">What have we got to loose? </sentence><sentence id="190">And I wasn't worried really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="191">| was maybe too young to worry about things and too ignorant. ( </sentence><sentence id="192">Laughter) We did that. </sentence><sentence id="193">Coming out on the other side I was looking up and I looked into the barrel of a gun. </sentence><sentence id="194">There was a French guard there and border guards there. </sentence><sentence id="195">He looked down at me. </sentence><sentence id="196">I looked up at him, and Heinz stopped crawling and I stopped crawling, and he had the gun aimed at us, so I said to him in German...shoot me but let him live. </sentence><sentence id="197">He's only twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="198">So it was that somebody something in French. </sentence><sentence id="199">I could not speak it. </sentence><sentence id="200">He...he called something back in French, and he says...he spoke broken German...he said to me, see that train over there. </sentence><sentence id="201">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="202">Get in it. </sentence><sentence id="203">It's going to go to Nice, into France. </sentence><sentence id="204">uncivilized person. </sentence><sentence id="205">We went in. </sentence><sentence id="206"> mobile (ph), and let me assure you the gendarmes and the guard du mobile, they are not the gentlest of people. </sentence><sentence id="207">They really are nasty dogs. </sentence><sentence id="208">They grabbed us. </sentence><sentence id="209">They called us spies, spies there. </sentence><sentence id="210">I was a spy and they threw us in jail. </sentence><sentence id="211">Now in France if you're caught about illegally, they...that's the law. </sentence><sentence id="212">You'll get one month in jail, before they even talk to you. </sentence><sentence id="213">I learned to understand what jail is in France. </sentence><sentence id="214">Jail is a dirty cell with roaches and rats and and you get a drink of water a day and a piece of bread full of ants. </sentence><sentence id="215">In order to eat the bread full of...and you knock out the ants as best you can...you break off a piece of bread and throw it in the corner, let the rats fight over it while they let you eat...quickly eat the other piece. </sentence><sentence id="216">That's is jail in France. </sentence><sentence id="217">After one day, took me out and they put me into a open car, like they called that the commando, like with eight people could sit there, like a long open van or something...I don't know what you call it. </sentence><sentence id="218">Eight guard du mobile, eight of them...they put me in chains. </sentence><sentence id="219">My...my legs and my arm in chains, and it took eight guards du mobile...guard du mobile is the French police and gendarmes...to guard me, after they chased me down, after I was already down to nothing from lack of food and lack of sleep and and and I had no more tears left to cry. </sentence><sentence id="220">I don't know what happened to Heinz. </sentence><sentence id="221">And they took me out. </sentence><sentence id="222">Nobody told me where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="223">Nobody told me anything. </sentence><sentence id="224">We went to Entibe (ph), a place called Entibe. </sentence><sentence id="225">Entibe is outside Nice, a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="226">They call it internment camp, but don't you believe it. </sentence><sentence id="227">Don't you believe internment camps. </sentence><sentence id="228">Resettlement camps. </sentence><sentence id="229">Don't you believe it. </sentence><sentence id="230">These are concentration camps, in the sense of the word...concentration camps with all their pitfalls, all their filth and all their dirt and and and and and and all their...all their nastiness and brutality. </sentence><sentence id="231">There was no place for us to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="232">We slept on floors under the open sky. </sentence><sentence id="233">Was___ maybe two thousand people in there. </sentence><sentence id="234">They pulled up in front of the gate, opened up the gate, took off the chains, grabbed me and threw me into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="235">And I fell down on my face into into the dirt and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="236">They did this. </sentence><sentence id="237">That's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="238">I was in that camp, oh must have been well maybe six weeks, maybe two months and they took us back on transports on trucks and they put us into another camp which was called 5 . </sentence><sentence id="239">That is Marseilles (ph). </sentence><sentence id="240"> me...you know, kept an eye on me. </sentence><sentence id="241">Chased people away. </sentence><sentence id="242">When the other camp ;
