<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: No, at that time it was only boys, but of course girls in -- in the resistance movement, when we should go for instance, into Oslo to look after what had happened [indecipherable] we used our girlfriends -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="432">Q: Mmn-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: -- because the -- they were not suspected, see? </sentence><sentence id="434">But th-they did fine job. </sentence><sentence id="435">Also, all the -- was girls in resistance movement did a wonderful job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="439">Q: So after Norway falls, after two months, where -- where are you? </sentence><sentence id="440">Have you -- have you met the -- the military in the north, or you never got there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: Well, our -- we -- our skiing company fought for about three weeks in southern Norway, then we had to give in, and I went back to Oslo. </sentence><sentence id="444">And then already some [indecipherable] I got the very bad pneumonia, but I got through it and the same month, more or less, July 1940, I met with some friends at the student's hut, out in the wilderness, north of Oslo. </sentence><sentence id="445">We started immediately think, what are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="446">What can we do? </sentence><sentence id="447">It's now two -- 200,000 Germans here. </sentence><sentence id="448">Where can we start? </sentence><sentence id="449">But we thought we will start slowly, building up small groups. </sentence><sentence id="450">Maybe could be an invasion, and we hope for that. </sentence><sentence id="451">And -- but one thing was what -- very important, it was all rumors. </sentence><sentence id="452">The papers were censored, all the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="453">Radios taken, so now it was all rumors. </sentence><sentence id="454">Anybody. </sentence><sentence id="455">It was rumors, rumors. </sentence><sentence id="456">So we thought you have to do something with this, you have to inform people. </sentence><sentence id="457">So then we started secret newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="458">It was about 350 newspapers in Oslo at that time, and I think it came up about at least so many secret newspapers, not with that circulation of course, but one of the newspaper had the circulation of 25,000. </sentence><sentence id="459">The newspaper what was that, we had -- the Norwegian [indecipherable] had put up a -- with BBC, the Norwegian broadcast to Norway, every evening, 7:30. </sentence><sentence id="460">And then these peop -- the news was taken down, that was news from the free world. </sentence><sentence id="461">It was no propaganda, it was -- we had got all the news from the free world. </sentence><sentence id="462">And they were put down, and they were magnified -- I mean, they were copied, and then you could have a sheet of paper, you could have 15, and you spread it round, very often where you were working, at your -- it was spread, and then the Germans propaganda and anti-propaganda was -- for them it was the worst thing. </sentence><sentence id="463">So Gestapo, it was the most terrible thing when -- if you are taken with the -- call it the clandestine newspaper, secretive, you would be arrested, and you could easily be shot. </sentence><sentence id="464">Or you were put into concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="465">I think about 20,000 did this during the war, 5,000 are taken into custody, concentration camp, many, many died. </sentence><sentence id="466">And over 200 Norwegian journalists -- call it journalist, they were shot, why? </sentence><sentence id="467">Because they fought Nazism with pencil and paper. </sentence><sentence id="468">And they were shot, 200 of them are shot during the war, we hear about now. </sentence><sentence id="469">So it was just incredible how the -- and it was two things that -- that Gestapo was after, but I had a real Gestapo force in Norway, secret police, security police, they were after people doing these newspapers, and building up small military groups. </sentence><sentence id="470">And of course they were after other groups, and later on, of course, the Jews, which we -- which we couldn't -- didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="471">We couldn't expect it at all, you know. </sentence><sentence id="472">They were Norwegians, they -- to me it was Norwegians, they had Norwegian passport, they lived in Norway, had -- they were born there. </sentence><sentence id="473">That we couldn't believe at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="507">Q: So let's talk about these newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="508">Ha -- about how many different clandestine newspapers do you think there might have been during this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="511">A: I think it might have been 350. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="516">All over Norway. </sentence><sentence id="517">About the same as we had before, but of course not with that circulation. </sentence><sentence id="518">It's just natural. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="523">Q: And they were distributed what, individually, you would pass them out to people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="525">A: Yes, for instance, when you had copied, let's say 50, you had other coming, fetching them, and of course we also used schoolchildren to distribute them. </sentence><sentence id="526">Could be old people, young people and schoolchildren, girls and boys. </sentence><sentence id="527">They were spread. </sentence><sentence id="528">But when they were grown up, they were taken and of course when you had 20 people [indecipherable] you, it was seen by some traitors, some informers, they would inform on you. </sentence><sentence id="529">They had put up the same as they had in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="530">Security police and informers. </sentence><sentence id="531">You know, in any nation you would have one to two percent which are traitors to your country. </sentence><sentence id="532">And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the -- they were about 4,000 in Oslo. </sentence><sentence id="533">In -- over the two, three years, we had 4,000 informers. </sentence><sentence id="534">And when they saw man with the paper, they informed it to the Gestapo, and that man was tortured. </sentence><sentence id="535">And of course, he had been to a place getting it, and that was -- of course he -- you cannot stand the torture, it's impossible with the torture. </sentence><sentence id="536">They came to Norway with Middle Age torture. </sentence><sentence id="537">Middle Age torture, which I had read about, it i -- was history, and now they came into open with the Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized, or reorganized Norwegian police. </sentence><sentence id="538">So they had about, I should say, 20 percent of them got taken into a new state, it was federal police, state police, and they were just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they were as good as any German Gestapo, any German security officer. </sentence><sentence id="539">So it was a very -- if you were in that, call it that trade, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be arrested, tortured and killed. </sentence><sentence id="540">Was a very great risk. </sentence><sentence id="541">We all -- they all knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="560">Q: But it was e-equally as risky to take the newspaper and be seen with it, as it was to deliver it, I gather? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: Oh yes, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="563">Then they would arrest you, they would torture you and say where did you get it from? </sentence><sentence id="564">Where -- where did you get it from? </sentence><sentence id="565">And, of course, they couldn't stand it, and they -- then they were arrested, others were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="566">But it all the time they kept -- kept on, it was more and more newspapers, secret newspapers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Did you write some of the stuff that went into the newspapers, or did you distribute them, what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: No, we -- I tried a little to begin with, because I started with this in 1940, we already -- we had the newspaper that started already autumn -- fall, "40, and the -- well, I think it fall -- deg41, it was really started, on the -- the very good newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="575">So -- but it was written by our best brains, very good articles, and today you can read them in our resistance museum, they're all there, you can read them, and very interesting to read now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="578">Q: So how long did you work with the clandestine newspap -- were you also, by the way, working at this -- as an assistant accountant still? </sentence><sentence id="579">Did you go back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="582">A: Oh yes, I tried, but I hadn't had time for this, because now I was a resistant worker on full time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="584">Q: Full time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: So then I started to make different aliases because after one year, the Gestapo heard about Hans Jacobsen, he was one of the -- what the hell this is -- one of the leaders. </sentence><sentence id="587">And then the -- a man was tortured, and he said that well, he knew Hans Jacobsen, that was his address, and then of course then the Germans went out and they couldn't find any Hans Jacobsen at all, he had no telephone, he had no address, he had just nothing. </sentence><sentence id="588">So they -- I was there, and then -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="589">Q: Was that your alias at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="590">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="592">Q: Jacobsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: Then I was Hans Jacobsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="596">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: But then when that was known by the Germans, I changed into another name. </sentence><sentence id="599">And I really started to fake this myself. </sentence><sentence id="600">I learned it, and I think I -- I used -- when I had the false papers I had no -- I had made [indecipherable] myself. </sentence><sentence id="601">So I believed them, I knew they were correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="606">Q: Was this easy for you to do? </sentence><sentence id="607">To fake yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: Well, no, it wasn't easy to start with, but for instance, will you -- you will see in one of my passports, one of the worst Gestapos we have ever had was a fellow called Martinsen, he was the head of the Norwegian part of Gestapo, and I today -- even today I can write his signature, because I had the signa -- his signature on one of my passports, and I think I today could write K.A. Martinsen, pol -- chief of police, secret police in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="611">So i -- i -- that was -- I hadn't had it in school, so I had to start from the ke -- beginning, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: Tell me something, did you go -- during this period, the beginning period a-as you started in the resistance in -- did you go back to your family and talk to your parents and tell them what you were doing, so the -- that they -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: A that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="618">Q: -- they wouldn't worry, or they would worry? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="619">A: That's an interesting question, because in "43, January, one man was tortured, and he knew my real name, Gunnar Sonsteby. </sentence><sentence id="620">I think it was my real name. </sentence><sentence id="621">Then they went right up to Rjukan and arrested my father as a hostage for me. </sentence><sentence id="622">But I talked with him, and I thought this would happen, that was the -- the way they did it. </sentence><sentence id="623">And we agreed he'd take -- said -- he said to me, "You take your job, I'll take mine." </sentence><sentence id="624">He was in prison -- concentration camp for two and a half years. </sentence><sentence id="625">But I knew I had to go on, and he was kept in Norway because they couldn't send him to Germany, because then they couldn't threaten to shoot him, you know? </sentence><sentence id="626">They would have -- liked to have in the neighborhood so they could shoot him if it was something with me. </sentence><sentence id="627">But he survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="637">Q: So early on, in 1940, or "41, you spoke to your parents, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: -- it was clear to them that this was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: And my mother knew -- my mother knew about it too. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="641">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="666">A: No, I didn't get bored, because it was terribly interesting. </sentence><sentence id="667">But I h -- then, in "41, I wanted to go to Sweden to report because I don't -- I didn't know what about our allies? </sentence><sentence id="668">What about our people in -- over the -- overseas, in the -- in London. </sentence><sentence id="669">And knew -- I knew they had their office in Stockholm. </sentence><sentence id="670">So I went with one of my refu -- he was a refugee, over to Sweden, to report. </sentence><sentence id="671">And then they told me, we can use you as a growing -- as a career between Oslo and Stockholm. </sentence><sentence id="672">So I started that. </sentence><sentence id="673">So I had about 15 - 20 of these trips between the towns, to report. </sentence><sentence id="674">Then I knew a little more what they wanted with us, from England, wh-what the allied wanted, through the Norwegian government and our defense people in -- in England. </sentence><sentence id="675">So our -- after awhile, I think it was in deg42, ninth of April, 42, then I was in touch with the British. </sentence><sentence id="676">And I said, we're have an organization, I didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="677">It was a S.O.E., special operations executive. </sentence><sentence id="678">And then they asked me, are you willing to go back to Norway, put up an office in Oslo for us, secret of course. </sentence><sentence id="679">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="680">So from ninth of April "40 to ninth of April "43, I had an office in Stockholm -- in Oslo, and every fortnight it came a courier to me, and I had to report -- make a report, so that had be ready when he came, so I wrote the report every fortnight that year, about conditions in Norway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="697">Prior to that, were you not taken to a refugee camp in Sweden? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1039">A: Well, I did, because I followed it all the time, and I -- I mention the name called Knut Moyen. </sentence><sentence id="1040">He and I worked very closely together. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And everything I could do to help him. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Then all the SOE sent in instructors from Great Britain to Norway, and it was a mixture there, it was a little difficult, because the Norwegian organization did one thing, and the groups from England did another thing. </sentence><sentence id="1043">It was the Norwegian independent company number one. </sentence><sentence id="1044">But then, together with Knut Moyen we could discuss this, and I could help him out. </sentence><sentence id="1045">We were both a little unlucky because one of the people coming from England, he was arrested, he was tortured, and he became more or less an informer. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Of course, this -- he was shot, he got shot right through the head, and [indecipherable] so it was terrible, but we are both a little unlucky there because many, many people, 200 people are arrested because of that instructor who was tortured. </sentence><sentence id="1047">But otherwise, I took care of -- I was asked by my authorities to take care of all people come -- all agents coming in from England, from the -- coming around the central part of Norway, and I took care of them, that was part my job, so we could discuss this, and in the -- in a couple of years it was all coordinated. </sentence><sentence id="1048">It was a little because the [indecipherable] thought I should built up with Norwegians alone, but they finally saw that some of the people inside Norway that built up the resistance, they were clever enough to let us -- so they could cooperate, but you know, you couldn't talk to each other in that way in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="1049">I-I-It was all secret, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Communications with England was difficult, everything was difficult, but in two, three years, it was all coordinated within SOE, and the Norwegian authorities in England and also the home front people, the military central leadership in Oslo, it was all finally coordinated from I would say, deg43, it started. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And we had also a very good leader who was very clever, and th -- he was over to England a couple of times, which I was also, but he really was a good man, and he -- they understood in England that he was a -- quite a terribly clever fellow. </sentence><sentence id="1052">He re -- he impressed them. </sentence><sentence id="1053">That helped. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And we had also, of course, Communists, which didn't agree in that kind of leadership. </sentence><sentence id="1055">But I worked together with them, so when I met the man who fought the Germans, that was the important part, whatever he was. </sentence><sentence id="1056">That was the important part for me, so I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Had a good cooperation with them, but legally on top, they would -- they would listen more, of course, to Stockholm, Moscow, than -- instead of to us. </sentence><sentence id="1058">But they were not under Moscow, but to a certain extent they listened more to Moscow than London, which is -- was natural, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1059">But it -- it worked fairly well in Norway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1082">Q: And how would you distinguish the Milorg people from the Linge people, from the Communists? </sentence><sentence id="1083">I mean, how -- ho -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1084">A: It was the same young Norwegian people, but with a different education, call it. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Where -- when you came over to England, you were taken care of by the British on the -- went through all that training schools, and they were -- must have been the best instructors in the world, because when you met -- when you re-met Germans in the war, beginning of the war, the -- like all the soldiers and all that, you -- we felt inferior. </sentence><sentence id="1086">But after being instructed and trained in England, we didn't feel inferior at all. </sentence><sentence id="1087">We knew we had the best weapons, we knew we had the best brains to train us, so now we could be equal. </sentence><sentence id="1088">And being equal, I think we were the best. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1096">Q: So wer -- were all these different groups, representatives from them, brought to England? </sentence><sentence id="1097">The Milorg had people who were England trained also? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1114">Q: And why did so many people want to be pilots? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1116">A: I don't know, because they had done very well, I think in -- from -- you know, over London in 1941 and deg42, they did very well. </sentence><sentence id="1117">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1118">Q: Were there any bad conflicts between these different groups? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1119">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1121">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1123">A: Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="1124">It could be, of course, when you're immigrants, it can always be little small quarrels, but in nor -- to Norwegians, we had been very lucky, and it was -- when we came back to Norway, or when it started, at the end of the war, it was only one real body, and that was the resistance movement in -- under the leadership of the homefront people, and they were the only - - the Communists were -- didn't put up a group like that, so it was all -- we had -- we had no, shall we say possibilities th-that they should start fighting each other in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="1125">We were very -- extremely lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1126">It may be that we are -- I don't know why, really. </sentence><sentence id="1127">But we agreed, or we had all -- one common emeny -- enemy, that was Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1128">And so that was the feeling all over. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I think -- I would say that 95, we had 98 percent behind us in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="1130">They tried whatever they could, they tried to make the pupils, they tried to make the teachers into nat -- Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I mean, it wasn't -- it was -- I think it was impossible in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="1132">I think we had -- after five years hard propaganda, I cannot see that they had any Norwegian turning into Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Only opposite, it was the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="1134">So that doesn't -- pure principle is nothing for us. </sentence><sentence id="1135">We have democratic rules. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2147">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2148">Because I didn't want to go in and out from that building. </sentence><sentence id="2149">So then I had my luncheon for instance, down at the bakery. </sentence><sentence id="2150">I had my dinner with a -- an old lady, a widow, where I could come. </sentence><sentence id="2151">| -- but then when night came I always went back to my hiding place, and I knew it had to be shifted in, for instance, three months. </sentence><sentence id="2152">Then the people could have seen me, and it was some -- after the war, some of the members of the Nazi party, they said, we didn't do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2153">No, but when they saw a man going in, out -- for instance with a rucksack every night, they reported it, and they had to report it. </sentence><sentence id="2154">If you were a member of the party you had to report it, and that could be disastrous for us. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Well, they didn't understand it, and you can explain it to them, but that's the way of a traitor. </sentence><sentence id="2156">Sometimes they are forced when they are in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="2157">That was the same in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2158">When you were in the party, you were forced to be -- more or less to be a -- an informer. </sentence><sentence id="2159">We had the same in Norway. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2182">A: All day. </sentence><sentence id="2183">And we -- a couple of times my second in command, we had a apartment which we used in the day, in the daytime, [indecipherable] so we could sit down, have coffee and sit and talk and do our passports. </sentence><sentence id="2184">We had a small -- we had a small office, which we had hired, so we have spent some time there. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And then when we had -- were -- had a sabotage job done, we also -- they used, very often -- the night, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2186">Sometimes it was daylight when we did our operations, but some -- usually nights. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And then the -- the place where I lived in for about a year, then the -- the lady there, she understood because whenever it was some noise in the town, I had been away. </sentence><sentence id="2188">So she said to me after the war that she thought that I maybe have carried -- carried the -- the -- the case for -- or the rucksack for the saboteur. </sentence><sentence id="2189">She thought I had been a helper. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2198">Q: Helper. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2200">A: But she never believed that I was the man, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2201">So it -- if -- she did never think that I was able to do any sabotage operations. </sentence><sentence id="2202">So I was an ordinary man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2206">Q: Tell me about your conversations when you would sit with your -- with your colleagues. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2208">Were they practical conversations, were they political conversations, a combination? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2209">A: Well, it was very often not so -- I would say funny things, we were joking very often. </sentence><sentence id="2210">We had the -- the humor, very good. </sentence><sentence id="2211">And all kinds of jokes were very popular and for instance, when I should meet with the whole group of let's say six, seven, altogether, then we usually met at one of the big graveyards in Oslo. </sentence><sentence id="2212">There was no money -- n-no people there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2213">And that could be a very good way. </sentence><sentence id="2214">It's -- for instance, we never met in restaurants. </sentence><sentence id="2215">We didn't never meet in cafes. </sentence><sentence id="2216">It was too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="2217">We met in the open, and I can't recall that the whole group ever met in one apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2218">Would be disastrous. </sentence><sentence id="2219">So sometimes then, communication between us could be difficult, because of that. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And that could -- could easily be some misunderstandings. </sentence><sentence id="2221">So when we had one operation, we -- the first time the man that should help us, he had -- he had overslept. </sentence><sentence id="2222">So he didn't show up, and we couldn't go because he had the fuse. </sentence><sentence id="2223">Next time, he forgot the fuse, so we -- I was very angry with him, I've never been so angry in my life, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2224">So, things like that could happen [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2225">But was -- then made it more -- more simple, more so the nerves could help out with -- they would have -- some had difficulties with their nerves, of course, but I had the -- we had about 15 operations in "44, and then one of the fellows, he said, well, he s -- what will happen here? </sentence><sentence id="2226">Can we come into trouble and get shot, or something. </sentence><sentence id="2227">Then one other fellow said, no, 24 is with us. </sentence><sentence id="2228">I had had so much luck, every time, and th-they were all -- we had no -- no -- then, 15 successful operations. </sentence><sentence id="2229">So in a way, it was dangerous to think that way, but I had the luck. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2252">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="2253">So how would you communicate when you were going to do an operation, or you had a task that someone should do -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2254">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2255">Q: -- how would you get the word out so that people would know to meet you in [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2256">A: Oh, that's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2257">Telephones. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2258">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2260">A: Telephones were not tapped in Oslo. </sentence><sentence id="2261">I think the reason why they couldn't tap all telephones, they had the -- the -- Germans had the technicians, they had it, but they were dependent on Norwegian, on Norwegian technicians, all over you know. </sentence><sentence id="2262">They call all -- these telephone boxes were different places. </sentence><sentence id="2263">I don't think they found any technician that was a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="2264">So they didn't think of it, and they had thought they should do it, but they never did. </sentence><sentence id="2265">So you could use the telephone, but of course you wouldn't say, now we are going to have sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="2266">You didn't say that, but you say, we have to fetch the milk, or we meet in a shop because I got any more bread, or maybe a little goat cheese. </sentence><sentence id="2267">That's Norwegian usually. </sentence><sentence id="2268">So, telephone was very much used. </sentence><sentence id="2269">Then, that day, they were [indecipherable] then we met, and I had all the information, all the intelligence, because I had been round there. </sentence><sentence id="2270">I -- I could be always in the open, I was there [indecipherable] it. </sentence><sentence id="2271">So what important in any military operation is intelligence before, and -- and intelligence very often can be wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2272">But I could go there and see with my own eyes that it -- it was like that. </sentence><sentence id="2273">So that was a ve-very important thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2288">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2290">A: But made out on the telephone, very often. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2292">Q: Let me go back to January 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2293">The -- apparently the -- the Gestapo was hunting for you, and you -- there was an incident when you came back to the apartment in which you were staying. </sentence><sentence id="2294">Could you describe that incident? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2358">A: Well, I had to know, are they sitting everywhere? </sentence><sentence id="2359">What about the rest of them? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3049">Q: Mr. Sonsteby, before we go on and talk about some other sabotage operations, let's get a picture of how many Germans there are to every Norwegian in -- in the country at this time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3051">A: We were, at that time, three million people. </sentence><sentence id="3052">And we had in from 42 - deg43, we had about 250,000, later on more than 300,000 troops. </sentence><sentence id="3053">It was 10 percent of all the population. </sentence><sentence id="3054">And if you take the age of -- the military age, which was an important 17 - 18 to 32 - 34, then it was -- in southern Norway it was about three Germans to a Norwegian. </sentence><sentence id="3055">And in north Norway, very little -- it was not so many people, we had -- it could be about 10 Germans to a Norwegian in that age group. </sentence><sentence id="3056">So [indecipherable] swarmed in [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3057">Q: So when you were walking around in Oslo during your daily meetings -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3058">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3060">Q: -- did you always see a lot of troops? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3062">A: Oh yes, all the time. </sentence><sentence id="3063">But I didn't care, I thought that they didn't touch me, and I didn't touch them. </sentence><sentence id="3064">So, just like that, especially you were always -- all the controls, you know, and when you consider Norwegians, they were being traitors, they had the -- some of them had the control. </sentence><sentence id="3065">They were one man with a machine pistol, and it was five others, youngsters, Nazi boys with rifles. </sentence><sentence id="3066">And then you were stopped, they looked in your pockets and in your -- your vest -- what do you call these small things you have? </sentence><sentence id="3067">Suitcases, and briefcases and looked through them, opened. </sentence><sentence id="3068">And if you saw them, and you tried to get away, and you didn't stop, you would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="3069">They shot immediately these youngsters, young Norwegians. </sentence><sentence id="3070">That was very bad to see, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3071">And they were Nazis and they didn't understand what they did. </sentence><sentence id="3072">So it could even be on the [indecipherable] gosh that man -- if you then just moved another, they would stop you. </sentence><sentence id="3073">And if you didn't stop immediately, got shot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3086">Q: A -- A few weeks after you bombed the Labor Office, you were supposed to blow up an insurance company building, why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3088">A: Well, they used some kind of a -- in order to call in people, they had to use what you call -- I won't -- I don't know what you call it in English, but all the insurance companies had -- is a kind of starting up of data system. </sentence><sentence id="3089">They could sort out things on new machines from the States. </sentence><sentence id="3090">And it was, of course, the company that had this, that was IBM. </sentence><sentence id="3091">At that time in Norway, it had another name, the company, and they had these machines. </sentence><sentence id="3092">And these machines were now put in to sort out people to find the addresses. </sentence><sentence id="3093">They were sorted like anything is. </sentence><sentence id="3094">It was a first kind of data -- data machine, I think, data. </sentence><sentence id="3095">And then the Germans and the Norwegian -- the Nazi government, they wanted to use this. </sentence><sentence id="3096">I got the order to take it, to destroy it before they could start. </sentence><sentence id="3097">So the first -- the machines, they were -- they were in a nice shop in Oslo, and one morning we heard that it - - they will be taken over by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="3098">So the day before, we came there, and we had a big stone through the window, and had three small charges of -- of explosives, and there were no more after a minute. </sentence><sentence id="3099">Then we disappeared completely. </sentence><sentence id="3100">The next day they -- we had forgotten a big machine up in the insurance company. </sentence><sentence id="3101">And then we had got the new order to go up there and take that. </sentence><sentence id="3102">And then they had put four guards around the machine with a police dog. </sentence><sentence id="3103">Now they were sure it will not be taken, and the Gestapo and the -- they were hundred percent sure nobody could come there. </sentence><sentence id="3104">So it was impossible, but we found a new way. </sentence><sentence id="3105">If it had been now we would have maybe used a helicopter, but you didn't have helicopter at that time, so we had to crawl over three, four roofs, until we reached that building and got down there, and the -- there we knew it was -- the machine was under the -- the dining room, or the room where the fella -- the employees had their meal. </sentence><sentence id="3106">And during the night we came, we reached it, and put the explosive, that would 10 -- it was a delayed bomb, 10 minutes, and then we went back, we -- if you then went into the streets about 10:30, you would be taken, it was German guard all over town during the night. </sentence><sentence id="3107">Also because of these sabotage operations. </sentence><sentence id="3108">If we came into the street, we would be arrested immediately, our age. </sentence><sentence id="3109">So we wen-went into the next building and had a fine view to where the explosion will go off and 10 minutes afterwards, again we -- we didn't want to take lives, so we called them again on the telephone, we said, two minutes, you'd better get out. </sentence><sentence id="3110">And they knew from experience now, so they all got out, even with the dog, and then it was blown up, the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="3111">And next morning they couldn't find anybody, no track whatsoever, which was a very important thing. </sentence><sentence id="3112">We didn't lose people, I didn't lose any of my men, and it was a -- should called a success. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3139">Q: You must have driven them crazy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3141">A: I think it was not so easy to bear. </sentence><sentence id="3142">Not to find a track, it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="3143">And of course it meant that the people also, they didn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="3144">They knew they had -- shouldn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="3145">Of course it was wonderful for them to hear about it, and when I came the next day, I went down in the district and talked to people and they said, oh, terrible people that's done this. </sentence><sentence id="3146">So -- but it was very popular, of course, within the population because they knew it was a fight towards the Gestapo first of all, and to stop this conscription of our young persons. </sentence><sentence id="3147">So in -- in the course of deg44 summer, autumn, it was all stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3148">They gave up. </sentence><sentence id="3149">And another thing, politically, Germans sometimes found that these Norwegian Nazis weren't always so good. </sentence><sentence id="3150">So they were -- they were now annoyed that they didn't make it and put [indecipherable] Gestapo in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="3151">So they were - - it could be a little -- for us it was very important that it was a g -- not good relations between the Germans and the Nazi Norwegians. </sentence><sentence id="3152">That could also be a point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3165">Q: Now, I guess it was about a month later, in the Lysaker factory, there -- you -- you blew up, was June 28", 1944, there was another bombing that you did. </sentence><sentence id="3166">Was it following that that the Nazis retaliated in terms of the ration cards? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3257">Q: And then once they agreed, you gave back the cards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3259">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3260">Of course, this was done by another group, but I worked closely with them. </sentence><sentence id="3261">I didn't do that part of it, but my part was to get hold of the cards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3265">Q: But that giving back process could also be dangerous because they could then catch the group </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3266">A: Oh yes, that -- you are quite right, but the way we did it, well we just gave them first 20,000 cards and then they -- we said, you can pick them up outside the bank, for instance. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3267">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3269">A: And then part of it we put in small parcels, and on top of them we wrote, dangerous explosives. </sentence><sentence id="3270">And it was put round in Oslo and it was a hell of a trouble for the police, the Nazi police, and they didn't dare to touch them. </sentence><sentence id="3271">So they sent for a company outside, an -- German specialists to -- on the -- to take over, and then they opened it very carefully, and it was ration -- ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="3272">So we had a little fun also. </sentence><sentence id="3273">But of course we were -- man -- many people into this, and -- but it was all coordinated very well from the top. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3279">Q: Now, ins -- in August of 1944, there was a bombing at Korzewall, with the airplane parts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3281">A: Yes, that was an important place, it was very hard to find because the German camouflaged it with a very big [indecipherable] very big, you know, the biggest in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="3282">And half of it was put into stock of all kinds of spec-special re-repair parts for -- for fighter planes, Messerschmitt. </sentence><sentence id="3283">And they had also a-about -- about 20 fuselage that was there, to put -- put up to the airport later on, and we got to know it, and it was very hard to know where it was and what they did, but we had to get intelligence, and one of my friends, he got to know all of it. </sentence><sentence id="3284">So then we went in there, and the part -- the Norwegian part was no guarded, strangely enough. </sentence><sentence id="3285">Was one guard, which I by the way took -- had -- took hold of when we came there in the night and pacified him. </sentence><sentence id="3286">And then we went in there and then went into the German part in the basement, through three fences, and put down about 300 pounds of dynamite. </sentence><sentence id="3287">We blew up the whole place. </sentence><sentence id="3288">And I think it wasn't very nice for them to use their spare parts in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="3289">And the same had to be done with ball bearing. </sentence><sentence id="3290">Ball bearing was terribly important for any nation. </sentence><sentence id="3291">And Swedish -- Sweden had the best ball bearings in the world, you know, they had also a small place in Oslo, which was also blown up. </sentence><sentence id="3292">Another thing what -- how -- how would we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk about submarines. </sentence><sentence id="3293">Submarines use batteries. </sentence><sentence id="3294">Submarines batteries, that means sulfur, the acid. </sentence><sentence id="3295">And we had two of them in Norway, so the way we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the submarines was to ruin these two acid factories, and they were stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3296">So they couldn't produce any more, they were ruined for the rest of the war, and then it was not -- very few batteries coming from Norway to -- norw -- to submarines, because at the coastline in Norway, during the war you could hide every nation's fleet, submarines and everything, in Norwegian fjords. </sentence><sentence id="3297">You could have the whole -- the world could be placed into Norwegian fjords. </sentence><sentence id="3298">And they did, of course, all those submarines, they disappeared in Norwegian fjords. </sentence><sentence id="3299">So they were -- it was very important to hit them in a way of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries. </sentence><sentence id="3300">Then you had to have experts to help you [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3301">But when we talked about Haugland, he was also wireless operator on the heavy water operation, and on my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="3302">And so he had a [indecipherable] experience. </sentence><sentence id="3303">Two s-s-small town -- two small town boys were also there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3328">Q: You said you pacified the guard. </sentence><sentence id="3329">Is that another word for killing him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3332">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3334">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3336">A: Just to hold him up, and just keep watching him, or one man had to watch him all the time. </sentence><sentence id="3337">But the trouble with that, of course, if he doesn't start screaming. </sentence><sentence id="3338">And people maybe done that, without helping it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3342">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3344">A: So that could be a -- then, when you hear about guards being -- you can shoot him, because of the noise. </sentence><sentence id="3345">So when you hear about that, it's a -- a necessity, because they can give a noise, scream or something like that, but he -- luckily he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3346">So he was a -- sent out -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3347">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3348">A: Afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="3349">So we tried to be very careful with the civilian at all. </sentence><sentence id="3350">It was not our -- we were no terrorists. </sentence><sentence id="3351">The Germans called us, of course, terrorists, but I -- I -- I don't know any type or [indecipherable] which was terrorism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3356">Q: And in that operation at the air -- at Korzewall, there were cleaning women who used [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3357">A: Yes, that was another difficult thing, of course, when you come into a place like that, if you had -- if you had the cleaning womens and I had pacify them in a way that -- I said that we were now -- you know, on all buses, you have different advertising, and I said I was a painter, so I should paint some of the buses with the -- and they believed me. </sentence><sentence id="3358">I -- I looked very innocent, and they said, he's a nice painter. </sentence><sentence id="3359">So then I -- then I -- when I saw all the explosives being carried in, I said, this is meat. </sentence><sentence id="3360">So this is -- go to your -- your people in the -- with all the buses [indecipherable] it will be fine. </sentence><sentence id="3361">So they believed me, but when they talked, and -- but then I had to tell them, I'm very sorry, but it -- now it will be blown up, you come with us. </sentence><sentence id="3362">So -- but they could stop the whole operation, you know, if they had started. </sentence><sentence id="3363">So that was not a way to be innocent, try to make people believe. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3371">Q: And what was their response when you said to them, essentially, I was lying to you, it's now going to be blown up, get out. </sentence><sentence id="3372">Were they angry at you, were they frightened of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3375">A: Oh no, they were frightened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3377">Q: They were frightened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3379">A: Like hell, of course, which is understandable, under -- but they got out. </sentence><sentence id="3380">They couldn't -- nobody hurt them afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3383">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3385">A: They couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3386">But people, when they see and hear about explosions, you know, fuses burning, it's very understandable that they are frightened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3389">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3391">A: It's -- it's a good thing, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3393">Q: Were you with Haugland at the heavy water operation, or no -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3394">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3395">Q: -- was he alone? </sentence><sentence id="3396">I mean, was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3397">A: I was then in Oslo, and they were trained in -- specially on that target in England, by some Norwegian professors that had really installed the heavy water plant at Rjukan. </sentence><sentence id="3398">It's part of the electr -- electrolyses. </sentence><sentence id="3399">That's part of it, you get the heavy water from the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3400">Q: And was he hurt at that operation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3402">A: No, no, he just -- he -- he was -- the operat -- operator [indecipherable] to keep the [indecipherable] London advised all the time, do they go in now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3404">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3406">A: And then he had to keep away so he could, if they had been lost, he had the report, so he was keeping in touch with the -- England all the time, during operation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3408">Q: I wanted to ask you about one more sabotage before we went back to England, which -- your group became known as the Oslo gang -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3409">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3410">Q: -- right a-around this time, in 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3424">Q: But you -- there was a decision made to destroy thousands of gallons of oil. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3426">A: Yeah, that was, of course, also necessary because -- especially the special oils for -- could be lubricating oils, which was very important, very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="3427">You know, the Germans, they really, in the last part, they had no lubricating oil, they had no gasoline, it was just -- some part of their Panzer, you know, couldn't work because they hadn't any more -- so that, it was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="3428">So to ruin any gasoline tanks, or lubricating, was very important, that was part of how you could hit the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3429">But as I said before, the real effort in Norway's war was the sailors and the -- or that was the real thing, but so -- but everything you could do against the occupying powers in Norway would, of course help -- help out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3434">Q: So you destroyed about 50,000 gallons of oil in that operation, am I right? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3446">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3448">A: That was done by several groups. </sentence><sentence id="3449">So I -- I don't know how much it would be, enormous. </sentence><sentence id="3450">It was ruined, especially all the stocks in Norway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3454">Q: Now why did you leave Oslo in November of 1944? </sentence><sentence id="3455">You went back to be more highly trained than you were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3458">A: Ah -- yeah, I wanted to report now in England, in London. </sentence><sentence id="3459">So I -- then I went over with an -- third name. </sentence><sentence id="3460">My name was this time Harald Sorensen. </sentence><sentence id="3461">When I came to England I had good papers, when I came to the security police -- in England you can think in a wartime, security police, and I got in now a-at the thi -- in the third, after third name, Harald Sorensen, electrical engineer. </sentence><sentence id="3462">So then it was a very few people that, of course -- in there, so we [indecipherable] that I was let in. </sentence><sentence id="3463">Could be a dangerous [indecipherable], I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4122">Q: Okay, go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4124">A: Yeah, this is a passport which we used when you are nearing the border. </sentence><sentence id="4125">When we were about 25 from the border, 25 miles, then you would have a special passport. </sentence><sentence id="4126">Every citizen there would    have this kind, so you can -- you are allowed to be in that district so near the border. </sentence><sentence id="4127">And it was necessary to have this. </sentence><sentence id="4128">If you haven't got them, you would be arrested when you -- it was a restricted area alongside a border. </sentence><sentence id="4129">And that's a picture that I usually -- when you take a picture in that box in the station all that, they're all different. </sentence><sentence id="4130">Look like criminal anyway, don't you, when you have these pictures taken. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4139">Q: It's a nice picture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4141">A: And it's in German and Norwegian. </sentence><sentence id="4142">So you can see the German, now you would read the German, so the -- the German guard would see immediately that you were supposed to be there. </sentence><sentence id="4143">And you -- you would be arrested co -- if you hadn't a good reason to be visiting there, and even if you should go 30 miles in Norway, you had to have a permission. </sentence><sentence id="4144">The written permission. </sentence><sentence id="4145">And here is that passport of Thor Hansen. </sentence><sentence id="4146">Then -- this I very seldom used, because you see in the signature th-that is from the general -- Nazi general Martinsen who was the most -- that's my handwriting, but on the we -- left side, you see it's signed by Martinsen, he was one of the worst men we had in Norway. </sentence><sentence id="4147">He was a leader of the -- all these state police, all the federal Nazi police, and I used to -- I know his handwriting so well now, so I can -- if you want me to sign it, I may be able to sign it even today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4155">Q: So when would you use that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4157">A: I would use it in -- for instance when I had to go to a special district in Norway with a -- to try -- if it was a real hurry, to get to tol -- tell people, give them some idea, then I could use this. </sentence><sentence id="4158">And in the car, I had a car, it was the same state police car, federal -- could be a Chevrolet, could be a Chrysler that I -- that I had, and that -- I had a driver's license with the same name, Thor Hansen, and that -- on the -- I -- plate there, it said -- the state police, federal police. </sentence><sentence id="4159">So it could be three, four documents which you had to have in order to go through that control, Gestapo control. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4169">A: We're all civilians. </sentence><sentence id="4170">All Gestapo, they were ordinary civilians. </sentence><sentence id="4171">Very seldom they show that they were all S -- SS, they had high ranks, but they were -- to do that job, they had to be all, as in Germany, they were all civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="4172">So I had -- I didn't need the -- and that's an ordinary passport, which every Norwegian had to have, with the number and everything. </sentence><sentence id="4173">Luckily, if you see the number on top there, if they had stopped me, and had the lightest suspicion that I was lying, then they would call that number, that was that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
