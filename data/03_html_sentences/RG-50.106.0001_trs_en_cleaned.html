<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2195">A: And disbelief that they were there so long they weren't going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="2196">And, from what I heard is that the American Red Cross got word that this was going to be the end of the camp and they were going to destroy this whole camp with everybody in it. </sentence><sentence id="2197">They didn't want -- they knew, I guess, that it was all coming to an end in "45. </sentence><sentence id="2198">And they didn't want any visible signs of this camp. </sentence><sentence id="2199">Theresienstadt was a fortress at one time. </sentence><sentence id="2200">Just outside of Prague, a small town in the countryside of Prague, and was used as an army fortress. </sentence><sentence id="2201">And they were just going to get rid of it all totally so there was no signs of it. </sentence><sentence id="2202">So when this war is over and whoever -- Americans -- whoever came over, there would be nothing left to say, "Yes, there was something there at one time." </sentence><sentence id="2203">And they had to do this kind of quickly where it was this was going to be over pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And so, they had to act very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2205">And somehow the Red Cross got wind of this, and the Russians came in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
