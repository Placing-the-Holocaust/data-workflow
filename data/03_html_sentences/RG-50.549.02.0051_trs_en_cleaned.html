Mr. Lessing, we're just going to go on and recap some of your experiences during the war, and if you want to just start talking about -- I di -- basically from the beginning of the German occ -- occupation in the Netherlands, when you went into hiding, and the [indecipherable] a short description of that time, and then we'll go into the post-war experiences. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: The -- Well, as you probably know, Holland was invaded in May 1940, when I lived with my father and my mother and my two brothers, who are eight and 10 years younger than I -- than -- than I am, in a little town called Delft, in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="8">And my father was all his life a musician, and had recently opened a little clothing store, to see if he could get away from the -- th -- wi -- away from the music. </sentence><sentence id="9">On the 10" of May, two days after my 14" birthday, the Germans suddenly -- I looked out the -- out the window, and there was all German planes and paratroopers in the sky. </sentence><sentence id="10">And five days later, we were, of course -- the Dutch government ran away, the queen ran away to London, and we were an occupied country. </sentence><sentence id="11">And it didn't worry us too much, because the -- the war was going to  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 3 be over anyway very soon, we all knew that, and the Germans would never do in Holland what they had done in Germany, to the German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="12">But, pretty soon, of course, we began to find anti-Semitic ordinances in the -- in -- in the -- in the paper, and things progressed rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="13">Two years later, 1942, after I couldn't go to school any more, and we were all wearing yellow stars on our clothing, two years later, in October 23", 1942, we went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="14">We were actually all set to go on the trains to what the Germans euphemistically called work relief, in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="15">We were all set, we had our backpacks ready, but my grandfather, who happened to come over fo-for a visit from Amsterdam, warned us that -- warned my parents that we -- we might not at all be going to work in Germany, that the Germans were lying, that there were rumors going around, and although no one knew where -- where we were yes going, he said don't ever go. </sentence><sentence id="16">It seems to have made a deep impression upon my parents, because at some point, they decided we're not going to go on those trains, like most of the Jew -- Dutch Jews, and we were going to go into hiding, although we had no places prepared. </sentence><sentence id="17">So, as I said, on the 23" of October, 1942, we walked -- in the morning we walked out of our home, and never to return to that same house again. </sentence><sentence id="18">And that night my family spread around. </sentence><sentence id="19">My na -- They - - My -- My parents went one way, and my brothers went another way, I didn't know where they went. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I was left, for awhile, in that -- with our friends where we had walked to, in the suburbs of Delft. </sentence><sentence id="21">I stayed there for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="22">And from there I went to -- first address in Utrecht, two old ladies who took me in, but very soon got scared, and  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 4 Thad to go. </sentence><sentence id="23">My mother, who is -- really became the -- the hero of this -- of our hiding story -- of our wartime story in general, was the only one who traveled on trains, and she went around finding places for all of us. </sentence><sentence id="24">She fou -- She decided that -- She suggested that I would bleach my hair and pretend to be a Christian boy, and work as a stable boy, s -- go find work on a sta -- as a stable boy on a Dutch farm. </sentence><sentence id="25">She then found a little farm somewhere, little farmer who had five cows, dairy farm, and that's where I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="26">That was my first farm, and it was absolute hell. </sentence><sentence id="27">I was this Jewish city kid, and I was supposed to go out at five o'clock in the morning, in the pouring rain, and -- and milk cows, and so, and I did. </sentence><sentence id="28">I -- I learned all that. </sentence><sentence id="29">I walked with bleeding feet i-in -- in wooden shoes, and -- very -- well, I don't know how long I was there. </sentence><sentence id="30">My guess is -- My guess is maybe -- oh, maybe -- maybe a half a year, I -- I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="31">The chronology is sometimes a little difficult to follow, but anyway, I -- I decided to give myself up to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="32">I couldn't stand the -- the fear of being maybe discovered, and the loneliness. </sentence><sentence id="33">I was all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="34">I was 16 years old, and I decided that I couldn't stay in there, I would give myself up. </sentence><sentence id="35">I figured, sooner or later, the Germans are going to find me anyway, and -- but my mother again, it's always my mother in this story, who came to visit me sometimes, secretly, we would meet somewhere in the fields, talked me out of it, and said she would try and find another place for me. </sentence><sentence id="36">And she found, through a whole long story that I can't go into now, but she found a police officer called Oskam, was his last name, O-s-k-a-m, who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer, came from  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 5 a completely Nazi family, and -- but -- but -- in -- in reality was a member of the underground, and was hiding about 30 Jewish men, women and children, in the little village not too far from Utrecht. </sentence><sentence id="37">And my mother had asked him if he would know a place for me, and I talked with him, and he said, "I have a place for you, but it's very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="38">You will not be able to leave there, and you will not be able to see any members of your family. </sentence><sentence id="39">Do you still want to go there?" </sentence><sentence id="40">And I said, well -- I figured everything was better -- anything was better than being isolated by myself on a farm. </sentence><sentence id="41">And he -- when I said yes, I would like to go there, he took me to a -- a hut in the middle of the woods, where he left me with seven Dutch Resistance men, mostly -- they were mostly of the -- what shall I say? </sentence><sentence id="42">The m -- More intellectual class o-of Dutch people. </sentence><sentence id="43">They didn't look like what you would think of partisans, or anything, didn't wear machine guns, or an-anything like that, but they had built this hut. </sentence><sentence id="44">And I stayed there from -- my guess is August 1943, until -- the exact date is 29" of December, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="45">I was the only Jew, I was the youngest, I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then, and let's see, the men would go out at night and raid police stations, and -- and ci-city halls, and -- and break in and get identity claus -- get identity cards, and -- and official German stamps, and -- and weapons. </sentence><sentence id="46">And so we were sort of a center, people would stop in, a-and take away weapons, and -- and -- and papers, and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="47">I should go just -- because it will relate to later on in this story, I should mention that one day two men were brought in, one who claimed to be a Canadian, and one who claimed to be an  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 6 Englishman, and claimed to have been on a raid in -- in the -- in the Royal Air Force, on a ra -- in on a raid to Germany, and were -- their bomber was shot down, and they bailed out, and they wound up in the -- and the Resistance got them before the Germans got them, and they brought them into our hut. </sentence><sentence id="48">So here were these two men, and I was assigned to interview them, because I spoke English well. </sentence><sentence id="49">I don't quite know why, but I think I have a hint of why. </sentence><sentence id="50">My parents had lived in the United States for three years, in 1929 to 1932. </sentence><sentence id="51">So I interviewed these men, and found out that they were not German spies, but they were a bona fide RAF people. </sentence><sentence id="52">They w -- They -- They spent awhile with us in the hut, but eventually they were smuggled out by the Resistance, through Belgium, through France, and Spain, and I guess Portugal, and -- and smuggled back to England. </sentence><sentence id="53">I don't know if they ever flew again, I will find that out in -- in August. </sentence><sentence id="54">There's a -- There's a story connected with that. </sentence><sentence id="55">On the tr -- In December, towards the end of the -- 1943, we got a message, somehow another, an intercepted message that the Germans had become suspicious of the -- of the area, the woods where we were. </sentence><sentence id="56">We were -- We were in the -- in the middle of a small parcel of woods. </sentence><sentence id="57">In Holland, you don't really have forests. </sentence><sentence id="58">These were planted parcels of woods, rectangles, one after another, about four or five, and they had the very dense undergrowth of evergreens. </sentence><sentence id="59">You couldn't walk through them, you would have to smash your way through -- through the undergrowth, however, we had a secret path to the hut. </sentence><sentence id="60">As I said, in December, the men in the hut got the message that the Germans had become suspicious, and we were -- they then decided we  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 7 should set out guards, and so a companion and I drew the lot for the 29" of December, I think four to eight A.M. watch, standing right inside the periphery of the -- in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="61">Now, on the -- on the -- on the woods, in -- within the first line of trees, and that's where we saw the Germans coming, in the half dark, and it was, of course, traumatic, because I realized they had come to kill me. </sentence><sentence id="62">I was very tempted to run away, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="63">The both of us ran back into the hut, warned the men. </sentence><sentence id="64">There was a total confusion there, cause they were sleeping in the bunkbeds, and we pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, "It's a raid, get up." </sentence><sentence id="65">And when -- when we saw that they were all out of the bunkbeds, we ran, and we ran to the edge of our parcel of wood -- of woods, and as I always say when I -- when -- when -- when I looked to the left and to the right, it seemed to me the Germans were coming around the corners of the woods, and I feared that nobody that we had left behind, would survive. </sentence><sentence id="66">We then jumped across the dirt road, into the next parcel of woods, and crashed through, and we ran and ran and ran and ran, until we wound up ina city called Hilversum, which you probably have heard about, it's the center of Dutch radio -- radio transmitter. </sentence><sentence id="67">And I can't go into the details now, but somehow another, we wound up at night in the woods again, about five miles away from where the hut was, because that was the spot where we were supposed to reassemble in case of a raid. </sentence><sentence id="68">It had been previously agreed upon. </sentence><sentence id="69">And my buddy and I, my -- my partner and I waited there in the dark. </sentence><sentence id="70">We had guns, we had nine millimeter Mauser, and we had them at the ready, because we didn't know if the men would have been tortured to reveal the place that the  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 8 Germans would -- might come and -- and ser -- I had pretty well decided then that -- that if they would come, that I would defend myself, I would -- I would try to kill, and be killed, probably, in a short gunfight. </sentence><sentence id="71">So, I was all prepared to die. </sentence><sentence id="72">It was very quiet, and then after awhile I did hear some noise coming through the woods, sounded like old metal rattling away, and thumping over -- wh-wheels on the dirt, and this bicycle rattled in the little clearing, and with a little flashlight somebody was shining ahead of it. </sentence><sentence id="73">And we didn't know who it was, we were ready to -- to -- to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="74">But nothing followed, and then we approached with drawn guns, and found out that it was not the Germans, and it was neither one of the men, it was my mother, who had heard about the raid, and had decided immediately to rescue us. </sentence><sentence id="75">Well, I think most of that escape, and so on, and my mother's part in that is probably in the -- in the video interview. </sentence><sentence id="76">We escaped. </sentence><sentence id="77">My buddy - - My mother gave the old bicycle to my -- my friend, my -- my partner, and she gave him also the little flashlight, and he peddled away into the darkness, he said he knew a place where to hide. </sentence><sentence id="78">And my mother and I pretended to be lovers, and as we approached the German guard, we talked very loud, and we giggled, and we -- you know, with -- with terror in our hearts, but we put our arms around each other, and we made kissing sounds, and the -- and the German guard whom we approached seemed to want to stop us for a second, but he didn't, and we walked by him, and as I always say, to live another day in [indecipherable] of that circle of death. </sentence><sentence id="79">After that I was close to a nervous breakdown, I needed help. </sentence><sentence id="80">Two -- Two older people, two Dutch people who lived in a very nice  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 9 mansion, put me up in a room, very peaceful room overlooking a gorgeous garden, and there I's -- recuperated slowly, I stopped shaking, and I became very religious, I found a Bible, and for the first time read something about the Jewish history, and became devoted to it, and for the rest of the war, tried to be a religious Jew. </sentence><sentence id="81">When I felt strong enough again, I left that place, and I got myself a new pair of wooden shoes, and I went out and found a new farm, now in a better part of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="82">And in the more eastern part, where the farms are bigger, and the people are [indecipherable] and I started to work this time as areal farmhand. </sentence><sentence id="83">By then I seemed to have had enough experience to work with horses, and plow, and -- and of course I had bleached my hair again, and matter of fact, I had the chutzpah to go and register myself with my false identity card in -- in the town hall, to allay suspicion. </sentence><sentence id="84">It worked pretty well, I -- I wasn't -- I worked on a couple of farms. </sentence><sentence id="85">The farmers were happy with me. </sentence><sentence id="86">Of course, every second was always a challenge if anyone approached the farm. </sentence><sentence id="87">It was like, this is maybe it. </sentence><sentence id="88">In May, 1944, my mother, coming back on the train from visiting my brother Fred, my youngest brother who was sick, was -- she had managed to put in a hospital in the south of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="89">On the way back, she ran into a expert on the train, German -- a Gestapo expert on the train, zeesha hites a deest expert, probably, and he immediately recognized that she had a falsified identity card, and he arrested her. </sentence><sentence id="90">And she -- And he put her into a -- into a separate compartment in the train, where she was guarded by a Dutch policeman on the way to Amsterdam, and that she later tells him -- I'm not quite sure any more at this point, by the way, let me interrupt  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 10 myself here for a second. </sentence><sentence id="91">I'm not quite sure how much of this is in the videotape. </sentence><sentence id="92">I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="93">I'm quoting here things that my mother and my father said in interviews conducted -- audio interviews conducted by my brother Fred. </sentence><sentence id="94">My brother Fred conducted audio interviews with the whole family, my father, my mother, myself, my brother Ott, my cousins, my wife. </sentence><sentence id="95">I have a tray with audio interviews, with the voices of my parents and everyone, and he later also transcribed it in book form, together with his son. </sentence><sentence id="96">Now, all that, I think happened after the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. </sentence><sentence id="97">So, I don't know, you can ask me later on it -- if it's not clear, I can go back to it. </sentence><sentence id="98">As my mother said -- now I go back to what my mother as -- she was arrested, as my mother later on told in interview with my brother Fred, she ate all the paperwork that was in her -- in her handbag, so the -- so that there was -- sh -- and she swallowed it. </sentence><sentence id="99">So by the time that she got to the interrogation in Amsterdam, when they ask her what her real name was, she lied, and she said that her name was Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, which was her maiden name. </sentence><sentence id="100">She never mentioned her -- her married name. </sentence><sentence id="101">And since she didn't have any other papers, except her false identity card, they wrote it down, and as she said, a-as a -- out of the blue sky she added, "And you have no right to keep me here, because I'm an American citizen." </sentence><sentence id="102">I don't know if that's in the -- in the video interview, either. </sentence><sentence id="103">In any case, she was sent to -- to Westerbork, Dutch camp, and from there she was sent to Bergen-Belsen, which we didn't know, of course. </sentence><sentence id="104">When I somehow heard that my mother had been arrested, I found my father and my two little brothers in a little cottage together,  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 11 in the -- not too far from Amhem, in Holland, where -- that little cottage my mother had rented just before she was arrested, in order to be a -- a -- just a week together with her husband and her two little sons. </sentence><sentence id="105">And of course, for her this didn't work out, but my father had gone there, and my two little brothers were there, and I found them there, and I decided that rather than work on the farm, my father would need help to survive in hiding with my two little brothers. </sentence><sentence id="106">So I quit the farm, and bicycled over to this little cottage, and that's where we spent the last winter of the war. </sentence><sentence id="107">Together with my two brothers and my father, we begged, borrowed and stole whatever we could to survive, and thus we reached the spring of 1945, when we were liberated by the Canadian army, and where -- I really should say this part of your interview ends, because it was the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="108">Many surprising things happened after that. </sentence><sentence id="109">If you want me to just go on with this now, or do you want to take a break? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Well I -- I am curious through the war -- you talked -- you had your family scattered in many different places, and your mom would -- would travel [indecipherable] and I'm sure it's -- what [indecipherable] look like. </sentence><sentence id="216">How much do you know what the other members of your family were doing, where they were, did you [indecipherable] see them from time to time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: It's very interesting question, and -- and as I go out speaking a lot to schools and so on, that question always comes up, people ask, "How did you know where your father was?" </sentence><sentence id="220">An-And I usually don't have an answer for this. </sentence><sentence id="221">I can tell you this, I did not know  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 12 in the very beginning where my father and mother were, until the raid on the hut, when I spent one night after the raid, after my mother and I escaped out of that -- out of the woods there, I spent one night at their hi -- their hiding place, which was in Soest, in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="222">So then I knew where they were. </sentence><sentence id="223">My brothers, I never knew. </sentence><sentence id="224">But there was a little time, which I don't remember too clearly, when my brother Ott, my middle brother, s -- came to the farm where I worked, and this was my little brother who came from the city, and who needed to be fattened up a little bit, and -- of course, he was also in hiding, but -- and he spent some time with me on this farm, I don't know how long. </sentence><sentence id="225">From -- From his interview later on, I -- I deducted he was there at least three weeks, or maybe even a month. </sentence><sentence id="226">I thought it was only a week. </sentence><sentence id="227">So, that period, I knew where my brother Ott was, he was with me. </sentence><sentence id="228">But then he disappeared again, and of course, from the fall of 1944, until the liberation 1945, my father, my two brothers and I were all together. </sentence><sentence id="229">Some of the communication was achieved through my grandfather's second wife. </sentence><sentence id="230">My grandfather lived in Amsterdam, my grandmother had died years before, he marred a non-Jewish woman, and had a daughter by her. </sentence><sentence id="231">And I think that daughter, who was not Jewish, at least she was half Jewish, did not wear a star, and traveled, and I think she managed to send some messages around, and I think it must have been through her that I found where my father and my two little brothers were hiding in that little summer cottage. </sentence><sentence id="232">That's as best as I can tell you. </sentence><sentence id="233">Course we had no phones, we didn't write letters, was -- we couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="234">And -- So sometimes it -- I just -- it's all conjecture, you know?

</sentence><sentence id="1953">I might have been killed with them, but -- but then that didn't make any sense. </sentence><sentence id="1954">We did warn them, and you know, and we did our best, and so we couldn't help it, you know, this kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1955">And here this man tells me they all escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1956">So instead of being guilty of maybe not doing enough, it now comes out, I've actually saved their lives, or helped save their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1957">So, I  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 73 come out of that conference with this man -- this man, and my cousin is there, and she says, "So, how was it?" </sentence><sentence id="1958">I said, "You can't -- I can't believe this. </sentence><sentence id="1959">The men whom I thought were killed, all survived."

there's an upper bunk, somebody's si-sitting on there eating a sandwich, and there's a lower bunk, where somebody's eating an apple, or something like that, and I'm leaning against one of the posts of

"What was his name?" </sentence><sentence id="2136">He says, "His name was Jan Carman, Jan Carman." </sentence><sentence id="2137">So now I knew who had been my buddy. </sentence><sentence id="2138">I said, "Where is he, what happened to him?" </sentence><sentence id="2139">He said, "Ed, I don't think you're -- it can be, because Jan Carman was with me that morning. </sentence><sentence
