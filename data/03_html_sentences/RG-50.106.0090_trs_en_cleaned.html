<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: So what specifically did you experience in the liberation of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Well, like I say, it was a few hours or the next morning after the gates were crashed that our company was pulled in there. </sentence><sentence id="288">We were billeted in some apartment buildings outside of the camp where the Nazi officers had lived. </sentence><sentence id="289">And we were put on guard shifts -- I don't remember -- several hours at a time inside of the camp and around the camp was -- orders for no one to go in or out. </sentence><sentence id="290">There was a lot of typhus in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="291">There was all kinds of sickness. </sentence><sentence id="292">My understanding -- and my numbers may or may not be right. </sentence><sentence id="293">But my understanding was that at the time we got there there were about 17,000 prisoners in the camp and that they were dying at the rate of about 300 a day. </sentence><sentence id="294">They didn't -- obviously didn't want them out in the countryside. </sentence><sentence id="295">So while I was in there doing guard duty, we talked whenever possible. </sentence><sentence id="296">A lot of the prisoners in there would come up    Interview with Thomas Gardiner 10 to our guard post and want to talk. </sentence><sentence id="297">They were overjoyed. </sentence><sentence id="298">And they would tell their personal stories. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Well, some of them could speak English, but some of them were strictly speaking their German or Polish or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Did you understand any of the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="317">A: At that time, I could understand some German. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: How did you know German? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: One or two of the prisoners then insisted on taking myself and another buddy for a tour of the barracks where they were -- where they slept in these boxes that the pictures all show. </sentence><sentence id="333">I guess had we known then about all this typhus and everything, we probably wouldn't have gone. </sentence><sentence id="334">But anyway, they took us through there and they took us through the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="336">Your hands are making a noise. </sentence><sentence id="337">I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="339">I'm a little nervous, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="340">Took us through the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="341">Of course, there was a lot of the prisoners still in the boxes. </sentence><sentence id="342">Took us through the shower room where we saw these emaciated men being given showers and taking showers. </sentence><sentence id="343">We then went back to our guard posts. </sentence><sentence id="344">And this sort of thing was repeated for several days. </sentence><sentence id="345">And I think we were   Interview with Thomas Gardiner 11 there four days altogether. </sentence><sentence id="346">And we had some interesting and some sad stories. </sentence><sentence id="347">There was one man came up to me and was speaking English. </sentence><sentence id="348">And come to find out, he had been a musician with one of the Dorsey bands, and he had gone over to Germany to settle a family estate or something and he'd been captured. </sentence><sentence id="349">Now, whether he was Jewish or not, I'm not sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: He was American? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: He was an American, but a musician. </sentence><sentence id="366">But anyway, he -- of course he was wanting to tell us his story. </sentence><sentence id="367">And he was really overjoyed because he had family back here. </sentence><sentence id="368">But some of the sad stories. </sentence><sentence id="369">One young Polish boy tell me in -- I guess in broken German, English, whatever -- we understood it -- that saw his parents butchered in front of his eyes. </sentence><sentence id="370">And another one told us about seeing the Nazis take these infant babies and throw them up in the air and shoot at them. </sentence><sentence id="371">Things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="372">That's where it's hard to visualize, really, anything or anybody being that animalistic, really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: Let's go back to what you actually saw yourself. </sentence><sentence id="382">When you went into the camp the first day, did you go in with other men on a truck? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: Uh-hmm. </sentence><sentence id="386">Went in -- probably marched in. </sentence><sentence id="387">I'm not sure of that. </sentence><sentence id="388">And then what we saw, of course, was the bodies laying out by the fence such as in that picture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: Now, could you describe the picture? </sentence><sentence id="394">Because this is just an audiotape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="398">Well, here on the back of this picture it describes just a few of the bodies which had been carried out of the barracks, dead, and not hauled to the crematorium yet. </sentence><sentence id="399">And these bodies were just laid out like sticks of wood out by the high barbed wire fence, and they were waiting to be burned. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="400"> Interview with Thomas Gardiner 12 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: Now, this is a photograph that you took? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: This is a photograph that -- yes, with a camera that I had taken from a prisoner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: From a German? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: From a German soldier prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="407">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="408">And these bodies were just almost like skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="409">And then there was a boxcar on the siding, probably more than one boxcar. </sentence><sentence id="410">I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="411">But there were bodies still piled in there that had been -- the Germans brought these people from some other camps that didn't have crematoriums, and they hauled them there and then they burned them. </sentence><sentence id="412">This photo is one of the boxcars with the side door open. </sentence><sentence id="413">Here is another photo of that. </sentence><sentence id="414">And after we got in and were given duty assignments, we were given a tour by some of the prisoners which included the -- they showed us the gas chambers where they lined up the concentration prisoners and had them undress and go through the -- what they thought was going to be a shower, a delousing shower. </sentence><sentence id="415">And they marched them into these gas chambers and gassed them. </sentence><sentence id="416">And then right in the room next to the gas chambers was a large room that had the bodies just thrown helter-skelter, just mounted up like cord wood, again waiting to be burned in the furnaces which were in an adjacent part of that building. </sentence><sentence id="417">The fires were still going at that time because they were -- I suppose it was important to dispose of these bodies that were diseased and had died of disease. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: So after the gates were opened, the bodies were still being cremated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: So far as I remember it was, yes. </sentence><sentence id="433">That's a detail I don't remember for sure. </sentence><sentence id="434">I'm pretty confident they were because the fires were still burning and the bodies were piled up. </sentence><sentence id="435">There would have been probably more disease, danger and all. </sentence><sentence id="436">Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="437">I   Interview with Thomas Gardiner 13 guess that's that and our visions of the barracks and talking with the people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: Let's go back to what you were doing. </sentence><sentence id="446">You marched into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="447">And what was the next thing that happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="451">A: I'm not terribly sure, ma'am. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="453">Q: Well, you said that you were on guard duty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: Well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="456">We were -- I don't know whether they took us in through the gates immediately or whether we marched to the outside and then were farmed up and assigned duty or what. </sentence><sentence id="457">I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="458">But I know that within a matter of minutes or hours of our arrival, we were actually inside of the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: So your guard post was inside the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Yes, ma'am. </sentence><sentence id="466">Most of them were. </sentence><sentence id="467">There was some I think out of the gates and that too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="477">Q: And what specifically were you told to do at your post? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: You know, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="480">I think probably just to make sure that there was no going in or out and no -- probably no fights or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="481">There was so much turmoil then and there was so many ethnic groups, prisoners and all. </sentence><sentence id="482">I'm not terribly sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="487">Q: Do you remember anything that you had to do as far as your guard duty? </sentence><sentence id="488">Any fights you had to break up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A: No, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="492">No. </sentence><sentence id="493">There were some cases where I think some of the prisoners perhaps tried to call attention to some of the -- maybe some of the Nazi guards who had put on a prisoner uniform to try to get out. </sentence><sentence id="494">But I don't remember a specific case where this    Interview with Thomas Gardiner 14 was -- where they pulled my attention to that or -- it was just so much confusion at that point. </sentence><sentence id="495">And these men -- these prisoners were so joyed to be liberated and eager to tell their stories. </sentence><sentence id="496">I guess it was probably all we could do to keep them off of us, if you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="497">Just picture a crowd pushing. </sentence><sentence id="498">Like this one photograph here. </sentence><sentence id="499">Here is a group of them that were -- this is a small group of the prisoners expressing their feelings at being liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="509">Q: In looking at the picture, what feelings do you see that they're expressing? </sentence><sentence id="510">How would you describe the picture? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: Well, most of them seem to be smiling. </sentence><sentence id="514">I see one man there making a face of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="515">Here is an old man sitting down in front here that's head down, probably maybe not even -- he might not even have been normal emotionally at that time. </sentence><sentence id="516">Because I'm sure a large percentage of them who had been in there very long, it would have been hard for them to keep their mental stability. </sentence><sentence id="517">It was hard for us to keep it. </sentence><sentence id="518">It happened -- and you may be aware of this -- that when our sister company went in there first, they were so upset about what they saw that they actually lined up about 40 or 50 of these Nazi guards and just mowed them down with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="519">And another eager officer from another unit that was there almost got court-martialed for killing these guards. </sentence><sentence id="520">But it was the sort of thing you would really expect because our soldiers were so torn up emotionally at seeing this type of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="529">Q: We have to stop and turn over the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="533">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="535"> Interview with Thomas Gardiner 15 Thomas Gardiner, Tape Number 1, Side B. Mr. Gardiner, you were talking about your sister company and how difficult it was for them and for your company to deal with all of the emotions that were involved. </sentence><sentence id="536">You mentioned when they first entered they had lined up some of the German guards and machine-gunned them. </sentence><sentence id="537">Did anything like that happen with your company? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="538">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="539">Because within the few hours that it took us to get in there, I think all of those guards that they'd found had been eliminated, probably, either killed or taken prisoner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: So the circumstances were a little different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: Yeah, right. </sentence><sentence id="545">Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="548">Q: But you said that you were billeted in the quarters of the German officers. </sentence><sentence id="549">What were they like, the quarters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="552">A: They were some pretty deluxe apartments. </sentence><sentence id="553">Yes, they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="556">Q: Could you describe more specifically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="558">A: Well, they were well-furnished and seemed to have -- be well-decorated and -- and I suspect there were probably maybe nicer than what the equivalent officers in our military would be furnished. </sentence><sentence id="559">There was nothing second rate about them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="562">Q: So after about four days, your company moved on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="564">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="565">And then we moved on into Munich. </sentence><sentence id="566">And we saw very little action between there and Munich because Germany was falling apart at that point. </sentence><sentence id="567">I think some of the other units, maybe in other parts of Munich, may have had some combat getting in, but our entrance into Munich was pretty peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="568">And so we moved into Munich. </sentence><sentence id="569">We were -- We took over a section of middle-class family apartments and were billeted in Interview with Thomas Gardiner 16 Munich for I think about a month and guarding important installations, utilities and things of that nature, I guess water supplies and everything there in Munich, until a military government unit could move in and take over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: Well, then we were packed up and shipped from Munich out to a town called Augsburg, A-U-G-S-B-U-R-G, I think. </sentence><sentence id="580">It was not too far from Munich, I don't believe. </sentence><sentence id="581">But we were put out there and billeted in some farmhouses. </sentence><sentence id="582">This was kind of a farm village. </sentence><sentence id="583">And we were there I think about a month, just marking time, waiting for reassignment orders, and were taking some exercise and routine training while we were there. </sentence><sentence id="584">And not anything really exciting. </sentence><sentence id="585">I myself and one of my buddies who happened to have woodworking as a hobby before the military were given an opportunity to work in one of the local cabinet shops on military materials -- exercise equipment, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="586">I don't remember what all we did make, but we had the free use of these cabinet shops and it was kind of a pleasant break from military life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="595">Q: And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="597">A: Well, then we were packed up and put on trains on the so-called 40 and eights, 40 horses or -- 40 men or eight horses. </sentence><sentence id="598">The boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="599">And we were shipped to a tent camp near Le Havre, France. </sentence><sentence id="600">I think we traveled several days there. </sentence><sentence id="601">And we were in this tent camp then, awaiting reshipment back to the States. </sentence><sentence id="602">And our division was scheduled to come back to the States for a short leave and a couple of months amphibious training. </sentence><sentence id="603">And then we were scheduled to be shipped over and participate in the invasion of Japan. </sentence><sentence id="604">While we were in a tent camp, the A bombs were dropped, much to our happiness  Interview with Thomas Gardiner 17 because that eliminated the need for us to be invading Japan. </sentence><sentence id="605">So that's -- That was it. </sentence><sentence id="606">We were shipped back to the U.S. then on some of the victory freighters or victory-sized ships. </sentence><sentence id="607">They hold about 2,000 troops, I think. </sentence><sentence id="608">And we got back to the States. </sentence><sentence id="609">We were given 45 days leave. </sentence><sentence id="610">And then those that didn't have enough points for discharge had to report to some other camps down in Texas. </sentence><sentence id="611">And I was one of those. </sentence><sentence id="612">I wound up down in -- well, two different camps down in Texas. </sentence><sentence id="613">And from that point I wound up being able to negotiate a discharge. </sentence><sentence id="614">My company was still doing some critical work, and they interceded for my release and returned to my job. </sentence><sentence id="615">And my wife had become pregnant during my 45 days leave, so I headed home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: Was that your first child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="639">Yes, ma'am. </sentence><sentence id="640">And we had been married six years when he was born. </sentence><sentence id="641">And he was very much wanted. </sentence><sentence id="642">That's the heavyset fellow that was with us out here in the hall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: So how was your readjustment to civilian life after all of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: Well, in a way I think it was much easier than a lot of the fellows had because I had a job to go to. </sentence><sentence id="651">I had a loving family. </sentence><sentence id="652">I wasn't hanging loose like so many soldiers were. </sentence><sentence id="653">It took some months, I think, to overcome the emotional part of it because I've always been sort of an emotional person anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="654">And I used to have nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="655">I'd stay up sometimes until 2:00 or 3:00 o'clock in the morning, working in my hobby shop just until I could get sleepy enough to go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="656">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="657">I guess gradually the trauma went away. </sentence><sentence id="658">I still 50 years later sometimes get a little bit emotional when I get to talking about it or if we see a war movie or something. </sentence><sentence id="659">But I guess that's quite normal too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="670">Q: And what about your experience at Dachau? </sentence><sentence id="671">Is that something that you have thought    Interview with Thomas Gardiner 18 about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: Thave, yes. </sentence><sentence id="675">I was never a racist. </sentence><sentence id="676">Never in my life. </sentence><sentence id="677">I was brought up to not be. </sentence><sentence id="678">But through my experiences in the Army and then in Europe and then especially at seeing Dachau and seeing what racism could do to people, I came out with an obsession of not letting myself or any of my family ever become racist towards any ethnic group or color of people or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="679">And to this day, that's held pretty true. </sentence><sentence id="680">Because that's what caused most of that turmoil in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="681">The Nazis had to pick out somebody to blame the world's troubles on, and it happened to be the Jews and the non -- other non-Germans. </sentence><sentence id="682">And I don't see that. </sentence><sentence id="683">I believe very much in judging people as individuals. </sentence><sentence id="684">And I think it -- it helped me. </sentence><sentence id="685">Those memories has helped me be a stronger Christian. </sentence><sentence id="686">I was led to be a Christian on the battlefield. </sentence><sentence id="687">I had a battlefield conversion. </sentence><sentence id="688">I've tried to live it all my life. </sentence><sentence id="689">And I think being an active Christian, one must work actively against any kind of discrimination activity or anything. </sentence><sentence id="690">I've never been an activist in terms of joining any group because that's a form of hate itself. </sentence><sentence id="691">There's things like these Klu Klux Klan and some of these militia groups in the U.S. now and all that. </sentence><sentence id="692">Well, they're hate groups that if they were allowed to be out of control, they would be just as heartless as the German Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="693">Some of the things they've done have been very similar. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="714">Q: Just before this interview, I understand that you saw the exhibit in the Holocaust Museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="716">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: And why did you want to come to see the museum? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: Well, I guess partly to refresh my own memory. </sentence><sentence id="721">But I think more than anything   Interview with Thomas Gardiner 19 because my oldest son had been here once before and had been kind of shocked by it. </sentence><sentence id="722">And I had talked to him about the things that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="723">And I had let my children see these photographs that we took and had emphasized to them that they must appreciate that it was real, the holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="724">It wasn't propaganda and so on. </sentence><sentence id="725">And my son really wanted me to come out with him. </sentence><sentence id="726">And I guess that's the primary reason. </sentence><sentence id="727">I guess if he hadn't come out here initially I probably never would have. </sentence><sentence id="728">But he brought a book back from here and I read it. </sentence><sentence id="729">And then we both bought the book, the Schindler's List book, saw the movie, and then there was the sequel to the Schindler's List, the Schindler Legacy or something. </sentence><sentence id="730">And I guess it just refreshed memories. </sentence><sentence id="731">And then my son developed a friendship or a business relationship or something with this Jewish man down in Houston who was from a survivor family or something, and they got to talking about collaborating on writing a book or something. </sentence><sentence id="732">I guess my involvement then has been more a matter of trying to support my son in a worthy endeavor than any personal desire on my part. </sentence><sentence id="733">It didn't open my eyes to anything new here, I think. </sentence><sentence id="734">It maybe just emphasized the immensity of the things that went on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="750">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="753">Not really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
