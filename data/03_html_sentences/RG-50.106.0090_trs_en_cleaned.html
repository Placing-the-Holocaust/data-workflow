<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="485">A: Well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="486">We were -- I don't know whether they took us in through the gates immediately or whether we marched to the outside and then were farmed up and assigned duty or what. </sentence><sentence id="487">I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="488">But I know that within a matter of minutes or hours of our arrival, we were actually inside of the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q: So your guard post was inside the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A: Yes, ma'am. </sentence><sentence id="496">Most of them were. </sentence><sentence id="497">There was some I think out of the gates and that too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="501">Q: But you were in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="503">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="504">Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="507">Q: And what specifically were you told to do at your post? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="509">A: You know, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="510">I think probably just to make sure that there was no going in or out and no -- probably no fights or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="511">There was so much turmoil then and there was so many ethnic groups, prisoners and all. </sentence><sentence id="512">I'm not terribly sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="517">Q: Do you remember anything that you had to do as far as your guard duty? </sentence><sentence id="518">Any fights you had to break up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: No, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="522">No. </sentence><sentence id="523">There were some cases where I think some of the prisoners perhaps tried to call attention to some of the -- maybe some of the Nazi guards who had put on a prisoner uniform to try to get out. </sentence><sentence id="524">But I don't remember a specific case where this This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="525">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="526"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thomas Gardiner 14 was -- where they pulled my attention to that or -- it was just so much confusion at that point. </sentence><sentence id="527">And these men -- these prisoners were so joyed to be liberated and eager to tell their stories. </sentence><sentence id="528">I guess it was probably all we could do to keep them off of us, if you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="529">Just picture a crowd pushing. </sentence><sentence id="530">Like this one photograph here. </sentence><sentence id="531">Here is a group of them that were -- this is a small group of the prisoners expressing their feelings at being liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="543">Q: In looking at the picture, what feelings do you see that they're expressing? </sentence><sentence id="544">How would you describe the picture? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: Well, most of them seem to be smiling. </sentence><sentence id="548">I see one man there making a face of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="549">Here is an old man sitting down in front here that's head down, probably maybe not even -- he might not even have been normal emotionally at that time. </sentence><sentence id="550">Because I'm sure a large percentage of them who had been in there very long, it would have been hard for them to keep their mental stability. </sentence><sentence id="551">It was hard for us to keep it. </sentence><sentence id="552">It happened -- and you may be aware of this -- that when our sister company went in there first, they were so upset about what they saw that they actually lined up about 40 or 50 of these Nazi guards and just mowed them down with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="553">And another eager officer from another unit that was there almost got court-martialed for killing these guards. </sentence><sentence id="554">But it was the sort of thing you would really expect because our soldiers were so torn up emotionally at seeing this type of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="573"> Interview with Thomas Gardiner 15 Thomas Gardiner, Tape Number 1, Side B. Mr. Gardiner, you were talking about your sister company and how difficult it was for them and for your company to deal with all of the emotions that were involved. </sentence><sentence id="574">You mentioned when they first entered they had lined up some of the German guards and machine-gunned them. </sentence><sentence id="575">Did anything like that happen with your company? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="577">Because within the few hours that it took us to get in there, I think all of those guards that they'd found had been eliminated, probably, either killed or taken prisoner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="580">Q: So the circumstances were a little different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="582">A: Yeah, right. </sentence><sentence id="583">Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="586">Q: But you said that you were billeted in the quarters of the German officers. </sentence><sentence id="587">What were they like, the quarters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="590">A: They were some pretty deluxe apartments. </sentence><sentence id="591">Yes, they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="594">Q: Could you describe more specifically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="596">A: Well, they were well-furnished and seemed to have -- be well-decorated and -- and I suspect there were probably maybe nicer than what the equivalent officers in our military would be furnished. </sentence><sentence id="597">There was nothing second rate about them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: So after about four days, your company moved on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="602">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="603">And then we moved on into Munich. </sentence><sentence id="604">And we saw very little action between there and Munich because Germany was falling apart at that point. </sentence><sentence id="605">I think some of the other units, maybe in other parts of Munich, may have had some combat getting in, but our entrance into Munich was pretty peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="606">And so we moved into Munich. </sentence><sentence id="607">We were -- We took over a section of middle-class family apartments and were billeted in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="608">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="609"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thomas Gardiner 16 Munich for I think about a month and guarding important installations, utilities and things of that nature, I guess water supplies and everything there in Munich, until a military government unit could move in and take over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="620">Q: And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="622">A: Well, then we were packed up and shipped from Munich out to a town called Augsburg, A-U-G-S-B-U-R-G, I think. </sentence><sentence id="623">It was not too far from Munich, I don't believe. </sentence><sentence id="624">But we were put out there and billeted in some farmhouses. </sentence><sentence id="625">This was kind of a farm village. </sentence><sentence id="626">And we were there I think about a month, just marking time, waiting for reassignment orders, and were taking some exercise and routine training while we were there. </sentence><sentence id="627">And not anything really exciting. </sentence><sentence id="628">I myself and one of my buddies who happened to have woodworking as a hobby before the military were given an opportunity to work in one of the local cabinet shops on military materials -- exercise equipment, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="629">I don't remember what all we did make, but we had the free use of these cabinet shops and it was kind of a pleasant break from military life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="638">Q: And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: Well, then we were packed up and put on trains on the so-called 40 and eights, 40 horses or -- 40 men or eight horses. </sentence><sentence id="641">The boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="642">And we were shipped to a tent camp near Le Havre, France. </sentence><sentence id="643">I think we traveled several days there. </sentence><sentence id="644">And we were in this tent camp then, awaiting reshipment back to the States. </sentence><sentence id="645">And our division was scheduled to come back to the States for a short leave and a couple of months amphibious training. </sentence><sentence id="646">And then we were scheduled to be shipped over and participate in the invasion of Japan. </sentence><sentence id="647">While we were in a tent camp, the A bombs were dropped, much to our happiness This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="648">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="649"> Interview with Thomas Gardiner 17 because that eliminated the need for us to be invading Japan. </sentence><sentence id="650">So that's -- That was it. </sentence><sentence id="651">We were shipped back to the U.S. then on some of the victory freighters or victory-sized ships. </sentence><sentence id="652">They hold about 2,000 troops, I think. </sentence><sentence id="653">And we got back to the States. </sentence><sentence id="654">We were given 45 days leave. </sentence><sentence id="655">And then those that didn't have enough points for discharge had to report to some other camps down in Texas. </sentence><sentence id="656">And I was one of those. </sentence><sentence id="657">I wound up down in -- well, two different camps down in Texas. </sentence><sentence id="658">And from that point I wound up being able to negotiate a discharge. </sentence><sentence id="659">My company was still doing some critical work, and they interceded for my release and returned to my job. </sentence><sentence id="660">And my wife had become pregnant during my 45 days leave, so I headed home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="683">Q: Was that your first child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="686">Yes, ma'am. </sentence><sentence id="687">And we had been married six years when he was born. </sentence><sentence id="688">And he was very much wanted. </sentence><sentence id="689">That's the heavyset fellow that was with us out here in the hall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="695">Q: So how was your readjustment to civilian life after all of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="697">A: Well, in a way I think it was much easier than a lot of the fellows had because I had a job to go to. </sentence><sentence id="698">I had a loving family. </sentence><sentence id="699">I wasn't hanging loose like so many soldiers were. </sentence><sentence id="700">It took some months, I think, to overcome the emotional part of it because I've always been sort of an emotional person anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="701">And I used to have nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="702">I'd stay up sometimes until 2:00 or 3:00 o'clock in the morning, working in my hobby shop just until I could get sleepy enough to go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="703">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="704">I guess gradually the trauma went away. </sentence><sentence id="705">I still 50 years later sometimes get a little bit emotional when I get to talking about it or if we see a war movie or something. </sentence><sentence id="706">But I guess that's quite normal too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="717">Q: And what about your experience at Dachau? </sentence><sentence id="718">Is that something that you have thought This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="719">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="720"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Thomas Gardiner 18 about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="725">A: Thave, yes. </sentence><sentence id="726">I was never a racist. </sentence><sentence id="727">Never in my life. </sentence><sentence id="728">I was brought up to not be. </sentence><sentence id="729">But through my experiences in the Army and then in Europe and then especially at seeing Dachau and seeing what racism could do to people, I came out with an obsession of not letting myself or any of my family ever become racist towards any ethnic group or color of people or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="730">And to this day, that's held pretty true. </sentence><sentence id="731">Because that's what caused most of that turmoil in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="732">The Nazis had to pick out somebody to blame the world's troubles on, and it happened to be the Jews and the non -- other non-Germans. </sentence><sentence id="733">And I don't see that. </sentence><sentence id="734">I believe very much in judging people as individuals. </sentence><sentence id="735">And I think it -- it helped me. </sentence><sentence id="736">Those memories has helped me be a stronger Christian. </sentence><sentence id="737">I was led to be a Christian on the battlefield. </sentence><sentence id="738">I had a battlefield conversion. </sentence><sentence id="739">I've tried to live it all my life. </sentence><sentence id="740">And I think being an active Christian, one must work actively against any kind of discrimination activity or anything. </sentence><sentence id="741">I've never been an activist in terms of joining any group because that's a form of hate itself. </sentence><sentence id="742">There's things like these Klu Klux Klan and some of these militia groups in the U.S. now and all that. </sentence><sentence id="743">Well, they're hate groups that if they were allowed to be out of control, they would be just as heartless as the German Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="744">Some of the things they've done have been very similar. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: Just before this interview, I understand that you saw the exhibit in the Holocaust Museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: And why did you want to come to see the museum? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A: Well, I guess partly to refresh my own memory. </sentence><sentence id="772">But I think more than anything This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="773">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="774"> Interview with Thomas Gardiner 19 because my oldest son had been here once before and had been kind of shocked by it. </sentence><sentence id="775">And I had talked to him about the things that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="776">And I had let my children see these photographs that we took and had emphasized to them that they must appreciate that it was real, the holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="777">It wasn't propaganda and so on. </sentence><sentence id="778">And my son really wanted me to come out with him. </sentence><sentence id="779">And I guess that's the primary reason. </sentence><sentence id="780">I guess if he hadn't come out here initially I probably never would have. </sentence><sentence id="781">But he brought a book back from here and I read it. </sentence><sentence id="782">And then we both bought the book, the Schindler's List book, saw the movie, and then there was the sequel to the Schindler's List, the Schindler Legacy or something. </sentence><sentence id="783">And I guess it just refreshed memories. </sentence><sentence id="784">And then my son developed a friendship or a business relationship or something with this Jewish man down in Houston who was from a survivor family or something, and they got to talking about collaborating on writing a book or something. </sentence><sentence id="785">I guess my involvement then has been more a matter of trying to support my son in a worthy endeavor than any personal desire on my part. </sentence><sentence id="786">It didn't open my eyes to anything new here, I think. </sentence><sentence id="787">It maybe just emphasized the immensity of the things that went on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="808">Not really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
