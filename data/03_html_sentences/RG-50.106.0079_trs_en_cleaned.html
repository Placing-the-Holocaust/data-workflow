<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1176">Q: And what was that experience like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1178">A: Well, that was a really very -- it's emotionally a difficult experience, but we -- we decided that we wanted to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1179">And we adopted them through the Louise Wise Agency in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And that was quite an experience in itself, going through that procedure. </sentence><sentence id="1181">But I must say they -- they were supportive because they saw we were sincere and they felt that we would make good parents. </sentence><sentence id="1182">And we adopted our son then when he was -- well, he was about three months old. </sentence><sentence id="1183">And so then short -- then three years later we decided maybe we should try for another adoption, which was very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="1184">The agency did not give out a lot of second children. </sentence><sentence id="1185">They had just   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kurt Pauly 8 November 18, 1997 started a program -- in fact, initially, when we adopted our son, they gave out no second children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1201">A: And then they, somewhere during that time period, apparently, they started a program for giving out second children. </sentence><sentence id="1202">They felt that perhaps it might be good for the children, that they would have siblings, or go to a family, not be an only child. </sentence><sentence id="1203">So they started a program to place second children, and we were able to get into that program. </sentence><sentence id="1204">And then we adopted my daughter about three years after my son. </sentence><sentence id="1205">And she again was about three months old when we adopted her. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1213">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1214">In New York at that time, the law was that you -- they -- the children could only be placed in homes of the religion of their mother. </sentence><sentence id="1215">So the agency could only place Jewish children, and it could only place them in Jewish homes. </sentence><sentence id="1216">Except that there was one exce -- an interesting exception. </sentence><sentence id="1217">There was a program for Native Americans adoption. </sentence><sentence id="1218">You c -- the law did not apply to Native Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1219">And they also had a program for placing Native American children. </sentence><sentence id="1220">It was a rather small   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kurt Pauly " November 18, 1997 program. </sentence><sentence id="1221">We never got -- did adopt a Native American child. </sentence><sentence id="1222">But that was the only exception at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1234">Q: Would that have been your choice, to adopt Jewish babies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1236">A: Not necessarily, because we -- they could have become Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1237">So that -- it just worked out that way because when we went -- the agents -- had we not been able to adopt through the agency, we probably would have tried some other means, but it all worked out very well. </sentence><sentence id="1238">So -- and -- so then after we adopted my daughter -- well, first of all, the agency required that you have a separate room for each of the children, that was one of the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1239">We only had a thr -- two bedroom apartment, and my son was already in the second bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So we -- we told the agency we would get a sec -- a third -- another bedroom for the -- for -- for my daughter eventually, so we looked for a house. </sentence><sentence id="1241">So on -- on the condition that we would, you know, provide a second bedroom for the -- my daughter, they placed my daughter with us on -- she was still in the -- we were still in the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1242">But what we did was we made a room out of a dinette area, temporarily, for my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And somewhere after that we -- we did move into a house, and then we had a bedroom for each child. </sentence><sentence id="1244">And meanwhile I was working, and I worked for five years for a public accounting firm, Touche, and -- whose name changed several times while I was working for them. </sentence><sentence id="1245">But by th -- when I left they were called Touche   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kurt Pauly * November 18, 1997 Ross. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And after about five years I went with a company called Mark Marietta(ph) in New York, at the headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="1247">It was shortly after the company was formed, it was a merger of two other companies, that's -- is frequently the case. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And I was with them until I retired really, in 19 -- at the age of 62, in 1992. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1902">   70 Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1903">A: Well, we were very happy to pass along to them some firsthand experience. </sentence><sentence id="1904">In other words, we were -- as they say, and there's a German phrase for it, which really says you're a witness of the event. </sentence><sentence id="1905">We were witnesses of the events that occurred. </sentence><sentence id="1906">I mean, they're young children, to them this history is almost like reading history about Ancient Rome in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1907">But -- but here were people who actually had the exp -- lived in that time f-- period, and had experienced some of these things, and they found it very interesting, and they seemed to take to it very readily, and they were very interested in our experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1908">They wanted to hear what had hap -- what we had -- you know, what had happened to us, and why it happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="1909">Of course, we couldn't really tell them why in -- in one sense, but on the other hand, it made what they had learned in class that much more immediate and real for them, as well. </sentence><sentence id="1910">And we felt very good about being able to pass this along to this chi -- generation, because those are the people we have to -- hope to -- to get to understand what occurred. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1947">Q: How do you think your experience has affected your current or past political views, or your opinions about national and international issues? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1949">A: Well, I think it pr -- the fact that it happened, and happened to our families, happened to us, that pe -- you know, that here are people who have lived in a country for hundreds of years, as my family and Jill's family had done, and really felt German, no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="1950">I mean, my father was a soldier in the first World War. </sentence><sentence id="1951">And the Jews of Germany were as patriotic Germans as the Jews of America are patriotic Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1952">I mean, they felt German. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And to think that what happened could happen, and did happen, is in a way very disturbing to us individually, because [phone ringing] somehow you have that nagging feeling that maybe it could happen again, and maybe even could happen here. </sentence><sentence id="1954">I mean, I think survivors had more of that feeling than people who did not go through that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1955"> 73 Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1956">Q: And you had that feeling more than people who did not -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1957">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I think, based on my -- our experiences with people who were not survivors of the Holocaust, who were not in Europe, who were Americans, and have lived here, didn't have that experience directly, I think we feel differently than they do. </sentence><sentence id="1959">And I get th --I get the same reaction from other friends of ours who are also survivors, that they have those feelings and those emotions. </sentence><sentence id="1960">I just -- you ju -- they -- I mean, I guess you can never quite feel as certain about what's going to happen, and that it" be that -- or that something like that occurred in the Holocaust can't happen again, or can't happen to Jews again, or can't happen in this country again, as people who didn't have that experience. </sentence><sentence id="1961">I think that also makes the state of Israel for us, much more important in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="1962">That that is something that was not there when the Holocaust occurred, and had it been there, probably things would have been somewhat different, because at least Jews would have had a place to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1969">Q: How does this feeling affect your politics or your participation in the community? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1971">A: Oh, I think --I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1972">But I thi-- I don't know whether it has some of that direct effect -- maybe I'm -- I'm [indecipherable] our politics might be otherwise, but it definitely, I think, has an effect on how we interpret the events, and what   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Kurt Pauly " November 18, 1997 people say and do. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And when something occurs, maybe we feel -- you know, if we see something -- maybe we are more apt to interpret something as being anti-Jewish or anti-Semitic than others, because we said, hey, wait a minute, is that really -- you know? </sentence><sentence id="1974">And it may not be, but I think you have that reaction more quickly than people who have not gone through something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1980">Q: Does an example come to mind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1982">A: Well, let me try to think. </sentence><sentence id="1983">All right, when we had this -- oh, what was this fellow down in Louisiana? </sentence><sentence id="1984">Can't think. </sentence><sentence id="1985">He ran for the U.S. Senate from Louisiana -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1986">Q: Huey Long? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1987">A: No, no, no, no, no, much later, recently. </sentence><sentence id="1988">A few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1989">No, not Huey Long, much earlier -- much later than that. </sentence><sentence id="1990">I can't think of his name. </sentence><sentence id="1991">He was a really -- I mean, he really was someone who not so much -- not necessarily anti-Semitic direct, but he was just sort of anti a lot of things, and he had -- obviously was a person with a great deal of -- of -- of prejudices, in terms of minorities and other people who were not, you know, quite Anglo-Saxon Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1992">And when you -- you know, so I think our reaction to that was much more fearful in a way, than other Americans who said, oh well, you know, he's out on a far limb, he's far -- you know, he's way out of the political s -- on the side of some extreme side of the political spectrum, because we said, well, people like that who were on the far side of the political    75 Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18, 1997 spectrum in Germany, finally got into power, and we said, you know -- so we're much more -- I think perhaps we're much more concerned about those things than people who don't have those experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1993">And when we see it in other parts of the world also, we're -- we s -- we -- we perhaps in si-- always more fearful that people who have such negative views, in terms of other minority groups, whether it's here or in Europe, or in Asia, can get into a position where they can create the kind of regime that did the sort of thing that happened in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1994">| do think that that's something that impacts survivors more than others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2004">Q: And it impacts you more than others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2006">A: Oh yes, yes, as -- me as well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2007">But overall, I think we're, you know, basically, because of our age when we left Germany, I think we're prow -- we are, on the other hand, not as much affected as people who even went -- or, you know, who -- who went through the camps, who went through the actual events of the -- that occurred in Europe in the Holocaust, I don't think we are -- we don't -- I don't think we have quite their emotions, cause they must have a whole other set of emotions, and concerns and reactions. </sentence><sentence id="2008">But I do think we are also -- but we -- I think we're somehow different emotionally than people who haven't had any -- the experience even we've had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2012">Q: So it's had a major, lasting impact on --    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2014"> 76 Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2015">A: Yes, and I think it had it -- and the other thing is, I think it had a -- a terrible impact on our families, our parents. </sentence><sentence id="2016">I th -- don't kn -- you know, there've been -- there's been a lot written about people who were in Europe and -- and survived the Holocaust in Europe, or -- and what happened to them, people who were in the camps, or hidden, or so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2017">I don't think there's been much written about people who got out of Europe, but had the experiences that our parents had, and what -- what that meant for them, because here were people who were just, you know, ripped out of their environment, and ripped out of everything that they were used to, and were thrown into another world, other countries, and had to adjust, you know, to -- try to establish a whole new life for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2018">Now, obviously their experiences were not as horrible as the people who were involved in the camps, but they certainly, I know, are -- both of our families suffered a great deal as a result of that as well. </sentence><sentence id="2019">It's a different kind of suffering and it's a different kind of experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2025">Q: But it's suffering. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2027">A: But it's there, nevertheless, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2028">So, I--I know our children and our nieces and nephews and all the people of the next generation, they have again different experience and different feeling because they're again another step removed from the events in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2029">But I think even those people are somewhat impacted by our experiences, because they" ve heard it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2030"> 77 Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2031">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="2032">So it's a part of their world. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2033">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2034">Now, their children, again, now they're gonna be another -- further removed from it, and now it really becomes ancient history, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="2035">And that's why I think the museum is very important, because it brings that history to these people, to these young people, and to the people who had no experience with the Holocaust, and says oh hey, wait a minute, here it is, and it's -- it's more immediate than just reading about it, or hearing about it, sort of on the background noise, and hopefully it brings it up as a more -- as a -- as a more real experience, that it really did happen, and it happened fairly recently, and it happened to people that are still alive today. </sentence><sentence id="2036">That was an interesting experience once I had in the museum when I was at the elevators. </sentence><sentence id="2037">A young group came -- some young people came through, oh, young teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And one of the boys came up to me while we were waiting -- while they were waiting for the elevator, and he says, is th -- is there anybody still alive who -- who experienced this? </sentence><sentence id="2039">So to him this was already, you know, really, you know, ancient history. </sentence><sentence id="2040">So what I told him I had -- had an exper -- you know, that I had lived through that, I guess it was sort of like, you know, meeting Julius Caesar or something, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2041">But -- so that -- our whole experience wa -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="2042">Now, we don't want to make the Holocaust, you know, sort of a religion of life now because I think that's a ne -- that's very negative. </sentence><sentence id="2043">But I    78 Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18, 1997 think we have to remember what happened, and -- and live our life knowing those events occurred, and what those mean. </sentence></p></dialogue>
