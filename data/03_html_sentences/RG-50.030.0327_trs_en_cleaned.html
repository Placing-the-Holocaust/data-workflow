<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Now, prior to 1939, what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Well, we knew enough. </sentence><sentence id="80">We had a radio, of course. </sentence><sentence id="81">The radio at that time was still pretty new,

Austria was shot. </sentence><sentence id="83">His name was Schuslig (ph), I think. </sentence><sentence id="84">I remember that and we were quite shocked because there was already a from Hitler's party because he wanted to  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 3 wanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to medical school, but I was cut out. </sentence><sentence id="85">No Jew could enter medical school. </sentence><sentence id="86">So, what to do, then? </sentence><sentence id="87">I was 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="88">So, I went to work for my father in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work. </sentence><sentence id="89">And I was, it seemed, from 19 -- to the end of the war -- 1945. </sentence><sentence id="90">Although in 1944, we already went to the mountains to escape, but we will come to it. </sentence><sentence id="91">But I was working, helping out, and I learned the trade. </sentence><sentence id="92">And about the business. </sentence><sentence id="93">Soon, the Slovak regime started. </sentence><sentence id="94">My father had to give up the business and he had to be political party zealot (ph). </sentence><sentence id="95">An Audian (ph) person, had to take over. </sentence><sentence id="96">He was the boss. </sentence><sentence id="97">He took the money. </sentence><sentence id="98">And just give certain amount of income to my father to live on. </sentence><sentence id="99">That was from 19 -- if | remember, it may be from 1941 or so to end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="100">So my father was employed, I was employed, but we stayed home. </sentence><sentence id="101">We did not go. </sentence><sentence id="102">Now, my sister, she was a seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="103">She was very good at it. </sentence><sentence id="104">And she worked for a Slovak company at a job. </sentence><sentence id="105">By 1942, came an order, actually, a letter given to the Jewish families, which said that all girls from age, I know it was from 16 or 18, unmarried women, should report in the Jewish school, I think, if I remember right, either five or ten kilograms of supply and they would be taken to a working place. </sentence><sentence id="106">So all the girls from, not all the girls, there were some exceptions, but many of the girls came. </sentence><sentence id="107">They had about two weeks notice. </sentence><sentence id="108">But at that time, you didn't know yet what was happening, so nobody felt nothing bad about it. </sentence><sentence id="109">They came there and stayed overnight in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="110">And the next day, they were taken by train to the city of Poprat (ph), which is about 40 kilometers east, and from there, on to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="111">Now, we didn't know nothing. </sentence><sentence id="112">We knew nothing about Auschwitz at that time. </sentence><sentence id="113">Now, there were some parents who were a little bit smarter than we were. </sentence><sentence id="114">And when they got the notice, they send their daughters to hospital for appendectomy, whether they needed it or not, and they saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="115">As a matter of fact, my classmate, girlfriend, who saved her life, lives here in Cleveland. </sentence><sentence id="116">She's married here to an American boy. </sentence><sentence id="117">But my father,we tried to talk, I must say, my sister was very good friend with a girl who was a, she was a girlfriend of the chief of the " was an organization which cooperated, of course, with Hitler, and which took care of all the Jewish problems. </sentence><sentence id="118">And my father went to this -- to help this girl to beg that they shouldn't take my sister. </sentence><sentence id="119">But they did not worry about it -- just didn't want to talk to my father about it. </sentence><sentence id="120">And that was our goal -- that was our biggest mistake that we made because they left of March 27, 1942, from my hometown, Nicholage (ph). </sentence><sentence id="121">And on April the 2nd, the train took them from the city of Poprat (ph) to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="122">We never heard of her anymore. </sentence><sentence id="123">And we found out that in May or June, they were already liquidated . </sentence><sentence id="124">So as I said, that was our biggest tragedy in the family. </sentence><sentence id="125">But we stayed on. </sentence><sentence id="126">And the tragedy was also that two weeks after she was deported, my father got so-called economic exemption. </sentence><sentence id="127">That means that father, my stepmother, I and my brother, we didn't even have to wear the , the Star. </sentence><sentence id="128">We didn't have to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="129">We could travel, but  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 4 12 men who managed a telegraph station for .

. </sentence><sentence id="133">It was the president of -- for their interruptions. </sentence><sentence id="134">The front didn't have any more connections to our home town. </sentence><sentence id="135">Because we knew that if something had happened, that there would be murder. </sentence><sentence id="136">I mean, everybody would be killed because there was, you know, the Germans might (ph) kill them. </sentence><sentence id="137">So, we didn't know, of course, at least, something bad had happened, but we were preparing ourselves for bad times, to leave our town and go to the mountains, because Nicholage (ph), my home town lies right on the top of a mountain. </sentence><sentence id="138">So, about a year before, we found a carpenter who was not a sympathizer with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="139">He was acommunist. </sentence><sentence id="140">And he built us a bunker in the mountains, about three kilometers from our town. </sentence><sentence id="141">Please ask

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: I'm curious what happened between 1938 and 1942. </sentence><sentence id="213">That's a big chunk of time, considering what was happening in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="214">So, what was happening in your town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: Well, first of all, on October 6th, 1938, they took Slovakia and was divided in Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="219">Slovakia became autonomous. </sentence><sentence id="220">That means, the president was still the president of both countries, but autonomy , but they still went to Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="221">Then,  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="301">There were some, but really, the bad things started in 1941, and mostly in "42. </sentence><sentence id="302">That was when the mass deportation took place, and the whole family was just -- they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="303">I remember, for instance, the cousin of the Schuller (ph), the colonel, his five children, I remember like today, they were taking him -- the police escort. </sentence><sentence id="304">And it was a very sad thing to see. </sentence><sentence id="305">And we stayed because we had the exemption. </sentence><sentence id="306">But all these people were gone. </sentence><sentence id="307">All the stores were out of the Jewish hens (ph) already at the time. </sentence><sentence id="308">As I say, it was all under different management. </sentence><sentence id="309">And the life became tougher every day. </sentence><sentence id="310">There was a rationing of food. </sentence><sentence id="311">I know that we didn't have everything that we wanted, but because my father was so long in business and he went to villages, to electrify the city, you know, to start putting electricity in the villages at that time. </sentence><sentence id="312">So, many times, he brought butter in or some meat or something. </sentence><sentence id="313">So, we are not starving really. </sentence><sentence id="314">But food was very, very hard to get. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Do you remember your family talking about the situation and what you thought was going to happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: You talking before my sister went or after? </sentence><sentence id="333">Before, I say, we didn't know it was going to be. </sentence><sentence id="334">We knew that if we honestly would go to work, it will be living. </sentence><sentence id="335">But, as soon as the transport went -- as I say, it was April 2nd, 1942 -- and we knew it was going to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="336">And we heard a few weeks after that, we knew already there was a liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="337">But what could we do? </sentence><sentence id="338">We couldn't escape at the time, because there was no passport, nothing you could get, no place. </sentence><sentence id="339">You were stuck where you were. </sentence><sentence id="340">But we tried to prepare for the inevitable, to build something that we could escape, if bad comes, and hopefully, to save our lives. </sentence><sentence id="341">And I think in 1943, I had a friend whose parents were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="342">And couldn't go to school, so he worked for his father. </sentence><sentence id="343">And they had two horses and a big buggy. </sentence><sentence id="344">And little by little, the material to build the bunker on Sundays, we shipped to the top of the mountain where we built the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="345">And somehow, people didn't notice too much. </sentence><sentence id="346">You know, why are they being gone? </sentence><sentence id="347">But anyway, it was several times, delivered wood, and it was probably needed. </sentence><sentence id="348">And his name, he was a carpenter, built a bunker, which I have said was very wonderfully equipped. </sentence><sentence id="349">We had bunk beds -- Oh, I didn't tell you, we were four families together, four families together, which, of course, put the money together to build this bunker. </sentence><sentence id="350">We were all friends. </sentence><sentence id="351">There were two couples -- husband and wife, husband and wife, husband and wife and a son, and my father and my stepmother and my brother and I, because my sister was gone. </sentence><sentence id="352">So four families. </sentence><sentence id="353">This bunker, it was pretty comfortably built. </sentence><sentence id="354">We had, for instance, our own radio so we could communicate with the . </sentence><sentence id="355">But how we did it, we brought in a bicycle and we put a through it, a dynamo on the  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 8 listen to BBC. </sentence><sentence id="356">So we knew what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="357">And it was all lasting very nicely from the day when the partisans came to town -- like I said, it was August 29, 1944 -- until we are liberated. </sentence><sentence id="358">How . . . </sentence><sentence id="359">I know, you want me to continue with this story now? </sentence><sentence id="360">Or do you have some other questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: Well, I've got a lot to cover before we get to liberation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="442">Q: How much did you know about the partisans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: We knew because, well, my town was mostly Protestants, so we were a little bit against the regime. </sentence><sentence id="445">And there were some people were coming in with information about going on and maybe even trying to get some people to join the partisans in the mountains -- because that was our adventure (ph). </sentence><sentence id="446">We went around mountains all around the city. </sentence><sentence id="447">So they were coming -- because at that time they weren't in uniforms, they were in plain clothes. </sentence><sentence id="448">And, though we knew what was going on and we knew the time would come that -- we hoped that the revolution would take place in the , because there was a -- the people parachuted (ph) from Russia and took "s army. </sentence><sentence id="449">And I understand there were even some Americans who were shot down over Slovakia, and they returned. , </sentence><sentence id="450">but I was  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 10 will represent the Jews," just like in Russia ghettos, he's like the unirat (ph). </sentence><sentence id="451">So he was the unirat (ph), one person. </sentence><sentence id="452">And, for instance, like I said, he had a niece. </sentence><sentence id="453">The niece was working for my father as a secretary or as a clerk in our business. </sentence><sentence id="454">She was a single girl, but never married. </sentence><sentence id="455">She was supposed to be the puppet (ph). </sentence><sentence id="456">He knew that this would take place for her, and suddenly, she disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="457">So, he saved her life. </sentence><sentence id="458">He didn't tell everybody else about the . </sentence><sentence id="459">So, he didn't have the best reputation. </sentence><sentence id="460">But, it was his kid, and a special life. </sentence><sentence id="461">But otherwise, only purposes, he sent out letters to the Jewish families (ph) who were still there, "you must know to do this, you must stay home at six, you couldn't go to the street," other restrictions went through there, to give out information. </sentence><sentence id="462">And the temple, which as I said was a very beautiful temple, was used as a warehouse or something. </sentence><sentence id="463">there was no more services going on. </sentence><sentence id="464">So, it was very, very restricted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
