<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell me your name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Eugene Lipman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 13, 1919. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="12">Uh...Gene, tell me something about your family and growing up in Pittsburgh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Uh...My father was a small jeweler in the mill district of Pittsburgh, my mother a Pittsburgher by the way. </sentence><sentence id="16">My father was born in Europe...uh...had and raised children and was the compliant homemaker. </sentence><sentence id="17">Uh...We never had any money. </sentence><sentence id="18">My grandparents,...uh...all four, lived in Pittsburgh until my grandfather, my paternal went off to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="19">In 1925 or 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebration, and then came back permanently during World War II because the idea of the Germans taking over Palestine was an unpleasant idea to him and so he came back and he died in Pittsburgh. </sentence><sentence id="20">We are a long lived family. </sentence><sentence id="21">My paternal grandfather was 93 at the time of his death. </sentence><sentence id="22">Uh...I grew up in this mill district of Pittsburgh to the age of 7, then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill because I had to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill, and I completed my high school education at High School, 40 percent Jewish and...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="23">And started the Pitt because I could live at home and go to Pitt. </sentence><sentence id="24">This was depression time. </sentence><sentence id="25">And then in 38...Solomon Freuhauf who was my mentor in this Rabbi business decided that I was wasting my time in Pittsburgh and sent me off to Cincinnati. </sentence><sentence id="26">I went to Hebrew College in Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="27">They were across the street from the other...from each other. </sentence><sentence id="28">They still are. </sentence><sentence id="29">And...uh...got my degree from University of Cincinnati, finished it HUC in 1943, having accelerated a year because they needed chaplains so badly. </sentence><sentence id="30">And...uh...so we went to school for 22 straight months in order to accomplish this. </sentence><sentence id="31">No professor would allow us to give up a course. </sentence><sentence id="32">How can you be a chaplain without my course in mid rush five, one of them was known to say. </sentence><sentence id="33">Uh...It was required by the military that you have a year of experience before you can go into chaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in Fort Worth, Texas, who went into the Navy and spent a very uncomfortable year there. </sentence><sentence id="34">I was 23 years old and everybody I met in the street 23 years old was in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="35">Uh...The entire American army was in Texas. </sentence><sentence id="36">And...uh...I was not in uniform so as soon as I could get into uniform, I got into uniform. </sentence><sentence id="37">Uh...We had married...in...1943, the day after ordination. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was a long weekend, and...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: When and under...when did you go overseas. </sentence><sentence id="64">What were the circumstances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Well, I had decided very early on that my war in World War II was the European theater, not the Pacific theatre, even though I wavered on that because of something I'll mention in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="68">But I had really decided that I wanted to go to Germany and I had asked the Chief Chaplain's office to ship me to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="69">Going overseas was unavoidable. </sentence><sentence id="70">I knew that. </sentence><sentence id="71">And so...uh...in February of 1945, I got orders to go overseas and didn't get there until April because that's the war the army worked. </sentence><sentence id="72">The...uh...thing I didn't mention to you was that while I was in Fort Worth, a member of my congregation who had rabbinical connections...uh..asked me, right after Yom Kippur services, as a matter of fact, if | had ever thought about becoming a pilot. </sentence><sentence id="73">Uh...He taught fairy pilots, the women pilots. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="82">I want to hold it. </sentence><sentence id="83">And can you stop the tape please? </sentence><sentence id="84">Alright, just hold the tape for a minute and then we'll pick it up. </sentence><sentence id="85">We've had construction problems on the third floor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="91">The sound is coming through the roof. </sentence><sentence id="92">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="93">These people are just marvelous. </sentence><sentence id="94">What we will do, we'll back it from the beginning of that story. </sentence><sentence id="95">I'll ask you to describe... Dean, tell me about...uh...the gentleman in Texas. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections. </sentence><sentence id="97">He came up to me after services on Yom Kippur and introduced himself. </sentence><sentence id="98">We had never met. </sentence><sentence id="99">I had been there all of about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all Rabbis were chicken. </sentence><sentence id="100">And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, "When do we start." </sentence><sentence id="101">And he said, "Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock." </sentence><sentence id="102">And (laughter) I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="103">I can't do it tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="104">Give me a couple days." </sentence><sentence id="105">Because, among other things, I didn't have a flight jacket. </sentence><sentence id="106">And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket. </sentence><sentence id="107">You couldn't go up in an airplane. </sentence><sentence id="108">They were open. </sentence><sentence id="109">There were no closed airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="110">That's a long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="111">So he taught me to fly in his little piper cub which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I notified the...uh...Jewish Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing this in case it was of interest. </sentence><sentence id="112">And the Chief Chaplain's office was very interested, they said. </sentence><sentence id="113">So I got my license and...uh...after Chaplain's school, which was 5 weeks we got our assignments and I was signed to the armored force. </sentence><sentence id="114">And I thought, you know, "Typical Army screw up!" </sentence><sentence id="115">But...uh...It was done deliberately. </sentence><sentence id="116">I found out that they just didn't want Chaplains flying airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="117">They wanted Chaplains praying for troops. </sentence><sentence id="118">And so I did go to Europe instead of doing Island hopping in the Pacific was what they had been talking about. </sentence><sentence id="119">So | arrived in Europe in...uh...April 1945. </sentence><sentence id="120">The...uh...voyage was of interest historically. </sentence><sentence id="121">I became the radio announcer on the plane...I...on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="122">I probably was the only one who could read English, something of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="123">And several times a day I did news broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner. </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of Franklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way overseas. </sentence><sentence id="125">That was a very discouraging and depressing...uh...idea. </sentence><sentence id="126">Who...who was Truman became a very important question to those of us who were on our way overseas. </sentence><sentence id="127">We also had a...uh... marathon bridge game going. </sentence><sentence id="128">It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army career ever suggested that we play bridge for money. </sentence><sentence id="129">Never did. </sentence><sentence id="130">There were eight of us in this bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep. </sentence><sentence id="131">And...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days. </sentence><sentence id="132">Several million points were involved in my losses. </sentence><sentence id="133">Uh...I also agreed to...uh...box for the only time in my life, because they were having a series of boxing matches and they couldn't find a heavy weight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had fought a couple of times before. </sentence><sentence id="134">We sort of sparred around for three rounds. </sentence><sentence id="135">I...uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by ambulance from dockside to an Evac hospital just outside Lahov in France. </sentence><sentence id="136">And the rumor went around that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been hospitalized. </sentence><sentence id="137">And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back home again because I was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="138">I heard that long after I got into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="139">Couple...couple of people were surprised to see me. </sentence><sentence id="140">I was in this hospital for 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="141">The hospital chaplain, who was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of bicycles and he and I peddled each night into this little village where he had met a French couple, and we played bridge in French, which was fun. </sentence><sentence id="142">Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to work. </sentence><sentence id="143">So I...uh...was put onto a troop train headed for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="144">Typical 40 and 8 box car and I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me, and then I was standing at the entrance to this box car waiting for the train to start and some sergeant was walking up and down yelling, "Who can talk French? </sentence><sentence id="145">Who knows some French?" </sentence><sentence id="146">So, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... "Will some French do?" </sentence><sentence id="147">And he says, "Three words will do. </sentence><sentence id="148">And Colonel needs a French translator." </sentence><sentence id="149">So I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because he was in the transportation corps running these troop trains which didn't require much military skill. </sentence><sentence id="150">And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his car which was not a box car. </sentence><sentence id="151">It was a heated Pullman car and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going into France. </sentence><sentence id="152">Uh...My job was every time the...uh... train stopped to tear up to the other end to the engineer and ask him what was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="153">And he told me, "Signal." ( </sentence><sentence id="154">laughing) Every time, it was "Red Signal. </sentence><sentence id="155">I can't go." </sentence><sentence id="156">And I went back and told the Colonel who was quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="157">I had lots of bad books to read. </sentence><sentence id="158">I had a fine, fine trip into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="159">Uh...wasn't wanted in Germany at that time. </sentence><sentence id="160">No one knew what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="161">I was moved back to a town in Belgium called Verea, and...uh...as a casual. </sentence><sentence id="162">I did not have an assignment. </sentence><sentence id="163">And then V.E. day came, and we celebrated V.E. day by going from our camp which was outside Verea into Verea to watch the celebration and to celebrate. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was depressed. </sentence><sentence id="165">I didn't feel like celebrating. </sentence><sentence id="166">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="167">I...Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to celebrate as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="168">The world was over, but in the square in Verea, I saw some men and women in concentration camp uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="169">Clearly! </sentence><sentence id="170">Uh...I knew what they were, and they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them. </sentence><sentence id="171">They recognized my insignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into. </sentence><sentence id="172">They were Buchenwald graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust whom I met. </sentence><sentence id="173">Uh... They didn't want anything. </sentence><sentence id="174">I didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh... But we talked, and...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories. </sentence><sentence id="176">They were followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years. </sentence><sentence id="177">I did get an assignment to 22nd Corps Headquarters in the Rhineland. </sentence><sentence id="178">Our town was Hildan, not to far from Cologne, and I moved in. </sentence><sentence id="179">Large territory, all of the Rhineland, including Cologne. </sentence><sentence id="180">A lot of troops. </sentence><sentence id="181">Theoretically, we were conducting services for all those troops. </sentence><sentence id="182">I got a jeep and went to work. </sentence><sentence id="183">Early discovered that a lot of German Jews and a lot of East European Jews had come into the area not in displaced persons camps, but living on their own where they could find a place to live, which many of them could not do. </sentence><sentence id="184">So I began to do three things. </sentence><sentence id="185">First of all to push military government to find housing for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income and they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a UNRRA installation. </sentence><sentence id="186">And...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing concentration camp uniforms, and that was not a very good idea. </sentence><sentence id="187">Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted of a gang coming together. </sentence><sentence id="188">There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to them,...uh... "Anybody need to say cottage, ...uh...there was frequently somebody who needed to say cottage, so we had a short service cottage, and then I said, "Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="189">We need food. </sentence><sentence id="190">Let's go get it." </sentence><sentence id="191">And after the first time in each of these installations, anybody who could beg, borrow or steal a truck...uh...came with truck, and we went to army depots and we got food. </sentence><sentence id="192">Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it. </sentence><sentence id="193">I have often had a nightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will some day. </sentence><sentence id="194">My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...1 know that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in France in World War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had signed a memorandum receipt for in France, and had never turned in. ... </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh...Actually, he had turned it in, but the Army didn't think so. </sentence><sentence id="196">So he had a correspondence with the army for many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so someday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it. </sentence><sentence id="197">We just stole it. </sentence><sentence id="198">And there were millions of tons of supplies stashed in depots around the area and...uh...they should be used. </sentence><sentence id="199">And they were. </sentence><sentence id="200">We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="201">Couldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear. </sentence><sentence id="202">There were socks. </sentence><sentence id="203">There were shoes. </sentence><sentence id="204">There were jackets and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="205">So, we were starting a pretty good system going when orders came out moving us. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh... The British were taking over our area. </sentence><sentence id="207">There had been negotiations and most of the Rhineland became British zone. </sentence><sentence id="208">And in typical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was Plezn, Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="209">We packed up and we started across Germany. </sentence><sentence id="210">Before that happened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I decided that I better do something in this part of Germany that needed doing for me. </sentence><sentence id="211">I went to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="212">Took a 3 day pass and took my jeep and went down to Dachau where Abe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto himself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing. </sentence><sentence id="213">Uh...My reaction to Dachau was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to Dachau to be. </sentence><sentence id="214">There was still 30 odd thousand Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="215">Some were dying each day cause there was no way for them to make it. </sentence><sentence id="216">Most of them were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="217">They didn't look like they were going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said they were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="218">Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he had this fine clothing for them. </sentence><sentence id="219">I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes out of a German Army warehouse just by going in, opening the doors, and taking them. </sentence><sentence id="220">And...uh...Every day he had people to bury. </sentence><sentence id="221">I...uh...often have said to people who are skeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off approximately how many...uh...feet of space it takes in full directions to make a rectangle that would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them. </sentence><sentence id="222">Uh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back. </sentence><sentence id="223">On the way to Czechoslovakia, we went through Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="224">And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the Germans didn't know about concentration camps cause when we went into the marvelous old town of Yana, and into the wonderful former capitol of the German Republic of Weimar, I saw smoke. </sentence><sentence id="225">And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not the...uh...crematorium fires, but the fires at the Buchenwald concentration camp where there were still people. </sentence><sentence id="226">You could see them. </sentence><sentence id="227">They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of those two towns. </sentence><sentence id="228">I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right way during those years...uh...you could smell Buchenwald without any trouble. </sentence><sentence id="229">We got to Plzen, and I settled into my room, and to my office. </sentence><sentence id="230">Uh... Two things happened in fairly short order, one of which is...uh...just of historic interest. </sentence><sentence id="231">The other of which transformed my life. </sentence><sentence id="232">I'll do the easy one first. </sentence><sentence id="233">I got a phone call. </sentence><sentence id="234">It was the Bishop of Plzen, a Catholic Bishop who told me his name, which I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="235">And I said to him, "Sir, I.. (You see he had some English)...that you want my Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun," and he said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="236">You're the Rabbi, aren't you?" </sentence><sentence id="237">And I said, "Yes Sir." </sentence><sentence id="238">And he said, "You're the man I want to come to see, he said, "You don't have to come out here." </sentence><sentence id="239">It was a couple of miles from us to the center of town where the cathedral was. " </sentence><sentence id="240">I am coming down this evening. </sentence><sentence id="241">I'll stop in." </sentence><sentence id="242">And I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="243">And I met for the first time a bishop who looked like a bishop. </sentence><sentence id="244">You know, the long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the whole business, and he greeted me very warmly and said that he wanted to take me somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="245">Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...it will be a great relief to one of his parishioners if I would go with him. </sentence><sentence id="246">I said, "Alright," and we made a date for the next afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="247">We went into the old part of Plzen, which is centuries old. </sentence><sentence id="248">These wonderful 4 and 5 story apartment buildings, which looked like a slum on the outside and are often very nice on the inside, and I was introduced to a man named Snyder, an engineer, who told me the following story. </sentence><sentence id="249">In the building in which he lived, a neighbor had been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the congregation in Plzen. </sentence><sentence id="250">The synagogue, by the way, was still standing. </sentence><sentence id="251">We cleaned it out. </sentence><sentence id="252">It had been made a warehouse, of course, by the Germans, and it was rededicated and used by the Jews who happened to be in Plzen during that time. </sentence><sentence id="253">It may still be used. </sentence><sentence id="254">I have no idea. ( </sentence><sentence id="255">Sigh) Rabbi Katz and Mr. Snyder, became very close friends because they both had an interest in French impressionist paintings, and they both collected what they could afford to collect. </sentence><sentence id="256">In 1938, when the Nazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, "They are going to take our pictures because they want paintings. </sentence><sentence id="257">They steal paintings. </sentence><sentence id="258">Let's hide them. </sentence><sentence id="259">Snyder, being an engineer, was ingenious, and he took his living room which was 40 feet long, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="260">One of these European saloon-type rooms, and he built a fake wall 3 feet in from the regular wall, and that wall was covered with book shelves and other nice things, with one a typical spring door. </sentence><sentence id="261">He took me inside, and there were all the paintings which they had stashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his. </sentence><sentence id="262">His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that, obviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings would be his...his paintings. </sentence><sentence id="263">If he did not come back, all the paintings would be Snyder's. </sentence><sentence id="264">Uh...He also left some books, and that's why the Bishop had taken me. </sentence><sentence id="265">His most precious books. </sentence><sentence id="266">Rabbi Katz was killed in Auschwitz, his whole family, so there was nobody to inherit either the paintings or the books. </sentence><sentence id="267">And I took the books at Snyder's request. </sentence><sentence id="268">An interesting group of 4, 5 books. </sentence><sentence id="269">Not his library, just the books he cared most about. </sentence><sentence id="270">One 2 volume set turns out to be precious. </sentence><sentence id="271">It's now in the rare book room of our seminary in Cincinnati. </sentence><sentence id="272">It's one of two copies of this 1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classics... uh...in the whole world. </sentence><sentence id="273">The other one is at Oxford. </sentence><sentence id="274">Uh... There were some German poems, beautiful edition, which I gave to Sylvia. </sentence><sentence id="275">We'll come across Sylvia shortly, and...uh...a Hebrew New Testament, 17th Century, which I gave to the Bishop. </sentence><sentence id="276">And...uh...for myself, I kept and sent home an album of Visidor Kaufman, a prince. </sentence><sentence id="277">Visidor Kaufman was a fine classical Jewish painter of the beginning of the 20th century who was himself Austrian and got interested in East European types. </sentence><sentence id="278">And his paintings of East European Jews and East European scenes are classics. </sentence><sentence id="279">And...uh...I have been distributing those to friends, and I have one or two of them. </sentence><sentence id="280">That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books. </sentence><sentence id="281">The same day there was a knock on my door and a little woman walked in, in an American Red Cross uniform. </sentence><sentence id="282">Uh...Sylvia was maybe 5 feet tall, a skinny little thing, very good looking, about 10 years older than I, and she told me the following story. </sentence><sentence id="283">She was a social worker who had been part of the social work department at Steven Wise Free Synagogue, which was then just called Free Synagogue because Steven Wise was still living. </sentence><sentence id="284">And she had worked for Wises, and told wonderful stories about Steven Wise. </sentence><sentence id="285">When America got into the war, he said to her, "You have to go into the Red Cross." </sentence><sentence id="286">And she said, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="287">To feed donuts to G.L."s?" </sentence><sentence id="288">And he said, "Yes, because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas, and you are going to be able to help Jews. </sentence><sentence id="289">There will be survivors, and they are going to need all kinds of help and you're just the type to do it." </sentence><sentence id="290">He was right. </sentence><sentence id="291">She was just the type. </sentence><sentence id="292">She got into the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="293">She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first concentration camps in France...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids who survived, and that was the transport that went to Palestine legally...uh...after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="294">She landed in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="295">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="296">And was the director of the Red Cross club in downtown Plzen. </sentence><sentence id="297">She had four other women working with her. </sentence><sentence id="298">And from early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and talked and chatted with American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="299">Then they closed up for the night, and they opened the back door and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="300">Uh...Sylvia asked me if I wanted to help Jews. </sentence><sentence id="301">Since that's why I went to Europe, I agreed "Yal," and...uh...asked her what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="302">She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade group which was in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="303">They had been attached to the British army in Italy, had fought through the war, and at the end of the war were in town called Trevisio, way up in the Italian Alps. </sentence><sentence id="304">Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent ambulances and they sent trucks over the hills into Austria and they began to move Jews into Italy to get on ships, illegal of course, to go to Palestine, and would I help with this enterprise? </sentence><sentence id="305">We could send Jews from Czechoslovakia into Austria and the Brigade would pick them up and take them to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="306">That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year old kid. </sentence><sentence id="307">Cops and robbers! </sentence><sentence id="308">And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the American zone of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="309">Actually, it was out of all of Czechoslovakia, because at that point the border between the American zone and the Russian zone was an open border. </sentence><sentence id="310">We were still friendly. </sentence><sentence id="311">We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="312">So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in Czechoslovakia I wanted to go for my purposes. </sentence><sentence id="313">And...uh...two things happened. </sentence><sentence id="314">First, Sylvia and I went over to Prague. </sentence><sentence id="315">There were 6,000 Jews in the Rothchild Hospital there without a place to go, and new people were coming in all the time. </sentence><sentence id="316">Some from Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="317">First time I had heard of Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="318">Others from further East coming West because they had no intentions of living in the East. </sentence><sentence id="319">Uh...Poland was not a place for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="320">Uh...They didn't want to live in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="321">They didn't want to Czech. </sentence><sentence id="322">They didn't want to live in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="323">They wanted out. </sentence><sentence id="324">And they would come to a Jewish center hoping that somebody would have some ideas about how to get out. </sentence><sentence id="325">They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very important function. </sentence><sentence id="326">We'll talk about that some more when we come back to Abe Klausner. </sentence><sentence id="327">We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the Rothchild Hospital to...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the city of Plzen. </sentence><sentence id="328">From Prague to Plzen is only about 40 or 50 miles. </sentence><sentence id="329">The only way to get there is by train. </sentence><sentence id="330">We then proceeded to type one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person to travel from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for relatives. </sentence><sentence id="331">We looked around Plzen for the biggest stamp we could find. </sentence><sentence id="332">I haven't any idea what it was about, but we found one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this thing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document. </sentence><sentence id="333">And...uh...We would collect them when the people came into Plzen and then take them back to Prague because I could travel. </sentence><sentence id="334">And...uh...leave them at our Headquarters, hospital and a new group would come. </sentence><sentence id="335">Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time. </sentence><sentence id="336">We didn't want large groups taking over trains, so they came in every day. </sentence><sentence id="337">And they reported to us at the Red Cross Club after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov displaced persons camp which was just on the edge of Plzen. </sentence><sentence id="338">It was an UNRRA camp. </sentence><sentence id="339">We were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="340">I went out to the camp to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some time in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="341">His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, "Tell me. </sentence><sentence id="342">Does the C stand for Carnegie?," </sentence><sentence id="343">and he said, "How do you know?" </sentence><sentence id="344">I said, "Because anybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that your middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from Pittsburgh." </sentence><sentence id="345">And he said, "Amazing." </sentence><sentence id="346">I said, "Yal, So am I." And we talked and he said, "Lipman. </sentence><sentence id="347">Lipman. </sentence><sentence id="348">Is your old man a jeweler?" </sentence><sentence id="349">And I said, "Yal." </sentence><sentence id="350">And he said, "I bought my wedding ring from him." </sentence><sentence id="351">His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his camp..We used for transportation to Austria and the answer was U.S. Army trucks. </sentence><sentence id="352">And who drove them? </sentence><sentence id="353">U.S. Army personnel. </sentence><sentence id="354">Why did they do it? </sentence><sentence id="355">Scotch. </sentence><sentence id="356">And some money. </sentence><sentence id="357">We did not want people doing us favors. </sentence><sentence id="358">We were commercial. </sentence><sentence id="359">Uh...We made a trip down to the Austrian border and made the discovery that the only bridge across the Danu...Australian Rivers that we knew about was a military bridge and we weren't about to use that. </sentence><sentence id="360">So we went down the road looking for a way to get across that blasted river, and we found one. </sentence><sentence id="361">It was an old dam no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide enough at the top for an Army 6-pods to get across with about 6 inches of play on each side. </sentence><sentence id="362">And that's the one we used. </sentence><sentence id="363">We went across the dam into Austria and found our way either to Lintz or to Gratz or to Saltsport, depending on whether the Brigade told us to bring this bunch of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="364">Others, it worked. </sentence><sentence id="365">But I have to tell you where we got the liquor because that involves one of my more favorite memories. </sentence><sentence id="366">I was entitled to a few bottles of Scotch a week as a...I was a Captain by then. </sentence><sentence id="367">That wasn't enough because we needed at least a dozen to 20 trucks or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="368">Uh...One of the breaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this... Massel is not to be considered a minor thing. </sentence><sentence id="369">The...uh...sergeant in charge of our motor pool at Corps Headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="370">Now Corps Headquarters has a lot of trucks. </sentence><sentence id="371">It just does. </sentence><sentence id="372">Uh...Corps a big thing. </sentence><sentence id="373">Was a sergeant named Katz, and he was from Brooklyn, and Sergeant Katz and I made a deal that he would get truck drivers for me and trucks and we would pay with money and Scotch. </sentence><sentence id="374">As I recall, it was 2 bottles per round trip or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="375">But where the Hell do you get Scotch in that kind of quantity? </sentence><sentence id="376">And I decided to take a real risk. </sentence><sentence id="377">I went to my senior chaplain, a Presbyterian from Kansas, Bird Colonel, full Colonel, but not regular army. </sentence><sentence id="378">He was a reservist. </sentence><sentence id="379">A very, quiet, pleasant man. </sentence><sentence id="380">He said to me, "You know, I haven't asked you any questions, but you travel a lot more than is comfortable for the Chief of Staff." </sentence><sentence id="381">Cause I was going to all the Jewish camps and communities and people I could find all over Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="382">I was also going to Theresienstadt by then. </sentence><sentence id="383">We haven't come to Theresienstadt yet. </sentence><sentence id="384">And he said...uh...Chief of Staff has asked...has asked me about this and I said I would investigate it." </sentence><sentence id="385">He said, "I can cover for you if I know where you are going. </sentence><sentence id="386">And you haven't any reason to tell me where you are going, but you will have to or I can't cover for you with the Chief of Staff," who is after all a 2-star General. </sentence><sentence id="387">I said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="388">I'll make a deal with you. </sentence><sentence id="389">When I leave each day, I will put under your blotter a statement of where I am going, from town to town to town each day, and then I'll give you my trip ticket. </sentence><sentence id="390">And you validate it if you chose to do so." </sentence><sentence id="391">He said, "Of course, I chose to do so. </sentence><sentence id="392">I know what you're doing and you got to do it." </sentence><sentence id="393">He did not know that we were taking Jews to Austria, but he knew I was working with Jewish displaced persons and he thought that was absolutely essential. </sentence><sentence id="394">Bless him, said I. He says, "Anything else I can do for you?" </sentence><sentence id="395">And I said, "Yal. </sentence><sentence id="396">You're a Bird Colonel. </sentence><sentence id="397">You get all the liquor you want, don't you?" </sentence><sentence id="398">He said, "I wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="399">I don't drink." </sentence><sentence id="400">I said, "I knew that, but you're about to." </sentence><sentence id="401">And he listened and he said a couple of people in supply are going to be awfully (laughing) surprised. </sentence><sentence id="402">I said, "You don't have to explain what you're doing with it. </sentence><sentence id="403">It's for charitable purposes that you getting into Protestant charities in Czechoslovakia which is your bound duty as a Christian." </sentence><sentence id="404">And he smiled and he thought that made sense, and I got all the liquor I wanted from then on, on his tab. </sentence><sentence id="405">Bless his heart. </sentence><sentence id="406">I was...I heard of his death in the early 50s, and I was very sorry. </sentence><sentence id="407">He was a good, good man. </sentence><sentence id="408">He saved my life, and saved Jews. </sentence><sentence id="409">That operation worked very well until August when...uh...we got caught in one of the Austria towns. </sentence><sentence id="410">Red handed! </sentence><sentence id="411">The whole bunch of us! </sentence><sentence id="412">We had not yet transferred these people to the Jewish Brigade...uh...and we got picked up. </sentence><sentence id="413">And I got terrible reaming from a General who announced me that he was going to radio my General immediately, and I would be court-martialed. </sentence><sentence id="414">And...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me. </sentence><sentence id="415">General Hubner, who was known as the little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="416">He didn't want Jews in his territory. </sentence><sentence id="417">I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only displaced persons who were difficult. </sentence><sentence id="418">All other displaced persons, and there were 20 some nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the Germans imported for labor purposes. </sentence><sentence id="419">They were grateful for being alive, for being fed by UNRRA where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were no hurry to go home. </sentence><sentence id="420">The Jews were not grateful. </sentence><sentence id="421">The Jews were in terrible conflict over being alive, over having survived. </sentence><sentence id="422">They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they wanted out, and nobody would let them out. </sentence><sentence id="423">And so they caused more trouble than everybody else put together. </sentence><sentence id="424">Some of us understood it. </sentence><sentence id="425">We tried to organize it so that it wasn't too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="426">In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that we always have. </sentence><sentence id="427">For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was was in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted everything. </sentence><sentence id="428">It was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="429">And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think that should be understandable that they were not. </sentence><sentence id="430">So General Hubnere said, "Get them out of here. </sentence><sentence id="431">I don't care." </sentence><sentence id="432">He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved. </sentence><sentence id="433">One incident will illustrate this. </sentence><sentence id="434">He called Sylvia and me in one day. </sentence><sentence id="435">Now I had never met General Hubner. </sentence><sentence id="436">Uh...Captains don't monkey around much with 3-star generals. </sentence><sentence id="437">There are layers of bureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cross women don't have a lot to do with Generals, though Sylvia had had more to do with Hubner than most because she was always making demands. </sentence><sentence id="438">Sylvia was a tough, tough lady. </sentence><sentence id="439">And Sylvia told the General...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to monkey with the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="440">He needed the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="441">Those donuts were very precious. </sentence><sentence id="442">Donuts and coffee kept American troops going. </sentence><sentence id="443">Uh...He called us in and said, "I hear there is going to be a Jewish meeting in London to talk about the future of all these Jews." </sentence><sentence id="444">And we said, "Yep." </sentence><sentence id="445">And he said, "You're going. </sentence><sentence id="446">You go my plane. </sentence><sentence id="447">When does the meeting start?" </sentence><sentence id="448">And we told and he said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="449">Two days before that, get out there and tell them for me to get all these Jews out of here. </sentence><sentence id="450">They should do everything they can do to get them out fast. </sentence><sentence id="451">It's not good for them and it is not good for us either." </sentence><sentence id="452">And he said it not unkindly, but he wasn't smiling. </sentence><sentence id="453">And Sylvia and I flew to London to the special Zionist Congress that was called in July in London, the chief purpose of which was to set the course that would lead to...uh...Israel's independence 3 years later, which meant that Ben-Gurion had a fight with Wietzman and Ben-Gurion wiped up the floor with Wietzman in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which, for me, is pretty unforgettable. </sentence><sentence id="454">Uh...What did he say? </sentence><sentence id="455">He did what Ben-Gurion always did. </sentence><sentence id="456">Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first to tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way up. </sentence><sentence id="457">Sometimes I felt like he was going it minute by minute. </sentence><sentence id="458">Four hours was not his longest speech. </sentence><sentence id="459">Uh...He has made longer. </sentence><sentence id="460">And then rehearsing the Zionist movement from Belu all the way up...uh...and then minute by minute the events of World War II, subjectively stated so that Wietzman looked like an idiot who played the British and he was the savior who was going to see to it that we had a Jewish State. </sentence><sentence id="461">And they believed him. </sentence><sentence id="462">And Wietzman was really not in condition to do a proper answer. </sentence><sentence id="463">Wietzman aged 10 years in 5 days, and he became the old man, the inevitable person to the first President of the State. </sentence><sentence id="464">Powerless and ceremonial. </sentence><sentence id="465">That's what Wietzman became as of that day. </sentence><sentence id="466">Ben- Gurion became the leader of the Zionist movement. </sentence><sentence id="467">Uh...Sylvia and I did not spend much time in sessions. </sentence><sentence id="468">We spent our time meeting people that Steven Wise told us to meet to tell them about Czechoslovakia, to tell them about displaced persons, to tell them about the Haganah, and to urge certain kinds of support, none of which we had yet gotten. </sentence><sentence id="469">I met some fascinating people. </sentence><sentence id="470">Uh...I discovered this Lord Reading. </sentence><sentence id="471">Rufus Isaacs had gout, and that Lady Reading was really a lady and as passionate about...uh...Jewish things as any convert could be and...uh...all the leaders of the Zionist movement wanted to hear from us. </sentence><sentence id="472">We were the only people there from the occupied territories. </sentence><sentence id="473">That is, from Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria. </sentence><sentence id="474">Nobody else there. </sentence><sentence id="475">Because nobody could get there. </sentence><sentence id="476">It never occurred to them for some reason or other to send some displaced persons over to tell the thing first person. </sentence><sentence id="477">There wasn't a single one there. </sentence><sentence id="478">So we were busy. </sentence><sentence id="479">And the General made that possible because that's how he wanted to get rid of the Jews. ( </sentence><sentence id="480">Laughter) Benevolently! </sentence><sentence id="481">So he did not court martial me. </sentence><sentence id="482">He called me in. </sentence><sentence id="483">Actually, it was the Chief Staff who called me in and said, "We got this TWX from Austria." " </sentence><sentence id="484">Yes, Sir." " </sentence><sentence id="485">What the Hell have you been up to?" " </sentence><sentence id="486">TWX tells you what I have been up to." " </sentence><sentence id="487">We can't allow this." </sentence><sentence id="488">I said, "No, I suppose not. </sentence><sentence id="489">What'll you do." </sentence><sentence id="490">He said, "We're moving you so you can't do it." </sentence><sentence id="491">Alright, that was fine. </sentence><sentence id="492">Sylvia could keep the thing going and then other people took over. </sentence><sentence id="493">So far as I know some transports continued to go until the communists took over Czechoslovakia. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="917">A: Yal. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="918">A: When I got to Prague the first time, I discovered there had been a concentration camp at Theresienstadt, or as the Czechs call it Terezin, north and a little bit west of Prague. </sentence><sentence id="919">So I went there. </sentence><sentence id="920">There was still 16,000 Jews there with a Russian unit...uh...running the camp because it was in a Russian zone. </sentence><sentence id="921">And...uh...Theresienstadt was exactly what...uh...all the pictures have ever shown it to be. </sentence><sentence id="922">It was an army barracks...uh...and wasn't bad, because Theresienstadt, I remind you, was the show-off concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="923">That was the place that the Red Cross came to. </sentence><sentence id="924">The International Red Cross was not exactly heroic during World War II, but they would go to Theresienstadt and make inspection...inspections and then send out a report saying the concentration camp was fine. </sentence><sentence id="925">They had a band and gave concerts and they had classes and they did all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="926">What they didn't say is that everyday transports left for the east and that none of those people survived. </sentence><sentence id="927">Leo Beck had survived by accident, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="928">There was somebody else named Beck in the camp, and they got mixed up and they sent that Beck off to East instead of Leo Beck. </sentence><sentence id="929">Leo Beck had left by the time I got there. </sentence><sentence id="930">The Russians had flown him into the British zone, and the British had flown him to London where his only child, a daughter, lived. </sentence><sentence id="931">And...uh...We proceeded, the Russian and I, to make a very simple deal. </sentence><sentence id="932">He wanted to close the camp. </sentence><sentence id="933">We wanted to close the camp. </sentence><sentence id="934">UNRRA had agreed that they would take this people to a town called Begendorf in the American zone. </sentence><sentence id="935">It was just a case of getting them there, and I had trucks. </sentence><sentence id="936">So we made a deal to move all the Jews out of Theresienstadt to Begendorf and here I have to tell you another one of those absolutely uncanny coincidences. </sentence><sentence id="937">All of our conferences, the camp commander and I, took place in the presence of a third person wearing a plain uniform who was the Commissar, the political leader, and he ran things. </sentence><sentence id="938">He sat there. </sentence><sentence id="939">Fortunately, he knew virtually no German. </sentence><sentence id="940">The only language the Commander and I had in common was German. </sentence><sentence id="941">Mine was fairly bad, and his was even worse. </sentence><sentence id="942">So we were talking German to each other, making ourselves understood and then I heard a word in a sentence that this man was saying, which was not German. </sentence><sentence id="943">It was a Yiddish word with a Hebrew origin. </sentence><sentence id="944">Aw, said I, He has just sent me a signal. </sentence><sentence id="945">So in my next paragraph, I carefully used a Yiddish word that had a Hebrew origin. </sentence><sentence id="946">Neither of us blinked an eye lash, but we both knew why he was going to work his head off to get those Jews out of there and he wanted me to know why. </sentence><sentence id="947">I had a Jewish camp commander. </sentence><sentence id="948">Never again in the whole time I was there...those...almost 3 months did he allude to it. </sentence><sentence id="949">We were never alone. </sentence><sentence id="950">The Commissar never let us alone. </sentence><sentence id="951">If I went there for lunch, the Commissar had lunch with us. </sentence><sentence id="952">He was with us every minute that I was in Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="953">Came the last day. </sentence><sentence id="954">The last transport leaving Theresienstadt for Dagendorf, trucks all lined up, my jeep ready, my driver excited, Vic, and...uh...suddenly was a scream toward the back of the transport, somebody yelling "Halt." </sentence><sentence id="955">And a woman, I remember her, a kind of heavy set lady climbed out of the truck and started to run toward one of the buildings. </sentence><sentence id="956">So we followed her, the Camp President and I. She went into the building. </sentence><sentence id="957">She went down some steps, around corners, down some more steps, way down into the bowels of the earth, and came to a...what looked like a piece of metal covering the wall, only it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="958">It was a door. </sentence><sentence id="959">And when we went through that door, we were in the Theresienstadt synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="960">And...uh...it had not been completely cleaned out. </sentence><sentence id="961">There were some things there, and we took them. </sentence><sentence id="962">One of the things was a Megillah, of Esther. </sentence><sentence id="963">And they wanted to give it to me, and I said, "No, that I thought it belonged to Leo Beck." </sentence><sentence id="964">Whether or not it was his, it should be his. </sentence><sentence id="965">They all agreed that was so. </sentence><sentence id="966">He was a hero in the camp, by the way, because he had organized all those classes. </sentence><sentence id="967">He had insisted after pulling his garbage truck all day that you could not let your mind go to waste, and he had organized what amounted to a university. </sentence><sentence id="968">Anybody who could teach anything taught it. </sentence><sentence id="969">And he taught it. </sentence><sentence id="970">And that was...uh...accepted by these people as terribly important. </sentence><sentence id="971">And so he was...there have...there has been some statements about Beck's status in the camp as being something less than heroic, but not in my conversations with people in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="972">They really respected this old man. </sentence><sentence id="973">So I said I would take it to him, that one way or another eventually I would be going to London or I'd send it or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="974">So when I went to the Zionist Congress in July, I took the Megillah with me, wrapped in a piece of plastic, and I called, spoke to his daughter and made an appointment to see him on a particular day I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="975">When I arrived, I was taken through the house to the back garden. </sentence><sentence id="976">It was a little back British gardens which are so nice. </sentence><sentence id="977">And...uh...Leo Beck was a bit of a ham, and my later experiences with him confirmed the fact that he was a bit of a ham. </sentence><sentence id="978">He was sitting...uh... reading something in profile. </sentence><sentence id="979">He had a marvelous profile, and the sun was shining directly on to him. ( </sentence><sentence id="980">Laughter) And we talked for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="981">I had to give him condolences. </sentence><sentence id="982">His niece...uh...had been killed in a truck accident on the way out of Theresienstadt, the only on toward thing that we had in our Theresienstadt transports. </sentence><sentence id="983">A truck slid into the ditch and she was killed. </sentence><sentence id="984">His great niece was okay though. </sentence><sentence id="985">Her daughter! </sentence><sentence id="986">And we talked about that for awhile, and this young lady's future and I gave him the Megillahe. </sentence><sentence id="987">And he looked at it, and he looked at it, and he said, "I don't want this." </sentence><sentence id="988">I said, "Why not? </sentence><sentence id="989">The people wanted you to have it." </sentence><sentence id="990">He said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="991">If I have it, it's a museum piece. </sentence><sentence id="992">The Megillah should not be a museum piece. </sentence><sentence id="993">It should be a living document. </sentence><sentence id="994">It should be read. </sentence><sentence id="995">It should be read by Jews. </sentence><sentence id="996">This one being the Theresienstadt Magila should be read under circumstances which connect the story of the Megillah with Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="997">You take it. </sentence><sentence id="998">Only you promise me that that's how it will be used." </sentence><sentence id="999">And I took it. </sentence><sentence id="1000">I had a box made for it by a Holocaust survivor when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="1001">Actually, I didn't have it made until I got to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And a woman named Friedal Blumenthal, a superb silversmith, made this box. </sentence><sentence id="1003">The box is teac and she has ornamented it with appropriate symbols and the fact that it's a Megillah of Theresien. </sentence><sentence id="1004">It is now going into its second generation. </sentence><sentence id="1005">When I retired, I gave it to my son who happens to be a Rabbi, and he uses it in his congregation and he has made a...an arrangement with the Holocaust Museum that it will be on display here for part of each year. </sentence><sentence id="1006">That's my first meeting with Leo Beck. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Later, he taught me. </sentence><sentence id="1008">He came to Cincinnati in 1948, and from 1948 until his death in 55, I think it was, he taught one semester each year at the college institute in Cincinnati and the rest of the year was in London where he lead the World Union For Progressive Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="1009">First rate lecturer and a bit of a ham. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Uh...Now where do we go from here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1106">Q: What I want to do from here is to go back? </sentence><sentence id="1107">Uh...I want to...I do not yet want to leave Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Uh...And I would like to know... You worked so closely with the Haganah, and you worked with Berichah. </sentence><sentence id="1109">I would like for you to talk a little bit about that. </sentence><sentence id="1110">Uh...Tell us who you worked with and what those relationships were like. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1122">A: The people I worked with were primarily my American truck drivers. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Andy Dunn and Faye Green at Camp Karlof...uh...I don't remember the names of anybody from the Rothchild Hospital, but there was an office there in which these documents...uh...which we did about 4 or 5 hundred eventually, these one-page things with the red stamp, that ..uh...got these people. </sentence><sentence id="1124">They never had trouble getting from Prague to Plzen traveling. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Even after the...uh...cold war was declared, and I had to go back roads my last couple of trips to Theresienstadt, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I could not just go across. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I had to go through a back road that I found to get to Theresin and then I could get to Prague and then I had to go back to my road to get back into the American zone because the Russians would no longer let us travel. </sentence><sentence id="1128">My 3"language pass was no longer acceptable. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Even after that, United Nations displaced persons traveling from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for relatives had no trouble getting through the border crossing at Brockisoni. </sentence><sentence id="1130">So I don't remember names very well. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I remember nobody from the Jewish Brigade group. </sentence><sentence id="1132">Sylvia had made contact with a man named, who had been a Captain in the Jewish Brigade, and , an attorney and I heard of him subsequent over the years. </sentence><sentence id="1133">I never met him. </sentence><sentence id="1134">So I had no dealings directly with him. </sentence><sentence id="1135">I dealt with whoever happened to come across with the ambulances or the trucks or the combination that was taking our people from the town in Austria across to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1136">It was pretty much a...uh...two-person operation, Sylvia and me. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Sylvia worked day and night. </sentence><sentence id="1138">She was absolutely incredible in that Red Cross thing of hers. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Her four people, the other women knew exactly what was going on, and they helped as much as they could. </sentence><sentence id="1140">They wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="1141">They were nice, healthy American kids who...uh...got a little bit bored listening to G.I. stories from 9 o'clock to 9 o'clock and handing out donuts and coffee, which is all Red Cross...un...canteens served. </sentence><sentence id="1142">They got tired making those donuts too. </sentence><sentence id="1143">So...uh...I didn't have a great many...uh....Berichah contacts then. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Later it...uh...it changed drastically. </sentence><sentence id="1145">But, the Czechoslovakia thing was pretty much as I have described it. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Uh...One ...uh...group of people I really have to mention because they become so important to me. </sentence><sentence id="1147">Shortly after we got to Czechoslovakia, I kept hearing about places where there were Jews and that's why the Chaplain had such trouble with my trip tickets because I went to all these places. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And incidentally managed to show up at all the American Headquarters I was supposed to go to. </sentence><sentence id="1149">There was a town in, a town in the southern part of ... And I heard that there some Jewish girls there. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Women! </sentence><sentence id="1151">And I went down there, and sure enough, there were. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Nearly 400 of them in a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1153">They had been in a labor camp in Germany and the Germans who were really suicidal about Jews had put these women...more than 400, nearly a thousand.... on to a train and sent the train east. </sentence><sentence id="1154">Toward the end of the war, they did that with a lot of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Their minds, I think, going like...we don't want the Americans to find them. </sentence><sentence id="1156">It will be better for us if the Americans don't find them. </sentence><sentence id="1157">These women got as far as Suchita when they couldn't get any more fuel for the train. </sentence><sentence id="1158">So the engineer abandoned the train, and there they were. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Somebody opened it up because they heard screams presumably, and they buried the dead and put the rest of them into this hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I went there and met these women. </sentence><sentence id="1161">They wanted a service, so we had services, after which one young woman came up to me, introduced herself in quite good English, told me that she and her three sisters and three of their friends, all from Krakow, had been together through the war. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Turns out that she mama'd this group and saved them through the war. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And...uh...they wanted to get out of the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1164">Was there any place they could live?Because she had been offered a job with UNRRA, and one of the others was going to this, one of the others was going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1165">They all had plans for living in Suchison, so we got them a house. </sentence><sentence id="1166">And...uh...they became my kids. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Uh... The word kid is funny because Erna is really only about 5 years younger than I am, and the man she married was older than I. But...uh...They're my kinds. </sentence><sentence id="1168">A little later...uh...the job situation was such that they would do better in the Bavarian town of Tishinroit, so they were moved to a house in Tishinroit, where they lived until they came to...well, 1946, Bronya, now Betty, married Henry and they moved to Australia where his only living relative was, and they are still there and we still correspond. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I have not seen them since 1946. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Uh...Dora, who was the housekeeper....she was the domesticated one of this crowd...married Borrof, and they disappeared in the wilds of Brooklyn, where he is a Hasid and does not permit his wife to have much to do with the rest of us. </sentence><sentence id="1171">But Dora manages to call Erna periodically to make sure everybody is alright and to send her love. </sentence><sentence id="1172">The other five have been together constantly ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1173">They all came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1174">They all married. </sentence><sentence id="1175">Two of them...three of them married in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1176">I officiated at all three marriages. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And...uh...some of the kids were born in Tirsenroit, including a pair of twins, who are now both M.D., Ph. </sentence><sentence id="1178">Ds doing extraordinary work. </sentence><sentence id="1179">Uh...They've remained my family to this day. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Uh...Interestingly enough, the one who was not their sister..-uh...married their uncle. </sentence><sentence id="1181">They had a very uncle, and Maguska married him. </sentence><sentence id="1182">So we've been through a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Births, Bar Mitzvah and a couple of deaths. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Remarkably few deaths, I am glad to say. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And we are still in routine communication. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Uh...Erna's marriage was rather miraculous because in the concentration camp, she had met a woman who had said to her that she was absolutely perfect as a mate for her son. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And after the war she married that son, a physician who had a successful practice in Syracuse. </sentence><sentence id="1188">The coincidences are such. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Anyhow, that's my ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1260">Q: We need to break tape. </sentence><sentence id="1261">Let's change tapes at this point. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1262">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Uh...We are still in Czechoslovakia, and you said there was a story that you wanted to tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1266">A: Not everything that happened in Czechoslovakia (clearing throat) or anywhere else was upbeat. </sentence><sentence id="1267">There were problems. </sentence><sentence id="1268">There were tragedies and there were horrors. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Uh...I'll tell you a horror story just because it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1270">The Karlov camp was our salvation, but there were problems there too. </sentence><sentence id="1271">One middle of the night, I got a frantic call from Andy Dunn to come out immediately, so I went over to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1272">It seems...uh...a Kapo had turned up in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1273">A Kapo was a Jew who worked for the Germans or Poles in the concentration camp, and if the Jews hated anybody more than they hated Germans and Poles and other people, they hated Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Somebody recognized this Kapo in Karlov that night, and they had killed him and they just tossed his body over the fence outside the camp, and the body had been found. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And poor Andy didn't know what to do with a dead Kapo, and that was understandable. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And...uh...It seemed to me that to inform the Czech authorities was a bad idea. </sentence><sentence id="1277">So we just buried the guy. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And...uh...he, like many other Jews, lies in an unmarked grave. </sentence><sentence id="1279">My own feelings that night made that one of the low points of the entire 3 year experience in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Uh...It's not my only Kapo experience. </sentence><sentence id="1281">We had another one, but...that Jews could kill somebody, another Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1282">No matter how terrible the other Jew was, with no due process of any kind, outraged me and upset me and scared me. </sentence><sentence id="1283">But...uh..it was another lesson to be learned. </sentence><sentence id="1284">Let's go from that to a birth. </sentence><sentence id="1285">A woman came to Sylvia, Hungarian Jewish girl who was very pregnant and who didn't want the baby. </sentence><sentence id="1286">The father of the baby was a concentration camp guard. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Following liberation she had met a man, a Hungarian, who wanted to marry her, only he wouldn't marry her with the baby. </sentence><sentence id="1288">It didn't bother him that she was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="1289">After all, she had nothing to do with that really, but...uh... he wasn't going to raise that child and neither was she. </sentence><sentence id="1290">What should we do with this baby about to be born? </sentence><sentence id="1291">Sylvia said, "Give it to me. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I will somehow get it to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1293">I have a sister who does not have children. </sentence><sentence id="1294">That will be her child." </sentence><sentence id="1295">And on June 1...July 1...July 1, 1945, this baby was born. </sentence><sentence id="1296">A little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And the doctor who delivered her, I remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Interestingly enough his son, who was very young at the time, became my friend because of this incident and the son died in California just about 2 weeks ago to my sorrow. </sentence><sentence id="1299">Uh...Here was this baby. </sentence><sentence id="1300">The mother agreed that she would keep the child until she was ready to leave for Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Five days later she came into the club after 10 o'clock one night and said, "I can't do this. </sentence><sentence id="1302">I have no interest in this baby. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Why should I waste time looking after this kid? </sentence><sentence id="1304">Here." </sentence><sentence id="1305">And handed a baby to Sylvia. </sentence><sentence id="1306">Sylvia and four Red Cross girls found themselves the mother of a 5 day old baby, and I became it's sort of surrogate father. </sentence><sentence id="1307">The child lived in the Red Cross Club. </sentence><sentence id="1308">The five women took care of her. </sentence><sentence id="1309">The...uh...story of how we found... Well, bottles were easy. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Coke bottles worked fine. </sentence><sentence id="1311">You sterilize a coke bottle, and we had lots of coke bottles around. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Nipples were harder to find. </sentence><sentence id="1313">It took almost a whole day of tearing around Czechoslovakia until we found one nipple for this kid that would fit a coke bottle. </sentence><sentence id="1314">That's part of the problem. ( </sentence><sentence id="1315">Laughter) It was big enough for a calf as a matter of fact, but the baby thrived on it which is what mattered. </sentence><sentence id="1316">We had no trouble with the other necessities for a young baby. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And then in very dramatic fashion...uh...Sylvia had to come home on emergency in the summer of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1318">Her father was desperately sick and did, in fact, die. </sentence><sentence id="1319">So she got emergency leave to go home and she packed up the baby in a bed roll and took her along with her. </sentence><sentence id="1320">When she got to Scotland to get on the Transatlantic plane they wanted...uh...baby's not on the manifest. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And Sylvia said, "Who puts 2 month old babies on a manifest?" " </sentence><sentence id="1322">Where did you get the child." " </sentence><sentence id="1323">It's my child. </sentence><sentence id="1324">I had a baby." </sentence><sentence id="1325">And she bluffed her way through immigration into the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And her sister got the child and the child is, I understand, very healthy and alive. </sentence><sentence id="1327">We changed her birthdate. </sentence><sentence id="1328">On the birth certificate, which...uh...happened under extreme circumstances also, it must have been...oh...a year later, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1329">No....a year and a half later, I got a frantic letter from the child's mother saying, "We're trying to complete the adoption and the court will not put through the adoption without a birth certificate. </sentence><sentence id="1330">Get me a birth certificate." </sentence><sentence id="1331">The communist had taken over in Czechoslovakia and I wasn't about to go to Plzen trying to get a birth certification. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So I went to my Commanding Officer and I said to him, "Colonel, is it true that all camp commanders and post commanders are notaries." " </sentence><sentence id="1333">Yes." " </sentence><sentence id="1334">Would you notarize a document for me?" " </sentence><sentence id="1335">Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1336">So in my name, I wrote a statement about the circumstances of this child's birth, never alluding to the child's name or mother because I wasn't going to lie...uh...not in a sworn affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="1337">I'm a funny American...uh...in view of the stories I am telling you, it sounds strange that I would lie in an affidavit, but I didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="1338">So I wrote it very carefully. </sentence><sentence id="1339">Told the circumstances of the child's birth and the movement to the United States, and...uh...civil affairs were not exactly in order Plzen in July of 1945 and there was no birth certificate, and would the court please accept this sworn affidavit in lieu of a birth certificate, and they did. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And so the adoption was completed. </sentence><sentence id="1341">Uh...That's one of my nice stories. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I hope you can get to Sylvia to get the rest of it because she tells it beautifully and I don't want to tell more because the young lady is around. </sentence><sentence id="1343">The young lady and I have no contact whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="1344">I have not tried to keep these kinds of contacts. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Let's now go to the USO. </sentence><sentence id="1347">We'll finish up Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1348">USO tours were very important, especially during the occupation period. </sentence><sentence id="1349">American soldiers were bored, and these entertainers came and...uh...you know, you've seen television pictures of Bob Hope and the crowd he gets. </sentence><sentence id="1350">Well, every group that came over, no matter how mediocre got this kind of reception. </sentence><sentence id="1351">I was called in by our special services officer in Plzen and asked if I could do them a favor. </sentence><sentence id="1352">I said, "What do you want?" </sentence><sentence id="1353">He said, "Well, we have a strange USO group coming over. </sentence><sentence id="1354">They have let it be known that they will not under any circumstances do the job they're being sent here to do, namely to entertain American troops, unless they can also go to Jewish displaced persons groups. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And they're important people. </sentence><sentence id="1356">So I want to indulge them. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Can you help me." </sentence><sentence id="1358">I said, "Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1359">I can help you. </sentence><sentence id="1360">I can make arrangement for concerts and appearances in Jewish DP camps."

to go to Paris." </sentence><sentence id="1785">He says, "I want to be at that service. </sentence><sentence id="1786">I ought to be there." </sentence><sentence id="1787">And I said, "Pava, you've earned the right. </sentence><sentence id="1788">Let's go." </sentence><sentence id="1789">So we went. </sentence><sentence id="1790">Snowed the whole bloody way across Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1791">We had to go by jeep. </sentence><sentence id="1792">There was no other way to go and...uh...it was not exactly a happy, happy ride, but we made it. </sentence><sentence id="1793">And one of the most frigid experiences of my entire life was that service at the Synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Not the atmosphere, but it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1795">There was no heat in this synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="1796">We were all sitting there in our gray coats, and Ben Gurion hung a on us. </sentence><sentence id="1797">He made a long, long speech. </sentence><sentence id="1798">I had been instructed by my Berichah people to see Ruth Kluger in Paris, at the Haganah office. </sentence><sentence id="1799">Haganah had an office in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1800">European headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="1801">So I wondered in there, and we were talking, Ruth and I, about what was going on in Germany and Czechoslovakia and what we needed and how we could do a better job of moving Jews when her phone rang. </sentence><sentence id="1802">And from the conversation at my...at our end, it was clear that she was talking to Judge Simon Riskin who had arrived...I don't remember how many weeks earlier...as the advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish Affairs, with a rank of Lieutenant General. </sentence><sentence id="1803">And they were talking about a deal which Ben Guron had made with Eisenhower just before Ben Guron came to Paris for the service. </sentence><sentence id="1804">The deal in which teachers would be sent from Palestine to the DP camps to teach Hebrew, to teach agronomy. </sentence><sentence id="1805">All of those teachers would be Haganah people, and the Army would try to turn its back to the maximum possible extent to let them operate. </sentence><sentence id="1806">Eisenhower asked one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1807">You will not bribe any American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1808">You will not corrupt my men. </sentence><sentence id="1809">I'll help you get around them, but you're not going through them. </sentence><sentence id="1810">And Ben-Gurion thought that made good sense. </sentence><sentence id="1811">So they wanted to get going. </sentence><sentence id="1812">The Army had an airplane ready to go to...uh...what is now Ben Guron airport, then called Lud to pick up the first group to bring them. </sentence><sentence id="1813">And it suddenly occurred to Judge Riskin that an American crew flying into Lud wouldn't know what to do with itself when it got there. </sentence><sentence id="1814">That some liaison person was necessary, and Ruth agreed that a liaison person was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="1815">And she looked at me and suddenly she said to Judge Riskin, "I think I have the person sitting right here. </sentence><sentence id="1816">Shall I put him on the phone." </sentence><sentence id="1817">And I introduced myself and Judge Riskine said, "If Ruth thinks you're the person to do this, then it's alright with me. </sentence><sentence id="1818">Can you be here tomorrow morning?" </sentence><sentence id="1819">I said, "If I drive all night, I can." </sentence><sentence id="1820">He said, "So drive all night." </sentence><sentence id="1821">Lieutenant Generals are like this, and Simon Riskin is like this too. </sentence><sentence id="1822">He's a very blunt...uh...guy who had given up a place on a Federal District bench, a life appointment, to take on this temporary thing, to work for Eisenhower and do Jewish things. </sentence><sentence id="1823">He was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1824">So I found Si with no trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1825">We had a terrible time finding our other driver who was carousing Paris, but we caught up with him and we loaded him in the back of the jeep because he couldn't drive and the two of us drove all night. </sentence><sentence id="1826">We reported to Judge Riskin in Frankfort the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="1827">Uh...the morning following that, I was on a B-17, with a crew of five Americans heading for... Uh...Bewildered. </sentence><sentence id="1828">Excited. </sentence><sentence id="1829">I had my orders from General Walter Bedel Smith, and they were for 7 days. </sentence><sentence id="1830">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1831">So I got into Delist. </sentence><sentence id="1832">Got to Jerusalem, and discovered nothing was ready. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Uh...Our Israel friends will all forgive me, but the Middle East is not exactly the most efficient place in the world to do business. </sentence><sentence id="1834">Not then and not now. </sentence><sentence id="1835">Uh...I went to meetings and tried to get things going. </sentence><sentence id="1836">There was no way to get those people out in 7 days. </sentence><sentence id="1837">But I got a lot of questions that had to be answered in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1838">So we flew back to Germany, went into conference with the various people at headquarters that were going to deal with this thing and...uh...got answers and flew back again. </sentence><sentence id="1839">I made two trips in about 2 weeks I guess it was. </sentence><sentence id="1840">My second trip was not long before Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="1841">And...uh...while we were getting my 14 people organized, a couple of incidents are worth mentioning. </sentence><sentence id="1842">First, my 7 day orders, the 7th day was a Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="1843">It was alright with me. </sentence><sentence id="1844">I was under military orders and you do things under military orders. </sentence><sentence id="1845">But 4 of my 14 teachers so-called were orthodox Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1846">They refused to fly on Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="1847">And I said, "What will give you permission to fly on Shabbat?" </sentence><sentence id="1848">And they said, "Written authorization from the Chief Rabbi." </sentence><sentence id="1849">I said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="1850">So I called the Chief Rabbi's office and I talked with a gentleman who is now the President of Israel, the Chief Rabbi's son, who was then his secretary. </sentence><sentence id="1851">I told him what I wanted and he laughed and he said, "All of us are gonna have fun with that one." </sentence><sentence id="1852">And...uh...he invited me for Shebot dinner and I didn't accept because I was having Shabbat dinner with the men who was really the political head of the Haganah, the first foreign minister of Israel, who I am delighted to say became Esther's and my very good friend. </sentence><sentence id="1853">Uh...We loved him dearly. </sentence><sentence id="1854">And I remember President Hertzog saying, isn't going to like that. </sentence><sentence id="1855">You don't turn down an invitation to the Rabbi's dish." </sentence><sentence id="1856">And I said, "One is also not rude. </sentence><sentence id="1857">One has to have . </sentence><sentence id="1858">And I had accepted another invitation. </sentence><sentence id="1859">Now would the Chief Rabbi call Sharet and give him reasons for me not to go to Sharet's for Shabbat dinner?" </sentence><sentence id="1860">He said, "No, the Chief Rabbi will not do that." </sentence><sentence id="1861">I said, "Fine. </sentence><sentence id="1862">You'll give my apologies to the Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="1863">I have no choice whatsoever." </sentence><sentence id="1864">But I went there late Friday afternoon, and the Rabbi's little synagogue and had an interview with him before . </sentence><sentence id="1865">His first question to me...he spoke Hebrew and English and Yiddish with an Irish accent. </sentence><sentence id="1866">He had been Chief Rabbi in Dublin before he went to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Charming, wonderful little man. </sentence><sentence id="1868">His first question to me was, "Is it true that you are Morris Neman's nephew?" </sentence><sentence id="1869">And I said, "How did you ever hear of Morris Neman?" </sentence><sentence id="1870">And he said, "We know things out here." </sentence><sentence id="1871">I said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1872">I am his nephew." </sentence><sentence id="1873">And he said, "You can't be all bad, even if you're a reform Rabbi." </sentence><sentence id="1874">I said, "Thank you for nothing." ( </sentence><sentence id="1875">Laughter) He gave me the piece of paper authorizing these guys to go on the grounds it was . </sentence><sentence id="1876">Human life was involved, and they had to fly out on Shabbat or not fly out. </sentence><sentence id="1877">I would have to go without because I wasn't going to get court martialed for this bunch or anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1878">So we left on Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="1879">Chief Rabbi was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1880">I was carrying with me not only 14 somewhat scared Jews, but the most peculiar package I have ever carried in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1881">I had been called and asked to come and see aman named Caplan, who was the treasurer of the Jewish Agency, First Minister of Finance, with the Government of Israel in 1948. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I walked into his office. </sentence><sentence id="1883">This was before my meeting with the Chief Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And he said, "Are you really Morris Neman's nephew?" </sentence><sentence id="1885">I said, "Yes," and he offered me condolences because as it happens Morris had died in September of 45. </sentence><sentence id="1886">One of the first things I did in Jerusalem was go to the walls and say kottish for him. </sentence><sentence id="1887">He was a great Zionist in Pittsburgh. </sentence><sentence id="1888">A magnificent, magnificent man. </sentence><sentence id="1889">My favorite uncle. </sentence><sentence id="1890">So he said, "Okay, then I'll trust you." </sentence><sentence id="1891">He said, "I want you to do something for me. </sentence><sentence id="1892">I want you to take a package to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1893">I said, "But I am not going to Paris." </sentence><sentence id="1894">He said, "If you take this package you are." </sentence><sentence id="1895">I said, "What will be in the package?" </sentence><sentence id="1896">And he said, "A quarter of a million dollars." </sentence><sentence id="1897">I said, "That's too big a package." ( </sentence><sentence id="1898">laughter) for my purposes. </sentence><sentence id="1899">He says, "No, it will fit in your shaving kit." </sentence><sentence id="1900">I said, "How?" </sentence><sentence id="1901">He said, "Because it's going to be in gold sovereigns. </sentence><sentence id="1902">It's the budget for the Paris office for the next period of time." </sentence><sentence id="1903">And I said, "Alright. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So I'll get court martialed. </sentence><sentence id="1905">What can I do?" </sentence><sentence id="1906">And he took me through a door and through another door into a room that consisted of shelves, each one of which was marked with a country. </sentence><sentence id="1907">All currency. </sentence><sentence id="1908">This was the Jewish Agency's private treasury of foreign currency. </sentence><sentence id="1909">I don't know how much money was there. </sentence><sentence id="1910">No idea. </sentence><sentence id="1911">All I know is that he was correct. </sentence><sentence id="1912">I got a quarter of million dollars in gold sovereigns into my docket. </sentence><sentence id="1913">Then I wondered, "How'll I pull this off? </sentence><sentence id="1914">I am going to have to trust one of my pilots. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And I got hold of the Major and I said to him, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="1916">I am going to do something very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1917">I am going to tell you something you don't want to know and I don't want to tell you, but I need you. </sentence><sentence id="1918">I need you in two ways. </sentence><sentence id="1919">I need you to protect me. </sentence><sentence id="1920">I am going to be walking around for the rest of the time we are Palestine with my dock kit in my hands, and I don't anybody to ask why. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And I don't want anybody to take it because it is money in it. </sentence><sentence id="1922">A lot of money." " </sentence><sentence id="1923">Okay, Chappy. </sentence><sentence id="1924">It's alright with me." </sentence><sentence id="1925">I said, "Second of all, you are to arrange an emergency that makes us land in Paris for 1 hour." " </sentence><sentence id="1926">That's not as easy," he said. </sentence><sentence id="1927">I said, "You'll do it though." </sentence><sentence id="1928">I let them know approximately when we would be coming in, and we were met at the airport by a man who became one of my most beloved friends, Efriam Decal who is second in command of the was the boss and Decal was his second. </sentence><sentence id="1929">Decal has written extensively about the Berichah and about all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="1930">He...uh...has died. </sentence><sentence id="1931">His wife is still living I am glad to say. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I just handed him this, and he, in effect, said thank you. ( </sentence><sentence id="1933">Laughter) That was our first meeting. </sentence><sentence id="1934">We became friends later. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And we flew back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1936">And we got away with it, which was alright. </sentence><sentence id="1937">We had something else on board, about which I was very sentimental and still am. </sentence><sentence id="1938">I was invited to a meeting of the Vodlume, which is the National assembly of the Ishuf, headed by..-uh...Ben , who became the second President of Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And I met all the people who are legendary. </sentence><sentence id="1940">You name them and they were all sitting there, and I was introduced to all of them. </sentence><sentence id="1941">And Ben said, "I need a favor." " </sentence><sentence id="1942">What." </sentence><sentence id="1943">The school children of Israel had been making Hanukiyot for the children of the DP camps in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1944">We have 36,000 of them. </sentence><sentence id="1945">And we have candles. </sentence><sentence id="1946">We don't know how to get them to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1947">Nobody ever thought of that. </sentence><sentence id="1948">I understand, he said, that you are flying in a bomber. </sentence><sentence id="1949">I said, "Yes, and my bomber has bomb bays, and I think it would be very nice if we filled the bomb bays of a B-17 with Hanukiyot and candles." </sentence><sentence id="1950">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="1951">And I sent a military TWX to Si Pava to alert everybody he could alert to come to the airport at Piece boden and pick up their Hanukiyot and they did. </sentence><sentence id="1952">All 36,000 of them got distributed in about 24 hours to Jews all over Germany, all over the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And...uh...that was some Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="1954">By the way, I don't have one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1955">We distributed them all. ( </sentence><sentence id="1956">Laughing) I never got one. </sentence><sentence id="1957">I would give much to have one of those Hanukiyot but I don't have one, and I guess that's proper and just that I should not have. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I never went back to Regensburg to work. </sentence><sentence id="1959">I spent the next period of time until April 46 running around, doing I don't know what, but there were emergencies constantly. </sentence><sentence id="1960">The American headquarters in Frankfort would call...the G.5 sections civil affairs, or Hiam...then called Hans Hoffman, later became Hiam Hoffman, later became , one of the fine people of Israel, and I had to do things. </sentence><sentence id="1961">So I was on detached service at Frankfort Headquarters for some months, but that had to end. </sentence><sentence id="1962">You just can't keep doing that. </sentence><sentence id="1963">So the theater Chaplain, a man named Hunan, Catholic, Truman's Chaplain, he called himself, from the first World War, called me in and said, "You gotta stop this monkeying around. </sentence><sentence id="1964">This isn't why you're in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="1965">I am sending you to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1966">That should be far enough away from all those displaced persons." </sentence><sentence id="1967">And I said, "Yes, Sir." </sentence><sentence id="1968">Excited, because the Jews from Poland and Russia had just started to come in and we were routing them all through Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1969">We had one of the Haganah people stationed in Berlin, and that's where the action was going to be. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Break my heart. </sentence><sentence id="1971">Send me to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1972">Twenty four hours later, he called me in and he said, "You're not going to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1973">I just found out the stuff that's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="1974">You're going to Augsburg to the Ist Division." " </sentence><sentence id="1975">Yes, Sir." " </sentence><sentence id="1976">And," he said, "when you get there, find Chaplain Freedman, whom | assigned there, but who is now going to Berlin in your place." </sentence><sentence id="1977">And I went to Augsburg and found Herb Freedman, whom I had never met before. </sentence><sentence id="1978">A young, first lieutenant, fresh into the Army, who was angry at me because Augsburg is near Munich, and in Munich is where the action was because he wanted to do Haganah work. </sentence><sentence id="1979">He was busting to do this stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1980">And I explained to him that Berlin was better and he should be made on me. ( </sentence><sentence id="1981">laughter) And he went to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1982">Of course, Herb Freedman's career since then has been legendary. </sentence><sentence id="1983">He and Phil Burstein did things that people really shouldn't have been able to do. </sentence><sentence id="1984">And...uh...it was superb. </sentence><sentence id="1985">I was delighted to be in Augsburg. </sentence><sentence id="1986">But my time was running out, because Hoffman was negotiating with the Army to make me into a civilian because it was clear during this period from December when these 14 arrived that this , this Jewish agency for Palestine group, as it was called,...uh... was going to have constant dealings with the Army. </sentence><sentence id="1987">And some American had to be there to see to it that nothing got fouled up. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And they decided I should be that person, and I was not unwilling. </sentence><sentence id="1989">My condition was that my wife and child be allowed to come to Germany with me. </sentence><sentence id="1990">I had two reasons for that. </sentence><sentence id="1991">First of all, I been away 18 months and that's a lot longer than 2 years...those 2 years that I thought wouldn't be so long, and second of all, I felt that Esther had to experience this or we weren't going to have much of a life because I was no longer the person who had gone overseas. </sentence><sentence id="1992">An awful lot had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1993">Deeply, deeply transforming stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1994">And they agreed. </sentence><sentence id="1995">Somebody fouled up, and in April 1946, just before Passover...uh...I got orders to go home to be demobilized and I asked Heim about it and he sort of shrugged and we talked to Ruth Kluger in Paris who was theoretically making these arrangements and she sort of shrugged. </sentence><sentence id="1996">So I came home. </sentence><sentence id="1997">And I became a civilian. </sentence><sentence id="1998">Uh... There was an Haganah office in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1999">It had been organized for a very simple purpose. </sentence><sentence id="2000">Money. </sentence><sentence id="2001">They had to buy ships. </sentence><sentence id="2002">Ships are expensive. </sentence><sentence id="2003">The only place they really could buy ships was the United States because they wanted larger ships. </sentence><sentence id="2004">Ships for 2 or 3 hundred people were not going to be able to do this thing anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2005">They needed big ships. </sentence><sentence id="2006">So they were going to buy them in the United States, and they sent 4 Palestinians over, led by who later became , the first chief of staff of the Israel army, later the President of the in Haifa. </sentence><sentence id="2007">A marvelous, marvelous man. </sentence><sentence id="2008">When I got to New York, I went into the office, naturally, and asked me if I would go to work for them. </sentence><sentence id="2009">As long as I had to be in the United States for a little while making speeches for the Haganah. </sentence><sentence id="2010">So from the end of April 1946 until February 1947, I was on the staff of the Haganah in the United States making speeches. </sentence><sentence id="2011">Esther and I lived in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2012">First in a hotel, but then we couldn't stand it. </sentence><sentence id="2013">And Michael was getting sick in this hotel. </sentence><sentence id="2014">The food just wasn't for a 2 year old. </sentence><sentence id="2015">And...uh...so we found an apartment on Staten Island, and we lived over there. </sentence><sentence id="2016">It was not a good time. </sentence><sentence id="2017">I was away more than I was there....uh... making the same speech over and over and over again to secret meetings of Jews to get money. </sentence><sentence id="2018">Was not my style, but it was what had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="2019">There was some compensation. </sentence><sentence id="2020">There was a rainy night. </sentence><sentence id="2021">I don't remember what month when I was allowed to go to Baltimore. </sentence><sentence id="2022">And down on the docks was a ship, then called the SS Warfield. </sentence><sentence id="2023">The Warfield being the same person as the Duchess of Windsor because her daddy was the President of the steamboat company that ran steamboats up around the Chesapeake Bay. </sentence><sentence id="2024">This was a Chesapeake Bay steamer. </sentence><sentence id="2025">Decrepit, messed up which the Haganah had bought, and we were sending off to Europe to transport Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2026">We estimated that maybe 25,000 Jews uncomfortable could get on it. </sentence><sentence id="2027">When it sailed in June of 47 to Palestine from France as the exodus 1947, it had 52 hundred people on board, and we'll pick that up later because I have more to do with the exodus. </sentence><sentence id="2028">That night in Baltimore we commissioned the exodus in a non-existent Jewish navy. </sentence><sentence id="2029">Gave it flag, and all the rest of the . </sentence><sentence id="2030">A word ought to be said about Americans for Haganah. </sentence><sentence id="2031">It was an astonishing organization. </sentence><sentence id="2032">It's head was a multi-millionaire oil man named Rudolph Sonaborn, whose last claim to fame was that he married Dorothy Shift, the publisher of the New York Post then. </sentence><sentence id="2033">But he gave at least half his time to Americans for Haganah. </sentence><sentence id="2034">We met every Tuesday for lunch in a hotel in New York, and...uh... books have been written about this operation, which was clandestine. </sentence><sentence id="2035">The bank account was the bank account of the Palestine pavilion of the New York Worlds Fair. </sentence><sentence id="2036">There had been a New York World's Fair in 1930...what...8, 9, something like that, and they never closed the bank account of the...of the Jewish pavilion or the Palestine Pavilion it was called. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And that money was funneled through the Palestine Pavilion bank account, and we never got caught. </sentence><sentence id="2038">Later, there was trouble with armed shipments to the Haganah, but that was much later, after the Foundation was dated as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="2039">This group that met on Tuesdays was a remarkable bunch, and the fact that we raised several million dollars for the purchase of ships is amazing because we were a small group and you couldn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2040">You couldn't do the usual kinds of fund raising hoopla. </sentence><sentence id="2041">We met in people's rumpus rooms, they were called in those days. </sentence><sentence id="2042">They are called family rooms today, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2043">And...uh...everybody had to know everybody, and they couldn't talk about it, and they had to get lots of money. </sentence><sentence id="2044">It was a wild operation. </sentence><sentence id="2045">I did not enjoy it. </sentence><sentence id="2046">One of my tasks, for example, was to go once a week for lunch to the 21 Club in New York because one of the Krinlers was interested in us, and he introduced me to all these degenerate people. </sentence><sentence id="2047">He used to hang out at the 21 Club and I'd get money from them. </sentence><sentence id="2048">Uh...Some of the ladies were very frank about where they money came from and how it came. </sentence><sentence id="2049">And I had a conscious problem about this, but it didn't last because buying the ships was more important than my Jewish conscious. </sentence><sentence id="2050">But it was a tough time for my family and me. </sentence><sentence id="2051">We were relieved when finally, finally, finally the paperwork was done, and we could get back to Europe, we thought. </sentence><sentence id="2052">I flew to Paris and went in back in to Germany immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2053">Got us a house in Heidelberg, and then went to Paris to pick Esy up when she and Michael arrived. </sentence><sentence id="2054">They got stuck in Paris for 4 week because the paperwork wasn't in order. </sentence><sentence id="2055">She lived in a very fancy hotel in Paris for 4 weeks, and then we moved into Heidelberg and the next phase of this operation begins. </sentence><sentence id="2056">b Hb

There were two people you wanted to tell us more about. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2534">A: One day in early Fall (clearing throat) 1945 I walked into our building in Regensburg and I went upstairs and I heard very loud sounds, kids stomping and shouting, and so I went to see what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2535">There about 20 teenagers with this short, very short, heavy set, young, young man leading them in a dance...in a song. </sentence><sentence id="2536">Uh. </sentence><sentence id="2537">was the theme and _ stuff and he had those kids going absolutely mad. </sentence><sentence id="2538">And I watched this guy and said to myself, "He's a leader. </sentence><sentence id="2539">That man is a leader." </sentence><sentence id="2540">So I met him. </sentence><sentence id="2541">His name was Leon Retter from , a genius who had been sent by the Russians to the language school in Moscow when he was 16. </sentence><sentence id="2542">He spoke then and still speaks somewhere between 10 and 15 languages quite fluently. </sentence><sentence id="2543">He was a captain in the Red Army during the war, and at the end of the war decided that he wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="2544">This was what he wanted that he wanted to live in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2545">So he ran away, and came into American zone in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2546">Landed in Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="2547">some months later his girlfriend joined him and they married. </sentence><sentence id="2548">They are still married and they lived in Munich for reasons which will become clear. </sentence><sentence id="2549">Uh...We had organized not only the central committee, but regional committees. </sentence><sentence id="2550">More people involved the better. </sentence><sentence id="2551">He became a member of our regional committee, and then I...uh...let Klausner know, as a matter of fact, that I thought this guy was...uh...good material and Klausner met him, moved him down to Munich and Irea which is the name he took instead of Leon,,...uh...for reasons that have to do with language. </sentence><sentence id="2552">Leon means lion and Irea means lion. </sentence><sentence id="2553">Their translation. </sentence><sentence id="2554">And Redder became just because he wanted it to. </sentence><sentence id="2555">He...uh...became the foreign secretary of the displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="2556">It was he who dealt with the big people who came in. </sentence><sentence id="2557">It was he who went to Frankfort headquarters to, as he said, make demands on behalf...on behalf of the Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="2558">Tough minded,...uh...brilliant orator who in the spring of 1946 was sent to the United States for his first UJA missions. </sentence><sentence id="2559">And he has done UJA off and on ever since until his retirement about 2 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="2560">He's 68 now. </sentence><sentence id="2561">He...uh.. should have become a major political figure, but...uh...Mr. Ben-Gurion was rather capricious about his boys, as he called them, and when there was a revolt against Ben-Gurion within the Labor Party, in the 50's, Irea joined the revolt. </sentence><sentence id="2562">And the old man punished him and then made him do projects for him afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="2563">Irea decided that the way to get along in Israel was to be independent, and so he become Israel's first management consultant on human relations. </sentence><sentence id="2564">As new immigrant groups came in, there were all kinds of tensions and problems and he would work with those. </sentence><sentence id="2565">He's a remarkable fellows, still one of my very closest friends. </sentence><sentence id="2566">He had the right kind of hutspah in huge amounts. </sentence><sentence id="2567">Uh...It was fun to watch him telling General Clay what General Clay had to do. ( </sentence><sentence id="2568">Laughter) It was really great. </sentence><sentence id="2569">He's also...was great with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2570">I went with him one night to one of the DP camps where we had just gotten a telephone call that there was a riot going on. </sentence><sentence id="2571">The G...the American Army did some not very bright things. </sentence><sentence id="2572">As we became friendly with the Germans, which we did by 1946, 47...Secretary Burns had led the way on that...they began to put German police in Jewish DP camps, and the Jews didn't like it much. </sentence><sentence id="2573">And we had that kind of situation, and the Jews went berserk. </sentence><sentence id="2574">So Irea and I went. </sentence><sentence id="2575">He got up on the back of the truck and he hushed those Jews, and then he spoke to them with his kind of beery voice, and they went back to their room...home to behave themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2576">I have never seen one person stop a riot before, but he did. </sentence><sentence id="2577">He had that kind of power. </sentence><sentence id="2578">Extremely, extremely charismatic, powerful guy, who became my brother. </sentence><sentence id="2579">And...uh...has remained very much a brother. ( </sentence><sentence id="2580">Sigh) I am trying to think of.... Well, we had a Congress of Displaced Persons...uh...in the first year, and unquestionably, the most influential individual there, besides Klausner, was Nesher. </sentence><sentence id="2581">Okay, that's Nesher. </sentence><sentence id="2582">That's who he is. </sentence><sentence id="2583">That's who he was. </sentence><sentence id="2584">Uh...He went to Palestine in time for the War of Independence cause he insisted on doing so. </sentence><sentence id="2585">He and Lilly took a bunch of kids on a legal trip because there were some...

" </sentence><sentence id="2629">Of course, Sir." " </sentence><sentence id="2630">Would you please tell him that I am looking for him because I must have his monthly reports?" </sentence><sentence id="2631">I said, "I will certainly tell him." </sentence><sentence id="2632">Next day, I had lunch with Abe in Munich and I said to him, "Here's your message from Chaplain O'Reilly." </sentence><sentence id="2633">And he listened, and he said, "Okay, message has been received." </sentence><sentence id="2634">I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="2635">Let's do it. </sentence><sentence id="2636">Let's regularize you. </sentence><sentence id="2637">It will be good for you, and it would enhance your status. </sentence><sentence id="2638">It wouldn't destroy your status with the Army." </sentence><sentence id="2639">We sat down in his house on with the help of the JDC women sitting at the typewriters and we wrote 8 monthly reports. ( </sentence><sentence id="2640">Laughter) Numbers, statistics, services conducted, counseling sessions held, the works! </sentence><sentence id="2641">And he signed them, and we sent them in through channels with no note of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="2642">We arranged for one of the officers to see that they got into the mail system and they landed in the Chaplain's office. </sentence><sentence id="2643">Next thing Abe heard was he got orders brought to him by a finance officer who was bringing him 8 months pay. </sentence><sentence id="2644">He hadn't been paid for 8 months. </sentence><sentence id="2645">He got this stack of occupation currency, and the finance officer said, "While I was coming here, the Adjutant General asked if I would bring you these. </sentence><sentence id="2646">They are orders." </sentence><sentence id="2647">And Abe looked and in the orders he was assigned to a hospital in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="2648">And that's where he remained. </sentence><sentence id="2649">He just kept right on going. </sentence><sentence id="2650">Never moved into the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2651">Reported to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2652">Spoke to the hospital Chaplain and said, "If you have any Jews problems, call me."

UNRRA blew it. </sentence><sentence id="2678">They started Jewish DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="2679">UNRRA was unable to do so. </sentence><sentence id="2680">Well, Abe did it. </sentence><sentence id="2681">He had this crazy capacity to do all sorts of things with very few resources. </sentence><sentence id="2682">Another funny story that happened to Abe, but it's not about him. </sentence><sentence id="2683">Obviously, the Jews wanted to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2684">One day, he was in his office, still at the Dorchus Museum, before he moved into... There was a knock on the door, and this little Jew came bursting in and, "Herr Chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="2685">Herr Chaplain." " </sentence><sentence id="2686">Yes." </sentence><sentence id="2687">This was...conversation was carried on in Yiddish although an instantaneous translation. </sentence><sentence id="2688">Uh..."I have a visa." " </sentence><sentence id="2689">Wonderful," said Abe. </sentence><sentence id="2690">And they danced together and they pranced together, "You have a visa. </sentence><sentence id="2691">Where are you going?" " </sentence><sentence id="2692">Costa Rica." " </sentence><sentence id="2693">Marvelous, it's a beautiful country," and they kibitzed around for a good...and the guy was about to leave and he turned to Abe and said, "Herr Chaplain, May I ask a question?" " </sentence><sentence id="2694">Of course." " </sentence><sentence id="2695">Where's Costa Rica?" </sentence><sentence id="2696">He had no idea what part of the world Costa Rica was in, and I suspect he didn't go there either. </sentence><sentence id="2697">He may have started for there, but he didn't land there. </sentence><sentence id="2698">What else should I tell you about Klausner? </sentence><sentence id="2699">Uh...The Army arranged for him to come home in 1946 too. </sentence><sentence id="2700">He will give you all kinds of stories about how...how and why it happened, but it happened. </sentence><sentence id="2701">As soon as he got to the United States, he began to maneuver to get back because that's all he wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="2702">He was a bachelor, and this was his life. </sentence><sentence id="2703">And General Hilldring was Assistant Secretary of State for International Affairs. </sentence><sentence id="2704">Good guy! </sentence><sentence id="2705">And Abe went to him, and Hilldring arranged for him to go back to Germany and he did go back. </sentence><sentence id="2706">Did some interesting things that had to do with the exodus people as a matter of fact and when I get to exodus we'll talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="2707">And then, eventually, I came home and...uh...took up a Rabbinical career. </sentence><sentence id="2708">He's been in Yonkers, New York, for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="2709">He's just retiring. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2900">A: It's from Heidelberg to another town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2902">Q: Then let's pick up as it were chronologically again. </sentence><sentence id="2903">We jump back. </sentence><sentence id="2904">You have been civilianized and returned to Heidelberg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2908">A: Went to Heidelburg to live. </sentence><sentence id="2909">And I did (sigh) three jobs. </sentence><sentence id="2910">I was responsible for all routine liaison with the American Army. </sentence><sentence id="2911">there was a Brigadier General in Frankfort Headquarters, a good man, solid man, with whom I had the right to talk anytime I wanted to, or he would call me whenever he had something, and we talked a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="2912">Second, any publicity or public relations that had to do with the underground, I was responsible for and...uh...I'll come back to that in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="2913">My third one was to lead transports with a guy who was then called Wolf, whose name was not and is not Wolf. </sentence><sentence id="2914">Uh...His name is Efrian Franke. </sentence><sentence id="2915">Uh...He lives in . </sentence><sentence id="2916">He's an attorney, Israel's most distinguished restitution attorney. </sentence><sentence id="2917">Married to a woman named Hanna, who was one of the members of this group in Germany, and they have an infinite number of grandchildren by now. </sentence><sentence id="2918">It was the second marriage for both of them. </sentence><sentence id="2919">So, Efrian who was never called Efrian and I did transports together, as the leaders of them. </sentence><sentence id="2920">I was called to Paris one day because a major American newspaper person wanted an interview with the famous Colonel Wolf, and I arranged it. </sentence><sentence id="2921">Efrian was in Paris, and we made this interview by agreeing to meet at a certain place. </sentence><sentence id="2922">We met at that place, got into a cab and went to another place. </sentence><sentence id="2923">Got into a cab, and went to a third place. </sentence><sentence id="2924">I guess it was about the 4th place where Efrian finally walked in, and the reporter joined us. </sentence><sentence id="2925">Because everybody assumed all the time that the British were looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="2926">That was one of my P.R. jobs. </sentence><sentence id="2927">The most important P.R. job I guess I ever did had to do with the late M . </sentence><sentence id="2928">We had a contact in the United States where reporters were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="2929">Let me tell you about one of the incidents and then I will come to . </sentence><sentence id="2930">Uh...The door bell rang one day in Heidelberg, and a young, fresh faced guy said, "My name is Dick Dudman, and I want a story about the Haganah." </sentence><sentence id="2931">And I said, "Never heard of it," and I closed the door. </sentence><sentence id="2932">And I sent a wire to the late LF. </sentence><sentence id="2933">Stone in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2934">Isy Stone was our New York contact. </sentence><sentence id="2935">He was working for P.M. newspaper then, and nobody could get into Haganah for a story unless Stone sent him. </sentence><sentence id="2936">And I in this cable said, "What's this Dudman guy? </sentence><sentence id="2937">Do I let him in or not? </sentence><sentence id="2938">He claims to be from the Denver Post." </sentence><sentence id="2939">And I got a wire back saying, "Yal, He's okay." </sentence><sentence id="2940">So I managed to get word...uh...I don't remember how I did it or whether Isy did it, but Dudman came to my door again. </sentence><sentence id="2941">And we made him into a displaced person. </sentence><sentence id="2942">Gave him everything he needed to be a displaced person, and sent him on one of the trips. </sentence><sentence id="2943">And he wrote a memorable series of articles for the Denver Post on being a displaced person, and what it was like to go on one of these illegal trips...uh...for which he got a name and fellowship by the way. </sentence><sentence id="2944">Later, we became friends again here in Washington, because he was the head of the Washington Bureau, the St.Louis Post Dispatch, and...uh...now lives in Ellsworth, Maine. </sentence><sentence id="2945">He and his wife decided that it was a small town for them. </sentence><sentence id="2946">They bought a radio station in Ellsworth. </sentence><sentence id="2947">Dick also became famous because...uh...rcemember when we were not in Cambodia, he was captured...uh...with the American troops in Cambodia...with his press credentials, and he was missing for several weeks and we all went out of our minds till he came back quite unharmed. </sentence><sentence id="2948">Remarkable reporter, and those stories I think...uh...were very exciting and very important in having Americans understand what this crazy underground was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2949">But...uh...I guess the longest lasting piece of P.R. has to do with a movie, which was made by Myrlon in..starring his wife,, who is now his widow. </sentence><sentence id="2950">She was a writer. </sentence><sentence id="2951">Uh...He came with full credentials, of course, and moved into our house in Heidelberg. </sentence><sentence id="2952">He was going to make a movie of one of our transports because the story of this movie was this displaced person and how this displaced person got to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2953">And obviously this displaced person had to be out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2954">And we decided to use one of our regular transports. </sentence><sentence id="2955">So one night, we applied all transports out of our part of German...the ones I was responsible for left on Saturday night. </sentence><sentence id="2956">Why, I hear you ask, Saturday night? </sentence><sentence id="2957">Because as few American troops as possible were on duty Saturday night. </sentence><sentence id="2958">Saturday night is getting drunk night or having a beer night or reading a good book night, but you're not on duty Saturday night if you can avoid it, so it was easiest to get through the border on Saturday nights. </sentence><sentence id="2959">We always had some kind of papers. </sentence><sentence id="2960">We never tried just to sneak through a border. </sentence><sentence id="2961">That was too risky. </sentence><sentence id="2962">Uh...There were times when for small groups we would go through borders, but we had a list of the constabulary units and their schedules, where they would be when General Mickelson always saw that we had those. </sentence><sentence id="2963">That was the guy at Frankfort Headquarters who was my contact, a Brigadier named Abraham Mickelson. </sentence><sentence id="2964">And he provided those. </sentence><sentence id="2965">Uh...But the big transports, we had to go through roads and border points because we were in 6 by 6 trucks, and some German trucks, though we never used wood burning ones. </sentence><sentence id="2966">We bought trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2967">We bought gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="2968">If did not have Army supplies unless we could steal them, and you couldn't steal large quantities of gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="2969">That's hard to do. </sentence><sentence id="2970">But by this time we had a budget and we were getting money from the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2971">This was a transport of about twelve hundred people, leaving Saturday night from the town of Noowhom. </sentence><sentence id="2972">We owned a barracks in Noowhom. </sentence><sentence id="2973">We bought it. </sentence><sentence id="2974">It was ours. </sentence><sentence id="2975">And we could use it to get people ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="2976">And we would appear there on either Friday or sometime early Saturday, and the people would arrive. </sentence><sentence id="2977">How they were selected and how they got there is a story unto itself, but that's what we eventually had 130 Palestinians doing out around the countryside. </sentence><sentence id="2978">They had political problems; they had age problems; they had all kinds of problems in making up these transports. </sentence><sentence id="2979">How did we know how many to send? </sentence><sentence id="2980">Uh...Let me ask myself the question when I finish the Myrlon Lynn story because it's a separate story which has its own kind of interest. </sentence><sentence id="2981">We got instructions on my telephone. </sentence><sentence id="2982">Saturday night we would have our people all ready. </sentence><sentence id="2983">This was a well organized thing. </sentence><sentence id="2984">We knew who was going to be in which trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2985">If they were pregnant women, they were in the same truck, and there was a nurse with them. </sentence><sentence id="2986">Sometimes the nurse was a woman named Esther Lipman, who was not a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="2987">But she was pregnant at the time, so she knew all about it. ( </sentence><sentence id="2988">Laughing) We were going to have our second child, so Esther a few pieces of equipment and she went on some of these transports as transport nurse. </sentence><sentence id="2989">We never delivered a baby on one of these transports, I'm glad to say. </sentence><sentence id="2990">It's just as well. </sentence><sentence id="2991">The tough part of the trip was the night part into the Black Forest. </sentence><sentence id="2992">And so we left. </sentence><sentence id="2993">Every 2 hours we would stop for relief. </sentence><sentence id="2994">We left at midnight so that we had two or three 2-hour periods before dawn. </sentence><sentence id="2995">At dawn or shortly thereafter, we would arrive at what was known as the picnic area. </sentence><sentence id="2996">We had been looking for this for weeks, and when we found it, it was as though we had found Heaven. </sentence><sentence id="2997">There was a place in the middle of the Black Forest where a small road went off to the right. </sentence><sentence id="2998">And they went about a half a mile and then there was a circle, at the end of which there was a wine house. </sentence><sentence id="2999">End of road. </sentence><sentence id="3000">That's perfect. </sentence><sentence id="3001">No traffic. </sentence><sentence id="3002">On the side of the road was a little cabin. </sentence><sentence id="3003">And there we got one of the great breaks of the entire era. </sentence><sentence id="3004">When a DP named Gittshuck, who worked for us, and I were looking for this place...and...for a place, and we came to this, we decided we better check out that cabin. </sentence><sentence id="3005">We knocked on the cabin door, and a lady answered wearing Bavarian costumes as everybody in the Black Forest did. </sentence><sentence id="3006">They wore old fashioned Bavarian costumes. </sentence><sentence id="3007">And we talked to her and asked her if she would have any objections if every once in awhile, every week, 10 days, some people would come and rest on the side of the hill and use the stream at the bottom of the hill just to wash. </sentence><sentence id="3008">And she said, "I have no objection, but who are they?" </sentence><sentence id="3009">And I said, "They're concentration camp survivors who are going to their new homes, and we are moving them." </sentence><sentence id="3010">And she said, "Oh, can I help?" </sentence><sentence id="3011">And I said, "If you want to feed them, it would be a great help. </sentence><sentence id="3012">We often have children. </sentence><sentence id="3013">It would be marvelous if we could leave cereal with you and we could have hot gruel for these kids when they get here and hot tea for the adults. </sentence><sentence id="3014">That would be absolutely marvelous." </sentence><sentence id="3015">Nothing to that. </sentence><sentence id="3016">Asked some more questions, as I was interested. </sentence><sentence id="3017">This woman was a Jew, who had married when she was at the University a non*Jewish German. </sentence><sentence id="3018">When the Nazi...when the war started, he was pulled into the Army. </sentence><sentence id="3019">She decided and he decided and his father decided that she should hide out in this cabin with the father because he lived there in the middle of the woods. </sentence><sentence id="3020">How many people would come into the Black Forest looking for somebody? </sentence><sentence id="3021">Uh...She was announced as his daughter-in-law, and her husband was off in the Army being a hero. </sentence><sentence id="3022">Her husband was killed on the eastern front, so she stayed. </sentence><sentence id="3023">Took care of the old man. </sentence><sentence id="3024">She took care of the old man till he died about 1946, and because some of the neighbors knew that she was Jewish and nobody had turned her in, she decided to live out her life there. </sentence><sentence id="3025">She had a job. </sentence><sentence id="3026">She worked. </sentence><sentence id="3027">She had her husband's pension from the Army, whatever it was, and she was living there. </sentence><sentence id="3028">So then we were able to tell her that these were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3029">And this became our picnic area. </sentence><sentence id="3030">Every transport going to Milhouse in France...uh ...went through there, and this woman loved it. </sentence><sentence id="3031">She was magnificent. </sentence><sentence id="3032">I remember her with great affection. </sentence><sentence id="3033">Any how, after resting at the picnic ground and having a meal, we got back into the trucks and headed for a place called Pompdecess, where the only bridge across the Rhine was. </sentence><sentence id="3034">It was a military bridge. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And...uh..we got to Pompdecess, and we had to be there at 4 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="3036">Not 5, not 3 because the French officer whom we owned, the , immigration officer, was sure to be on duty then. </sentence><sentence id="3037">Any day but Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="3038">And he would take our papers and pass them right through. </sentence><sentence id="3039">So we got through the Duon easily. </sentence><sentence id="3040">And then from there to Milhouse in France was nothing to it, and there there was a big railroad yard and the French Haganah picked up the people at Mulhous and took them by train to somewhere in the Marseilles area depending on where the ship was going to be sit, Port Boog or Marseilles itself, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3041">This particular transport had Tereska on board as a DP. </sentence><sentence id="3042">She had DP papers. </sentence><sentence id="3043">She had DP clothing. </sentence><sentence id="3044">She was a DP. </sentence><sentence id="3045">In front of this particular transport just before my car was the camera car with Myra. </sentence><sentence id="3046">And we had a terrible time with Myer. </sentence><sentence id="3047">It wasn't his fault. </sentence><sentence id="3048">He had to make noise. </sentence><sentence id="3049">He had to call something out to the camera crew. </sentence><sentence id="3050">You can't do it. </sentence><sentence id="3051">He had to call this... There's simply no way to do it. </sentence><sentence id="3052">You're going to shut up or you ain't going. </sentence><sentence id="3053">You see you had to go through the American zone of occupation to the French zone of occupation. </sentence><sentence id="3054">Pompdecess was in the French zone. </sentence><sentence id="3055">The French zone was a small zone in the southwestern Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3056">The French insisted on having a zone. </sentence><sentence id="3057">It was a four-power power thing after all. </sentence><sentence id="3058">So going from the American zone to the French zone was the dangerous one. </sentence><sentence id="3059">And having the camera crew along was great, because we say the United Nations wanted to have records of all these transports of survivors as they go to their new homes and...uh..we have a crew with us, and want to take your picture at the border as you do your duty, and we got through very fast. </sentence><sentence id="3060">Uh...It was very difficult for Myer. </sentence><sentence id="3061">I am sure he suffered a lot. </sentence><sentence id="3062">It's got the illegals. </sentence><sentence id="3063">It is still available in 16 millimeter. </sentence><sentence id="3064">It still gets rented I understand by school groups and others who want to see it. </sentence><sentence id="3065">One minor tragedy in it which we laugh about in our family, but it isn't totally funny. </sentence><sentence id="3066">Esther was along on that transport as transport nurse. </sentence><sentence id="3067">The only time that I appear in the film was at Pompdecess where I am standing with the Duan going over the papers and getting people ready to go through. </sentence><sentence id="3068">And Esther was filmed there too. </sentence><sentence id="3069">There were other pictures of me in the...in my car and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3070">We had a car with a moveable roof so that we could stand on the seat and watch what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3071">Dangerous, but...uh...very effective because we had to see what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3072">We didn't want to lose any trucks. </sentence><sentence id="3073">They had to stay in line. </sentence><sentence id="3074">Uh...We had to go through one or two towns, went through Fribrook for example and in the streets of Fribrook, we did not want to lose trucks. </sentence><sentence id="3075">But the only one that got printed and is in the film is me at the...there's nothing of Esy. </sentence><sentence id="3076">All the shots of Esther got cut in the editing, and she never stopped teasing Myer about it. </sentence><sentence id="3077">And whenever we met, he would come up and want to hug her hello and she would say, "You don't want to hug me. </sentence><sentence id="3078">You wouldn't even put me in your movie." ( </sentence><sentence id="3079">Laughter) So...uh...that's our...Myer saga of The Illegal. </sentence><sentence id="3080">Incidentally, they...uh...filmed the...the boat. </sentence><sentence id="3081">That part of the trip being caught by the British, going to Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3082">They got a complete record on the illegal. </sentence><sentence id="3083">I forget how much of it is in the film. </sentence><sentence id="3084">But that was part of the P.R. job as well as taking transports. </sentence><sentence id="3085">Uh...With one exception we had no difficulty, with the transports to France. </sentence><sentence id="3086">Uh...One night they got nasty at the border and kept us there 5 hours, and it was only when we finally, finally found Paul Edwards... It being a Saturday night, he wasn't at home either. </sentence><sentence id="3087">When he finally got home...uh...just before dawn, that he was able to say to these guys, "Are their papers in order? </sentence><sentence id="3088">Is my signature on them? </sentence><sentence id="3089">What do you want? </sentence><sentence id="3090">Get them out of there? </sentence><sentence id="3091">You've had those peoples in there a long time. </sentence><sentence id="3092">They're tired. </sentence><sentence id="3093">They have to get where they're going." </sentence><sentence id="3094">So the soldiers backed down. </sentence><sentence id="3095">And...uh..that had been the result of a tip from a CID Criminal Investigation Division of the Army, I am sorry to say, a young man I knew. </sentence><sentence id="3096">The son of somebody I had grown up with in Pittsburgh who was stuck on his duty and he got a...in his investigations or whatever, he heard that a bunch of Jews were going out on Saturday night and he notified the border station. </sentence><sentence id="3097">But it happened. </sentence><sentence id="3098">Not everybody was...uh...all for what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="3099">There were people aside from the British who didn't think we were...uh...behaving properly. </sentence><sentence id="3100">Okay, that's transports. </sentence><sentence id="3101">Oh, no, there's one more thing about it that I must mention. </sentence><sentence id="3102">How did we get the quotas and the number of people who were going to take a transport? </sentence><sentence id="3103">I had a telephone. </sentence><sentence id="3104">Because I was a Lieutenant Colonel, I had a telephone that could call outside the country. </sentence><sentence id="3105">Whenever we were scheduled for a transport, at precisely 7 o'clock in the evening, my phone would ring. </sentence><sentence id="3106">It would be a female voice talking English with a heavy French accent who never identified herself and who gave me a list of agricultural implements and tools and God knows what all, that I was to copy down with numbers. </sentence><sentence id="3107">And the code Hiamhead I didn't know what it said. </sentence><sentence id="3108">I immediately called Munich and transmitted it to Munich, and that's how we knew about our transports. </sentence><sentence id="3109">Some years later, 48 or 9, I don't remember, I was asked by the UJA to go to the opening of the campaign in Nashville, Tennessee, at a posh country club and I went. </sentence><sentence id="3110">Sitting next to me at dinner was a woman named Paulette OppertO PPERT,a French Jew, whose husband had been killed in the resistance who had herself been in the resistance and who after the war worked for the French Haganah and for people in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="3111">She later married an American businessman named Fink, and lived in Minneapolis for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="3112">I saw her once in awhile. </sentence><sentence id="3113">I listened, and I said to her, "Paulette. </sentence><sentence id="3114">I know your voice." </sentence><sentence id="3115">And she said, "I have been sitting here going crazy cause I know your voice." </sentence><sentence id="3116">It was she. </sentence><sentence id="3117">She had been calling from Paris all those months, giving me all those instructions out of order which she understood, not a word of which I understood, that made it possible for the transports to go. </sentence><sentence id="3118">We felt like blood brother and sister. </sentence><sentence id="3119">Okay, that's the...uh...that's the transport business. </sentence><sentence id="3120">What's next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3339">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3340">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="3341">Uh...How did you start preparing for the Exodus? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3345">A: Well, first of all we got a call from Paulette, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people in Marseilles on a certain date. </sentence><sentence id="3346">The largest transport that had ever been contemplated. </sentence><sentence id="3347">And the people in the camps did their job. </sentence><sentence id="3348">And it was decided that two of the transports would go by train, by way of Strasbourg, and three of them would go by truck and they would be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come back, load up, and do this three times. </sentence><sentence id="3349">Two of them being Saturday nights, and one of them being mid- week which we had never done before. </sentence><sentence id="3350">But what're we going to do. </sentence><sentence id="3351">Because we had to get these people on board. </sentence><sentence id="3352">The British were watching this ship in sit where it was, and they didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so we rushed it. </sentence><sentence id="3353">All of these people had to get new identities because we using a series of French transit visas that the Minister of the Interior people had kindly prepared for us, but they were...we would call in blank. </sentence><sentence id="3354">They weren't really blank at all. </sentence><sentence id="3355">They had names on them. </sentence><sentence id="3356">They just weren't names of any living people, and they all had ages and they all had birth places. </sentence><sentence id="3357">So we prepared in advance DP cards. </sentence><sentence id="3358">Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by UNRRA with military authorization and we had tens of thousands of them that we had printed and...uh...we issued new ones to all of these people with the proper stamps on them and then we handed them out at Nooam in the barracks in the stables there, and told them, "You got a new name. </sentence><sentence id="3359">You got to know how old you are. </sentence><sentence id="3360">You got to know where you were born. </sentence><sentence id="3361">It has nothing to do with you. </sentence><sentence id="3362">It has to do with whatever that name is on that piece of piece." </sentence><sentence id="3363">So they all had to learn them. </sentence><sentence id="3364">And some of the old people had difficulties with this. </sentence><sentence id="3365">Kids had no trouble at all. </sentence><sentence id="3366">There was one cute little kid with obviously orthodox origins was standing there holding these things and chuckling back and forth as he memorized his name and his birthplace and his birth date. </sentence><sentence id="3367">It was nice. </sentence><sentence id="3368">And then we took them. </sentence><sentence id="3369">Normally, when we got Milhouse there was a little hotel there. </sentence><sentence id="3370">A wonderful lady owned it who fed us a hot meal. </sentence><sentence id="3371">This is the staff who had gone on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="3372">The people were on the train bound for Marseilles already...and...uh...we'd spend the night and part of the next day. </sentence><sentence id="3373">Relax a little bit, have some fun, drink some good wine. </sentence><sentence id="3374">I learned to eat pate for the first time and...Milhouse is in...uh...SS Lorraine...that part of France and they made wonderful pate. </sentence><sentence id="3375">So this time we got there early evening. </sentence><sentence id="3376">We turned in. </sentence><sentence id="3377">Didn't have all that wonderful hospitality. </sentence><sentence id="3378">And in the middle of the night, we got back in our trucks and we went back to , and that night we loaded up and we did that three times in 8 days. </sentence><sentence id="3379">Esy was not with me on the Exodus ones. </sentence><sentence id="3380">I don't remember why not, but she wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="3381">And...uh...when I left I said to her as I always did, "I'll be back when I get here," and all she would say to people who called was, "I am sorry. </sentence><sentence id="3382">He's out of town. </sentence><sentence id="3383">Have you tried the Munich office?" </sentence><sentence id="3384">Uh...This was the longest I had been away. </sentence><sentence id="3385">And she allowed as how she was a little bit apprehensive, but nothing we could do about it. </sentence><sentence id="3386">That's how the people got on the exodus. </sentence><sentence id="3387">The French Haganah did a superlative job in getting all those trains. </sentence><sentence id="3388">Uh... That's a lot of bribery for the railway officials to... These were private trains. </sentence><sentence id="3389">These weren't just seats on train. </sentence><sentence id="3390">Twelve hundred people is a lot of...lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="3391">So these were three transports of between a thousand and twelve hundred each, and the other approximately two thousand went by train from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3392">Then the exodus story doesn't end there. </sentence><sentence id="3393">It goes on because as people should know, the British sent that ship back. </sentence><sentence id="3394">Not the ship. </sentence><sentence id="3395">The ship stayed in Haifa Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="3396">It's still there. </sentence><sentence id="3397">By the way, it's falling apart. </sentence><sentence id="3398">It is disintegrating and will not last forever. </sentence><sentence id="3399">They've tried to preserve it. </sentence><sentence id="3400">It's not working very well. </sentence><sentence id="3401">It's been in a museum for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="3402">They sent the people back in three ships to a place called Port Luke, where they went on a hunger strike. </sentence><sentence id="3403">They wouldn't get off. </sentence><sentence id="3404">The British took them off by force, and then put them back on again and shipped them around to Hamburger in the British zone where they were taken, by I think, truck or train to two concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="3405">One is called Amistow and one is called Popendorf where they incarcerated them. </sentence><sentence id="3406">One of the things Abe Klausner did was organize their escape with a bunch of the Haganah people, and they escaped. </sentence><sentence id="3407">And one of my great stories was greeting some of them again at Nooam when they went a second time. </sentence><sentence id="3408">I don't know how many of them went the second time by Haganah, but I had all transport of them one night, twelve hundred of them who went. </sentence><sentence id="3409">They landed on Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3410">Cyprus requires specific mention. </sentence><sentence id="3411">We made jokes about Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3412">We are going to have a Jewish State, but it's not going to be an ordinary state. </sentence><sentence id="3413">It's already an empire. </sentence><sentence id="3414">It has a colony. </sentence><sentence id="3415">Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3416">Because we had tens of thousands of Jews interned on Cyprus by the British in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="3417">The first immigrants who came into Israel after independence were the people from Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3418">They had priorities. </sentence><sentence id="3419">God knows they had earned them, and they came through. </sentence><sentence id="3420">That was Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3421">I have never been to Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3422">I should go there some day. </sentence><sentence id="3423">What's next Linda? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3504">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3505">Where did you...What did you do after the exodus transport or do you want to go back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3508">A: Uh...I think we ought to do the baby before we forget it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3510">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3512">A: A good friend of mine, displaced person, had a child. </sentence><sentence id="3513">Called me from where they were, told me that they were in terrible trouble. </sentence><sentence id="3514">The child was born with infantile jaundice, and she was getting dehydrated and they weren't sure she could live. </sentence><sentence id="3515">It was particularly painful because they were displaced persons and looked forward to this child, even more particularly painful for this father was a physician and didn't know how to save his child. </sentence><sentence id="3516">So Esther and I got into our truck...our car...it was truck, and we went to that town to be with them. </sentence><sentence id="3517">When I got there the father told me in the most agonized tones I have ever heard that he had a decision to make and didn't know how to make it. </sentence><sentence id="3518">That 30 or 40 miles down the road, not in the country, was a very famous German...uh...obstetrician, pediatrician, who was barred from practicing medicine because he had not only been a Nazi, but he had done experiments on Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="3519">But, said the father, this man can save my daughter if anybody can. </sentence><sentence id="3520">He has unique information and methods that nobody in this hospital knows about. </sentence><sentence id="3521">I said, "I don't think I am asking you. </sentence><sentence id="3522">I think I am going to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="3523">Your daughter's life is more important than the fact that this man was a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="3524">If he can save your daughter's life, that's saving the world for you. </sentence><sentence id="3525">You gotta do it." </sentence><sentence id="3526">So he decided we better do that. </sentence><sentence id="3527">So I went down in my jeep and met this doctor who was living in a little cabin in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="3528">A very dignified, middle-aged man who spoke relatively good English. </sentence><sentence id="3529">I told him the circumstances and said we would pay him well to come and take care of this child. </sentence><sentence id="3530">And he said, "Alright." </sentence><sentence id="3531">And he got into the jeep with his bag and he came. </sentence><sentence id="3532">And he spent about 48 hours without sleep taking care of this baby. </sentence><sentence id="3533">And he saved her. </sentence><sentence id="3534">After it was all over, I drove him back to his cabin and gave him German money, a large sum and I said, "I trust that's enough for your services." </sentence><sentence id="3535">He said, "I don't care about the money." </sentence><sentence id="3536">He said, "I want a letter from you addressed to military government saying that you recommend that I be permitted to practice again because I saved this Jewish child." </sentence><sentence id="3537">Now I said, in effect, "Doctor, you should live so long." </sentence><sentence id="3538">And I left the money, and I left with him not being very happy with me. </sentence><sentence id="3539">The end of this story is not a pleasant one. </sentence><sentence id="3540">The child developed acute leukemia at the age of 4 and died. </sentence><sentence id="3541">The family had other children, but that was a bad blow. </sentence><sentence id="3542">That was in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3543">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3544">You know who to talk to if you want more about that one, and if that person says to you, "Cut it completely," I insist you have to do so. </sentence><sentence id="3545">She has a perfect right to her privacy and if this is too much to identification it's got to go. </sentence><sentence id="3546">Next, after the exodus we went into a bad time. </sentence><sentence id="3547">Uh...First of all, all the stuff was going on at the United Nations. </sentence><sentence id="3548">Would there be a Jewish State, whether or not there would be a Jewish State, where they'd be partitioned, wouldn't there be partition and what should we be doing meanwhile. </sentence><sentence id="3549">So I sat in my office day after day in Heidelberg doing not very much. </sentence><sentence id="3550">Uh...Taught English to a couple of medical students at Heildelberg University. </sentence><sentence id="3551">Uh...This, I think, is worthwhile story. </sentence><sentence id="3552">Uh...The University gave 15 fellowship to Jewish survivors to study medicine. </sentence><sentence id="3553">Full tuition and books. </sentence><sentence id="3554">Three of them I still have communication with. </sentence><sentence id="3555">One of them was my secretary's husband, and...uh...he practices as an internist in New York, and we are good friends. </sentence><sentence id="3556">I taught him English. </sentence><sentence id="3557">She was my secretary because she spoke Hebrew, German, Yiddish, Hungarian, Russian, and was a remarkable woman. </sentence><sentence id="3558">She still is. </sentence><sentence id="3559">Her husband is a good doctor. </sentence><sentence id="3560">Two of them are my story really. </sentence><sentence id="3561">It...uh...has to be told backwards. </sentence><sentence id="3562">About two years ago, here in Washington, my wife attended a seminar at the Washington School of Psychiatry, being conducted by two very imminent psychiatrists from the University of Cincinnati Medical School, named Ornstein. </sentence><sentence id="3563">Anna and Paul Ornstein. </sentence><sentence id="3564">They had the full day and Esther went up at the end to thank them, and Anna said to her, "Tell me your name again. </sentence><sentence id="3565">I want to remember you." </sentence><sentence id="3566">She told her her name. </sentence><sentence id="3567">Paul, who was standing about 10 feet away, came over and said, "What did you say your name was?" </sentence><sentence id="3568">She told him. </sentence><sentence id="3569">He said, "Are you by any chance related to...to Chaplain Lipman." </sentence><sentence id="3570">Anybody who calls me Chaplan Lipman goes back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3571">She said, "Yes, I am married to him." </sentence><sentence id="3572">At which point, he bursts into tears, threw his arms around her and wouldn't let her go. </sentence><sentence id="3573">He and Anna had been two of those medical students in Heidelberg. </sentence><sentence id="3574">Very poor. </sentence><sentence id="3575">They had a room in a German house. </sentence><sentence id="3576">The Germans would do nothing for them. </sentence><sentence id="3577">They lived, aside from going to medical school which they wanted to do, for Friday night for whenever I was in town we had a Shabbat service, and if anybody else could conduct one when I wasn't there, they had a Shabbat service, followed by a Shabbat dinner for all the Jews in the area. </sentence><sentence id="3578">Displaced persons, G.I.s, the Palestinians who might be passing through because our house was a way station for any illegal going through. </sentence><sentence id="3579">We had 4 bedrooms on the third floor with 12 army cots and we had as many as 14 people on a given night. </sentence><sentence id="3580">Uh...And then of course the arms and the czar. </sentence><sentence id="3581">They came and went without us. </sentence><sentence id="3582">They had a key to the cellar and they moved out. </sentence><sentence id="3583">After the service and dinner, we sit around and talked. </sentence><sentence id="3584">And it was the only adult conversation these people had and they thought of the Chaplain as somebody very special. </sentence><sentence id="3585">The next night after this revelation, Paul gave a lecture in Washington and I went and then we went out afterwards to drink coffee and begin to catch and he looked at me and he smiled and he said, "You know. </sentence><sentence id="3586">It's eerie." </sentence><sentence id="3587">I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="3588">He said, "You are only 4 years older than I am." </sentence><sentence id="3589">I said, "Oh, you're thinking of that Chaplain." </sentence><sentence id="3590">He said, "That's right. </sentence><sentence id="3591">I have never quite gotten rid of that image." </sentence><sentence id="3592">I said, "Please get rid of it (laughter) real fast." </sentence><sentence id="3593">And we have seen a great deal of one another since then, and are good friends. </sentence><sentence id="3594">The person who saved their lives in Heildelberg was a Protestant minister. </sentence><sentence id="3595">Herman Maus,...uh... whom I call the of Heildeberg. </sentence><sentence id="3596">I read an article about him once. </sentence><sentence id="3597">He had been a very famous pastor...uh...before World War II was pastor of the Holy Ghost Church of Heidelberg. </sentence><sentence id="3598">He had become a Zionist in 1933 because when he grew up in Titisay in the Black Forest, his father, a poor pastor, had not been able to send him to college. </sentence><sentence id="3599">A Jew in Titisay came to him and said, "Herman, you want to be a pastor like a father don't you?" </sentence><sentence id="3600">And he said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3601">You have to go to school, don't you." " </sentence><sentence id="3602">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3603">Okay, you go to school and I will take care of the bills. </sentence><sentence id="3604">You just be a good pastor." </sentence><sentence id="3605">The year he graduated and was ordained the Jewish friend said, "Herman, you've done well. </sentence><sentence id="3606">Before you take up your first congregation, you have a vacation coming. </sentence><sentence id="3607">He handed him some money and told him to take a vacation. </sentence><sentence id="3608">And he went to Switzerland and he turned up in Bail during the 1903 Zionist Convention, the famous one at which the Uganda Resolution was turned down, and he met Hertzl and he met Nordau and he met all of those people, and he joined up. </sentence><sentence id="3609">David Yellin became his particular friend. </sentence><sentence id="3610">He made his first trip to Palestine with his wife and daughter in 1933 this summer, and he said to David Yellin, "I'm not going back. </sentence><sentence id="3611">There is where I belong and this is where I want to stay." </sentence><sentence id="3612">And Yellin said to him, "Herman, you haven't earned the right to stay. </sentence><sentence id="3613">You have to go back and to earn it." </sentence><sentence id="3614">The daughter said, "My father can go back. </sentence><sentence id="3615">I am not going." </sentence><sentence id="3616">And the daughter remained in Jerusalem, became a weaver, until after World War II. </sentence><sentence id="3617">When her father got very old, she went back to care of them because the mother couldn't anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3618">But she lived in Palestine the whole time. </sentence><sentence id="3619">He came back and because he was a pacifist, he went to every peace meeting there was anywhere in Europe carrying messages about how to get Jewish kids out, how to save this, how to save that, and he did that until 1941 when the Germans picked him up and put him in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="3620">And he and his wife both spent the war years in a concentration camp, and they both survived. </sentence><sentence id="3621">He came back and became Dean of the Diocese, that's second to the Bishop and did several things which were characteristic of him. </sentence><sentence id="3622">First of all, every Yom Kippur, he spent all day in the synagogue and fasted as penance for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3623">Second of all, he announced to his congregation, that is to the people he dealt with, that for the rest of his life he would never preach a sermon on a New Testament theme. </sentence><sentence id="3624">That it was time that Christians went back to their origins and learned what they should have been. </sentence><sentence id="3625">He preached only out of the Hebrew bible for the rest of his life, and he never missed. </sentence><sentence id="3626">I know that. </sentence><sentence id="3627">Third of all, every Jewish displaced person around he would take food to. </sentence><sentence id="3628">He visited all of these students at least once a week bringing them food on condition that they tell nobody. </sentence><sentence id="3629">My secretary never told me that she ever had a visit from him. </sentence><sentence id="3630">Anna and Paul told me last year about their relationship with Maus. </sentence><sentence id="3631">Maus had been to my home. </sentence><sentence id="3632">I had been to his home. </sentence><sentence id="3633">He took me to meet Carl Yasburs, and we had an incomprehensible conversation one day (laughter) and...uh..but he never told me. </sentence><sentence id="3634">No one told me. </sentence><sentence id="3635">They kept their promise. </sentence><sentence id="3636">He looked after these people. </sentence><sentence id="3637">I think it's absolutely fitting that there is a large forest in Israel named for him, and it pleases me. </sentence><sentence id="3638">You know this is all part of the Heidelberg saga. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3768">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3769">Let us break at this point. </sentence><sentence id="3770">We're going to break and change tapes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3774">A: You know what we ought to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3776">Q: What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3778">A: It's a quarter after 2:00. </sentence><sentence id="3779">My own suggestion would be that we break until you have a chance to read this stuff and I have a chance to go through the letters. </sentence><sentence id="3780">I have mentioned a number of times the role that luck played in getting results and coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="3781">Luck every one in awhile reunited a family. </sentence><sentence id="3782">I have one particular memory of being in my office in Regensburg, and a young woman came in, kind of agitated and excited. </sentence><sentence id="3783">She had heard a rumor. </sentence><sentence id="3784">She had no living relatives so far as she knew. </sentence><sentence id="3785">Everybody had been killed, but she heard a rumor that maybe her younger brother had survived and was in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3786">And I said, "Do you have any idea where?" </sentence><sentence id="3787">And she said, "Yal. </sentence><sentence id="3788">I think so." </sentence><sentence id="3789">I said, "The way to find out is to go there. </sentence><sentence id="3790">There's no point in trying to do it...uh...by any other way." </sentence><sentence id="3791">So we got in my jeep and we went. </sentence><sentence id="3792">We got to this town and found a Jew and asked around and it was her brother and he was there. </sentence><sentence id="3793">And we really should have tape recorders in those days. </sentence><sentence id="3794">Every recording of the looks on their faces as they met each other, each believing...having been forced to believe that the other was dead. </sentence><sentence id="3795">Every once in awhile a tragedy occurred however in this connection. </sentence><sentence id="3796">I remember a case, sad case, which has since been written up in the annals of Jews Law. </sentence><sentence id="3797">I didn't decide it. </sentence><sentence id="3798">A guy came in to one of our communities, lived there, and did not know what had become of his wife. </sentence><sentence id="3799">Went on the assumption that she was killed. </sentence><sentence id="3800">We took a sort of informal position. </sentence><sentence id="3801">Jewish law didn't permit it, but we took it informally that as a certain date there would be a presumption that anybody who hadn't been heard from was dead. </sentence><sentence id="3802">I don't remember whether it was 2 years or what length of time. </sentence><sentence id="3803">And we...we knew this was an informal, not...uh...sanctioned, position in Jewish law, but...uh...people had to get on with their lives. </sentence><sentence id="3804">And a lot of people were just plain missing. </sentence><sentence id="3805">There was no way to find out. </sentence><sentence id="3806">And this man met a woman, wanted to marry her, and...uh...the time came and they married. </sentence><sentence id="3807">And 6 months later, his first wife turned up. </sentence><sentence id="3808">She had been off in Soviet Union over in Siberia somewhere and it had taken a long time for her to get out and to come to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3809">Under Jewish law, of course, he had to divorce both of them. </sentence><sentence id="3810">And as happens so often, one does not hear the end of the story. </sentence><sentence id="3811">I don't know with which one he ended up. </sentence><sentence id="3812">I am not sure that it matters at this point. </sentence><sentence id="3813">The dilemma...that was a very poignant one, and the fact that I have only one story out of the many hundreds of people...uh...with whom I came into contact during those 3 years is, I think, a marked statement of the propriety of making a decision that just set a date after which you have to gamble. </sentence><sentence id="3814">You gamble. </sentence><sentence id="3815">For most of the people, they had a little mazal and the gamble was okay. </sentence><sentence id="3816">When they married, they could stay married. </sentence><sentence id="3817">I don't think it's good luck that one's first spouse is dead, but there it is </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3858">Q: Under what circumstances did you leave Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3860">A: We finished our work. </sentence><sentence id="3861">We had a huge celebration in November when the partition plan was announced...uh.......decided not to send transports thereafter because what was the point of...of that, and then changed our minds because it was a good idea to keep pressure on the British and have more people go to Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="3862">So we did somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="3863">Not a great deal though. </sentence><sentence id="3864">Much of it by then was being done from Constansus or from Italy, not from France, and I simply don't know about those operations. </sentence><sentence id="3865">One of the generalizations that you have to know about is that none of us knew anything we didn't have to know. </sentence><sentence id="3866">People keep asking me did you know so and so who worked on this. </sentence><sentence id="3867">One of my closest friends in the kibitz in Israel is a man who was one of the leaders of the Berichah in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="3868">I never met him in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="3869">I met him in 1960 when I got to the kibbutz because he was not my business. </sentence><sentence id="3870">I knew what I had to know and nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="3871">In Washington, it's called "need to know." </sentence><sentence id="3872">Uh...the doctrine of secrecy. </sentence><sentence id="3873">But by February, March of 1948, it was clear that the State would come in to be, and that our work, Berichah, would end. </sentence><sentence id="3874">There would be lots of people at the camps, a lot of to become Israelis would have to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="3875">To help and to work and to teach and all the things that they were doing legally, but I was none of those things. </sentence><sentence id="3876">My operation would end. </sentence><sentence id="3877">I turned down, with thanks, the suggestion, an urgent one, from of my...uh...Israeli friends that I take Esther and our one and half children and go to Israel and fly for the upcoming air force which at that point had one and a half piper cubs, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3878">I said, "No, Thanks, that...that isn't how I wanted to die," as a matter (laughter) and decided very reluctantly to go home. </sentence><sentence id="3879">Mostly because of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3880">That there was a war coming was clear, and...uh... I had had my war. </sentence><sentence id="3881">So, in...uh...April of 48, we tried to get out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3882">It was almost as hard to get out of Germany as it was to get into Germany because the American Army had forms and you had to fill them out, and a pregnant wife caused problems. </sentence><sentence id="3883">We wanted desperately to go to Norway. </sentence><sentence id="3884">I have a thing for Scandinavia, and take the Oslo home. </sentence><sentence id="3885">They wouldn't let us. </sentence><sentence id="3886">The Oslo did not have a full-time physician on board. </sentence><sentence id="3887">Although my wife was having the healthiest pregnancy in the history of the world, but there had to be a ship with a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="3888">The Army would not take responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="3889">So we decided to come home on the SS America from Lauf, and we close up the house and shipped everything home. </sentence><sentence id="3890">Michael was very disturbed because nothing he was ever going to see again. </sentence><sentence id="3891">He was 3, and....uh...he couldn't bring his dog, and I think that bothered him more than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="3892">He...uh...he really a mess. </sentence><sentence id="3893">But we got to Paris, settled in for a couple of days and went to the boat .Two of the people in the world closest to us were Eva Kaufman, now Eva Kaufman Penn, and her late husband, Rabbi Jay Kaufman. </sentence><sentence id="3894">They had gone to Jerusalem in 1946 for Jay to get a doctorate at Hebrew University. </sentence><sentence id="3895">Uh...They tried to leave the United States in the middle of the Maritime strike, and they got held up, and stayed at our house in Staten Island. </sentence><sentence id="3896">When they left they were allowed to go, but they couldn't take the car. </sentence><sentence id="3897">They had Palestine and stayed with us until Paul was done. </sentence><sentence id="3898">It was this kind of relationship. </sentence><sentence id="3899">Then they disappeared in the wilds of Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="3900">What we heard about them once in awhile was from Jay's parents who would drop us a note saying they got a letter. </sentence><sentence id="3901">They were okay, and then we didn't get that any more for awhile because Jerusalem was under siege, and they were in the of Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="3902">We were in Paris, and we went to to the and Michael was riding a little kiddie car up and down the platform, and we suddenly heard a scream. </sentence><sentence id="3903">It was Eva. </sentence><sentence id="3904">She and Jay had tickets for the same ship to come home. </sentence><sentence id="3905">Coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="3906">And she was 2 weeks more pregnant than Esther, and we had a 5 day trip across the Atlantic which was an extraordinary experience, just trying to catch up with one another with these two very pregnant ladies. </sentence><sentence id="3907">Their son, their first child, was born on Israel's independence day, and our second child was born 2 weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="3908">I had had an offer from Henry Montaur, the head of the UJA, and the world's greatest fund raiser in all of history. </sentence><sentence id="3909">I would add here that the 1948 UJA campaign raised a hundred and 80 million dollars. </sentence><sentence id="3910">As of that date, that was the largest fund raising campaign in private hands in the history of the world. </sentence><sentence id="3911">And it was not surpassed for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="3912">Now, of course, it sounds like small money thanks to inflation, but it was an absolutely amazing out-pouring of money. </sentence><sentence id="3913">Uh...And I spent 3 months doing speaking full time. </sentence><sentence id="3914">One of my first speeches was on the night of Israel's independence. </sentence><sentence id="3915">I went to Norfolk, Virginia, to speak. </sentence><sentence id="3916">Why was I sent to Norfolk? </sentence><sentence id="3917">Because the featured speaker was the Senator from Kentucky, Alban Berkley, shortly to become Vice President of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3918">Now Barkley was one of the world's worst speakers in terms of content, but he was an affable pleasant guy and he loved Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3919">And he went around making speeches for Jews and for Israel and for Zionism all the time. </sentence><sentence id="3920">So he was to be the featured speaker. </sentence><sentence id="3921">He made a very short speech. </sentence><sentence id="3922">He walked over, wrapped himself in the Israel flag, and the cameras popped and I made a sort of content speech. </sentence><sentence id="3923">Only later I discovered how much money he was paid for all the speeches he made for the Zionist movement and for Israel and for the UJA and the rest. </sentence><sentence id="3924">Fortunately, I make it a practice not to have illusions about public figures, so I didn't get disillusioned about him. </sentence><sentence id="3925">Uh...He was not a pleasant experience. </sentence><sentence id="3926">Most of them were very pleasant experiences because to watch people give more money than they ought to give...uh...has its beauties. </sentence><sentence id="3927">And the statements they made. </sentence><sentence id="3928">Uh...I didn't fight in the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="3929">I was too old. </sentence><sentence id="3930">I was not involved in the decimation of our people in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="3931">Therefore, the least I can do is pay for it. </sentence><sentence id="3932">And the money poured in. </sentence><sentence id="3933">Unbelievable amounts of money. </sentence><sentence id="3934">I learned to respect sacrificial giving for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="3935">There has been very little of it, of course, but I respect it when I find it. </sentence><sentence id="3936">I was invited to go to Hawaii to open their campaign. </sentence><sentence id="3937">That was exciting. </sentence><sentence id="3938">Never been to Hawaii. </sentence><sentence id="3939">And I understood that the Hawaii Jewish community was all excited. </sentence><sentence id="3940">When you're that far away, you get more excitement. </sentence><sentence id="3941">Excitement grows in direct proportion to the distance from the action. </sentence><sentence id="3942">And...uh...Montra called, asked me to go. </sentence><sentence id="3943">I said, "What dates?" </sentence><sentence id="3944">And he said, "Well, the affair is on June 2nd, but you would have to go a day or 2 early because it's a long way." </sentence><sentence id="3945">And I said, "Forget it. </sentence><sentence id="3946">Not me. </sentence><sentence id="3947">We're due to have a baby right on June 2nd." </sentence><sentence id="3948">And...uh...he kinda said, "So what?" </sentence><sentence id="3949">And I understood that. </sentence><sentence id="3950">I said, "Well, I wasn't there when the first one was born, and I have solemn advice from my wife that if I am not there when the second one is born, there won't be a third and I won't have a wife. </sentence><sentence id="3951">And I believe her." </sentence><sentence id="3952">And he was a little bit upset, but he accepted that. </sentence><sentence id="3953">As it happens, the child was born on June the Ist so it was very sensible of me to stay home. </sentence><sentence id="3954">Those 3 months were exhilarating and exhausting. </sentence><sentence id="3955">And then I settled down for the first time since I had become a Rabbi to be a Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3956">I accepted a position at our seminary to teach and to get my doctorate and we moved to Cincinnati and became people for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="3957">No longer did our son Michael get into a pullman berth and say, "Home," which he had done a number of times when he was 2 years old and traveling constantly. </sentence><sentence id="3958">I'm done. </sentence><sentence id="3959">Finished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
