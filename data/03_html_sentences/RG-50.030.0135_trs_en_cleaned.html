<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Uh...My father was a small jeweler in the mill district of Pittsburgh, my mother a Pittsburgher by the way. </sentence><sentence id="14">My father was born in Europe...uh...had and raised children and was the compliant homemaker. </sentence><sentence id="15">Uh...We never had any money. </sentence><sentence id="16">My grandparents,...uh...all four, lived in Pittsburgh until my grandfather, my paternal went off to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="17">In 1925 or 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebration, and then came back permanently during World War II because the idea of the Germans taking over Palestine was an unpleasant idea to him and so he came back and he died in Pittsburgh. </sentence><sentence id="18">We are a long lived family. </sentence><sentence id="19">My paternal grandfather was 93 at the time of his death. </sentence><sentence id="20">Uh...I grew up in this mill district of Pittsburgh to the age of 7, then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill because I had to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill, and I completed my high school education at High School, 40 percent Jewish and...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="21">And started the Pitt because I could live at home and go to Pitt. </sentence><sentence id="22">This was depression time. </sentence><sentence id="23">And then in 38...Solomon Freuhauf who was my mentor in this Rabbi business decided that I was wasting my time in Pittsburgh and sent me off to Cincinnati. </sentence><sentence id="24">I went to Hebrew College in Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="25">They were across the street from the other...from each other. </sentence><sentence id="26">They still are. </sentence><sentence id="27">And...uh...got my degree from University of Cincinnati, finished it HUC in 1943, having accelerated a year because they needed chaplains so badly. </sentence><sentence id="28">And...uh...so we went to school for 22 straight months in order to accomplish this. </sentence><sentence id="29">No professor would allow us to give up a course. </sentence><sentence id="30">How can you be a chaplain without my course in mid rush five, one of them was known to say. </sentence><sentence id="31">Uh...It was required by the military that you have a year of experience before you can go into chaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in Fort Worth, Texas, who went into the Navy and spent a very uncomfortable year there. </sentence><sentence id="32">I was 23 years old and everybody I met in the street 23 years old was in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="33">Uh...The entire American army was in Texas. </sentence><sentence id="34">And...uh...I was not in uniform so as soon as I could get into uniform, I got into uniform. </sentence><sentence id="35">Uh...We had married...in...1943, the day after ordination. </sentence><sentence id="36">It was a long weekend, and...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Dean, tell me about...uh...the gentleman in Texas. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections. </sentence><sentence id="98">He came up to me after services on Yom Kippur and introduced himself. </sentence><sentence id="99">We had never met. </sentence><sentence id="100">I had been there all of about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all Rabbis were chicken. </sentence><sentence id="101">And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, "When do we start." </sentence><sentence id="102">And he said, "Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock." </sentence><sentence id="103">And (laughter) I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="104">I can't do it tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="105">Give me a couple days." </sentence><sentence id="106">Because, among other things, I didn't have a flight jacket. </sentence><sentence id="107">And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket. </sentence><sentence id="108">You couldn't go up in an airplane. </sentence><sentence id="109">They were open. </sentence><sentence id="110">There were no closed airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="111">That's a long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="112">So he taught me to fly in his little piper cub which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I notified the...uh...Jewish Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing this in case it was of interest. </sentence><sentence id="113">And the Chief Chaplain's office was very interested, they said. </sentence><sentence id="114">So I got my license and...uh...after Chaplain's school, which was 5 weeks we got our assignments and I was signed to the armored force. </sentence><sentence id="115">And I thought, you know, "Typical Army screw up!" </sentence><sentence id="116">But...uh...It was done deliberately. </sentence><sentence id="117">I found out that they just didn't want Chaplains flying airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="118">They wanted Chaplains praying for troops. </sentence><sentence id="119">And so I did go to Europe instead of doing Island hopping in the Pacific was what they had been talking about. </sentence><sentence id="120">So | arrived in Europe in...uh...April 1945. </sentence><sentence id="121">The...uh...voyage was of interest historically. </sentence><sentence id="122">I became the radio announcer on the plane...I...on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="123">I probably was the only one who could read English, something of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="124">And several times a day I did news broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner. </sentence><sentence id="125">Uh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of Franklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way overseas. </sentence><sentence id="126">That was a very discouraging and depressing...uh...idea. </sentence><sentence id="127">Who...who was Truman became a very important question to those of us who were on our way overseas. </sentence><sentence id="128">We also had a...uh... marathon bridge game going. </sentence><sentence id="129">It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army career ever suggested that we play bridge for money. </sentence><sentence id="130">Never did. </sentence><sentence id="131">There were eight of us in this bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep. </sentence><sentence id="132">And...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days. </sentence><sentence id="133">Several million points were involved in my losses. </sentence><sentence

series of boxing matches and they couldn't find a heavy weight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had fought a couple of times before. </sentence><sentence id="137">We sort of sparred around for three rounds. </sentence><sentence id="138">I...uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by ambulance from dockside to an Evac hospital just outside Lahov in France. </sentence><sentence id="139">And the rumor went around that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been hospitalized. </sentence><sentence id="140">And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back home again because I was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="141">I heard that long after I got into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="142">Couple...couple of people were surprised to see me. </sentence><sentence id="143">I was in this hospital for 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="144">The hospital chaplain, who was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of bicycles and he and I peddled each night into this little village where he had met a French couple, and we played bridge in French, which was fun. </sentence><sentence id="145">Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to work. </sentence><sentence id="146">So I...uh...was put onto a troop train headed for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="147">Typical 40 and 8 box car and I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me, and then I was standing at the entrance to this box car waiting for the train to start and some sergeant was walking up and down yelling, "Who can talk French? </sentence><sentence id="148">Who knows some French?" </sentence><sentence id="149">So, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... "Will some French do?" </sentence><sentence id="150">And he says, "Three words will do. </sentence><sentence id="151">And Colonel needs a French translator." </sentence><sentence id="152">So I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because he was in the transportation corps running these troop trains which didn't require much military skill. </sentence><sentence id="153">And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his car which was not a box car. </sentence><sentence id="154">It was a heated Pullman car and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going into France. </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh...My job was every time the...uh... train stopped to tear up to the other end to the engineer and ask him what was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="156">And he told me, "Signal." ( </sentence><sentence id="157">laughing) Every time, it was "Red Signal. </sentence><sentence id="158">I can't go." </sentence><sentence id="159">And I went back and told the Colonel who was quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="160">I had lots of bad books to read. </sentence><sentence id="161">I had a fine, fine trip into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="162">Uh...wasn't wanted in Germany at that time. </sentence><sentence id="163">No one knew what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was moved back to a town in Belgium called Verea, and...uh...as a casual. </sentence><sentence id="165">I did not have an assignment. </sentence><sentence id="166">And then V.E. day came, and we celebrated V.E. day by going from our camp which was outside Verea into Verea to watch the celebration and to celebrate. </sentence><sentence id="167">I was depressed. </sentence><sentence id="168">I didn't feel like celebrating. </sentence><sentence id="169">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="170">I...Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to celebrate as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="171">The world was over, but in the square in Verea, I saw some men and women in concentration camp uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="172">Clearly! </sentence><sentence id="173">Uh...I knew what they were, and they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them. </sentence><sentence id="174">They recognized my insignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into. </sentence><sentence id="175">They were Buchenwald graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust whom I met. </sentence><sentence id="176">Uh... They didn't want anything. </sentence><sentence id="177">I didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="178">Uh... But we talked, and...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories. </sentence><sentence id="179">They were followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years. </sentence><sentence id="180">I did get an assignment to 22nd Corps Headquarters in the Rhineland. </sentence><sentence id="181">Our town was Hildan, not to far from Cologne, and I moved in. </sentence><sentence id="182">Large territory, all of the Rhineland, including Cologne. </sentence><sentence id="183">A lot of troops. </sentence><sentence id="184">Theoretically, we were conducting services for all those troops. </sentence><sentence id="185">I got a jeep and went to work. </sentence><sentence id="186">Early discovered that a lot of German Jews and a lot of East European Jews had come into the area not in displaced persons camps, but living on their own where they could find a place to live, which many of them could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="187">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="188"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection not do. </sentence><sentence id="189">So I began to do three things. </sentence><sentence id="190">First of all to push military government to find housing for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income and they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a UNRRA installation. </sentence><sentence id="191">And...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing concentration camp uniforms, and that was not a very good idea. </sentence><sentence id="192">Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted of a gang coming together. </sentence><sentence id="193">There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to them,...uh... "Anybody need to say cottage, ...uh...there was frequently somebody who needed to say cottage, so we had a short service cottage, and then I said, "Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="194">We need food. </sentence><sentence id="195">Let's go get it." </sentence><sentence id="196">And after the first time in each of these installations, anybody who could beg, borrow or steal a truck...uh...came with truck, and we went to army depots and we got food. </sentence><sentence id="197">Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it. </sentence><sentence id="198">I have often had a nightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will some day. </sentence><sentence id="199">My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...1 know that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in France in World War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had signed a memorandum receipt for in France, and had never turned in. ... </sentence><sentence id="200">Uh...Actually, he had turned it in, but the Army didn't think so. </sentence><sentence id="201">So he had a correspondence with the army for many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so someday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it. </sentence><sentence id="202">We just stole it. </sentence><sentence id="203">And there were millions of tons of supplies stashed in depots around the area and...uh...they should be used. </sentence><sentence id="204">And they were. </sentence><sentence id="205">We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="206">Couldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear. </sentence><sentence id="207">There were socks. </sentence><sentence id="208">There were shoes. </sentence><sentence id="209">There were jackets and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="210">So, we were starting a pretty good system going when orders came out moving us. </sentence><sentence id="211">Uh... The British were taking over our area. </sentence><sentence id="212">There had been negotiations and most of the Rhineland became British zone. </sentence><sentence id="213">And in typical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was Plezn, Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="214">We packed up and we started across Germany. </sentence><sentence id="215">Before that happened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I decided that I better do something in this part of Germany that needed doing for me. </sentence><sentence id="216">I went to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="217">Took a 3 day pass and took my jeep and went down to Dachau where Abe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto himself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing. </sentence><sentence id="218">Uh...My reaction to Dachau was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to Dachau to be. </sentence><sentence id="219">There was still 30 odd thousand Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="220">Some were dying each day cause there was no way for them to make it. </sentence><sentence id="221">Most of them were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="222">They didn't look like they were going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said they were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="223">Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he had this fine clothing for them. </sentence><sentence id="224">I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes out of a German Army warehouse just by going in, opening the doors, and taking them. </sentence><sentence id="225">And...uh...Every day he had people to bury. </sentence><sentence id="226">I...uh...often have said to people who are skeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off approximately how many...uh...feet of space it takes in full directions to make a rectangle that would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back. </sentence><sentence id="228">On the way to Czechoslovakia, we went through Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="229">And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the Germans didn't know about concentration camps cause when we went into the marvelous This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="230">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="231"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection old town of Yana, and into the wonderful former capitol of the German Republic of Weimar, I saw smoke. </sentence><sentence id="232">And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not the...uh...crematorium fires, but the fires at the Buchenwald concentration camp where there were still people. </sentence><sentence id="233">You could see them. </sentence><sentence id="234">They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of those two towns. </sentence><sentence id="235">I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right way during those years...uh...you could smell Buchenwald without any trouble. </sentence><sentence id="236">We got to Plzen, and I settled into my room, and to my office. </sentence><sentence id="237">Uh...

</sentence><sentence id="296">To feed donuts to G.L."s?" </sentence><sentence id="297">And he said, "Yes, because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas, and you are going to be able to help Jews. </sentence><sentence id="298">There will be survivors, and they are going to need all kinds of help and you're just the type to do it." </sentence><sentence id="299">He was right. </sentence><sentence id="300">She was just the type. </sentence><sentence id="301">She got into the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="302">She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first concentration camps in France...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids who survived, and that was the transport that went to Palestine legally...uh...after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="303">She landed in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="304">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="305">And was the director of the Red Cross club in downtown Plzen. </sentence><sentence id="306">She had four other women working with her. </sentence><sentence id="307">And from early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and talked and chatted with American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="308">Then they closed up for the night, and they opened the back door and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="309">Uh...Sylvia asked me if I wanted to help Jews. </sentence><sentence id="310">Since that's why I went to Europe, I agreed "Yal," and...uh...asked her what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="311">She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade group which was in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="312">They had been attached to the British army in Italy, had fought through the war, and at the end of the war were in town called Trevisio, way up in the Italian Alps. </sentence><sentence id="313">Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent ambulances and they sent trucks over the hills into Austria and they began to move Jews into Italy to get on ships, illegal of course, to go to Palestine, and would I help with this enterprise? </sentence><sentence id="314">We could send Jews from Czechoslovakia into Austria and the Brigade would pick them up and take them to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="315">That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year old kid. </sentence><sentence id="316">Cops and robbers! </sentence><sentence id="317">And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the American zone of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="318">Actually, it was out of all of Czechoslovakia, because at that point the border between the American zone and the Russian zone was an open border. </sentence><sentence id="319">We were still friendly. </sentence><sentence id="320">We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="321">So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in Czechoslovakia I wanted to go for my purposes. </sentence><sentence id="322">And...uh...two things happened. </sentence><sentence id="323">First, Sylvia and I went over to Prague. </sentence><sentence id="324">There were 6,000 Jews in the Rothchild Hospital there without a place to go, and new people were coming in all the time. </sentence><sentence id="325">Some from Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="326">First time I had heard of Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="327">Others from further East coming West because they had no intentions of living in the East. </sentence><sentence id="328">Uh...Poland was not a place for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="329">Uh...They didn't want to live in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="330">They didn't want to Czech. </sentence><sentence id="331">They didn't want to live in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="332">They wanted out. </sentence><sentence id="333">And they would come to a Jewish center hoping that somebody would have some ideas about how to get out. </sentence><sentence id="334">They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="335">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="336"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection important function. </sentence><sentence id="337">We'll talk about that some more when we come back to Abe Klausner. </sentence><sentence id="338">We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the Rothchild Hospital to...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the city of Plzen. </sentence><sentence id="339">From Prague to Plzen is only about 40 or 50 miles. </sentence><sentence id="340">The only way to get there is by train. </sentence><sentence id="341">We then proceeded to type one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person to travel from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for relatives. </sentence><sentence id="342">We looked around Plzen for the biggest stamp we could find. </sentence><sentence id="343">I haven't any idea what it was about, but we found one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this thing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document. </sentence><sentence id="344">And...uh...We would collect them when the people came into Plzen and then take them back to Prague because I could travel. </sentence><sentence id="345">And...uh...leave them at our Headquarters, hospital and a new group would come. </sentence><sentence id="346">Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time. </sentence><sentence id="347">We didn't want large groups taking over trains, so they came in every day. </sentence><sentence id="348">And they reported to us at the Red Cross Club after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov displaced persons camp which was just on the edge of Plzen. </sentence><sentence id="349">It was an UNRRA camp. </sentence><sentence id="350">We were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="351">I went out to the camp to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some time in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="352">His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, "Tell me. </sentence><sentence id="353">Does the C stand for Carnegie?," </sentence><sentence id="354">and he said, "How do you know?" </sentence><sentence id="355">I said, "Because anybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that your middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from Pittsburgh." </sentence><sentence id="356">And he said, "Amazing." </sentence><sentence id="357">I said, "Yal, So am I." And we talked and he said, "Lipman. </sentence><sentence id="358">Lipman. </sentence><sentence id="359">Is your old man a jeweler?" </sentence><sentence id="360">And I said, "Yal." </sentence><sentence id="361">And he said, "I bought my wedding ring from him." </sentence><sentence id="362">His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his camp..We used for transportation to Austria and the answer was U.S. Army trucks. </sentence><sentence id="363">And who drove them? </sentence><sentence id="364">U.S. Army personnel. </sentence><sentence id="365">Why did they do it? </sentence><sentence id="366">Scotch. </sentence><sentence id="367">And some money. </sentence><sentence id="368">We did not want people doing us favors. </sentence><sentence id="369">We were commercial. </sentence><sentence id="370">Uh...We made a trip down to the Austrian border and made the discovery that the only bridge across the Danu...Australian Rivers that we knew about was a military bridge and we weren't about to use that. </sentence><sentence id="371">So we went down the road looking for a way to get across that blasted river, and we found one. </sentence><sentence id="372">It was an old dam no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide enough at the top for an Army 6-pods to get across with about 6 inches of play on each side. </sentence><sentence id="373">And that's the one we used. </sentence><sentence id="374">We went across the dam into Austria and found our way either to Lintz or to Gratz or to Saltsport, depending on whether the Brigade told us to bring this bunch of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="375">Others, it worked. </sentence><sentence id="376">But I have to tell you where we got the liquor because that involves one of my more favorite memories. </sentence><sentence id="377">I was entitled to a few bottles of Scotch a week as a...I was a Captain by then. </sentence><sentence id="378">That wasn't enough because we needed at least a dozen to 20 trucks or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="379">Uh...One of the breaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this...

He says, "Anything else I can do for you?" </sentence><sentence id="408">And I said, "Yal. </sentence><sentence id="409">You're a Bird Colonel. </sentence><sentence id="410">You get all the liquor you want, don't you?" </sentence><sentence id="411">He said, "I wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="412">I don't drink." </sentence><sentence id="413">I said, "I knew that, but you're about to." </sentence><sentence id="414">And he listened and he said a couple of people in supply are going to be awfully (laughing) surprised. </sentence><sentence id="415">I said, "You don't have to explain what you're doing with it. </sentence><sentence id="416">It's for charitable purposes that you getting into Protestant charities in Czechoslovakia which is your bound duty as a Christian." </sentence><sentence id="417">And he smiled and he thought that made sense, and I got all the liquor I wanted from then on, on his tab. </sentence><sentence id="418">Bless his heart. </sentence><sentence id="419">I was...I heard of his death in the early 50s, and I was very sorry. </sentence><sentence id="420">He was a good, good man. </sentence><sentence id="421">He saved my life, and saved Jews. </sentence><sentence id="422">That operation worked very well until August when...uh...we got caught in one of the Austria towns. </sentence><sentence id="423">Red handed! </sentence><sentence id="424">The whole bunch of us! </sentence><sentence id="425">We had not yet transferred these people to the Jewish Brigade...uh...and we got picked up. </sentence><sentence id="426">And I got terrible reaming from a General who announced me that he was going to radio my General immediately, and I would be court-martialed. </sentence><sentence id="427">And...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me. </sentence><sentence id="428">General Hubner, who was known as the little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="429">He didn't want Jews in his territory. </sentence><sentence id="430">I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only displaced persons who were difficult. </sentence><sentence id="431">All other displaced persons, and there were 20 some nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the Germans imported for labor purposes. </sentence><sentence id="432">They were grateful for being alive, for being fed by UNRRA where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were no hurry to go home. </sentence><sentence id="433">The Jews were not grateful. </sentence><sentence id="434">The Jews were in terrible conflict over being alive, over having survived. </sentence><sentence id="435">They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they wanted out, and nobody would let them out. </sentence><sentence id="436">And so they caused more trouble than everybody else put together. </sentence><sentence id="437">Some of us understood it. </sentence><sentence id="438">We tried to organize it so that it wasn't too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="439">In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that we always have. </sentence><sentence id="440">For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was was in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted everything. </sentence><sentence id="441">It was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="442">And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think that should be understandable that they were not. </sentence><sentence id="443">So General Hubnere said, "Get them out of here. </sentence><sentence id="444">I don't care." </sentence><sentence id="445">He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved. </sentence><sentence id="446">One incident will illustrate this. </sentence><sentence id="447">He called Sylvia and me in one day. </sentence><sentence id="448">Now I had never met General Hubner. </sentence><sentence id="449">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="450">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="451"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Uh...Captains don't monkey around much with 3-star generals. </sentence><sentence id="452">There are layers of bureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cross women don't have a lot to do with Generals, though Sylvia had had more to do with Hubner than most because she was always making demands. </sentence><sentence id="453">Sylvia was a tough, tough lady. </sentence><sentence id="454">And Sylvia told the General...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to monkey with the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="455">He needed the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="456">Those donuts were very precious. </sentence><sentence id="457">Donuts and coffee kept American troops going. </sentence><sentence id="458">Uh...He called us in and said, "I hear there is going to be a Jewish meeting in London to talk about the future of all these Jews." </sentence><sentence id="459">And we said, "Yep." </sentence><sentence id="460">And he said, "You're going. </sentence><sentence id="461">You go my plane. </sentence><sentence id="462">When does the meeting start?" </sentence><sentence id="463">And we told and he said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="464">Two days before that, get out there and tell them for me to get all these Jews out of here. </sentence><sentence id="465">They should do everything they can do to get them out fast. </sentence><sentence id="466">It's not good for them and it is not good for us either." </sentence><sentence id="467">And he said it not unkindly, but he wasn't smiling. </sentence><sentence id="468">And Sylvia and I flew to London to the special Zionist Congress that was called in July in London, the chief purpose of which was to set the course that would lead to...uh...Israel's independence 3 years later, which meant that Ben-Gurion had a fight with Wietzman and Ben-Gurion wiped up the floor with Wietzman in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which, for me, is pretty unforgettable. </sentence><sentence id="469">Uh...What did he say? </sentence><sentence id="470">He did what Ben-Gurion always did. </sentence><sentence id="471">Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first to tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way up. </sentence><sentence id="472">Sometimes I felt like he was going it minute by minute. </sentence><sentence id="473">Four hours was not his longest speech. </sentence><sentence id="474">Uh...He has made longer. </sentence><sentence id="475">And then rehearsing the Zionist movement from Belu all the way up...uh...and then minute by minute the events of World War II, subjectively stated so that Wietzman looked like an idiot who played the British and he was the savior who was going to see to it that we had a Jewish State. </sentence><sentence id="476">And they believed him. </sentence><sentence id="477">And Wietzman was really not in condition to do a proper answer. </sentence><sentence id="478">Wietzman aged 10 years in 5 days, and he became the old man, the inevitable person to the first President of the State. </sentence><sentence id="479">Powerless and ceremonial. </sentence><sentence id="480">That's what Wietzman became as of that day. </sentence><sentence id="481">Ben- Gurion became the leader of the Zionist movement. </sentence><sentence id="482">Uh...Sylvia and I did not spend much time in sessions. </sentence><sentence id="483">We spent our time meeting people that Steven Wise told us to meet to tell them about Czechoslovakia, to tell them about displaced persons, to tell them about the Haganah, and to urge certain kinds of support, none of which we had yet gotten. </sentence><sentence id="484">I met some fascinating people. </sentence><sentence id="485">Uh...I discovered this Lord Reading. </sentence><sentence id="486">Rufus Isaacs had gout, and that Lady Reading was really a lady and as passionate about...uh...Jewish things as any convert could be and...uh...all the leaders of the Zionist movement wanted to hear from us. </sentence><sentence id="487">We were the only people there from the occupied territories. </sentence><sentence id="488">That is, from Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria. </sentence><sentence id="489">Nobody else there. </sentence><sentence id="490">Because nobody could get there. </sentence><sentence id="491">It never occurred to them for some reason or other to send some displaced persons over to tell the thing first person. </sentence><sentence id="492">There wasn't a single one there. </sentence><sentence id="493">So we were busy. </sentence><sentence id="494">And the General made that possible because that's how he wanted to get rid of the Jews. ( </sentence><sentence id="495">Laughter) Benevolently! </sentence><sentence id="496">So he did not court martial me. </sentence><sentence id="497">He called me in. </sentence><sentence id="498">Actually, it was the Chief Staff who called me in and said, "We got this TWX from Austria." " </sentence><sentence id="499">Yes, Sir." " </sentence><sentence id="500">What the Hell have you been up to?" " </sentence><sentence id="501">TWX tells you what I have been up to."

get going. </sentence><sentence id="1896">The Army had an airplane ready to go to...uh...what is now Ben Guron airport, then called Lud to pick up the first group to bring them. </sentence><sentence
