<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="67"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 4 grandparents and parents, a part of that town, particularly, of course, of -- of the Jewish community? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: My grandfather, Haim Kabiljo, he, as I mentioned earlier, was a sexton, and his main function was, as a sexton, to keep the synagogue in an order, make sure that it's clean, that it was -- all the things that are needed. </sentence><sentence id="69">And also, one of the big problem was that we had a very small Jewish community and one of the big problems was trying to get a minyan, or a quorum, for the services every day. </sentence><sentence id="70">So he would go searching for people, men. </sentence><sentence id="71">In those days, only men counted for the quorum. </sentence><sentence id="72">He would go around searching and asking them to come to the services. </sentence><sentence id="73">I failed to mention, when he got a little older, and his children were grown up, he s-started sort of s -- a little store, what they sold was yard goods, mostly. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was a very small store, and one of my aunts, I think she was next to the youngest of his children, she worked in that store. </sentence><sentence id="75">My grandfather was well known in the Jewish community, as one can imagine, and my mother had just terrific memories and she always talked about him after he passed away. </sentence><sentence id="76">But I was about nine years old when he died, so I remember him. </sentence><sentence id="77">When we would go visit our parents in our store, we would take a walk and go say hello to him, or we would meet him sometimes on the street and I remember every time we met him, he would reach in his little pocket, which is -- he had a watch in the pocket, watch with a chain, and he would pull out a coin. </sentence><sentence id="78">A Yugoslav coin was called a dinar. </sentence><sentence id="79">He always had a dinar for me. </sentence><sentence id="80">That was good for an ice cream or a couple of candies. </sentence><sentence id="81">So ah -- we had tremendous memories of him. </sentence><sentence id="82">Our grandmother, she was a little bit rougher. </sentence><sentence id="83">She didn't have the finesse to deal with the little children. </sentence><sentence id="84">So our USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 5 memories are not as good as -- about her. </sentence><sentence id="85">Now, my other grandmother, I remember her. </sentence><sentence id="86">She was a very hard working woman. </sentence><sentence id="87">She was a good cook and a good baker and she made lots of sweets, which we always enjoyed. </sentence><sentence id="88">She would ship them to us. </sentence><sentence id="89">Once a year we would get a package of all kinds of goods, jellies, marmalades, cookies. </sentence><sentence id="90">Even a homemade salami, occasionally, which I didn't care too much for, because it had an onion-y smell to it. </sentence><sentence id="91">But these are memories of a childhood. </sentence><sentence id="92">Since then, I learned to love onions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Can you talk some about the role that your faith played in your family when you were growing up? </sentence><sentence id="120">What was -- What were the habits of how your family observed their faith? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="124">Well, our faith was a central thing in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="125">Both my mother and father had grown up in the religious homes. </sentence><sentence id="126">We are what is known na -- here, as Sephardic, which, for those who don't know, means that we are descendant of the Jews who lived in Spain, and after the expulsion, they went to either Turkey, or they went to Genoa and crossed over to Italy, or they went to Turkey and moved with the Turkish occupation. </sentence><sentence id="127">They moved further up and of course Sarajevo was Turkish outpost and that's where they -- they must have come that route, I think. </sentence><sentence id="128">Although Split was settled by Jews of Italian descent, which means that the most people who live i -- most Jews who lived in Split, came from Spain, through Genoa, through Italy, and crossed over the Adriatic, into Split. </sentence><sentence id="129">As I said, our -- our religion played a central role in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="130">We observed all of the holidays, quite religiously. </sentence><sentence id="131">We never went to school on any of the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="132">We maintained a kosher home, and we -- the education was such in Yugoslavia, that the   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 6 primary subject in the public school was religion. </sentence><sentence id="133">So, because we were a very small minority, when the priest would come to teach religion, we would be excused, we would have a free period. </sentence><sentence id="134">And there is a payback, later we would have to go twice a week to the -- some facility, usually was one central school, well all -- where all the Jewish kids would come and we would have Jewish education, which consisted of course, of religious observances, Hebrew, history and well, songs and such. </sentence><sentence id="135">That's about what I remember, as a young child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: Can you remember anything -- and perhaps share it with us, that your parents taught you, not just about religion, but the -- the place of Jews in your town? </sentence><sentence id="151">Where did they fit into town? </sentence><sentence id="152">Do you remember them talking about that, or what was your perception of where they fit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Well, I think the Jews were in -- in the town of Split, they were pretty well integrated with the general community. </sentence><sentence id="157">Most of the Jews in Split were either small merchant -- and I'm emphasizing small, or they were professional people, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and such. </sentence><sentence id="158">So, I don't think that there was too much distinction, as I was growing up. </sentence><sentence id="159">The -- We had, in the neighborhood, we were totally integrated and in the business community, you sa -- s -- have, let's say, shoe stores, there would be several of them, one might be owned by a Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="160">The rest would be owned by the local, whatever religion. </sentence><sentence id="161">Prevailing religion in Split, was of course, Roman Catholicism, and -- but they also had a few, I guess you might call them Serbian Orthodox, or Eastern Orthodox, but prevailing Serbs. </sentence><sentence id="162">So, we were -- as kids we were lumped with s-some of the Eastern   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 7 Orthodox in school, because we were the ones -- we and them, were the ones who were told we can be excused during the religious instructions in the class. </sentence><sentence id="163">But the classes were conducted still -- there was a big crucifix on the wall and everybody had to say the Catholic prayers, which we would just stand up and not say them. </sentence><sentence id="164">But this was true fo -- both of us, and the Serbian Orthodox kids. </sentence><sentence id="165">And some -- some classes, there were a few of those and few Jews. </sentence><sentence id="166">Sometimes I would be the only one of my faith or only one who was not a Roman Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="167">So I -- I didn't feel too much of a -- a burden, and especially when it was time to be excused. </sentence><sentence id="168">I accepted that gladly. </sentence><sentence id="169">Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: What was the reaction when you stood and you did not say the Catholic prayers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Well, I think that -- I had a teacher who liked me. </sentence><sentence id="187">I was the best student in class. </sentence><sentence id="188">That was my -- I don't know whether that was a burden I carried, but I enjoyed studies. </sentence><sentence id="189">So -- And I was a very, very small kid for my age. </sentence><sentence id="190">Everybody towered over me. </sentence><sentence id="191">So everybody considered me like a -- I don't know, like a little puppy and the teacher did, too. </sentence><sentence id="192">I remember now, that I'm being asked to recall some of these things, I remember I would be cuddled by every teacher over there. </sentence><sentence id="193">We didn't have any male teachers, just female teachers, and they were all single, not -- none of them usually were married. </sentence><sentence id="194">Anyway, so, nobody ever said anything. </sentence><sentence id="195">I -- I know, in fact, later on, at one point, I learned from somebody that there was a possibility of having an interfaith prayer. </sentence><sentence id="196">So I suggested that, and she accepted it for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="197">I guess she was reprimanded later on. </sentence><sentence id="198">But this came -- There was at -- somebody who had left Romania and moved to Yugoslavia and this one young girl said that they had that ecumenical prayers. </sentence><sentence id="199">So she gave me the translation of    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 8 the Romanian ecumenical prayer, which I -- which is the one that I brought to my teacher, and that's the one that was tried, for awhile, anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: So a-at this point, you're quite comfortable and assertive about who you are? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Today, you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: No, at this point, i-in your life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Oh, you -- you mean like [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: You're -- You're a young boy, but you're very clear about saying that you were quite comfortable with the mix of people and also saying that I am Jewish and I would like my faith included here, if possible. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Yeah, well, that was true for a long while. </sentence><sentence id="223">However, the situation started changing with the political situation. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I would say the first changes were when Hitler took over Austria and there was pressure on every country nearby, to sign up with the axis powers. </sentence><sentence id="225">So, there was again, like I mentioned to you earlier, I was told once not to talk about politics, but this is not politics, this is -- this relates to the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="226">There was a party in the -- in that area, the Croatian area, called Ustashi and they were beginning to rise up, with assistance from the Austrian government and later from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="227">And they were agitating, and of course, they took the same -- Hitler's, you know, values, and preachings and that's -- at that point, started getting somewhat -- more and more uncomfortable for us. </sentence><sentence id="228">In fact, occasionally, we w -- we would be attacked by the local kids and I'm not talking about stealing our lunch, or anything like that, although that took    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 9 place on occasions, but just for the sake of playing the role that they heard from their parents, who were sympathizers of the Fascist governments. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: C-Can you do -- remember one of those incidents, just so we could get a clearer picture of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Oh yeah, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="240">The -- Split was located on the sea and there were areas, the beach, and Saturday morning I was always at the synagogue and we didn't have school Saturday and others -- friends of mine my age, and I, we -- we were pretty close, so Saturday after the services, we would go for a walk, and there was areas in the city that were well known for people walking. </sentence><sentence id="241">But we would go further, we would go to the areas that are beach fronts and in the winter months this was sort of nice, because it wasn't crowded -- it wasn't too crowded. </sentence><sentence id="242">There were people there, because Split was in a -- I won't call it temperate zone, but it was very comfortable, especially if you could be shielded from the wind, and our beaches were shielded. </sentence><sentence id="243">So, we would go walk, maybe even take our shoes off and walk in the -- on the surf. </sentence><sentence id="244">And sometimes, or one time, wasn't just one time, but often, some of these other kids from the neighborhood would start throwing the rocks at us, and stones. </sentence><sentence id="245">And, you know, I learned to fling rock pretty well, also, but they were usually in the majority, so we always ended up at the short end of the stick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: H-How did you know that -- How did you interpret this, or how did you know or feel that it was because you were a -- a Jewish boy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="255"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Well, there was no doubt, because they accompanied their attacks with vocal attacks, too. </sentence><sentence id="257">So there was no doubt why they were doing it. </sentence><sentence id="258">They -- They made it quite clear, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about how things started to shift? </sentence><sentence id="260">I guess when you were fairly young, things were pretty good and calm and -- and you felt comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="261">But then, as you said, Hitler came on the scene and things started to shift. </sentence><sentence id="262">If you could just tell us a little bit more how that started to alter life in your town? </sentence><sentence id="263">Things that your parents said to you perhaps, or you overheard? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Okay, well, first of all, when Hitler started coming on the scene, maybe 1935 or "36, I was only six or seven years old. </sentence><sentence id="265">But in those areas, we -- the kids, six, seven, we were pretty aware of what was going on, because we had to be and we heard our parents listen to the radi -- I mean, we heard them talk, listen to the radio intensively. </sentence><sentence id="266">You know, everybody had to keep quiet while they were listening to the news and what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="267">And so we were quite aware. </sentence><sentence id="268">And at first -- well, the first signs, we knew that there was an effort being made to teach the Jewish community, the grown ups, the adults, teach them some form of a trade, because they were saying, in case you have to leave ina hurry, how are you going to support yourself unless you have a trade, something that you can do with your hands. </sentence><sentence id="269">So there was -- a few courses were set up in a club that we had, like photography, like working with the leather, tailoring. </sentence><sentence id="270">I know my sister took up sewing and she learned pretty well how to sew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Which sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="280"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 11 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: My older sister. </sentence><sentence id="282">Her name was Blanca, named after my paternal grandmother. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="283">Anyway, she -- she was very young in those days, too, but she learned how to sew and later on she really made -- made her living sewing and even during the war, when we would get some pictures from her, she would show us the same dress that she had changed and every year it's look different. </sentence><sentence id="284">That was the only dress she owned. </sentence><sentence id="285">Anyway, SO we -- we sort of saw that things were not going too well in the rest of the world, for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="286">And we were conscious, so this learning a trade was one thing -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: J-Just to clarify, this is the people in the Jewish community saying to each other, we must learn a trade and we will therefore provide these courses? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Well -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: It wasn't anybody else? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: No, more than the people in the com -- Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="291">The Jewish community, the organized Jewish community would engage some tradesmen to teach the trades. </sentence><sentence id="292">Like maybe on Tuesdays and Thursdays, there would be electrical trade and the carpentry and leather -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Preparation? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: And maybe on Wednesday would be sewing and cooking and stuff like that, for women. </sentence><sentence id="299">So this was an organized effort. </sentence><sentence id="300">But then came a few other signs. </sentence><sentence id="301">For instance, some of the instructors -- my sister, her first year in the gymnasium -- first year USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 12 gymnasium is equivalent to fifth grade. </sentence><sentence id="302">She was two years ahead, she was two years older than I was, so she was telling us how her instructor was making anti-Semitic remarks to the class. </sentence><sentence id="303">And of course, kids caught on and they emulated their professors. </sentence><sentence id="304">And also, there were a few of my, quote, friends, that they would sort of jokingly make an-anti-Semitic remarks, and -- while they're hugging me and all that, or trying to copy from my homework, they would still make those remarks. </sentence><sentence id="305">So there was no question this was happening as gradually as one can perceive it. </sentence><sentence id="306">And in the meantime, the war started in -- well, there was the Czechoslovakian take over, what we call peace in our times, and then the war started in Poland, that's 1939. </sentence><sentence id="307">By that time I was 10 years old and I saw what was going on in the world and so did everybody around us. </sentence><sentence id="308">And we saw the signs, we would see the -- these Ustashi, they would have their meetings. </sentence><sentence id="309">I don't know how to equate this to the current situation. </sentence><sentence id="310">Would be almost like Blacks living integrated with the White community, but every Tuesday night, the White community would don the white sheets and hoods, you know. </sentence><sentence id="311">And so, is that a sign of something? </sentence><sentence id="312">I guess that would indicate, you know, that if -- in case of some trouble, you could not rely on your neighbors too well. </sentence><sentence id="313">So, that was another sign. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: D-Do you remember your father or mother talking to you about this, or you assing -- asking them about it, or perhaps your grandfather? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="552">Not much. </sentence><sentence id="553">I mean, it's just, like my father had a bigger backpack, I remember and he put a, you know, a sweater, a pair of shoes, some underwear and there was some, I remember, I don't know if you know what zwieback is? </sentence><sentence id="554">It's a hard, hard -- it's not bread, it's like a, yeah, crust of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="555">Anyway, so I know he had brought that. </sentence><sentence id="556">He was in the military, the    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 21 Yugoslav military two years earlier, when it was general mobilization, so he brought a couple of those zwiebacks and I remember, we tried to bite into it, impossible. </sentence><sentence id="557">So he put those in his, you know, backpack and of course we put -- we all, each kid had something that they made ready and after we left, my other sisters, my younger sisters, they remained. </sentence><sentence id="558">Oh, my older sister, she joined the partisans immediately. </sentence><sentence id="559">She was 16 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="560">Yeah, here. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="776">Q: When you and your father left to go join the partisans, how -- what kind of decision was that? </sentence><sentence id="777">Was that a political decision, to go fight the good fight, or was it more a decision to -- to s -- to make sure that you and your father would not have to come face to face with the Nazis, to be safe, or how would you characterize the decision? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: Well, the decision to fight never entered my mind nor my father's mind. </sentence><sentence id="781">Yeah, that was my older sister. </sentence><sentence id="782">We were trying to save our skins, frankly. </sentence><sentence id="783">My father, let's see, how old was he at the time? </sentence><sentence id="784">I would say he was 40, and he had fought in the -- this war that was brought to Yugoslavia, in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="785">They had general mobilization and he -- he didn't have very pleasant memories from that. </sentence><sentence id="786">I mean, he was in there long enough, but I know he didn't care for the experience. </sentence><sentence id="787">And I was much too young. </sentence><sentence id="788">I was 13 years old, you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 29 know. </sentence><sentence id="789">I wasn't going to fight anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="790">So we just left the town when we heard the Germans are coming, and there was no other place to go but the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="791">And if you joined the partisans, you're -- hopefully, you're with some -- some organize group. </sentence><sentence id="792">Otherwise, you're on your own, and how do you survive on your own in a strange town, you know? </sentence><sentence id="793">And again, the general population of that area was peasant. </sentence><sentence id="794">You know, they live off the land, either as shepherds or as farmers. </sentence><sentence id="795">Once you got into the mountain, there was not much farming, except maybe around your house, you know. </sentence><sentence id="796">No extensive farming of any kind, anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="797">In the lowlands, where I lived, they had like -- grapes was the big thing. </sentence><sentence id="798">And fruit, fruit, different kind. </sentence><sentence id="799">Figs, peaches, cherries. </sentence><sentence id="800">But figs was a big fruit and grapes -- many, many of the people, they live off the grapes. </sentence><sentence id="801">They -- you know, there's a lot of work that goes in to this and th -- once they collect the grapes and squish them for a wine. </sentence><sentence id="802">You know, st -- stomp it and whatever they do. </sentence><sentence id="803">We all have seen movies how that's done. </sentence><sentence id="804">I used to see that done personally, all our neighbors were that, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="805">Anyway, so after that, it's nothing else to do the rest of the year. </sentence><sentence id="806">Well, anyway, so my father was a city dweller, if you will, and he couldn't survive in the mountains, among the -- the suther way of life, you know. </sentence><sentence id="807">So, he was out of place, and I guess the entire Jewish community would be out of place in the rural -- well, more than rural, it's in the peasant type environment, you know. </sentence><sentence id="808">Farming or sheep-herding or animal, you know, life, because they were not accustomed to it. </sentence><sentence id="809">There is -- Just to dissuade anybody that -- that's in the Jewish genes, they proved in Israel that they can be good farmers and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="810">But in this type of situation, we didn't have that background. </sentence><sentence id="811">So, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 30 anyway, we came to the partisans to be a part of a organized society, where we could survive and of course, make our contribution, whatever is needed. </sentence><sentence id="812">And we were accepted, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="813">There was a place for everybody and once we got into this place on Hvar, they found a place for me, too, and I was still 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="814">I was placed in a machine shop, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="815">That's -- That's the best -- the best description of it. </sentence><sentence id="816">But machine shop was making -- well, we were repairing ammunition, we were even making some of the things for the mi -- for the partisans, for the military or partisans. </sentence><sentence id="817">I remember, oh there were two kids younger than me in this unit. </sentence><sentence id="818">We were three kids assigned to this unit. </sentence><sentence id="819">One was 11 year old, and one was 12. </sentence><sentence id="820">All f -- All came from Split, similar route that we came. </sentence><sentence id="821">What we were doing, actually, is generating power. </sentence><sentence id="822">It's a -- like a bicycle, you would just go, you know, drive this bike, stationary bike, but would generate power for the units that they had. </sentence><sentence id="823">We would fill the batteries, you know, we would do -- and we would also stoke the ovens, you know, for the -- the guy -- blacksmiths, you know. </sentence><sentence id="824">They weren't shoeing horses, they were making things out of -- well, let's say the guns -- I mean the weapons needed certain parts, steel part, they -- they wouldn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="825">They take a piece of steel and -- and by hand and hammer, you know. </sentence><sentence id="826">Get it into the [indecipherable] and just beat it and grind it and make the part, whatever it takes, whatever time it takes, you know. </sentence><sentence id="827">And they would fix rifles, they would fix machine guns, occasionally, you know. </sentence><sentence id="828">And I remember they even had a big searchlight that came to be fixed. </sentence><sentence id="829">And we, the kids were doing -- even our job was making -- what the -- would you call it, it was for disinfecting clothes or whatever for the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="830">You take -- We would take a barrel of the -- for oil  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 31 barrel, split it in half -- and this was pretty heavy steel, split it in half, and finish up th -- with the -- I don't know -- I didn't -- don't know in English how you call these things to - - like a file. </sentence><sentence id="831">Yeah, file it down, fix it so it doesn't scratch. </sentence><sentence id="832">Then we would take a metal sheet, roll it and we would make grooves on both ends, so y-you have like roll. </sentence><sentence id="833">And beat the ends together, then we cut a piece for the bottom, make holes in it. </sentence><sentence id="834">So this was a barrel inside the barrel and on one you would put water and the other one would hold it closed, because steam gives you more heat to kill the germs. </sentence><sentence id="835">You couldn't just boil it because you only get 212 in boiling water, 212 degrees, but steam, you can really make it, I don't know what, 400 - 500, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="836">So this was one of the jobs that we, the kids, did. </sentence><sentence id="837">But these other kids used to tell stories about how they would, before they came to Hvar, they were engaged in real battles, Germans and the Ustashi were -- had these bunkers and the kids job was to sneak, crawl on the ground to the bunker and then just lob hand grenade into the small holes in the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="838">And they could do it very silently, so they would not be detected. </sentence><sentence id="839">So the kids were useful for that, wher -- whereas grownup per -- person would be detected much easier, the kid knew how to wiggle his way to the bunker and do this kind of job. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3227">Q: Have you ever been back to Split, where -- where -- where you were born, since you left, with the partisans, really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3229">A: No, I have not been back. </sentence><sentence id="3230">At one point I was considering it seriously, but somehow other things got in the way. </sentence><sentence id="3231">When I was in the military, during the Korean conflict, they send me to -- first to Germany and then France. </sentence><sentence id="3232">And at several times, like during vacation time, I would go travel around Europe and I never went back to Yugoslavia, because it was still under the Communist rule and I didn't know what kind of foolish things they might do, like oh my papers might show that I was born there and they might retain me or something and that wouldn't f-fit too well with my military requirement to be on the post, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3233">We -- Anyway, no, that was one fear. </sentence><sentence id="3234">And one time, I went to a religious retreat in Bavaria and we went to Salzburg, Austria, which is not too far from Yugoslavian border -- Yugoslav border, and I'm -- I was toying with the idea, going across, well, I had a few days free time, so I figure, maybe I rather spend them in Munich and was some -- Salzburg and those areas, than take a chance going across. </sentence><sentence id="3235">And I didn't know what kind of roads they had and I read about lots of accidents, traffic accidents and we were, well, limited time, so I didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="3236">But, all my o -- both of my younger sisters went there. </sentence><sentence id="3237">The younger one went in 1957, the youngest one. </sentence><sentence id="3238">That's when she was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 105 earning enough money on her own to have her own kind of vacation. </sentence><sentence id="3239">She went, visited my older sister there. </sentence><sentence id="3240">And she enjoyed her stay and the country seemed even prettier than it was in her mind, in her imagination. </sentence><sentence id="3241">And the middle sister, Sarah, she went right before the war, this present conflict, like 1990 - "91, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3242">She and her husband, and they toured the country and she retained quite a few good memories of her visit. </sentence><sentence id="3243">But I never went back, even though my brother-in-law keeps bugging me, keeps asking me to come there, and visit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3260">Q: What have been your thoughts as the present conflict in -- in a very horrific period o- of war in the country have -- have played out over the past few years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3262">A: Well, I knew what was happening in that country and anybody who was interested, could have read a little bit about what the -- the basis of the country and the influences from outside, and I can be as specific as you want me to be. </sentence><sentence id="3263">But I'm not too proud of the staff in our state department. </sentence><sentence id="3264">If -- If you want me -- okay -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3265">Q: Te-Tell us some, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3266">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3268">Q: Lam very -- This is an interesting point, and I would like to know what you think about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3270">A: Okay, well, first of all, the country was created from all these different, southern Slavs. </sentence><sentence id="3271">Many were under Turkish occupations and others, even more, were under Austro- Hungary empire. </sentence><sentence id="3272">And the -- some under Italian occupation, but these people were brought up differently. </sentence><sentence id="3273">They had different religions, different scripts and different USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 106 history. </sentence><sentence id="3274">So they were not the same kind. </sentence><sentence id="3275">Ethnically, I guess, many years back, they came from the same origin, but because of these power -- super-power interplays, and controls and agitation, they -- the super-powers played on the differences and they instigated these people. </sentence><sentence id="3276">Divide and conquer, it's a old expression and it's -- it was true. </sentence><sentence id="3277">So Germany and through Austria, actually, was funding the protests and the uprising of the Croatians and the Serbians, they were monarchy for a longer time and they had fought the Turks and so there was -- the conflict was being raised. </sentence><sentence id="3278">They were supported -- Serbia was supported by Russia, of course, because that's the big brother, Russia, and was supported also by France and England. </sentence><sentence id="3279">So there was that inner conflict. </sentence><sentence id="3280">Now, what we call Bosnia today, actually it's Bosnia and Herzegovina -- nobody can pronounce the Herzegovina part. </sentence><sentence id="3281">Anyway, these were just two little provinces. </sentence><sentence id="3282">As far as I know, they never had a political autonomy. </sentence><sentence id="3283">And they were shuffled back and forth between Turkish empire and Austro- Hungarian empire. </sentence><sentence id="3284">At the time when my parents were born, this was under Austro- Hungarian empire, but there was enough Turkish influence there, from various periods. </sentence><sentence id="3285">Anyway, so as I was trying to emphasize, there was a lot of the conflict fueled by the outside powers. </sentence><sentence id="3286">So, when the Germans came in the play, of course they made the supreme break, they armed the Croatian, you know, and they -- they gave the Croatian authority to kill and the Croatian outdid themselves killing Jews, of course, but Serbs, too. </sentence><sentence id="3287">And that was in everybody's mind after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3288">So Tito, when he became the leader of the partisans, he tried to unify them back to where they could live with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3289">And whatever it took, I guess we heard about pax romana, but we had pax Yugoslavia, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 107 whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3290">Tito, you know, he was -- yeah, he was the dictator, no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="3291">And he was a Communist, but he was very pragmatic. </sentence><sentence id="3292">He allowed anything that worked for him, so economically, he abandoned Communism and put in some form of free ownership, private ow-ownership and free trade and all that. </sentence><sentence id="3293">But anyway, I knew when he would pass away, that there was -- something was going to happen, because he didn't build a natural succe-succession force. </sentence><sentence id="3294">He did provide the mechanism, but no way to enforce it, because the control of the country was with the secret police and the army and he didn't have people who -- who were going to take over those phases after he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="3295">But anyway, so when -- whenever it was, six, seven years ago, when Croatians declared themselves independent, first it was Slovenia, and the Yugoslav army tried to put down the insurrection, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="3296">And they were not successful, because they had to cross Croatia and Slovenia was in the mountains and it was not the most effective way of conducting a war. </sentence><sentence id="3297">So Slovenia succeeded in seceding from Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="3298">Then when Croatia seceded, they had all these people from way back, the ones that were Fascists and they -- they took over the power. </sentence><sentence id="3299">And when there was a conflict in bosni -- yeah, well, I want to say the Croatians -- the Fascists took over the power and the Serbian government, under this guy Milosevic, and he must be some kind of a kook, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3300">He's -- I guess he's a Yugoslav Saddam Hussein. </sentence><sentence id="3301">But they tried to punish the Croatian and instead of taking, let's say territory, they would just go there and destroy. </sentence><sentence id="3302">Like, that was their way of discouraging, but not a very civilized way. </sentence><sentence id="3303">But anyway, the Croatians were not very civilized either, so -- and when I look at it, that's all evil, it's all around and which one is USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 108 the worst, and in my mind, I say Croatians are worse than the others. </sentence><sentence id="3304">But unfortunately for my viewpoint, American government encouraged the Croatian, funded it and we were there, we were in a position to pacify that area, we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3305">In fact, whatever we did was -- this was, much of it was done under Jim Baker's rule. </sentence><sentence id="3306">Jim Baker, he was George Bush's Secretary of State, but I -- I would call him president, because he was acting in that position. </sentence><sentence id="3307">So, I didn't like what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3308">Libya and Iran were sending arms to Bosnians, to the Moslem side and of course, they had no way to get the arms through, except through American controlled areas. </sentence><sentence id="3309">So we just let them and the Croatians would take half for themselves and give the Moslems the other half. </sentence><sentence id="3310">And that encouraged, you know, s-stri -- fighting. </sentence><sentence id="3311">And I think we picked the wrong side in that conflict. </sentence><sentence id="3312">We could have pacified it, we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3313">And that's my viewpoint. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3361">Q: ["ll just ask one more question, and this is about your eldest sister Blanca, and her life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
