id="1740">So we were signed up in the local school. </sentence><sentence id="1741">We were interviewed and assigned to a grade. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And frankly, I think unfairly in some cases, because the selection was made on basis of our knowledge of English language, I didn't know any English, so I was put in seventh grade, even though I was 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1743">But, you know, people who spoke English, some of my friends, too, were sent to local high school. </sentence><sentence id="1744">So I felt a little bit of a -- not resentment, but that I was set back unfairly. </sentence><sentence id="1745">But, thinking back, all I had from the Yugoslavia, was -- like I had completed four years of schooling, and a portion of the fifth year, which in our

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3639">A: Okay, well, first of all, the country was created from all these different, southern Slavs. </sentence><sentence id="3640">Many were under Turkish occupations and others, even more, were under Austro- Hungary empire. </sentence><sentence id="3641">And the -- some under Italian occupation, but these people were brought up differently.

Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 106 history. </sentence><sentence id="3645">So they were not the same kind. </sentence><sentence id="3646">Ethnically, I guess, many years back, they came from the same origin, but because of these power -- super-power interplays, and controls and agitation, they -- the super-powers played on the differences and they instigated these people. </sentence><sentence id="3647">Divide and conquer, it's a old expression and it's -- it was true. </sentence><sentence id="3648">So Germany and through Austria, actually, was funding the protests and the uprising of the Croatians and the Serbians, they were monarchy for a longer time and they had fought the Turks and so there was -- the conflict was being raised. </sentence><sentence id="3649">They were supported -- Serbia was supported by Russia, of course, because that's the big brother, Russia, and was supported also by France and England. </sentence><sentence id="3650">So there was that inner conflict. </sentence><sentence id="3651">Now, what we call Bosnia today, actually it's Bosnia and Herzegovina -- nobody can pronounce the Herzegovina part. </sentence><sentence id="3652">Anyway, these were just two little provinces. </sentence><sentence id="3653">As far as I know, they never had a political autonomy. </sentence><sentence id="3654">And they were shuffled back and forth between Turkish empire and Austro- Hungarian empire. </sentence><sentence id="3655">At the time when my parents were born, this was under Austro- Hungarian empire, but there was enough Turkish influence there, from various periods. </sentence><sentence id="3656">Anyway, so as I was trying to emphasize, there was a lot of the conflict fueled by the outside powers. </sentence><sentence id="3657">So, when the Germans came in the play, of course they made the supreme break, they armed the Croatian, you know, and they -- they gave the Croatian authority to kill and the Croatian outdid themselves killing Jews, of course, but Serbs, too. </sentence><sentence id="3658">And that was in everybody's mind after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3659">So Tito, when he became the leader of the partisans, he tried to unify them back to where they could live with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3660">And whatever it took, I guess we heard about pax romana, but we had pax Yugoslavia, This is a verbatim transcript of

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 107 whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3663">Tito, you know, he was -- yeah, he was the dictator, no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="3664">And he was a Communist, but he was very pragmatic. </sentence><sentence id="3665">He allowed anything that worked for him, so economically, he abandoned Communism and put in some form of free ownership, private ow-ownership and free trade and all that. </sentence><sentence id="3666">But anyway, I knew when he would pass away, that there was -- something was going to happen, because he didn't build a natural succe-succession force. </sentence><sentence id="3667">He did provide the mechanism, but no way to enforce it, because the control of the country was with the secret police and the army and he didn't have people who -- who were going to take over those phases after he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="3668">But anyway, so when -- whenever it was, six, seven years ago, when Croatians declared themselves independent, first it was Slovenia, and the Yugoslav army tried to put down the insurrection, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="3669">And they were not successful, because they had to cross Croatia and Slovenia was in the mountains and it was not the most effective way of conducting a war. </sentence><sentence id="3670">So Slovenia succeeded in seceding from Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="3671">Then when Croatia seceded, they had all these people from way back, the ones that were Fascists and they -- they took over the power. </sentence><sentence id="3672">And when there was a conflict in bosni -- yeah, well, I want to say the Croatians -- the Fascists took over the power and the Serbian government, under this guy Milosevic, and he must be some kind of a kook, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3673">He's -- I guess he's a Yugoslav Saddam Hussein. </sentence><sentence id="3674">But they tried to punish the Croatian and instead of taking, let's say territory, they would just go there and destroy. </sentence><sentence id="3675">Like, that was their way of discouraging, but not a very civilized way. </sentence><sentence id="3676">But anyway, the Croatians were not very civilized either, so -- and when I look at it, that's all evil, it's all around and which one is This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3677">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3678"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 108 the worst, and in my mind, I say Croatians are worse than the others. </sentence><sentence id="3679">But unfortunately for my viewpoint, American government encouraged the Croatian, funded it and we were there, we were in a position to pacify that area, we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3680">In fact, whatever we did was -- this was, much of it was done under Jim Baker's rule. </sentence><sentence id="3681">Jim Baker, he was George Bush's Secretary of State, but I -- I would call him president, because he was acting in that position. </sentence><sentence id="3682">So, I didn't like what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3683">Libya and Iran were sending arms to Bosnians, to the Moslem side and of course, they had no way to get the arms through, except through American controlled areas. </sentence><sentence id="3684">So we just let them and the Croatians would take half for themselves and give the Moslems the other half. </sentence><sentence id="3685">And that encouraged, you know, s-stri -- fighting. </sentence><sentence id="3686">And I think we picked the wrong side in that conflict. </sentence><sentence id="3687">We could have pacified it, we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3688">And that's my viewpoint. </sentence></p></dialogue>
