<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: What happened, with the hotel, or what did you begin to notice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: In 1941, there was a club in Holland, and it was a men's club. </sentence><sentence id="119">Very sophisticated, for lawyers; and, and the German right away took that building. </sentence><sentence id="120">So one of the head of the police and the owner from that men's club came to my mother and say, you know, "Why don't you go out of the hotel, so the Germans don't take it. </sentence><sentence id="121">And we take your hotel and that you will  save." </sentence><sentence id="122">And my mother was very upset, of course. </sentence><sentence id="123">They really-- my father died, what I told you -- they really built that hotel by themselves, really built it. </sentence><sentence id="124">And to leave everything, just to go out what you have in your hand, was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="125">So I don't remember exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="126">I know after many talking with the police and with this man, the owner, my mother had to go out of the hotel and could just take with her--they talked her into it, perhaps it was the best-they could just go out of the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="127">And there was another Jewish family in our home town what, had a little house, very poor little house in a very poor area, and, we moved in that little house in. </sentence><sentence id="128">But I have to tell -- yeah -- it was already -- we moved into the hotel in and in that little house in, and, and it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="129">There was no hot water and there was no bathroom and it was a very poor neighborhood and I really hated it, | remember; and it was a very difficult time because, you were not allowed to go out and you hear the German already walking through your door. </sentence><sentence id="130">And also one day the German took all the people what went over to another religion, like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over to the Catholic religion, and they picked up all the people what went over to the, the Jews what went over to the Catholic religion. </sentence><sentence id="131">So they didn't know -- they picked my mother and my two brothers and me. </sentence><sentence id="132">My oldest brother was married. </sentence><sentence id="133">I, 1 come from a family from four children and I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="134">I had three older brothers. </sentence><sentence id="135">And they took us already to the German border. </sentence><sentence id="136">But in Holland was a Jewish Raad", a Jewish group of people. </sentence><sentence id="137">What they say they help the Jews going to, Poland and Germany, but they went after it and they know that they made a mistake and we were already one or two days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Okay, fine. </sentence><sentence id="159">Can you just go back and explain why were you taken? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: Because that was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="163">It was a mistake that they took us because, they didn't know that the, the Wynberg, that boy, that he was it. </sentence><sentence id="164">They thought that we were it. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="166">And it -- because we had the same name. </sentence><sentence id="167">And so they sent us already -- and always we had a little backpack staying by the door because everybody knows already that it would be perhaps something like that happened, that, that we would be called up, so we went to that -- Enschede was the city. </sentence><sentence id="168">We went to Enschede. </sentence><sentence id="169">It was on the German border. </sentence><sentence id="170">And when we were there the Dutch Jewish organization, the Jewish Raad was there -- I don't know how it is in English. </sentence><sentence id="171">They, they went working very effective and they got us back to my, to Zwolle, where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="172">And I remember when we came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: And how did they get you back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: I don't know, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="187">They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the wrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy what he went over to the Catholic religion and not we. </sentence><sentence id="188">We were Jews, and, and that's the reason, they got us back. </sentence><sentence id="189">They went after that they said they had the wrong people. </sentence><sentence id="190">But that was just a postponing of a time. </sentence><sentence id="191">And so we went -- I remember we came back and all the  people were standing on the street and, and everybody was cheering that we came back and, and everybody came to our house and congratulated us. </sentence><sentence id="192">That's the reason it's so in my memory, that thing, that way. </sentence><sentence id="193">But, it didn't help much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: What happened when you did go back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="205">We just-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: What was your life like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Our life was -- we were not allowed to do anything, so it was very, very upsetting. </sentence><sentence id="211">It was very strenuous and it was very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="212">And, and the men had to go already to, work camp but I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941, beginning 1942 or so. </sentence><sentence id="213">And, the men had to go to work camp. </sentence><sentence id="214">And I remember my brother was -- one of my brothers was hidden and he just got married not long before, and her father had to go a work camp. </sentence><sentence id="215">And they starting already talking; they say, "Oh, when somebody goes to a work camp, then my father will be sent away. </sentence><sentence id="216">So you better come out of the hiding place." </sentence><sentence id="217">So my brother came out of the hiding place and her father -- they would have sent away anyway -- my -- you know, the rumors go around. </sentence><sentence id="218">You didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="219">And so my brother came out. </sentence><sentence id="220">And the men went to working camps, but they were allowed to go weekends home; so nobody saw something difficult in it, not so serious in it. </sentence><sentence id="221">They thought, "Oh, they have to go there for helping, doing things," and they came weekends home. </sentence><sentence id="222">So in between, also, there were things going on in, in my home town. </sentence><sentence id="223">That a young group of men didn't have anything to do. </sentence><sentence id="224">They're all -- everybody what had a business was taken away already for the Germans and they put Volk-, traitors what went with the Germans-they put in these businesses. </sentence><sentence id="225">So the men didn't have anything to do. </sentence><sentence id="226">And we were not allowed to go out of the house after five o'clock at night; we have to stay in. </sentence><sentence id="227">So these men, eight young married men, came together and played card. </sentence><sentence id="228">And one of the traitors, a Dutch man, went to the German and say, "You know, that bunch of Jews sitting there and playing card." </sentence><sentence id="229">And they took these eight men and sent them to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="230">So that was going on a lot. </sentence><sentence id="231">It was a, a lot of Dutch, not-Jewish people, what were traitors; and you had to be very, very careful, to not to talk and not to, say anything. </sentence><sentence id="232">I tried to, to, to do something, what, what I told you I went to Apeldoorn and helped--and that's a little town not far from my hometown--and helped an older family, an older couple. </sentence><sentence id="233">But it was after a very short time also very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="234">And there was not much what you could do. </sentence><sentence id="235">I remember one day I was walked in my street, and in the street where I was, was a big house and there was a Catholic priest lived in there. </sentence><sentence id="236">And the Catholic priest came to me and he say -- he start talking to me, and he said, "How do you think that you can save your life?" </sentence><sentence id="237">And I say, "The only way that I, that the Jews can save their life, is when not-Jewish people take us in." </sentence><sentence id="238">And, the same evening he came to me and he say, "I have a house for you. </sentence><sentence id="239">I have a place for you where you can go. </sentence><sentence id="240">And be ready tomorrow morning at five o'clock, six o'clock," I don't remember exactly what time, but very early in the morning, "with your bicycle, and a little bit what you can take with you on the bicycle, and I will bring you there." </sentence><sentence id="241">And that what I did. </sentence><sentence id="242">I remember I say goodbye to my mother and to my brothers, and I never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="243">That was the last time, time that I ever saw my family. </sentence><sentence id="244">And, we  went to Utrecht, and I went to, a family -- no, a woman, what she was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="245">She came also from my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="246">I went to her house and, I stayed with her a few months. </sentence><sentence id="247">And that was very, a very nice place with this woman to live; what she was the whole day gone and I was the whole day alone. </sentence><sentence id="248">And, then she had another family what she want to take in, and I went to another family's house. </sentence><sentence id="249">A very large house with, a lot of room, and I was there the maid. </sentence><sentence id="250">I had to clean the house, and I had to, was not allowed to talk to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="251">I was not allowed to go open the door ever. </sentence><sentence id="252">I was not allowed to go out of the house; and there was no food in the house and it was very hard already, food in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="253">Holland -- they suffered tremendous in the war. </sentence><sentence id="254">They didn't have, much to eat and they had, didn't have much, it was very difficult; and these people, they really didn't have anything in the house. </sentence><sentence id="255">I remember they cooked the bones ten times to make soup and they had the cat's plate already with it. </sentence><sentence id="256">It was very awful fam-- it was a very awful time for me to be there alone. </sentence><sentence id="257">And, I, I didn't I didn't get much to eat there. </sentence><sentence id="258">I remember I stole sometimes an apple, or I put in a sandwich under my pillow that at night when I came to my bed that I had something to eat-- because there was, really nothing to eat there. </sentence><sentence id="259">These people -- when I was there a few months, they had another Jewish family and they took in; an professor it was there--I met his wife, and they came upstairs and they want to use me also as a maid. </sentence><sentence id="260">I didn't let it. </sentence><sentence id="261">They had, they wanted I cleaned the oven and things like that, and I didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="262">Because I was so very lonely and so unhappy, one day they told me that not far from them is another Jewish family hidden; and, I want to go and visit them. </sentence><sentence id="263">And I was very happy that I could talk with somebody. </sentence><sentence id="264">So after three months being alone in, in that, locked up in that house and not really having to talk with anybody. </sentence><sentence id="265">And they were very Christian. </sentence><sentence id="266">They really tried me to get over to their religion too, but, you know, it was very -- it was not very pleasant time. </sentence><sentence id="267">I went, to this family, and the moment that I came into this family's house, the police came. </sentence><sentence id="268">And, I was very sure that I was safe because I had a passport and it was -- every Jew in Holland had to have a passport with a "J" on it, and the underground took my "J" out of the passport. </sentence><sentence id="269">Well, I didn't know that you hold it to the light that you can see the J, so I came there and I -- and when the police came. </sentence><sentence id="270">There were also police what were with the German. </sentence><sentence id="271">Dutch police that went over to NSB", as they called them; and when police came I say I'm a nurse and have come to help these people. </sentence><sentence id="272">And so they took my passport and hold it to the light and they saw the "J" and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="273">So there wasn't -- there was a family hidden there, a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="274">And what I didn't know, the people where I was hidden were traitors. </sentence><sentence id="275">That what I heard when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="276">Twenty-eight Jews are caught after that I, after that I was the first one what was hidden there; and nothing happened to the people what lived in the house. </sentence><sentence id="277">Always when the German found Jews in an house, they took the whole family -- most of the time the whole family, but sometimes just the men. </sentence><sentence id="278">And there never was happen something to these people, but I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="279">I heard it all after the war. </sentence><sentence id="280">These men went to jail, but because I didn't know, after the war I, I testified for that they saved -- that what I know. </sentence><sentence id="281"> Later on I heard what was happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="282">So anyway, the police tried to get to know from me where I was hidden, but I didn't want to tell because I thought I know there was another Jewish family there, and they have a chance then to, to get away. </sentence><sentence id="283">And so I didn't tell them; and the people where I was caught told them. </sentence><sentence id="284">So in the evening I had to go back to the place where I was hidden and they went to my room. </sentence><sentence id="285">I was in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="286">I had a room in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="287">And they opened the bed and they found that sandwich what I told you what I put sometimes under my pillow what I was very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="288">And they say, "See! </sentence><sentence id="289">Look what the Jews did! </sentence><sentence id="290">You know -- see, you give them to eat and still she steals from you!" </sentence><sentence id="291">I remember that very -- there's not many things that I remember, but that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="292">So anyway I don't remember what I took with me or how, but I remember I had to go back to the police station in Utrecht. </sentence><sentence id="293">I was a week in the police station in Utrecht. </sentence><sentence id="294">I could have got away from there. </sentence><sentence id="295">I had a brother what was married and he was hidden in Utrecht, and I visit him and I didn't get along with my sister-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="296">I still -- she's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="297">I don't get along with her. </sentence><sentence id="298">Anyway, the, the kids were very small; and it was very dirty and it was very poor. </sentence><sentence id="299">And I thought, "When I have to go to my brother...." I, I just didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="300">So the, the police asked me in Utrecht -- they know that I could get away, so there was an underground already what I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="301">That was already 1942, October 1942. </sentence><sentence id="302">I didn't know that there was the underground already in Holland, very strong. </sentence><sentence id="303">And, when I and -- I say "no." </sentence><sentence id="304">I did -- my mother didn't give me any money. </sentence><sentence id="305">I didn't have any money; and I thought when you have no money, where do I go?You know, you have to go somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="306">So I didn't, go away, and, that -- I remember that, many times they tried to get me out, so in 19-- then I went, from there I went to Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="307">In Amsterdam I was, in jail. </sentence><sentence id="308">| was three months in jail in Amsterdam. </sentence></p></dialogue>

and his wife came to me when I was in -- hidden in, in Utrecht, and she's told me one day that my mother on the way out of the house -- she was planning to go hide somewhere -- somebody told the Germans that my mother wants to go and hide somewhere and they caught my mother. </sentence><sentence id="647">And they send my mother already to Poland, and my brothers too. </sentence><sentence id="648">My two brothers, and one brother was just married also. </sentence><sentence id="649">And so, so I, I wanted to go to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="650">That's the all what I thought about it; also when I was in Utrecht, I wanted to go to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="651">That's the only thing what I thought about. </sentence><sentence id="652">And so I didn't want to go, really, hide somewhere because I didn't know there was the underground already that you that you had a chance to save a-- somewhere that somebody would take you in. </sentence><sentence id="653">And, so when I went to, was in Westerbork I thought the only thing what I could, go to my mother; and that was that's that we all thought, the girls that were together with me what had already the family were, were, away, thought also they go to their family. </sentence><sentence id="654">So we had no idea that Holland -- in Holland was, was no antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="655">We didn't grow up with antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="656">We didn't grow up to be afraid, that you say something and, and, and it would something happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="657">And so, we had no idea what would happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="658">So after three days and three nights, we, we came to Sobibor. </sentence><sentence id="659">What, what were -- yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>

that with all these people I came with, that they were dead and -- you know? </sentence><sentence id="894">So, after that we talked together, we got very close. </sentence><sentence id="895">They, they were very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="896">They, we didn't get anything to eat in, in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="897">They didn't work with the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="898">They worked some place else. </sentence><sentence id="899">I was lucky that I start working with assorting clothes; so I had a chance to steal food from the, from the backpacks what the Dutch people brought when there was transport. </sentence><sentence id="900">They didn't have a chance to, to get anything. </sentence><sentence id="901">So after a very short time, there was a German, German Jew, and he was a traitor. </sentence><sentence id="902">Chaim, my husband, always say, "He wants to be holier than the Pope," this guy. </sentence><sentence id="903">And he told the Germans that the Dutch men-- there were seventy-two Dutch men in camp---that they want to run away. </sentence><sentence id="904">We never know if it was truth or if it was just a lie. </sentence><sentence id="905">We really never know, but after a very short time that we were in camp -- and I don't remember have long contact with the Dutch, young men -- I remember they had to go on, on roll call. </sentence><sentence id="906">They had to, Ap-- on Appell(r) and they -- I remember one of the boys -- Zeehandelaar was the last name, Maurits Zeehandelaar -- he had a little piece of butter and he brought it to me; says he, "When I come back, save it for me." </sentence><sentence id="907">So he give me the little piece of butter and he -- they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="908">Seventy-two Dutch boys were shot, so they never came back. </sentence><sentence id="909">So I don't remember much talking to them. </sentence><sentence id="910">So that was a very short time that we was -- after I was in camp that they got shot. </sentence><sentence id="911">I, Iremember we didn't get much to eat. </sentence><sentence id="912">In the morning we got some black water and bread. </sentence><sentence id="913">It was for the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="914">It was like clay. </sentence><sentence id="915">It was very sour and you couldn't eat it. </sentence><sentence id="916">I couldn't eat it. </sentence><sentence id="917">And were -- and I remember that from the beginning the Dutch people always tried to get that bread; and we, I gave it to them because, we could we could eat some, we could steal and we had together with us some -- we could make some food. </sentence><sentence id="918">So, they were very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="919">Later on we get more Dutch people in camp. </sentence><sentence id="920">Later on there come more Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="921">I -- somehow the Dutch were always, came to us and they wanted to have some food from the others. </sentence><sentence id="922">We had a little group of people. </sentence><sentence id="923">Some -- later on came also, a cousin of mine came to camp, to Sobibor. </sentence><sentence id="924">And so I, we -- and Mimie Katz was another Dutch girl what I was with in camp, and Ula. </sentence><sentence id="925">We had -- we shared our food in the evening when we came together and we helped each other when we got sick and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="926">We -- most of the time we worked assorting clothes. </sentence><sentence id="927">When there came no transport, we had to work in the woods and clean the woods. </sentence><sentence id="928">Just there was no work there in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="929">Or we had to clean the railway, rail, railroad. </sentence><sentence id="930">Or we had to throw out the ashes from the -- what we got. </sentence><sentence id="931">We didn't get it. </sentence><sentence id="932">They brought it. </sentence><sentence id="933">In the fields, and we had to assort -- throw it in the fields for, fertilizing, the ashes. </sentence><sentence id="934">So I got typhus. </sentence><sentence id="935">I got sick on typhus. </sentence><sentence id="936">So there's a big part in Sobibor what I don't remember, because I got typhus. </sentence><sentence id="937">And you was not allowed to be sick in Sobibor. </sentence><sentence id="938">Everybody what was sick went straight to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="939">I remember what I was sick and one day I stayed in, in the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="940">The barrack had no toilet. </sentence><sentence id="941">We were not -- we had -- there was a pail and that was our bathroom; and we slept in two rows, three rows, three. </sentence><sentence id="942"> 4 The floor and three rows, and we all with the lice a very short time, and there was --once there was another animal but also red and that was full and that little bit food what was sometimes had to put under the pillow and, and were the mice. </sentence><sentence id="943">I remember one day I put a pillow up and it was all mice with little babies under my pillow with that what -- and we were already -- I remember I was so upset from the first lice what I had that Chaim -- I was on already -- Chaim fell right away in love with me, so that was a big help for me too; you know, that, that the time in Sobibor was not so difficult if I would have been alone. </sentence><sentence id="944">But Chaim was already six months longer in camp. </sentence><sentence id="945">Now Chaim was really a girlfriend with somebody else, with Esther Raab -- what was interviewed here -- and I think she was jealous. </sentence><sentence id="946">Chaim right away fell in love with me, so he was a big help for me and all the time in the camp, because I don't think when I wouldn't have Chaim, I wouldn't have made it. </sentence><sentence id="947">Ultimately, definitely not out of camp. </sentence><sentence id="948">But when I was sick Chaim took me to the bathroom and made me walk and, he brought me, I think, food. </sentence><sentence id="949">I don't remember much from the time when that I had typhus because I was very sick and you had to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="950">And because of Chaim, and also because of the girlfriends what I had -- I say they helped me through this time because that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="951">Later on they told that I fell sometimes asleep and they hide me when we had to clean the woods, so they hide me some where that I was sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="952">And also one day, F renzel" came out. </sentence><sentence id="953">Frenzel was one of the worst SS's in camp; and he came to the camp, Camp One, and he went, with the whip he went in the barrack in and everybody was sick, had to go out and had to stay on the middle and I remember so vividly, was also a boy that I know from Assen, from another town, from the Zionist organization, and he was standing there and, and they all was standing on a long time in the middle on the camp and they all got shot, right away. </sentence><sentence id="954">When I -- then he screamed and, and I came out and he recognized me; and I don't remember if it was Wagner"? </sentence><sentence id="955">or Frenzel -- now one of the two -- I mixed it up -- he say to me, "Go back to work!" </sentence><sentence id="956">So I could go back to work. </sentence><sentence id="957">Just luck. </sentence><sentence id="958">Frenzel picked me out, too; and Frenzel somehow always picked me out. </sentence><sentence id="959">When I had a very heavy work -- I don't know why -- just luck. </sentence><sentence id="960">He picked me out and give me easier work. </sentence><sentence id="961">We had sometimes to go in the woods and picking mushrooms for the Germans, some of the girls. </sentence><sentence id="962">I remember I put everything, the mushrooms, | put them in my bra and in my underpants, and when we came home we cooked them in a little something what, what the Polish girls had; and then we had to go out and picking blueberries sometimes, but we were not allowed to eat them. </sentence><sentence id="963">So when we came back then we had to show our tongue if we had one. </sentence><sentence id="964">And we were very hungry in that time. </sentence><sentence id="965">When there came no transports, we were very hungry, because you couldn't save the food because the mice and the and the rats, they, they took away under your pillow. </sentence><sentence id="966">So we were very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="967">Somehow Frenzel, when I had very heavy work -- we has also to go in the woods and cutting trees and bringing from one place to the other, or filling up these trolleys, what the people came in, with sand. </sentence><sentence id="968">And that we had to do on the -- they were the Germans,  5 also the, the Kapos" " with the whip in back of us, and they -- we had to put it somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="969">You know, when there didn't came transport. </sentence><sentence id="970">So we were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="971">We are like animals already, because we were happy when there came a transport; because we know when it comes in a long time no transport, we go to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="972">And when there come already transport, when they coming, then we were happy that they came. </sentence><sentence id="973">When there came transport from Holland, everything went very smoothly. </sentence><sentence id="974">And there came also transports from Poland, and when there came transports from Poland, was -- we were locked up in our area and there was always shooting. </sentence><sentence id="975">There came also a transport from Belzec -- my husband will tell that story from Belzec, that transport. </sentence><sentence id="976">I remember that we got locked up in our things and we thought, "that's the end of us." </sentence><sentence id="977">There was shooting and there was screaming and there was -- it, it was very scary; and that was from Belzec. </sentence><sentence id="978">They didn't want to go to the gas chamber, so they shot them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="979">And many times when transports came from, from Poles -- Polish Jews, they didn't want to go to the gas chamber because they know they went through the gas -- that they went. </sentence><sentence id="980">So they just shot them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="981">So, it was also many times we had to stay on roll call the whole night because an animal walked on one of the mines; because Sobibor was with, mines three times or two times and sometimes an animal walked on there -- I don't know what kind of an animal -- and then we had to stay the whole night on roll call. </sentence><sentence id="982">And we always made so out that, Chaim and I, that we stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="983">You know, he always made sure that we always -- when also once what is that there was, some Jews ran away. </sentence><sentence id="984">Two Jews ran away. </sentence><sentence id="985">They made it, too. </sentence><sentence id="986">And we had to go back and we stayed on roll call. </sentence><sentence id="987">And Chaim, Chaim had -- the men had to stay separate and the women had to stay separate. </sentence><sentence id="988">And we stayed in Lager One on roll call, and they cut, they picked out every tenth person. </sentence><sentence id="989">So okay, imagine how what a nervous wreck I was -- they picked out every tenth person, so it could have been Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="990">Chaim was number nine. </sentence></p></dialogue>

But, so it was all barracks that were over, that were sent, that were sent to Poland; where they make bundles out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1385">There were other people again what worked there. </sentence><sentence id="1386">Other people what worked and organized everything to separate. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And it went in the trains what went back; what when the Jews came, the trains went back with all clothes what went back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And that went also, before the people went to the gas chamber, the men had to go and cut their hair; and that also went back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Everything, also the gold; and, we had to separate gold, and many times when we had to assort the clothes we found diamonds and gold in it, and I remember once I found a whole handful of diamonds and the German saw it and he took it. </sentence><sentence id="1390">The Germans when they went on vacation to Germany, they took the backpack full with ger-- with gold and with silver and with, with everything what, what they could grab; what was, what the Germans really want for the army. </sentence><sentence id="1391">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1392">So, when you, when you found that you have to give it up. </sentence><sentence id="1393">I had to assort the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1394">And I was not so clever, really, that I thought about that the German and they take the gold; but a lot of people took it and hide it. </sentence><sentence id="1395">I, I always cut out all the clothes what I had assorted. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I, I cut it in pieces, when I saw that's the only sabotage what I can do. </sentence><sentence id="1397">You know, to cut the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1398">And Chaim, and when I found something what nobody could see, I give it to Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="1399">The fireman what had to burn all the pictures and all the documents what were burned in Sobibor -- Chaim, that was Chaim's best friend. </sentence><sentence id="1400">Szmuel was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1401">And so Chaim many times put money under it, in the bottom and that went to him and he hide that in the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1402">That was hidden in the ground, so I when we run away, Chaim makes sure that he got some of the money. </sentence><sentence id="1403">So, so we, we-- I didn't know anything, what was the uprising or anything what was, going-- absolutely had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1404">So when Chaim told me try to get some warm clothes; then he told me, "Take some warm clothes," and he told me that what the plan is to do. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Then he told I was not allowed to tell it to anybody, absolutely-- and that's my always and guilt feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I had a cousin there, and I didn't tell her; and the same day she say, "I will make some food," when she work in the where the laundry  0 for the Germans and she had a chance to cook something. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And I didn't tell her, and she didn't come out. </sentence><sentence id="1408">And I always feel guilty that I didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1409">So, I went to a barrack, and there was one German that was sometimes good. </sentence><sentence id="1410">He didn't get also not much punishment, and he give me a pair of boots. </sentence><sentence id="1411">And I had a lot of clothes on, what was very dumb, because when the German would have seen me with so much clothes on, he would have asked, "Why do you have so much clothes on?" </sentence><sentence id="1412">So Chaim told me, "On four o'clock be by a big place." </sentence><sentence id="1413">That is-- and also the, the medicine, all the medicine the Dutch people brought a lot of medicine and that went also in one big place where, where they put the, the medicine, so the medicine was in that big place. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And there he say, "Come there at four o'clock." </sentence><sentence id="1415">So I make sure that I walked there at four o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1416">Everybody was working. </sentence><sentence id="1417">Everything -- nobody knows anything. </sentence><sentence id="1418">Everything -- just a very small group of people what were involved in this in this uprising. </sentence><sentence id="1419">So everything went through normal. </sentence><sentence id="1420">I went walked -- I don't know how, how I came to that, was allowed to walk there. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Anyway, I walked there. </sentence><sentence id="1422">I remember also in camp, once before the uprising, that I walked somewhere and I heard that the Germans spoke to the whole group of transport people; and I saw the rabbi and the cantor from my home town, sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And I, you know, I just -- I was planned just to run to them or -- but I couldn't have done anything. </sentence><sentence id="1424">Also, many times I saw people from my home town walking. </sentence><sentence id="1425">There was a little window, and I saw people from my home town passing this window; and I was afraid that they would see me, you know, I made almost sure. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Whole families I saw walking to the gas chamber, many, many times. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And, and I couldn't say anything when even -- was no way, nothing that I could do. </sentence><sentence id="1428">Nothing that I could do. </sentence><sentence id="1429">So I walked to Chaim, and on four o'clock, and I come there. </sentence><sentence id="1430">I remember I walked in there, and one of the Kapos -- Wieszubski was his name, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1431">He killed already a few Germans, and he was very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And I say, "Take a pill for it, something for your nerves to calm down;" and he took it, and I remember and it was bitter and he spit it out. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Says he, "I don't need it." </sentence><sentence id="1434">So I met Chaim on the end, and there came -- there wasn't -- Chaim was not involved in the uprising, but somehow he say to me, "come there" and from there we will always go somehow in the area for roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1435">So he want to be sure that we are together when there is a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1436">And there was a boy standing there and he was involved, he was in the uprising involved, and he had to kill one German. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Together with the Kapo, with Wieszubski, and he say -- I was standing together with him and Chaim -- he say, "I'm afraid to go." </sentence><sentence id="1438">Said Chaim, "You have to go." </sentence><sentence id="1439">And said he, "I'm afraid." </sentence><sentence id="1440">Said Chaim -- "there's no way back." </sentence><sentence id="1441">What we know already there was one young boy what had a chance to go walk around in camp and he knows already there were ten dead. </sentence><sentence id="1442">So there was -- we know already now, you know, there was -- we know it is our death. </sentence><sentence id="1443">When we, when we get caught now, that's the end. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So the, the electricity was already cut off and the telephone was already cut off; so there was already, you know, was already not a connection anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So Chaim had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1446">He run inside and took a knife, put it in his boots; and he walked to this, office where Beckman", was his name, was and in between the Kapo was already there. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And he had no choice, Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="1448">And he -- I remember that he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1449">I was inside to take  1 the knife or something like that, and I didn't see him going away to the barrack; and I went looking for him. </sentence><sentence id="1450">I said, "Where's Chaim? </sentence><sentence id="1451">Where's Chaim?" </sentence><sentence id="1452">Oh, I got so panicky, when I know already there was an uprising and there was something going on there, and I couldn't find Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And then one of the boys, he say that, "I say Chaim is in that barrack." </sentence><sentence id="1454">And I went looking where Chaim was and I hear screaming, like somebody killed a pork. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Was screaming, this man -- the SS man was screaming, of course; and they were killing him with knives. </sentence><sentence id="1456">When it was -- we couldn't, we couldn't use guns or anything because nobody was allowed to hear, hear that we were -- that they were killing Germans because they were all over, the Ukraines were standing there and the, and the Poles were all around. </sentence><sentence id="1457">So I went back to the spot; and I went, went there for the roll call because it was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1458">I know when I was standing there when just one German would walk around and if an Ukraine would see me there -- I know that I went back to the, to that barrack and was the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1459">I went in the roll call, and then we walked back to the -- then there was the roll call, and it was already a little bit unorganized. </sentence><sentence id="1460">It was, that was already, you know, with the, the main -- you could see already it was unorganized; and then we started walking. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And finally Chaim comes out, and he, he was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="1462">When he, when that knife slipped out of the head from this German and he got a cut in his arm. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And he was all over blood; and I remember I thought, "God forbid we come somewhere and he sees this blood." </sentence><sentence id="1464">And you know, I had no idea what will happen and what will happen now. </sentence><sentence id="1465">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1466">We're running away or just was very --I, you know -- so, I cleaned him up from this blood a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1467">So in the time that we were walking, and I think I had a handkerchief and I put a handkerchief on his arm. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And it was bleeding and, and we were walking to Camp One, that we go home. </sentence><sentence id="1469">In, in between more people came off, on all side people came; and, you see, I remember there were came a Ukrainian on a bicycle and they just killed him like nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1470">Somebody had taken an axe or something, a knife or a who knows, and everybody start coming there together, what I remember; and then everybody say, "Hurrah!" </sentence><sentence id="1471">or something. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And then we started running, and we were lucky we were running to the entrance where the Sobibor comes in. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And I remember that then Frenzel starts shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1474">I hear guns starting already; the, the Germans knows what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1475">Because in between that we started walking and I cleaned Chaim up, a truck came. </sentence><sentence id="1476">And it was one of the Germans was on this truck; and the Kapo what Chaim killed the back of it, he killed already a few other ones and he went on this truck. </sentence><sentence id="1477">He jumped on this truck and tried -- and then I don't know what's happened, but he never came out so I think he got killed on this truck. </sentence><sentence id="1478">That was an family -- an older man. </sentence><sentence id="1479">He had three sons. </sentence><sentence id="1480">He had three brothers and the father was there. </sentence><sentence id="1481">I have to tell you later that I've met the father in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1482">There was there three boys, all the three boys were Kapos, and nobody came out. </sentence><sentence id="1483">Nobody came out of this, out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1484">So when we start running, Frenzel was already shooting and he had something in front of him. </sentence><sentence id="1485">I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1486">And every -- it was a little house and everybody stopped for that little house. </sentence><sentence id="1487">So Chaim took my hand and, and he say, "Come," when it is no use that we stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And then everybody start running, and people start -- and then we walked to this door, to this gate and everybody was falling around next to  2 us. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Everybody -- you hear mines going and people dropping dead, you know, on the mines, and you only you didn't see much. </sentence><sentence id="1490">You just run. </sentence><sentence id="1491">You just run. </sentence><sentence id="1492">I remember I had a necklace full with Jewish emblems; and, and I thought, "Oh, when I come in a non-Jewish area I better take that off." </sentence><sentence id="1493">So I -- that was the first thing what I took off and throw away. </sentence><sentence id="1494">And then [had to run and run and all the clothes slowly on. </sentence><sentence id="1495">I took all the clothes off and I just had on what normally had on, because I couldn't run with all those clothes on. </sentence><sentence id="1496">So I was running and running; and when I run I remember, when I'm very nervous, I get diarrhea and I had to stop all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And I was very nervous, of course, when you had to run; and then we heard shooting already in back of us, and we heard, screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1498">And we're running and running and running till we came -- and that was dark. </sentence><sentence id="1499">Went to four o'clock, five o'clock, started be dark already. </sentence><sentence id="1500">We're running and we're running, we're running and there come away a whole bunch of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1501">We stayed there together. </sentence><sentence id="1502">People from Sobiber. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And I saw also Kurt Thomas, and he asked me, "Where's Ula?" </sentence><sentence id="1504">No. </sentence><sentence id="1505">Where is his girlfriend, Millie."* </sentence><sentence id="1506">And I told him, "I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1507">You have to take her." </sentence><sentence id="1508">I say, "Yeah, I had to run." </sentence><sentence id="1509">So he -- Chaim was the only one what took his girlfriend, what took, took his Dutch girl. </sentence><sentence id="1510">He was the only one from all the Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1511">See how lucky I was. </sentence><sentence id="1512">And we run and there we come together with a bunch of these Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1513">And Chaim say to them, "Can we stay together?" </sentence><sentence id="1514">And one had a gun, a large gun; and he wants to shoot Chaim because he was afraid for me because I don't speak Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1515">And, and right away they're, you know, they're afraid. </sentence><sentence id="1516">So I jumped in front of Chaim, and he didn't shoot Chaim. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And we went away, the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="1518">We left all of them, and we went away, the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="1519">We had -- Chaim had some money, some gold pieces and some diamonds and we thought it was a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I have no idea how much it was. </sentence><sentence id="1521">We both don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1522">He had in -- where you put the glasses in --a case, he had filled with diamonds and gold and you know. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And so we came; and he thought that and that was what we thought we can save our lives with. </sentence><sentence id="1524">Was his brains, not mine. </sentence><sentence id="1525">I wouldn't even think about money. </sentence><sentence id="1526">So we went to a farmer in a little village, and we asked if we can stay for the night. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And he say, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1528">Chaim give him a gold piece, a gold dollar. </sentence><sentence id="1529">I don't know how much it was. </sentence><sentence id="1530">And we stayed in the attic for the night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1739">Q: How did you find this place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1741">A: We just saw somebody with a light on, and we walked in. </sentence><sentence id="1742">We had a lot, that was just luck. </sentence><sentence id="1743">We -- just the lucky stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1744">So I thought we didn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="1745">It was just a little house and in the same village, the same day, we stay at night. </sentence><sentence id="1746">We hide at night. </sentence><sentence id="1747">In the same day, the Germans came and they went a lot of houses and they killed all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1748">All the Jews what, what they could find, they killed all over; and they skipped this house where we were in, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1749">But the same village that they went in houses in, so when it was started to be dark -- I remember there was no bathroom, of course, and I had to go to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1750">We were hidden down in the attic, and I'm still ashamed of what it was, it was terrible, it was  3 terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1751">Anyway, I walked in water and my shoe got too small, my boots got too small, so I took off my boots. </sentence><sentence id="1752">I couldn't get it on anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1753">So I had to walk all the two weeks on the side of my boots. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Chaim had to cut it open with a knife, and I had to walk on the side of my boots; on one, on one boot when I couldn't get it on anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1755">So we walked and we were wet and it was raining and we walked at night and I was very scared, and we walked through the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And every tree I looked "Frenzel." </sentence><sentence id="1757">Frenzel wore always in, in cape, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1758">And it, and sometimes the tree looks like that. </sentence><sentence id="1759">I remember Chaim say once to me, "Now you have to stop saying things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1760">You make me scared too." </sentence><sentence id="1761">And once we went through a woods, and there was a body where we went through woods -- very big where we walked for days. </sentence><sentence id="1762">It -- and there was a body laying there. </sentence><sentence id="1763">We had to -- you know -- and it was very scary, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I came from a little town, and you know you come from after Sobibor but still it was just -- it was very scary. </sentence><sentence id="1765">We walked at night. </sentence><sentence id="1766">When it's turned daytime we tried to hide. </sentence><sentence id="1767">We tried to hide in houses, but most of the time they didn't want to take us. </sentence><sentence id="1768">Sometimes they took us for money but most of the time not. </sentence><sentence id="1769">We slept in the woods, and we and when we walked near to an other town. </sentence><sentence id="1770">We walked on the stars, on the stars; on the Wagen"(r), I think, on the Wagen. </sentence><sentence id="1771">That was Chaim's part. </sentence><sentence id="1772">We walked on the Wagen. </sentence><sentence id="1773">So that's - Chaim want to go to the farmer where he worked before the war. </sentence><sentence id="1774">Now in the war, he worked by a farmer; and he thought he goes to the farmer where he worked and perhaps this man will hide us. </sentence><sentence id="1775">So we walked on the stars and we walked two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1776">One night we, we, we couldn't find somebody, and we were hidden in a hayloft, in a hayloft. </sentence><sentence id="1777">And we were hidden there; and little kids were, were playing outside and they go, they climbing all on there and we were hiding under this, this hay. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Well, how much can a kid have come up you? </sentence><sentence id="1779">And they saw us and they run off saying, "Jews!";
