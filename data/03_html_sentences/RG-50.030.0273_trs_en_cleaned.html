<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="545">A: Yeah, when I saw SS I meant the German SS as well as the Leucoline SS. </sentence><sentence id="546">And frankly the Leucoline SS were even worse then the German SS. </sentence><sentence id="547">They took -- they were real anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="548">They took their jobs very seriously and, you know, they were, besides the hangings, the regular hangings of people who had bothered for food -- by the way, the first transports that had come into the ghetto, when they first came into the houses they found that the apartments had been pretty much plundered. </sentence><sentence id="549">They had been destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="550">All of the valuables had been taken out. </sentence><sentence id="551">But once in awhile hidden away some place we would discover a piece of jewelry or something and then even though we had never gotten our own clothing in the ghetto there was a clothing depot set up that -- where we issued our clothing and these things were used to bother on the outside for food. </sentence><sentence id="552">A piece of bread or whatever we could get. </sentence><sentence id="553">Because you could not live on the food rations we got in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="554">We were given 200 grams of bread a day issued once a week and potatoes and old cabbage leaves and fish heads. </sentence><sentence id="555">And once in a great while a small portion of horse meat which was a great treat. </sentence><sentence id="556">So as I said, you had to supplement your food through outside bartering. </sentence><sentence id="557">Otherwise you could not exist. </sentence><sentence id="558">So you had to take your chances of being hanged. </sentence><sentence id="559">Sometimes one of our SS commendans would shoot people on the spot besides the hangings. </sentence><sentence id="560">So we had shootings and hangings all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="663">A: Well, the commandant must have looked over us young girls and who ever suited his fancy he thought we would do for that assignment. </sentence><sentence id="664">So I befriended five of the girls on this labor detail and we decided that once we would get back to the ghetto we would try to move together. </sentence><sentence id="665">Where as, you know, they all had been from different districts in Germany and we had all lived in different places. </sentence><sentence id="666">So after the summer was over we got back to the ghetto and our life went on as usual in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="667">We went on our work assignments and as usual. </sentence><sentence id="668">Then in -- yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: Well, actually, we reminisced more about our childhood and about the good times than we wanted to dwell on the hard times that we had there. </sentence><sentence id="795">Which actually became worse later on. </sentence><sentence id="796">Well, anyway, while I was helping my friend Lilly to take care of these younger children I had a relapse of my hepatitis and the jaundice and I was taken back to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="797">This was in the later fall of 1946. </sentence><sentence id="798">And I was in the hospital again for several weeks and improved to some extent, but really not enough to be discharged. </sentence><sentence id="799">So one day my girlfriend Lilly who had visited me regularly at the hospital, came by . </sentence><sentence id="800">There was no visiting time and she called me at the window and said to me "I'm very glad to hear that you're coming out of the hospital tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="801">Well, I understood immediately what that message meant and I told the doctor, the chief doctor in the hospital, that I would be leaving the hospital the next day and he said "Not with my permission. </sentence><sentence id="802">You are in no condition to be released from the hospital." </sentence><sentence id="803">I said "With or without your permission I'm leaving." </sentence><sentence id="804">And so here I was barely able to stand on my feet, but I left the hospital the next day. </sentence><sentence id="805">It so happened that Lilly's father, the chief of labor details, had gotten wind of the fact that there would be a -- that the hospital would be evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="806">All these people would be sent away to their deaths and that's why he had told his daughter to warn me of that. </sentence><sentence id="807">So I came out. </sentence><sentence id="808">This was in November of "43. </sentence><sentence id="809">I came out of the hospital and sure enough a few days later the hospital population was taken out and put to death, but all the other ghetto inmates had to stand for selection. </sentence><sentence id="810">And this time not only were the infirm people taken away, all the older ones who were left and there were not many of them, but mothers with young children. </sentence><sentence id="811">All young children were put to one side and we were asked at what places we had worked. </sentence><sentence id="812">And I of course have not -- having not had worked on the outside, lied that I had been working at the Aviar (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="813">which was the army clothing depot. </sentence><sentence id="814">Otherwise, it would have meant death for me too. </sentence><sentence id="815">And luckily I got away with it. </sentence><sentence id="816">I was put This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="817">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="818"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 -- put on the right side. </sentence><sentence id="819">So all these mothers with the young children got taken away that time to their death. </sentence></p></dialogue>
