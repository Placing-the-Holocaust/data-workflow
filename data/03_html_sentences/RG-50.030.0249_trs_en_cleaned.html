<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: Were you involved in cultural activities or community activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: To a certain extent, with the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="42">We went to the synagogue, and I had religious lessons there in the afternoon, because we did not have a day school, a Jewish day school. </sentence><sentence id="43">So I went in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="44">And besides this, I was very friendly with some people, some youngsters who lived a little further out in Bremen, a suburb called Hammerlichen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="45">And those Jewish people whom I saw there, it was a two hours walk, but I went on the weekends several times. </sentence><sentence id="46">They were mostly from Poland, and they had settled there. </sentence><sentence id="47">There was a difference in the Jewish community between what they call the ost stuent (ph) and the west stuent (ph). </sentence><sentence id="48">And I felt very comfortable with the ost stuent (ph), too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Did -- were you involved in any political organizations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="59"> A Not really, but I remember that sometime before Hitler came to power, 1932, I remember, I was associated of going with the Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="60">And in the Zionist organization, it was more leftist. </sentence><sentence id="61">And I did not like this, because they are very close to Communism, and I did not like it, and I left. </sentence><sentence id="62">And some 30 or 40 other youngsters left with me, and we joined a different organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="70">It was not really a political organization. </sentence><sentence id="71">It was more or less a religious organization, a of Israel. </sentence><sentence id="72"> received 107 people, I think, 107 members in the parliament. </sentence><sentence id="73">And they came into the car where we were riding, into the street car where we were riding, and my mother was very much afraid that Jewish life in Germany would become different, which it did. </sentence><sentence id="74">And I saw many times that -- that the Nazis had in mind to exterminate all the Jews, especially in the non-Jewish school where I went, they sometimes ridiculed me and they said to me, "Go back to Jordan, go back to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="75">You don't belong here." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: These were other students? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="85"> A Students, yeah, from the non-Jewish school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: And this was all prior to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: This was even prior to Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: So you were -- you were fairly aware of Naziism before Hitler came to power, then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="94">But we never thought that he would get power, because the largest party in Germany were the social democrats. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: So how did all of this start escalating when Hitler came to power? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: When Hitler came to power in January 1933, we listened to the radio, and we thought that it would only last a little while. </sentence><sentence id="100">Because we had non-Jewish friends living near us, and they told us, "Don't worry, it will only last a little while, and it cannot go on this way. </sentence><sentence id="101">It will stop." </sentence><sentence id="102">However, by that time, many youngsters and many other people had joined the party. </sentence><sentence id="103">Some of them joined the party even though they were not 100 percent convinced about Hitler and had no -- much belief in him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Why did they join the party? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: They knew things would change. </sentence><sentence id="112">And there were different reasons, because of the political speeches which Hitler made, because of blaming the Jews for having mishandled and brought Germany into such a mishap, like the S.I. and all kinds of  because if they ever found out, they would send me to the concentration camp," because they already had concentration camps in 1933. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: So you didn't feel that it was going to be this serious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: We felt -- we felt that every day had got more serious. </sentence><sentence id="118">Because in the very beginning, when they had the seven states -- seven days of celebration, when Hitler came to power, afterwards when they had the Reister (ph) fire, the burning of the ragster (ph) at the end of February. </sentence><sentence id="119">And then finally, when on April Ist, they had the first progrune, (ph) the day of solidarity, they called it, when -- which happened to be on the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="120">And Jews were not allowed to go out. </sentence><sentence id="121">Non-Jews could go out. </sentence><sentence id="122">So we really felt it was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="123">Also, they forbade right away Schreichter (ph), that means slaughtering according to Jewish custom. </sentence><sentence id="124">So we felt it was getting bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Now, how did the attitudes of your friends, your teachers, start changing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: In the beginning, they still came to our business. </sentence><sentence id="136">But as time went on, when Hitler made a law that all the parties were prohibited, except the Nazi national party, national socialist. </sentence><sentence id="137">And anyone who joins Jews, who talks to Jews, then they slowly kept away from Jews, from us. </sentence><sentence id="138">And it happened before, you see, that they tried to do something against it that we should not have business anymore, and take away the business from us. </sentence><sentence id="139">It happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Can you -- do you have specific memories of situations with good friends of yours who were not Jewish, or your teachers, how they started changing toward you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: There were many changes. </sentence><sentence id="148">Let's talk about, if I may, so talk about our neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="149">We had a neighbor who had also -- who had been placed there by the Nazis and had also a bicycle and repair shop. </sentence><sentence id="150">And he didn't know very much about the business. </sentence><sentence id="151">He came to my father, and my father taught him and gave him business and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="152">One day, the Nazis told him to build a high wall near our house, so high that we could not look out anymore, completely close our windows, just in order to take away business from us, even though he came to us and he wanted to -- he needed it, because he didn't know too much about the mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="153">Regarding the youngsters, the children, more or less, they were forced to join the Hitler Youth. </sentence><sentence id="154">And as soon as they joined the Hitler Youth, they were not allowed to have any more contact with Jewish people, with me and others. </sentence><sentence id="155">But the teachers, if that's what you are asking me, were different. </sentence><sentence id="156">The teachers were a different generation, the generation before. </sentence><sentence id="157">And they felt that it was not right to do this. </sentence><sentence id="158">And quietly taking me apart, they told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="159">But not publicly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: So for a while, you still were in the public schools, the teachers were kind to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Things didn't change too much initially? </sentence><sentence id="177">A No. </sentence><sentence id="178">In fact the teacher told me at that time in 1934, they made a law that Jewish children, especially orthodox Jewish children, were no longer allowed to go to school on Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="179">They used to do this. </sentence><sentence id="180">And when they went to school on Sabbath, they would not write, would not take baggage along. </sentence><sentence id="181">Now they said, "If you come to school, you have to do everything." </sentence><sentence id="182">So I went to my teacher and I said to him, "I don't want to come any more on Sabbath." </sentence><sentence id="183">He said to me, "Why don't you want to come anymore?" </sentence><sentence id="184">So I said to him, "You know, when Hitler came to power, Hitler wanted Germans to know about their background as Germans, to give them a certain sense of identity, according to what he thinks is the identity. </sentence><sentence id="185">So I want to go a little bit back to my own identity to being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="186">I want to be more Jewish now. </sentence><sentence id="187">You want to be more Nazi; I want to be more Jewish." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: This was brave in 1934. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="203">And then the teacher told me, "What I will do to you is, whatever I teach on the Sabbath, I will tell the students to give you the notes. </sentence><sentence id="204">And besides this, on Sabbath, I will teach them Mein Kampf, Hitler's book, so you won't be there." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Why do you think the teachers -- was this a risk for the teachers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: It was a certain risk. </sentence><sentence id="211">But they did not do it publicly. </sentence><sentence id="212">They put on the Nazi emblem, which was like a life saver, double ring, with a swastika in it. </sentence><sentence id="213">And the teacher told me I had to put this on. </sentence><sentence id="214">This is my life saver. " </sentence><sentence id="215">They are taking away my job," and many jobs from teachers were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="216">The principal of my school where I went, non-Jewish, was retired, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="217">The teachers at that time were about between 50 and 60 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how all this started changing. </sentence><sentence id="227">And my guess is that every year it certainly got worse in terms of your ability to spend time with your Gentile friends, or your teachers" relationships with you. </sentence><sentence id="228">How did life start changing? </sentence><sentence id="229">Do you remember any specific people or instances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="235">We were good friends with people, neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="236">And there were some young people. </sentence><sentence id="237">We came together; we played together. </sentence><sentence id="238">There was a yard, what they call a playground like this, not far from us. </sentence><sentence id="239">And we played together with them. </sentence><sentence id="240">And everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="241">I even went on bicycle tours with some of these people and everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="242">I even have a picture at home where I am in this picture with the neighbors, the non-Jewish people who were with us. </sentence><sentence id="243">They were all very nice to us. </sentence><sentence id="244">However, it changed because everyone was forced -- two things. </sentence><sentence id="245">They were forced number one to join the Hitler Youths. </sentence><sentence id="246">And number two, they were forced to tell the Hitler Youths of what their parents thought about the Nazis at home. </sentence><sentence id="247">And so slowly it infiltrated to the parents and to others, you see. </sentence><sentence id="248">And they felt it was not safe anymore to talk to Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: And they stopped talking to you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Slowly, they stopped talking to us. </sentence><sentence id="266">Then later on, they started to avoid us by walking on the other side of the street, or by just not talking to us. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Were they ever abusive or violent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: No, not in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="270">But you could not complain, because there were still people there who were of the old type. </sentence><sentence id="271">And I remember that one day I went to the -- a fair, which they had in Bremen nor far from us, and they showed a puppet show. </sentence><sentence id="272">And in the puppet show, they showed how the one person went against the Jews, boop, boop, boop. </sentence><sentence id="273">So I asked a policeman there, which actually was stupid of me. </sentence><sentence id="274">But I asked the policeman, "Why do you show such shows?" </sentence><sentence id="275">You see, "Why do they show such shows here," you see. " </sentence><sentence id="276">The Jews are also people." </sentence><sentence id="277">He didn't answer, because the answer was simply, "Because this regime is against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="278">That's why we have to infiltrate the public, and we have to make them aware that Jews are different. </sentence><sentence id="279">And they have to be done away with." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: As time went on, were you ever hurt or abused in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Not directly. </sentence><sentence id="294">But I remember that one day, when I was in Wurzburg and I went home from the school to the dormitory, the boys came and they took away my hat. </sentence><sentence id="295">And they threw it up, and they tried to hurt and beat me. </sentence><sentence id="296">And, but I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="297">Somehow I got this hat back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Were you ever afraid? </sentence><sentence id="304">Did your parents start getting fairly worried about the situation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: My mother was very much afraid of this situation. </sentence><sentence id="308">And my father, too. </sentence><sentence id="309">But, so we started quite early, 1934, "35, or even before that, to find relatives or people all over in the world, wherever we thought we had some people. </sentence><sentence id="310">Because some of my mother's relatives had gone to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="311">Some had gone to South America. </sentence><sentence id="312">And my father, Russia was out of the question. </sentence><sentence id="313">To find out if they would be able to help us getting out, because we want to get out. </sentence><sentence id="314">And the only way, especially after the Nuremberg laws, 1935, and then 1936, they made it like imperative to move out. </sentence><sentence id="315">We couldn't stay there anymore, because the business got worse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Was your father's business closed down? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: Eventually, you see. </sentence><sentence id="328">They made very little -- they earned very little in that business. </sentence><sentence id="329">And they had something like what's called a community project whereby they collected food and so on. </sentence><sentence id="330">And we even had to use some of this food in order to live, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Now, you graduated from public school, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: Yeah, even later. </sentence><sentence id="338">I graduated from some kind of high school in 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: And then you went -- then you went onto -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="341">Then 1936 when I graduated from there, through the help of a teacher, a Jewish teacher in Bremen, I went to Frankfurt am Main. </sentence><sentence id="342">And I was in Frankfurt am Main for one year. </sentence><sentence id="343">We considered this, like, instead of military service, Jewish service, you see, because many people there prepared what they called Hashra (ph), which means preparation for moving out to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="344">At that time it was very difficult even to go to Israel because it was under British dominion, and the British didn't want anyone there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: So you went to -- you went to this school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: In Frankfurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="355">And things -- were things more difficult, less difficult there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="358"> A In Frankfurt, contrary to Bremen, we lived in a Jewish -- more of a Jewish environment. </sentence><sentence id="359">And at that time, we did not feel so much about what the outside world did. </sentence><sentence id="360">But we read, of course, the papers. </sentence><sentence id="361">But from Frankfurt after one year, I went to Wurzburg, which was a teacher's seminary. </sentence><sentence id="362">And this teacher's seminary was not far from the railroads. </sentence><sentence id="363">And there, I saw every day trains, freight trains, dozens of them, covered up with tarpaulin, with machine guns, moving to the front, to Czechoslovakia, to Poland, to all kinds of countries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: What did you make of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: So we thought -- of course, this was done secretly. </sentence><sentence id="373">But we knew or we thought that this was a preparation for war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: Of course, now, you were thinking about war. </sentence><sentence id="377">You weren't necessarily thinking about concentration camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="381">You see, at that time we knew there were concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="382">Because already in 1933, "34, "33, when they had the Sachsenhausenbergerhomme (ph), we heard from friends of ours, Jewish friends, that they had received urns of ashes from concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="383">And it said, "This person was killed while trying to flee," or, "This person committed suicide," or, "This person had been ill." </sentence><sentence id="384">And so we knew something was going on there, but we didn't really know what was going on there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: Do you -- do you have memories of any of the book burnings or any of some of the more violent outbursts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="393">I remember the book burning was early in May 1933. </sentence><sentence id="394">And just because of curiosity, I wanted to go and see it. </sentence><sentence id="395">So I went out, it was in the evening, about 9:00, 10:00 o'clock, I  went out to this big place where they had all the books and they were burning the books. </sentence><sentence id="396">And I was standing from afar. </sentence><sentence id="397">And I saw all of the -- thrust all of the books into this bookcase, into this fire and burned them. </sentence><sentence id="398">So I saw the book burning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: This was in Bremen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: In Bremen, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: What did you make of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: I only thought, "They don't know what they are doing." </sentence><sentence id="413">Because these were some of the most intelligent people, you see, that burned the books. </sentence><sentence id="414">They probably don't know anything about these books, you see, just to burn it. </sentence><sentence id="415">I say, by burning books, you cannot really do much, because other countries have the book. </sentence><sentence id="416">And so the books wouldn't get lost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="422">Q: Was it frightening at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="424">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="425">Europe was frightening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="428">Q: Do you have memories of shops closing down, or any other violent outbursts prior to Kristallnacht? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: Prior to Kristallnacht, we had in Bremen what we called great big department stores. </sentence><sentence id="431">And there were two or three department stores in the main streets in Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="432">And they had actually built department stores which were new at that time, you see, were the newest kind. </sentence><sentence id="433">There was one department store by a Jewish person who had for the first time this escalators. </sentence><sentence id="434">They didn't have escalators before. </sentence><sentence id="435">And this went up to the fourth floor, the escalators. </sentence><sentence id="436">And people went there a lot, just because of the escalators, I think, Jewish department store. </sentence><sentence id="437">And they were closed and taken over by non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="438">Or if they were not taken over directly by non-Jews, a non-Jew was made the chief manager of that department store. </sentence><sentence id="439">I think it was Bamberger's department store, if I remember, and certain others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="450">Q: Did -- I mean, did this make it more difficult to start getting things to have a normal life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="452">Not just the store, but in general? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: We tried to live a normal life as much as was possible. </sentence><sentence id="454">And we tried to get out of Germany as soon as possible and to find some way of living. </sentence><sentence id="455">You could not change, because since we had this business, and my father knew this business, and we were helping him in this business, that was a way, you see, we could make a living. </sentence><sentence id="456">You couldn't just change and do a different job. </sentence><sentence id="457">Because eventually he was thrown out of the , which means the trade union, and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="458">And they even  things. </sentence><sentence id="459">And then they said, "These things were stolen." </sentence><sentence id="460">And they want to accuse him of having stolen these things. </sentence><sentence id="461">They came in and buying things at a different price, and just to say, "He oversells, he overprices," and things of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="462">But thank God, he was -- they couldn't put anything on him, you see. </sentence><sentence id="463">But they tried. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="476">Q: How did you all combat this? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="492">Q: Tell me a little bit about Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="494">A: Actually, Kristallnacht did not start at Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="495">It started, I think, on the 28th of October, when a number of students from the school where I had been at that time were of Polish descent, and they were sent away. </sentence><sentence id="496">And that's where the story of Herschel Grynszpan comes in. </sentence><sentence id="497">They were sent away. </sentence><sentence id="498">First they were sent to a prison in Wurzburg. </sentence><sentence id="499">And we went there and we threw packages of food in there, and we tried to help them. </sentence><sentence id="500">And we tried to tell them so-and-so. </sentence><sentence id="501">Then when the Germans and the Poles concluded their contract, I mean, the negotiations, then suddenly it stopped. </sentence><sentence id="502">And the trains which had been sent to Poland was like this: A part of the train in Germany, they could go back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="503">The part of the train in Poland, they could stay in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="504">Even the Polish were just as much anti-Semitic as the Germans, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="505">And the people in the middle were in No Man's Land. </sentence><sentence id="506">And that's where Herschel Grynszpan came. </sentence><sentence id="507">But two weeks later on November 9th, the 10th, was the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="508">No one thought of this. </sentence><sentence id="509">What happened is this: On the day before Kristallnacht, we were studying in school for a test which should have been the next day. </sentence><sentence id="510">And I had already been a student and a teacher in this school at the same time, because I spoke a little bit of Spanish, so I gave a little bit Spanish classes in school from October to November. </sentence><sentence id="511">And then in the night it happened, I went home early on that evening, because I wanted to study some more. </sentence><sentence id="512">And besides this, I wanted to have a good night's sleep for the test the next day. </sentence><sentence id="513">You want to hear more about that? </sentence><sentence id="514">So we went to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="515">Then in the middle of the night, about 2:30 or 3:30, I don't remember anymore the time. </sentence><sentence id="516">I think it was -- it was the night that I remember, the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="517">We heard noise coming in, into the dormitory where I stayed, which was in this little side street. </sentence><sentence id="518">And I woke up my colleagues, and I said to them, "What shall we do? </sentence><sentence id="519">There is noise. </sentence><sentence id="520">Shall we go and find out where the noise comes from?" </sentence><sentence id="521">So we waited, and we heard -- the noise got louder. </sentence><sentence id="522">So I said to them, "Let's make sure we are safe." </sentence><sentence id="523">So the window, there was a window in the room on the top, barricaded so we couldn't even go through that window. </sentence><sentence id="524">Outside, there was a hallway. </sentence><sentence id="525">And outside the hallway, there was a yard. </sentence><sentence id="526">So I said to them, "The best thing is we get dressed now. </sentence><sentence id="527">And if anything should happen, we are ready to encounter whatever there is." </sentence><sentence id="528">And I said, "Let's get our bags ready, if anything should happen." </sentence><sentence id="529">And then I said, "Let's maybe hide under the -- under the bed, or in that corner." </sentence><sentence id="530">And then I decided, "No, we don't --  0 shouldn't hide. </sentence><sentence id="531">We should just meet it head-on." </sentence><sentence id="532">So there was a door, one door, with a little lock. </sentence><sentence id="533">First I tried to lock it, but then I said, "It's no use. </sentence><sentence id="534">If they come, they come." </sentence><sentence id="535">And they did come. </sentence><sentence id="536">They made a lot of noise. </sentence><sentence id="537">They came in, and they saw our suitcases there. </sentence><sentence id="538">And they said, "Take these suitcases and throw them against the window." </sentence><sentence id="539">They wouldn't fall outside the window anyhow, because the windows were barricaded. </sentence><sentence id="540">Then he said, and I said to them, "What shall we do?" " </sentence><sentence id="541">Stay here and wait until we give you orders. </sentence><sentence id="542">And you should know, we never even bent a hair of a Jew, and we won't do it this time. </sentence><sentence id="543">But eventually, you will all be exterminated," something like that. </sentence><sentence id="544">I don't know if they said the exact words. </sentence><sentence id="545">So we waited, then said, "What should we wait for? </sentence><sentence id="546">Let's go downstairs." </sentence><sentence id="547">That was on the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="548">We went through the hallway, and we saw in the big -- there was another dormitory place. </sentence><sentence id="549">We were on a small side room with lamps hanging down. </sentence><sentence id="550">They just took their swords, or whatever they had, and cut off the electric lamps that were hanging down. </sentence><sentence id="551">They cut the faucet so that the water was just coming out. </sentence><sentence id="552">And they said to us, "Go downstairs." </sentence><sentence id="553">There was a non-Jewish janitor. </sentence><sentence id="554">And he said to us, "You better get dressed and get ready, because we don't know what's going to happen," because they didn't tell anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="555">Then the caretaker of the house thought it would be good idea to go to the police and tell them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="556">But that was a joke, because going to the police, they just kept him there. </sentence><sentence id="557">He never came back, and probably afterwards was sent to concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="558">Then the woman of the house downstairs said, "What I will do," it is 4:00 o'clock in the morning, 4:30, "I will make some coffee for you. </sentence><sentence id="559">I will give you something to eat." </sentence><sentence id="560">And she did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: Excuse me, this is the same morning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: This is the same morning. </sentence><sentence id="651">On November 10th, it was a Thursday morning, they came back. </sentence><sentence id="652">And the Nazis who were not dressed in Nazi uniform, because they wanted the people to believe it's the foixvut (ph), the anger of the people. </sentence><sentence id="653">And this does not come from the party, but comes from the plain civilian people. </sentence><sentence id="654">They were in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="655">They told us, "Get a little bit together." </sentence><sentence id="656">We thought we should pack all of this. " </sentence><sentence id="657">No, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="658">You will come back." </sentence><sentence id="659">Of course, it wasn't true, you see. </sentence><sentence id="660">So we took a few things along, and they said, "All of you assemble in this corner." </sentence><sentence id="661">And so we assembled in that corner. </sentence><sentence id="662">And then about 7:30 or so, they said to us, "Now let's go and march." </sentence><sentence id="663">They marched about three or four, maybe even six in a line. </sentence><sentence id="664">We were about -- I don't even remember how many people there were. </sentence><sentence id="665">But there were 50, 60 people or more. </sentence><sentence id="666">And we walked, it's a narrow street, through this narrow street. </sentence><sentence id="667">And we walked toward the prison they led us. </sentence><sentence id="668">And while we were going through the street, the populace, the people were  1 standing at the side. </sentence><sentence id="669">I think they were all Nazis, because they spit at us, and they threw stones at us and all kinds of -- and they made noise and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="670">We went through the street and we passed by the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="671">We saw the synagogue burning. </sentence><sentence id="672">And we went all the way, and Wurzburg is a city where there used to be a palace of the Bavarian king. </sentence><sentence id="673">We passed by there, and they led us to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="674">And they were -- the Germans were very methodical. </sentence><sentence id="675">When you came in, they took a picture of you, on the right side, from the left side, from the front. </sentence><sentence id="676">And they took all your money, or all kind of things which you had in your pocket. </sentence><sentence id="677">And they made a complete record of it. </sentence><sentence id="678">They were very meticulous. </sentence><sentence id="679">They were very orderly in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="680">And they gave it to us, and they said, "Sign here." </sentence><sentence id="681">Okay, we signed. </sentence><sentence id="682">Then they led us into cells, prison cells. </sentence><sentence id="683">And I was in prison cell number 99, I think. </sentence><sentence id="684">And there were about 15 boys in that prison cell. </sentence><sentence id="685">They put us in there, in the water cell. </sentence><sentence id="686">And there was, like, a toilet, a bowel. </sentence><sentence id="687">And there were windows on top, with iron bars. </sentence><sentence id="688">And there was -- I don't think anything else, maybe a few mattresses or so. </sentence><sentence id="689">And in the door was a little window. </sentence><sentence id="690">And through this window they gave us food about an hour later, like water with a few beans in it and things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="732">Q: How long were you in this prison? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: From that Thursday until the next Thursday, eight days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: It was fairly -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="738">A: And we always thought we would all be sent away. </sentence><sentence id="739">Because every morning and every evening, they took us all out. </sentence><sentence id="740">Once a day, they led us around the prison yard to give us a prison walk for an hour. </sentence><sentence id="741">And then they led us all out, and they read a list of names to make sure everyone was still there. </sentence><sentence id="742">And every day, the number had come less. </sentence><sentence id="743">And we imagined, because no one told us, that they probably were sent to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="744">And then came the last day of the seven days. </sentence><sentence id="745">They called us a list. </sentence><sentence id="746">They called us a list, and they read all the names. </sentence><sentence id="747">Then they read seven names, and I was among the seven whom they read. </sentence><sentence id="748">And they said to them, "Stay at the side." </sentence><sentence id="749">We stayed at the side. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="762">Q: What were you thinking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: I didn't know what they would do with us. </sentence><sentence id="765">I think they would send us to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="766">But what happened was, all the others were sent to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="767">And these seven, I among them, was stateless. </sentence><sentence id="768">And they said to us, "You are stateless, and we are going to send you away," not telling us where. </sentence><sentence id="769">So I thought maybe they send me to Russia, because my father came from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="770">And I said to myself, "It's better to be in Russia than to stay here," even though I didn't know that at that time it was just as bad. </sentence><sentence id="771">And I already made up my mind to go to Russia. " </sentence><sentence id="772">Within 24 hours I will be in Russia." </sentence><sentence id="773">That was at noon-time then. </sentence><sentence id="774">Then they came back in the evening, and they called us again, the seven people. </sentence><sentence id="775">And they said, "Go downstairs and report to the office, the prison office." </sentence><sentence id="776">I know now that all the others were sent to concentration camps because they wanted to empty the prison of all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="777">All people under 15 and over 60 were  2 sent home. </sentence><sentence id="778">They only kept the people between 15 and 60, I think. </sentence><sentence id="779">So when we came downstairs, they told us, "You are free. </sentence><sentence id="780">Sign this." </sentence><sentence id="781">And they gave us back all the things which they had taken away from us. </sentence><sentence id="782">They were very meticulous. </sentence><sentence id="783">And they said, "Return within 24 hours to your home cities, and report to the Gestapo." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="804">Q: Now, how did this feel? </sentence><sentence id="805">I mean, it must have been a fairly strange feeling that you were so close to being sent away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="808">A: I didn't -- I felt -- I said, "Whatever is going to happen to us, we cannot do much about it. </sentence><sentence id="809">We can maybe pray a little bit," and that's what we did while we were together in this cell. " </sentence><sentence id="810">But what can we do? </sentence><sentence id="811">We hope for the best, you see, and we know bad things -- bad things are going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="812">We hope that a miracle or something would happen, and things will change for us." </sentence><sentence id="813">Well, it was very bad, and nothing helped us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="820">Q: Now, while you must have had a certain immediate relief at not being sent away, what were you thinking about the other people you had spent time with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="822">A: We felt very bad about the other people that were sent away. </sentence><sentence id="823">And we hoped that maybe they wouldn't have to stay there such a long time. </sentence><sentence id="824">At that time, they had concentration camps, but they did not do the killings in such large measures as afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="825">They killed a few people, as I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="826">They sent the urns to those people about -- Jews and non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="827">I even know non-Jews whose urns they had sent away, back to them, to family. </sentence><sentence id="828">So we thought -- and beside this, when we came out, we knew that Greppels (ph) had called off -- Gurling (ph) had called off the sending away the Jews on the day afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="829">It didn't make much difference. </sentence><sentence id="830">I only felt, I only thought that maybe I would come home and I would see what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="831">But for eight days we didn't know what was going on in the world because we were completely separated from any news. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="842">Q: I'm going to ask you, do you want a glass of water? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="846">Q: I want to talk to you about what happened when you got home. </sentence><sentence id="847">You were from the prison, and then went back to Bremen; is that correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="850">A: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="851">After I got out of the prison, I needed to go back to my home town. </sentence><sentence id="852">And I needed money for the train, and I had none. </sentence><sentence id="853">But as I say before, miracles happened. </sentence><sentence id="854">The miracle happened, I met the secretary of the school where I left. </sentence><sentence id="855">And I asked her, "Can I have some money?" </sentence><sentence id="856">And she gave me 20 marks. </sentence><sentence id="857">And I went back to the school to find out if any of my belongings were still there. </sentence><sentence id="858">And I went to the school, and I met another fellow, and -- but I couldn't find anything. </sentence><sentence id="859">It was all locked up. </sentence><sentence id="860">And so I went straight to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="861">And it was late at night, because we came out, it was in winter, November. </sentence><sentence id="862">It gets dark early. </sentence><sentence id="863">I came to the train station, and the train station was packed with Nazis and other people at that time. </sentence><sentence id="864">And I went to the counter, and I bought a ticket. </sentence><sentence id="865"> 3 But during the train trip, I was afraid if they would find out that I'm a Jew, they would beat me up or throw me off the train. </sentence><sentence id="866">So while I was traveling on the train and the train would come to Bremen about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, I was walking always along the hallways in order to walk around and not sit at one place. </sentence><sentence id="867">Because I was afraid of that. </sentence><sentence id="868">And I was probably the only Jew there on the train. </sentence><sentence id="869">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="870">So then I came back to Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="871">When I came to Bremen, it was a Friday morning. </sentence><sentence id="872">You can figure out, on the 10th, 17th, it was probably the 18th of November. </sentence><sentence id="873">And I came to the station, and I took a trolley car to where we were living. </sentence><sentence id="874">And I thought everything was okay. </sentence><sentence id="875">I tried to call my mother and my parents from the train station, but there was no answer. </sentence><sentence id="876">So I said, "Okay, I walk. </sentence><sentence id="877">I will go there myself." </sentence><sentence id="878">I went there. </sentence><sentence id="879">And I walked over. </sentence><sentence id="880">And when I came to our house, I saw the whole -- all the windows that barricaded with wood. </sentence><sentence id="881">And the side door had a note there, "Get the key from the police department." </sentence><sentence id="882">So before I went to the police department, I saw a neighbor of ours on the other side who had a furniture business. </sentence><sentence id="883">And he was really a good friend of ours, non-Jewish person. </sentence><sentence id="884">Because as I told you, we had mostly non-Jewish neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="885">And this man just went to me with a finger, "Come in, come in." </sentence><sentence id="886">He was afraid to say anything or stay outside. </sentence><sentence id="887">He did it from inside the window, and he took me in. </sentence><sentence id="888">And he took me in one of the rooms which was farthest away from the entrance. </sentence><sentence id="889">I think it was a safe -- he had a safe, I'm not so sure. </sentence><sentence id="890">And I don't know whether his wife was there or not, because we were also friends with his wife and his children. </sentence><sentence id="891">And he said to me, "I want to tell you what happened on the Kristallnacht." </sentence><sentence id="892">They didn't call it the Kristallnacht then. </sentence><sentence id="893">They called it the progrun (ph).
