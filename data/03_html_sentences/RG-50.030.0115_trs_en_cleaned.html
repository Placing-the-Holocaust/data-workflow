<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: There is by, you know, a few people knowing, you know; and they.... This...this was, you know, situation where you never know more than three people. </sentence><sentence id="170">You know. </sentence><sentence id="171">So you really, know, was given a job to do and this was in organizing--very early, 1939 still, and 1940 at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="172">So, uh, there was not, not much as the...the activity as more just the organizing uh process that we are involved, you know. </sentence><sentence id="173">Hiring more and more people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="174">But this was from the very, very beginning uh ...in action. </sentence><sentence id="175">On account of that, and also because uh uh again the Germans were, you know, arresting young people and uh taking them to Germany to forced labor camps, I had to uh, uh...uh... stay in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="176">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="177">I had to...I, I was not sleeping at home for, uh, for many months; because, you know, it was, uh, uh, not safe. </sentence><sentence id="178">And out of that came the idea that I must go. </sentence><sentence id="179">Cross the border, and go to another country; and, uh, maybe again join the army in France, which was being uh...uh, organized at that time. </sentence><sentence id="180">Uh...so with three other people, uh, L...on...in March 1940, I uh...I went through the Tatra Mountain[s] to Czechoslovakia; and I traveled through the through the Czechoslovakia, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="181">And I traveled almost to the other end of that little country, almost to this Hungarian border. </sentence><sentence id="182">And here we...I, myself and another uh fellow, we were arrested; two survived and two escaped--but two of us were arrested, because we just, uh, ran into the uh...uh...set-up, you know, by the...by the police. </sentence><sentence id="183">They waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="184">So, uh, they arrested us and then they sold us to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="185">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="186">Slovaks sold us to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="187">I mean, they...I understand that they were paying money, being paid money for that, you know; because they were, they...in other words, uh, they were, um, working as agents for the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="188">You know, Slovaks at that time were cooperating with Germany. </sentence><sentence id="189">There was a government run by that uh uh priest Haha  [NB: reference to Joseph Tiso?]. </sentence><sentence id="190">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="191">And uh... and, of course, they...they allowed German to...on the roads come in to the trans...military transport to go right through Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, uh, at the end, uh, they gathered us all arrestees--and there were thousands of people that were being arrested--uh, so about...a huge train, a huge train was going toward the Polish border one day. </sentence><sentence id="193">And we crossed the border to the town of Muszyna, where the Gestapo took it over. </sentence><sentence id="194">And that is why I got in contact with the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="195">And they were immediately, uh, segregating all those uh, arrested...arrestees. </sentence><sentence id="196">Uh, I tried to...I, first of all, I...made up a, uh...false name; and I stick with that false name all the time, because I was ashamed to let my parents know that I allowed myself to be arrested. ( </sentence><sentence id="197">Laughter). </sentence><sentence id="198">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="199">And so I stuck to that, uh, false name; and, of course, everything, all the personal data and everything uh, uh...was changed to and also falsified... falsified. </sentence><sentence id="200">And I figured that it would be good idea to uh to to be born in Soviet territory, because I was hoping, "Well, the Germans will never get there." ( </sentence><sentence id="201">Laughter) How wrong I was!

These was the soldiers" helpers; and we already know really, you know, we're in huge trouble from the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="351">There was not time to grab the, uh, suitcases and all our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="352">We all just had to jump, uh, from the train; and right away, you know, uh, we are in, uh... beaten and kicked and everything. </sentence><sentence id="353">And this way we marched to the, uh, inside; and they right away, uh, uh...made a column of us, and were,  uh...we were, uh, processed. </sentence><sentence id="354">That means we have to be, you know, the...the...the data, the personal data, was, uh, was written under; and then they...then they shave our heads. </sentence><sentence id="355">They gave us number. </sentence><sentence id="356">My number was 564. </sentence><sentence id="357">And, uh, immediately they started a gymnastic with us. </sentence><sentence id="358">There was nothing else to do; so, so they says that first an gymnastic, uh, the German call it Hiipfenrollen, all kinds of, uh, terms. </sentence><sentence id="359">I remember a beautiful grass around that building; but in few hours, there was no grass at all, you know. </sentence><sentence id="360">In the next few days, it was really uh necessary to go and find something to do other than gymnastic. </sentence><sentence id="361">You know, a real work, even a hard work. </sentence><sentence id="362">And, uh, I was assigned to a group that was going to a military compound, uh, nearby to clean uh uh the rubble which was...uh, they partially destroyed this whole building. </sentence><sentence id="363">And in a week or two, we moved over there to a small camp consisting of three blocks in one corner of that compound. </sentence><sentence id="364">And this was the beginning of the camp Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="365">Out of that, uh, area we would then go out and build first of all a kit...a prison's kitchen, and then surround the whole area--which was twenty- one, uh, brick blocks--with uh barbed wire, electrified barbed...uh, barb...barbed wire fence. </sentence><sentence id="366">And immediately after uh after this was accomplished, this...the new transport start arriving. </sentence><sentence id="367">And there are transport who had come from Silesia, from Krakow, from Warsaw; and uh from other countries, too. </sentence><sentence id="368">And ...and uh to the end of that year, to the first winter, the camp was probably about uh, uh fifteen thousand people strong, you know. </sentence><sentence id="369">Immediately, Germans began uh to...uh enlarge the camp by building new blocks. </sentence><sentence id="370">They built another eight blocks; and uh so the...so the thirty, thirty-nine blocks was the end of the...of the whole construction in that area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: Tell me more about what your...what a day was like in Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="398">From the morning "til night. </sentence><sentence id="399">What was a day like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="403">A: Well, we would get up very early, even before the sun... sunrise. </sentence><sentence id="404">And immediately...and eat and get a uh uh substance that was called "coffee," which was made out of the bark uh of a...some tree, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="405">I mean, it was bitter but it was black, you know. </sentence><sentence id="406">And it was bitter, and...that's it. </sentence><sentence id="407">Now if you have saved uh some bread from the day before, then you're lucky and you'll eat that uh that piece bread before going to work. </sentence><sentence id="408">But if not, then you just drank that coffee. </sentence><sentence id="409">And then immediately you were thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="410">Regardless of weather, you thrown out uh...outside and you'd have to stay and wait for a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="411">The reason being that people, uh those who are um... who are um...who are uh assigned to do the cleaning would uh clean up the rooms where we slept; and they themselves would then join us and go to work with us. </sentence><sentence id="412">And certain hour after, uh we would all assemble and there was a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="413">A roll call uh is the...it is a ceremony that the Germans never stopped uh doing. </sentence><sentence id="414">It was uh at certain times uh three roll calls a day; in the morning, in the uh at noon, and in the evening--and later on, too. </sentence><sentence id="415">But not less than two. </sentence><sentence id="416">And after roll call--if everything was OK, if there was nobody missing, you...you...all the dead from the night before were counted.... And they were, have to be counted because at night the offices, German offices, were closed. </sentence><sentence id="417">So if anybody died, you would be counted as alive until the offices opened so he could be uh crossed out in the big book and say that he is uh...he is dead. </sentence><sentence id="418">So anyway this was...if everything accomplished, and uh and nobody, as I say, was missing, then you would join the groups, working groups. </sentence><sentence id="419">So the people would  go, you know; some would go to the uh...uh to...with the wheel-barrows and uh spades, you know, to do the work on improving the roads or to the agriculture or, you know, or to the so-called "Bauhof" [Ger: "building yard"], where all the professionals were working. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="420">Uh, uh...all the skills like uh...uh masons and uh...and uh carpenters. </sentence><sentence id="421">There was a, also in Auschwitz, in that area, a group of uh sculptors from Zakopane. </sentence><sentence id="422">They would do this...they would, they would create the plates for SS; and, you know, the ashtrays--all kinds of things made of wood. </sentence><sentence id="423">So I, I even work with them for a while. </sentence><sentence id="424">Also there was another jobs, very important; of course, in...in uh offices. </sentence><sentence id="425">I work, my first work was in uh...an architect's office; and uh I was assigned to do the renderings, color renderings, of uh projects that were in...in uh...on the drawing table. </sentence><sentence id="426">Uh, all these drawings will then, will go with the plans to Berlin for approval. </sentence><sentence id="427">Everything has to be proved; approved in Berlin, or in Sachsenhausen or in Oranienburg. </sentence><sentence id="428">I also had a secondary responsibility uh...in that office. </sentence><sentence id="429">I would help the surveying team. </sentence><sentence id="430">From the very beginning, uh, the surveying team would go in the terrain and do a uh...work on the map. </sentence><sentence id="431">And they were really hurrying; the German wanted it, that map, because the uh area around Auschwitz was being depopulated, the vill...villages destroyed, people taken to the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="432">Uh so, uh that any terrain would have to be measured...uh all the roads and all the buildings or everything, and sent; because on it, that basic map, they would do the planning what's going to be there in the future. </sentence><sentence id="433">On one (cough)...one area of that uh big territory there, the camp on...later on they built a huge compound "Birkenau," which is the village of Brzezinka. </sentence><sentence id="434">In Polish, it's called Brzezinka. </sentence><sentence id="435">In German, they call it "Birkenau." </sentence><sentence id="436">Uh, this is where later on, in 1940, would be start the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="437">So, uh, until the evening we would do all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="438">Uh, all of this outside of the camp; uh, so we would go in the extra guards. </sentence><sentence id="439">Extra guards--there are large garrison in Auschwitz. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="440">Uh, they would set out some...1941, some hundred guardsmen, and they would join--few of them with every group--and go and stay the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="441">Again in the evening we would all return. </sentence><sentence id="442">And, uh...uh on the average day in Auschwitz there were always orchestra playing, and uh the people would return and form like a small parade. </sentence><sentence id="443">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="444">With the tools in the hands that they used during the work. </sentence><sentence id="445">They would march to German tangos and (laughter) and uh...military songs; and this was must. </sentence><sentence id="446">And to attention, of course, while the commandant and all the SS would watch. </sentence><sentence id="447">And you have to do, uh, march very briskly, like uh...like a soldiers; because the German, they like make of us soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="448">Uh, to a point, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="449">And then of course we would assemble on the roll call place, and there would be the roll call again. </sentence><sentence id="450">If the roll call was successful--nobody had escaped--uh, then we would go, and we would get your our uh...our uh supper. </sentence><sentence id="451">If there was a situation what somebody escaped, then instead of going to the Block, we would wait. </sentence><sentence id="452">And, uh, meantime the search party would go out and search for, uh...for a man who has escaped; and the search party would be, uh, composed of the soldiers and the Kapos, uh, from there. </sentence><sentence id="453">So there would be about three hundred, four hundred people going around and looking for, uh...for an escapee. </sentence><sentence id="454">Usually it was not, uh...it was almost impossible to leave entirely the area of the...where, where the during the day the guards were stationed; because, uh, it is always, uh, open...that area was open...and there was no, uh, no places, no...no bushes, no trees, nothing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="455">So app...usually an escapee would have to know, uh, have to, uh, get the hiding somewhere in the building in that area outside of the  camp, and then wait for a night to come. </sentence><sentence id="456">So that is why most of those who escaped, uh, usually were found. </sentence><sentence id="457">Now if a man was found, then he would go to a bunker for a while, true uh...uh. </sentence><sentence id="458">And he would be asked </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="459">Q: why he did it, how he did it. </sentence><sentence id="460">Gestapo were interested in that. </sentence><sentence id="461">And then on the next day or day after, he, uh...he would be paraded through camp; and then, uh, on the, uh, roll call, uh, ceremony he would be hang on the gallows. </sentence><sentence id="462">And this was a regular punishment. </sentence><sentence id="463">If a...if this was not the case, then we would go just simply to the blocks and get our soup and bread and margarine, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="464">And it was all kinds of, uh, uh...and this diet was, uh, usually a watered soup and a slice of bread, and a little bit of of margarine. </sentence><sentence id="465">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="466">And then after that, uh, there was about one hour of daylight; so in this time you would have to repair your uniform, you know. </sentence><sentence id="467">Under the supervision of Blockaltester, who was the...the manager of the Block. </sentence><sentence id="468">And what is the Block? </sentence><sentence id="469">Block was a, uh, a number of people who lived on...in...on one floor. </sentence><sentence id="470">Blocks, uh, buildings, were two-story buildings; and that means in every building, uh, would be two blocks, uh...because there were two different floors. </sentence><sentence id="471">Sometimes even on, uh, in, uh, on attic they would form another Block. </sentence><sentence id="472">And generally was not more...not enough room more for some hundred and fifty men. </sentence><sentence id="473">But I remember times when there were up to one thousand people in every Block. </sentence><sentence id="474">So in one bed, we would sleep six of us. </sentence><sentence id="475">So there was actu...actually no sleep; we were just sitting, you know, the whole night. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: The museum in Auschwitz, uh, was in, uh, in 1941 established. </sentence><sentence id="498">The idea was, uh, uh, came from the, uh, comman...the camp manager. </sentence><sentence id="499">His name is, uh, Fritzch, Commandant Fritzch." </sentence><sentence id="500">He created two things. </sentence><sentence id="501">Museum and the orchestra, symphony orchestra. </sentence><sentence id="502">Uh, symphony orchestra was, uh...uh, very large. </sentence><sentence id="503">It was opera...uh, run professionally. </sentence><sentence id="504">It was so good that they would, uh, allow her to go to the neighboring town and have a concert, for Germans, in Katowice, in...in Bytom, even in...in...1n Wroc_aw [Ger: Breslau]. </sentence><sentence id="505">Now, museum was beginning, uh, from, started from small beginnings that Franz Targosz was the manager of that." </sentence><sentence id="506">And his, uh, function was to go and look, and...and, uh, confiscate a more interesting items that the people used to bring when they come to camp; so in museum were things like, uh, national flags, uh, military, uh...uh, orders. </sentence><sentence id="507">You know, there were Jewi...Jewish bibles. </sentence><sentence id="508">There were, uh, there were, uh, folklore uniforms, all kinds of, uh, maps, all...this kind of things, you know. </sentence><sentence id="509">And there were...now, the reason why the German, uh, allowed this--uh, and they even, the German even allow a big area for that at certain point. </sentence><sentence id="510">Why? </sentence><sentence id="511">Because they were always expecting a International Red  Cross, uh, visit. </sentence><sentence id="512">So if this would occur, then they would have a, uh, opportunity to tell, "Look, and...you know, the prisoners here are uh doing alright, you know. </sentence><sentence id="513">They are living, they are...you know, they are having even a museum!" </sentence><sentence id="514">And things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="515">In the museum there were, uh, several people working--or employed--were, you know, to send, that, uh, were sportsmen. </sentence><sentence id="516">I, I mentioned before [Czerk (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="517">He was one of the...of the steady people working there. </sentence><sentence id="518">He was painting on glass. </sentence><sentence id="519">There were two Jew, Jewish fellows who were translating with the bible. </sentence><sentence id="520">It was also Fritzch's idea. </sentence><sentence id="521">He wanted to have a bible, uh, translated from, uh, Hebrew to German; so there was a, uh, uh, older man. </sentence><sentence id="522">Uh, he was a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="523">And he knew the bible, and he was translating into Polish. </sentence><sentence id="524">And there was another, uh, friend of his who translated it from Polish to German. </sentence><sentence id="525">Now in four years, I understand they translated two pages. ( </sentence><sentence id="526">Laughter) And they both survived, because the Germans just simply have forgotten about them. </sentence><sentence id="527">This is something that happens very often in, in, in the big camp--that, you know, once you establish yourself then they will forget about you. </sentence><sentence id="528">And then you are on your own. </sentence><sentence id="529">It is up to you, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="530">That means you have, you have a...you, you learn the...you learn the tricks how to not be beaten, how to, uh, stay in hiding if it's necessary. </sentence><sentence id="531">And, of course, there was always a time, uh, an opportunity, to get an extra food, too. </sentence><sentence id="532">And this was also important. </sentence><sentence id="533">So those two fellows, you know, survived. </sentence><sentence id="534">You know, with all this Holocaust, they...nobody bothered them. </sentence><sentence id="535">And of...and it goes for other people, too. </sentence><sentence id="536">Those who are chosen when the transport came, and they were chosen to go as prisoners--I mean to be uniformed as prisoners and go to for work...they usually, uh, survived, most of them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="537">Unless they were either, you know, run into the trouble, uh, with the...with the Kapos, with, uh, Blockaltesters, or they got sick. </sentence><sentence id="538">A lot of people, uh, died in Auschwitz, unfortunately; because of the, uh, uh...like uh...there was a typhus, you know? </sentence><sentence id="539">The typhus killed thousands of thousands of people. </sentence><sentence id="540">Another way to die in Auschwitz was to go and be executed, you know. </sentence><sentence id="541">The Gestapo always uh, you know, was the final judge and, uh, on the fate of a man. </sentence><sentence id="542">And they would...and they sometimes wait a long time before they, uh, would, uh, send a man for execution. </sentence><sentence id="543">Sometimes I know people who, some who survived two years in camp; and then they were executed. </sentence><sentence id="544">Uh, and they were never told for what-- for why, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="545">The execution was taking place in Block 11, uh, on the courtyard between Block 12 and Block 11, and that execution wall still standing in Auschwitz today. </sentence><sentence id="546">And uh...at the beginning, uh, execution was performed by a platoon of soldiers, uh, with, uh, with rifles; and it was very noisy. </sentence><sentence id="547">People in Auschwitz knew about it, that something's going on in in the camp; uh, because there was that salvo. </sentence><sentence id="548">So later on the Germans changed the whole, uh, occurrence. </sentence><sentence id="549">They would, uh...they would use a silencer; and one man would execute a, uh... the prisoners by pointing to the neck, you know. </sentence><sentence id="550">And, uh, I remember, uh, I know the man who was executioner. </sentence><sentence id="551">He was, uh, a top sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="552">Uh, his name was, uh, Palitzsch.? </sentence><sentence id="553">He was a twenty-nine year old man. </sentence><sentence id="554">He had a family and four children. </sentence><sentence id="555">But at the end, he fell in love with Jewish woman; and he was sent, uh, to the  0 concentration camp and to the east front." </sentence><sentence id="556">Nobody knows what's happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="557">But these men, these men had certain...in 1942, executed in one afternoon three hundred people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="619">Q: Did you see it, and can you tell us about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="621">A: I didn't see the...the action; but I saw the corpses being driven on the big wagon and the...with the blood running to the street, as they were uh...uh...on their way to crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="622">This we saw, all...all of us, because you know, we were waiting for a roll call at that time when they were going right through, to the main gate, you know. </sentence><sentence id="623">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="624">Now, uh, this three hundred people, this was a transport that was arrested in 1942 ina restaurant in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="625">Uh, mostly artists and actors and uh...and uh, teachers (cough); and they were brought, uh, to O_wi_cim, to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="626">And they, uh, were assigned the works; but only they work about two weeks, and they were all called up--their numbers called up--on the roll call, and, uh, assembled in, uh, Block 11 and shot, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: You survived. </sentence><sentence id="634">One of the ways you survived was by contact through the Museum. </sentence><sentence id="635">Can you tell us what you did, and how you did things in the museum--what your contact was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="639">A: I, uh...no, well I really can...uh, my contacts were actually uh with the surveying team-- earlier, you know. </sentence><sentence id="640">Museum is something that you do in your spare time. </sentence><sentence id="641">Uh, I was always working. </sentence><sentence id="642">I really never worked in the Museum as such; but I did lot of work over there and a lot of paintings that are still there, because it was a meeting place uh for many artists. </sentence><sentence id="643">There were about five hundred artists that I know in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="644">So uh many of them...there was even a hard place, a hard time to get a place to stand in the Museum and do some work. </sentence><sentence id="645">But, uh, the contact with the civilian were done uh...uh, when the...we would go, allowed to go and out to Auschwitz as a surveying team. </sentence><sentence id="646">Because automatically we had to have a contact with people, because we were going into the areas which was uh in process of depopulation and there were always few people still left uh wait...waiting to be transported somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="647">So that is how all the contacts grew up with the families and underground. </sentence><sentence id="648">And, uh, as you...when we were about to escape we had a very good contact with underground. </sentence><sentence id="649">And there was a plan drawn how; and where this will occur and in what time, on what day, and who's going to be waiting. </sentence><sentence id="650">And it worked the same way as was planned, after many months of uh missed opportunities and, you know, in uh disappointments; because you...you...you never are sure, you know, if you really succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="651">But uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: Tell us how you...how did you plan it, and who did you plan the escape with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: I was planning with another man whose uh name is on that picture, Kuczbara [NB: identified on the photograph as "Bolos_aw Kuczbara"]. </sentence><sentence id="668">Sometime, some day, as we were  1 walking--at that time I was working in a different uh job. </sentence><sentence id="669">I was uh in "Arbeitseinsatz" [NB: "Special Work"], which is uh a uh labor relation office. </sentence><sentence id="670">And uh as we were wal...returning to the office one day, we just talked about it; and we found out that each one of us is...has a false name. </sentence><sentence id="671">And uh...and we came to the idea that this is a a good...that is a...the next step would be...uh, should be an escape. </sentence><sentence id="672">And, of course, he told me that he's a Polish general's son, and that he goes to the certain areas in the camp and listens to the radio. </sentence><sentence id="673">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="674">He has a communication with it.... 1 don't know if this is uh true, because he was this kind of a fellow who imagined a lot of things; but anyway he was always very active. </sentence><sentence id="675">So, we had in our office a uh a sergeant, German sergeant--uh, blinded on one eye--older man, who was a teacher before; and he was the manager of that office. </sentence><sentence id="676">He was...he had a apparently large family, and he was always in the need of money. </sentence><sentence id="677">He was worrying so much about that uh family of his, so that Kuczbara-- who...you know, who knew almost everybody, uh...especially in in uh...in the area of...in the hospital area.... Because he also was a dentist--although he told me he never was a dentist--but he was pulling the teeth in...he, he he was acting as a dentist in...in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="678">So he knew a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="679">And, see...so, uh, that...that German uh asked him for money, and he want us bring several hundred dollars...uh, marks, German marks. </sentence><sentence id="680">But there was this...there was a prob... there was a stipulation that we would have to go to Auschwitz to get this money; because it is our family that will bring that money, you know, and hide in certain area near...near town. </sentence><sentence id="681">And if we go there and we find money, he'll get it. </sentence><sentence id="682">Now this was a plan of escape. </sentence><sentence id="683">We were supposed to escape from that point. </sentence><sentence id="684">He'll get that money; but we will, we will escape. </sentence><sentence id="685">And there was a idea that uh we will give him something to drink. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="705">Q: Give who something to drink? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: A whiskey with a uh with uh...with sleeping pills in it. </sentence><sentence id="708">Or something. </sentence><sentence id="709">But what's happened: he didn't drink. </sentence><sentence id="710">He was not drinker, you know. </sentence><sentence id="711">This was one of uh thousands of soldiers who didn't use any (laughter)... So it, it didn't work, you know? </sentence><sentence id="712">We have to come back. </sentence><sentence id="713">There were several other ways we tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="714">Never work. </sentence><sentence id="715">And finally we came on idea that we will never do it unless one will uh be dressed as a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="716">And we started organize a German uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="717">This took, took months. </sentence><sentence id="718">And uh...uh I, my job was to furnish...to give him all the documents the sol...the German soldiers uh usually carried in the wallet. </sentence><sentence id="719">And, uh of course, the main thing was to...to make that main, most important uh document where he needs a photograph. </sentence><sentence id="720">So, again, Kuczbara uh found...uh found...in his, in his bag on his arrival he apparently brought, you know, some pictures of his. </sentence><sentence id="721">See he went there and he found that uh, that one picture. </sentence><sentence id="722">He gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="723">I painted a uniform on that pictures. </sentence><sentence id="724">We sent out then later on that photograph to the underground in Auschwitz, and they made a copy out of that. </sentence><sentence id="725">And the copy came back, and here was Kuczbara in the SS uniform. ( </sentence><sentence id="726">Laughter) Yeah! </sentence><sentence id="727">So we used this uh...that photograph on that document; and uh, of course, other documents--that was, everything that a soldier should have in his wallet, he [NB: Kuczbara] had. </sentence><sentence id="728">Now there was a question of a revolver. </sentence><sentence id="729">Now, the revolver uh...we took from the office uh where we worked, because we saw a Sol...a SS man locking a revolver in the drawer while uh on the weekend he was  2 going to the Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="730">So uh we broke into that uh...table and took the revolver. </sentence><sentence id="731">So we had a revolver. </sentence><sentence id="732">Now, two other people joined us. </sentence><sentence id="733">Uh number two, who is that Kiissel; and...and uh Januszewzki, who was also at "Arbeitsdienst." </sentence><sentence id="734">And these, we...people, we took because they were...they had a way of uh organizing almost anything in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="735">So what happened: Kiissel went to a SS man in agriculture, and uh uh tried to uh loan from him a wagon and two horses. </sentence><sentence id="736">And for these, he offered him the...uh two...uh some furniture... I, 1 forgot, you know, what it was. </sentence><sentence id="737">Anyway, uh the uh SS needed something for furnishing his office. </sentence><sentence id="738">And, of course, if he would go, you know, straight away through a sign...through a signing the papers and the...and ordering this--you know, in official way--would take a month, you know. </sentence><sentence id="739">But here he come, he got in uh contact with the prisoner, and prisoner could do this immediately; because in everywhere in all these places...uh warehouses, there were always prisoners who worked. </sentence><sentence id="740">So this way we got the uniform; because, you know, it was the prisoners who work over there, too. </sentence><sentence id="741">And you know, you give prisoner uh some margarine or, you know, you do him a favor. </sentence><sentence id="742">And uh we were very important agency, because we could uh gave a man a good job uh for this, for...for...for uh giving that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="743">We would, you know, have another favor from, from other people.... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: Well, we waited for a word from the outside people where, when the escape will occur. </sentence><sentence id="812">When, and what time. </sentence><sentence id="813">And uh we were given four days. </sentence><sentence id="814">We couldn't go...there was a plan for four days. </sentence><sentence id="815">Uh, we couldn't go in the first day because first day was a Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="816">The second day was a very bad weather after Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="817">So at the end, it was on 29 of December that in the morning we decided that we're going to go. </sentence><sentence id="818">And it happened this way: I went uh...Kuczbara and myself, we went to the office on usual schedule; and then went out of the office with the papers to, into...into the area where uh the people, usually new people, usually used to come and wait, you know, to...for, uh uh... in...interrogation, you know. </sentence><sentence id="819">That was our job. </sentence><sentence id="820">Two other people--uh Otto [Kiissel] and uh Januszewzki-- they were uh the "Arbeitsdienst"; they had to uh send out all the columns out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="821">And then they would come to our office and have to write a uh a report. </sentence><sentence id="822">Every morning. </sentence><sentence id="823">This I have to emphasize, how...how this uh uh the pro...procedure in, in our office were. </sentence><sentence id="824">Every morning, they had to write a report on how the employment of the whole camp looks like--where, how many they were uh... there were people employed in what categories of jobs, how many there are sick, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="825">Now these reports written on a special typewriter, big one; was then be taken by a messenger--a soldier--who traveled to Oranienburg every day. </sentence><sentence id="826">Oranienburg was a uh headquarters of the labor, of all the labor assignments in the...in, in the...in the camps in the whole Germany. </sentence><sentence id="827">And uh on that particular day, 29 of December, they had to do that in order to be free. </sentence><sentence id="828">After that they could do whatever they wanted because, you know, they were not [Czerk (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="829">You know, they would uh they would visit uh various uh working groups in the field, or in the uh uh area inside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="830">So Otto went to that SS man, who...uh and he got from him a pair of horses and a wagon; and drove this, this uh vehicle through the camp, through a main gate, to Block 24 where we all lived. </sentence><sentence id="831">And he grabbed four or five prisoners who were wandering in the camp, and made them go into the attic; and from the attic they brought down four uh cabin[et]s, wooden cabin[et]s. </sentence><sentence id="832">They loaded it on the, on that vehicle--which was a platform--and he drove out of the camp again, went to that SS man he was dealing with, gave him two cabin[et]s for...for just uh making that deal; and with two uh... two cabi...cabinets on that wagon uh he would uh ride to a place where, in between, Kuczbara would dress into the uniform, SS uniform. </sentence><sentence id="833">Uh, and...and I was with him; and we were waiting for ...for those two to come. </sentence><sentence id="834">We took from our office about  4 sixteen thousand names, files uh of people, uh of transports. </sentence><sentence id="835">Some transports were completely annihilated. </sentence><sentence id="836">You know, we took this as a...as a sample what is going on in our...in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="837">Also, we took a list of uh people who were executed in uh...in Auschwitz--on the Block 11--with the signature of the, the top uh doctor, SS doctor. </sentence><sentence id="838">Uh, he had to countersign them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="839">So we had, you know, some twenty-four thousands of names that we took with us in our briefcases. </sentence><sentence id="840">And when the Otto and Januszewzki arrived with that wagon, we jumped on and we uh drove off to the main gate, again. </sentence><sentence id="841">And at 11 o'clock, uh we drove through the gate. </sentence><sentence id="842">The soldier opened the barrier. </sentence><sentence id="843">Uh Kuczbara told him, "Heil, Hitler!" </sentence><sentence id="844">And that's it, and this was the end.(Laughter) Because we were posing as a working group. </sentence><sentence id="845">We had a...these uh cabinets. </sentence><sentence id="846">This was supposed to mean that we are, you know, delivering a furniture to a SS house somewhere in the area. </sentence><sentence id="847">So nobody bothers us. ( </sentence><sentence id="848">Laughter) That's the way! </sentence><sentence id="849">And then we drove through on the road around the...near the uh Sola River, through Auschwitz to the village of [Brzeszkowice (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="850">The village [Brzeszkowice (ph)] was already empty. </sentence><sentence id="851">People were already thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="852">There were still buildings; and in those buildings the underground put in, you know, our...the, the civilian clothes for us. </sentence><sentence id="853">We changed. </sentence><sentence id="854">We...we uh...drove that uh vehicle into a...into a alley under the roof. </sentence><sentence id="855">Horses to the...also. </sentence><sentence id="856">We take care of that. </sentence><sentence id="857">You know, all the documents were thrown to the well, uh deep well; and some stones thrown on the top of it. </sentence><sentence id="858">And then we went on that attic, the uh dress in the civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="859">And went outside and to the bridge on uh the River Vistula [NB: Wis_a (Pol)]. </sentence><sentence id="860">That [Brzeszkowice (ph)], this is a triangle made of two ri...rivers, Vistula and Sola. </sentence><sentence id="861">It is isolated place. </sentence><sentence id="862">This is why we chose that place. </sentence><sentence id="863">We know not many people around; and on that bridge, uh Sola/Vistula bridge, there were four men waiting for us who had the bikes. </sentence><sentence id="864">Each one of them took one of us, you know; and then we had walked to the second village uh Libi_z, where we stayed for a week. </sentence><sentence id="865">Now the man...yeah, the man who, who was uh managing this whole uh project was a village manager of the the village Libi_z. </sentence><sentence id="866">And he had Germans living in his house. ( </sentence><sentence id="867">Laughter) So uh this was also a very safe place this way, because it was no suspicion that it might be some... some, uh, strange people living in that area, you know. </sentence><sentence id="868">So, uh, we got contact with the, uh, underground. </sentence><sentence id="869">They came. </sentence><sentence id="870">They make a photographs of us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="871">They, uh, promise us to send us the, the German Ausweis, this documents; you know, personal documents. </sentence><sentence id="872">They took all the names of all those--you know, the killed people--in Auschwitz, and, uh, make some photographs, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="873">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="874">The next thing what we did, was that we all at night crossed the border from that village for the next village not far from...from Libi_z, to Generalgouvernement. </sentence><sentence id="875">Generalgouvernement was a section of Poland that German considered Poland, but it was surrounded by the Germans and the governor was famous, uh...uh, Governor Frank. </sentence><sentence id="876">And, uh, when we, uh, crossed that border at night, two of the, uh, the men immediately boarded a train and went to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="877">Two of us, you know, walked to the next village; uh, and we were prepared to hiding over there. </sentence><sentence id="878">We waited for about one week, until two ladies came from Warsaw with the documents for us. </sentence><sentence id="879">And we boarded train again from that village to Krakow, in order to take a night train to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="880">I was supposed to get a studio in Warsaw, a hiding...a, a place where the the people from the underground would meet, you know. </sentence><sentence id="881">An camouflage thing. </sentence><sentence id="882">And, uh, we made it all right to Krakow from the place Brzeszkowice; and as we were waiting in  5 train, uh, to depart, the whole train had been uh was surrounded by the German tanks and the Gestapo went into the cars and arrested everybody. </sentence><sentence id="883">Took everybody. </sentence><sentence id="884">Men, children, women--everybody-- including the two of us, not knowing whom they have. </sentence><sentence id="885">So, uh, uh ...when we were arrested, we...we uh decided that we're going to have to...again try to escape again; because it was only three weeks after a escape and everybody would know now, uh recognize us in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="886">And we knew that this transport will go for sure to O_wi_cim. </sentence><sentence id="887">So, uh, at the, at the moment of, uh, transition from the truck to the, uh, gate in Prison Montelupich," I escape again. </sentence><sentence id="888">I threw out two of the soldiers and I start running, but the...Mietek,deg I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="889">He didn't do it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="890">So because we had it planned that we will, you know, go one in, uh, one direction and another one in other direction, and sort of a .... But, you know, he didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="891">And they all, those soldiers, about forty of them maybe, you know, they, uh, start chasing me. </sentence><sentence id="892">They, they sho...uh, fire uh...shots were fired, you know. </sentence><sentence id="893">One hit me in the ankle, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="894">I couldn't run anymore, and they captured me. </sentence><sentence id="895">And immediately they almost, they wanted to execute me right there, right on the street, you know? </sentence><sentence id="896">And I, uh, remembered that moment. </sentence><sentence id="897">I will never remem...uh, forget it to the end of my life. </sentence><sentence id="898">In the split of second, I was able to to see my whole life, all...I, L...in that split of second, I converse with my family; with my sister, my my parents, uh friends. </sentence><sentence id="899">And then I was ready to die; and I even have uh enough time to wonder how I'm going to be uh looking on that snow, you know, after uh...after uh uh...dead, dead person. </sentence><sentence id="900">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="901">But uh eventually, they uh...they did not do that; uh because it was a public place and I heard them uh talking among themselves that they going to do it on the...on the coal. </sentence><sentence id="902">There was a heap of coal uh right in the courtyard of the prison, and they usually execute people over there. </sentence><sentence id="903">But as we were walking toward that uh prison, uh the Germans were very nasty and somebody hit me with a with a revolver here in the head; cut my head, and this blood was start running. </sentence><sentence id="904">And I came inside that prison in such a bad shape, all bloody and so forth, that they didn't know what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="905">So they sent me to a ambulatorium to stop the blood; and this is how I escape, because they forgot about me again. ( </sentence><sentence id="906">Laughter) And uh the transport... Anyway, Januszewzki, the next morning, in the morn...went back to Auschwitz; and as I say, said, you know, Januszewzki had that big knife. </sentence><sentence id="907">Uh, he probably committed suicide, uh because he never arrived in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="908">And I uh was sick for a few days, sick...and they and they used to come, you know; they would come, the soldiers, and they were very angry. </sentence><sentence id="909">And they would, you know, threaten me with all kinds of consequences; but at the end they were, they were proud of me, that I dared to escape. </sentence><sentence id="910">And we start talking, and they found out that I am an artist. </sentence><sentence id="911">In two days, they brought, you know, all the uh paints and uh material; and I start painting portraits. ( </sentence><sentence id="912">Laughter) And uh it came to the point that they, there was one SS officer who wanted to release me. </sentence><sentence id="913">And he uh started an investigation into who I am, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="914">And, and here comes a uh uh...and...here the whole blame, you know, comes to... to that...to that bad document I...I received from the  6 underground, because they uh...they sent me something. </sentence><sentence id="915">They told me that I am living in Warsaw and...and on certain street. </sentence><sentence id="916">This street was non-existent. </sentence><sentence id="917">Everything was...was uh fake, and... instead to be released, I fell into such a suspicion that then lasted several years. </sentence><sentence id="918">That I wound up with beating and everything; and uh...and this is why they send me to those uh other camps uh later on, you know... </sentence></p></dialogue>
