<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: And no feeling of being different because you were Jewish or anti-Semitism or anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: No feeling of that sort whatsoever, the, the sports were mixed with the religion. </sentence><sentence id="18">The sports were mixed with school. </sentence><sentence id="19">The sports were mixed with music. </sentence><sentence id="20">The ports were mixed with whatever activity was going on in, among our small group and for that reason I think we got along very well.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Were sports an opportunity for everybody to be together and get to know each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: It is, itis an opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="28">Sports is a way in which you can get to know each other, in which you can um be happy together, be distressed together when nec, when it happens. </sentence><sentence id="29">To understand more about the Catholic religion, the Protestant religion in the neighborhood which serves its clientele and it was our responsibility, my mother and father taught us to be together and uh it was, it was a fine, it was a fine way to do it and my father had a hardware store and in the hardware store everyone needs nails and screws, hammers, lawn mowers, it doesn't matter what religion you are, if you need a tool, you need a tool and so I learned a lot about the exchange of information, exchange of equipment tools, um how to make keys, how to fix locks, um 1-o-c-k-s.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Tell me a little bit about your sports activity, what you liked, how good were you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="51"> 3    4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Uh in my younger years there was no such thing as a little league baseball or Babe Ruth league baseball. </sentence><sentence id="53">Uh fourteen managers and 26 assistant managers uh and somebody in charge of the Pepsi cola and someone in charge of, of something else. </sentence><sentence id="54">There, there wasn't that kind of uh relationship that uh the grouping was, was not hard and in that way um my parents were aware of and permitted my participation in sports so I had to balance out the hours I spent in sports with the hours I gave to sports. </sentence><sentence id="55">And um it was uh a good way I think for me to learn um importance of earning a living how different ways exist for earning a living. </sentence><sentence id="56">And uh participating in certain projects regardless of what background you come from religiously. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: What sports did you like? </sentence><sentence id="63">how did you get started? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Uh well one way in which you get started I guess is by having things close to hand. </sentence><sentence id="67">My father had a hardware store but it also had a sporting goods branch to it and so I was allowed to go pick out a pair of ice skates. </sentence><sentence id="68">I was allowed to pick out a pair of roller skates. </sentence><sentence id="69">I was allowed to pick out a brand new basketball and go with a team to a certain neighborhood to play. </sentence><sentence id="70">I was allowed to uh pick for myself and my Dad sold many of those sporting good items but it wasn't pushing me into sports in order to sell a few more gloves, a few more bats, a few more balls, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="71">And my Dad liked them very much too and that's why it was such a surprise to me when I played baseball in the Canadian American league, professional baseball on opening day when um the team I was playing with the Rome Colonels, Rome New York Colonels, um frankly uh had a, an opportunity that no one really ever gets automatically. </sentence><sentence id="72">And that was my father coming secretly and I don't mean secretly in a secret, secretive sense but in a personnel sense. </sentence><sentence id="73">He got on a train and he came up to Rome, New York, didn't let me know, stood behind the dugout watched the belgium between Ottowa and the Rome Colonels, watched his son play. </sentence><sentence id="74">After the game was over had dinner with his son, and a couple of his son's friends from the team and after dinner he got back on the train and went back to Brooklyn to his hardware store. </sentence><sentence id="75">Kind of a homey sequence but that's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="76">And uh most of... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Followed your career. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: That, that started it yes. </sentence><sentence id="91">And as a handball player, tennis player, um I never had golf clubs, we never had that kind of money to fill out all the sporting goods that exist. </sentence><sentence id="92">But that was one, that was one way to do it and the competition that came from sports relationship angles uh was very important kind of experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="93">Because I, I learned to live with the competition, to lose when I had to lose without crying about it. </sentence><sentence id="94">To win when I could win with joyousness and to share with my teammates other, other kinds of experiences. </sentence><sentence id="95">The last thing I would say in this regard is that that may have been the reason why when Little League did start in Rochester, New York I started it. </sentence><sentence id="96">And got the teams together uh got the, the parents together, got it, got it started and then we went off to high school. </sentence><sentence id="97">I 4    5 played catcher for Boys High School and then catcher for Brooklyn College. </sentence><sentence id="98">I was on Brooklyn College when I was selected for the Olympic team. </sentence><sentence id="99">Um. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: .. how you really got into baseball, did you love it, how good were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Well I was it was not a great competitor. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was a good competitor. </sentence><sentence id="115">I was fair. </sentence><sentence id="116">I worked hard at it. </sentence><sentence id="117">I had all the moves necessary. </sentence><sentence id="118">I was a catcher very early and being a catcher eliminates a lot of people from vying for that role. </sentence><sentence id="119">How to hold your hand, how to make sure that the fingers are in such a position that when you, when you went to the minor leagues you didn't get whacked and have your fingers broken there or in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="120">And so it was an attempt to be able to scoop the ball, learn how to scoop it without injuring your fingers and that took some doing. </sentence><sentence id="121">Um so my sports really came from high school from being a catcher at Brooklyn College from which I went to the Olympic tryouts in Baltimore. </sentence><sentence id="122">And the Olympic tryouts were held in 3 places in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="123">In Stanford, California, in western state Michigan College and in the Baltimore area and there were hundreds and hundreds of athletes vying for the spots. </sentence><sentence id="124">There were 21 places on the Olympic team, 21. </sentence><sentence id="125">And there were maybe 6, 7, 8 hundred athletes vying for that, those 21 spots and I was a catcher selected uh by the coaches for the Olympic team from Baltimore, from the east coast tryouts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: You must have been pretty good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Uh I worked hard at it, I worked hard at it. </sentence><sentence id="142">I knew what I was doing and uh wanted to be a catcher right from the beginning and catching is so hard and so difficult and uh it, it's one of the positions in sports where injuries are more likely to happen because of the close activity of the batted ball against the swinging bat and your fingers don't always give that much. </sentence><sentence id="143">Um and so I went off to school, went off to Brooklyn College, became an athlete on the Brooklyn college team, went to the Olympic tryouts, was selected for it uh and then had my chance very happily with meeting up with Hank Greenberg, the uh first baseman of the Detroit tigers who that year was being shifted from first base to outfield. </sentence><sentence id="144">Uh and I talked to him about some things that were going on that I felt needed adjustment and he gave prompt attention to what he thinks he, what he thought he could do. </sentence><sentence id="145">And he did some things that were very helpful to teammates and others on the team. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: ...go back to the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="152">While you were playing baseball in high school and at college, were you ever thinking in terms of Olympics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Never. </sentence><sentence id="156">In the first place you couldn't hope and dream for something that didn't exist, there were no Olympics in the baseball area, there just weren't any. </sentence><sentence id="157">It was track and field where Johnny Woodruff participated, sprinters, jumpers, runners, uh long distance athletes uh you can think about it. </sentence><sentence id="158">You can dream about it and you can measure yourself uh side by side with other athletes and begin to think of your own chances and you try for it and you shoot for it and by shooting for it and 5    6 at some of the materials that um may become available to you, you will see that uh I worked very, very hard to try to get that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: What you're saying is that while you were playing baseball in college it hadn't occurred to you that you might be going to the Olympics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: Never. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: ...complete thought. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: What, what I could say is that the uh thinking about playing in the Olympics as a specific activity compared with uh playing baseball with a semi pro team with a neighborhood team, with a college team, far differed and thinking of playing baseball in college, uh and getting a bid to be on the team, all of which were helpful, um and I was lucky to be one of those selected and as I said they came from Stanford, western state Michigan and the Baltimore area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Did a coach or somebody at college suggest that you go to these tryouts. </sentence><sentence id="173">How did this come about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Uh the coach at the college uh at which I, I earned a silver medal in baseball when I was very young, 16, 17 years of age um kept pushing just said go ahead, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. </sentence><sentence id="177">Uh yes he wanted me to, to keep trying out. </sentence><sentence id="178">Um I gave more energy. </sentence><sentence id="179">I spent more time in practice I worked harder with my teammates. </sentence><sentence id="180">And um when I went to Baltimore, there were 2,300 athletes in the competition. </sentence><sentence id="181">And uh you were tried in all the positions, sliding, hitting um throwing. </sentence><sentence id="182">Uh doubling, triple activities. </sentence><sentence id="183">Uh all of which I knew something about... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="184"> (end first tape) </sentence></p><p><sentence id="185"> (Tape 2 of 3) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: ...for over a month. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: How did exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics come about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Are you ready for the answer now. </sentence><sentence id="191">Exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics really started because there was an American committee on baseball that was pushing very hard for baseball to be introduced and attached to the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="192">The uh number of baseball players in the world were limited pretty much to Central American teams, to all the American teams of course, South African teams uh the kinds of athletes who got started early through films, through television and began to play at a very early age. </sentence><sentence id="193">It really got introduced because 6    7 frankly and I don't take this as a compliment for myself, because of Herman Goldberg who was in charge of developing baseball in the country of Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: I want to go back to Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Please. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: So the United States Olympic committee decided that they were going to try to promote baseball. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="204"> A; They were going to try to promote it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Who came to this decision? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Judge J. L. Hoffman of Cincinnati, Ohio was the one who headed the group that pushed very hard for baseball to be an Olympic sport. </sentence><sentence id="209">Also the American Olympic committee wanted to see baseball in the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="210">They had seen uh ski jumping; they had seen all the other sports and they really wanted to see baseball in there and it came about because the committee of the various sports, finally agreed that it would be a good thing for American baseball to be on the calendar and as far as I can tell that's when it started because I began to get mail. </sentence><sentence id="211">I began to get the first uh pieces of information about the possibility of a baseball tournament being held. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: And so it must have been pretty exciting to be in this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: It was very exciting because well first of all the stadium was very large. </sentence><sentence id="219">125,000 people watching a baseball series, unheard of, unheard of before. </sentence><sentence id="220">Most of the baseball teams in America, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 maybe but 125,000 who ever heard of such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="221">You heard of it in Berlin, Germany for the first time and it was promoted by the small group of 28 baseball players. </sentence><sentence id="222">There were 28 of us assigned to play a series of exhibitions against each other and then go out into the countryside and demonstrate baseball to schools, to colleges, to many German institutions, how it's played uh what the difference is between baseball and soccer, uh what the rules were. </sentence><sentence id="223">How the umpires played, played the game. </sentence><sentence id="224">Um it was done um because of America and I was very proud to be a part of the group that kept pushing without pushing. </sentence><sentence id="225">We kept encouraging, encouraging, demonstrating. </sentence><sentence id="226">This is how left handed first basemen behave, this is how right handed pitchers do this. </sentence><sentence id="227">If you are left handed this is how it's done. </sentence><sentence id="228">And um we, we put it on the map. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: What was the reaction when you were playing these games in Berlin? </sentence><sentence id="241">What was the audience reaction? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: The audience reaction was very poor, very poor. </sentence><sentence id="245">They didn't like the game, they didn't know the game. </sentence><sentence id="246">The diamond, the baseball diamond was never laid out 7    8 like a diamond. </sentence><sentence id="247">They took a four inch white silky tape and they pressed it into the grass. </sentence><sentence id="248">And they made a, a, a uh diamond out of it for baseball. </sentence><sentence id="249">But they never actually made a baseball field, never. </sentence><sentence id="250">It caught hold to some extent, not to such extent as in other countries, especially central America. </sentence><sentence id="251">But it became a vivid activity because it came from America. </sentence><sentence id="252">A lot of the kids wanted very much to know more about America and the sports were very important to them too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: But the audience was not excited. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: The audience was not excited because the pace of baseball much slower than soccer. </sentence><sentence id="267">In soccer the, the ball is moving, moving, moving, moving, moving all the time and the kids are kicking you, and they're kicking you, they're kicking you and they're circling and they're beating out the other guy whereas in the the sports you play hard or you jump hard, you, you run hard. </sentence><sentence id="268">You do all of the things yourself, but in baseball you're part of a team. </sentence><sentence id="269">And it's necessary to uh understand that and uh the crowds on the baseball field were 100,000? </sentence><sentence id="270">not 125,000 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: ...the period before you went over to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="277">How much did you know at that time about what was going on in Nazi Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: I knew less than I guess I am told I should have known by many people who asked me how come you went to Germany when this was going on. </sentence><sentence id="281">The uh number of Jewish athletes, sort of about 8 or 9 out of 328. </sentence><sentence id="282">Um the number of Jewish athletes who made the team and then quit 3 or 4 of those. </sentence><sentence id="283">Knowledge about what was going on with Hitler beginning to come more close to us. </sentence><sentence id="284">Um. </sentence><sentence id="285">One of the most telling experiences that I had personally we'd lived in a small cottage. </sentence><sentence id="286">Mine happened to be named Brandenbourgh cottage. </sentence><sentence id="287">Because Hitler had charged money to all the dead residents of Brandenburg. </sentence><sentence id="288">To pay for his cottage and then they, another group paid for the, their, their named cottage. </sentence><sentence id="289">Another group paid for this and I can recall very vividly the um concern I had when I went down and I saw a big chain at the basement door of our village. </sentence><sentence id="290">There were 28 players who lived in the Brandenbourg dorf in our village and uh what I saw in the rear of the cottage was a door and another door and then a chain. </sentence><sentence id="291">And I opened the chain and I walked, started to walk downstairs in the bottom of a basement. </sentence><sentence id="292">And there was a big cavernous area. </sentence><sentence id="293">I didn't know what it was for but Isure found out. </sentence><sentence id="294">That it was for Panzer tanks, German tanks because what they did was declare the Olympic dorf, and the athlete and the military chiefs were housed where the Olympic athletes were housed after the Olympics were over and I was told by a woman who took care of that building. </sentence><sentence id="295">Raus, raus, raus, get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="296">Get out of there, get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="297">She didn't want me looking down in the basement. </sentence><sentence id="298">I didn't know what was down there but it turned out that it was large enough, the cellar or the basement whatever you want to call it, in my, my cottage you, you find these picture material that was brought to the studio today. </sentence><sentence id="299">Uh you will find uh structures that look like resorts but when you walk down there, the cavernous, they're empty. </sentence><sentence id="300">They're the thick the uh the cement was about 10, 12, 8    9 15 inches thick. </sentence><sentence id="301">And that couldn't be for just a car or a jeep or a truck. </sentence><sentence id="302">Something big had to be in the basement that had floors this thick. </sentence><sentence id="303">You never saw such thick floors and uh it turned out that that became the west point of Germany </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: At what point did you realize this was what it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: I realized what it was after I was in Germany and after I had seen enough of the activity that led to uh the early movement of labor camp people into army men and from boy scouts into young soldiers and from ordinary men uh with ordinary credentials, carrying shovels, dressed in regular clothes but carrying shovels ready to clean out as soon as the American athletes left, ready to clean out what they could from there to get it ready for the army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: So you saw this as you were departing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: I saw this about half way there. </sentence><sentence id="336">I would say about 4 weeks, 4 weeks before we left. </sentence><sentence id="337">I saw it and they were very strict very angry because I, I was the only one who went down to the basement and it was just a happenchance walking down a flight of stairs, we were moving a chain and being yelled at by the German hausfrau and house man who didn't like what they saw. </sentence><sentence id="338">I mean American down in their property, that was going to become a Panzer tank unit as soon as the games were over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: You stayed in Germany for how long after the Olympics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Um, about 2 weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: So I'm sorry but I'm a little confused. </sentence><sentence id="348">When you say you saw people coming in with shovels getting ready to transform the Olympic village. </sentence><sentence id="349">This was while you were there for the Olympics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Yes and the materials that we found by our beds, they were very large books marked Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="354">Just the name Berlin on the outside and in that book were pictures of men marching in parade but they weren't equipped with Army uniforms, they were equipped with regular clothes, with work clothes, with uh seemingly baskets and then shovels on the shoulder and they were walking this way, this way, this way through the whole area there and uh what we found out was that they were not only being prepared for their part in the Olympics, but some were ready on, on the grounds. </sentence><sentence id="355">Ready to be instructed in how to go ahead and um fill in the tanks that were going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: You said there were books that would say Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="360">Or boxes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Yes, on the outside it just said Berlin, one word, that's all and you turned pages and you saw pictures of the army and you turned more, there's one on everybody's bed, propaganda material and it was, it was on everybody's bed and nobody gave them up because you, you were intrigued, and you were reading them, what is this all about. </sentence><sentence id="372">So I began to learn more about Hitler and Goebbels and some of the others after I turned pages. </sentence><sentence id="373">And uh I noticed that the um Olympics were for other purposes than storage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: How odd this is that they would leave this for you to see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: How what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: Odd this is. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="434">Q: Was there talk about a boycott, about not going to the games? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="436">A: There was some talk about it, yes there was and, and a lot of the talk was directed at the president of the American Olympic committee, who I think gave very little preliminary credence to it. </sentence><sentence id="437">But he wanted to see what was happening and he as an old time pole vaulter from Yale University and the head of the American Olympic committee behaved in such a way that um 8 or 9 of us who were Jewish were, were not in the games. </sentence><sentence id="438">I was there because I was working with a demonstration group, not a competitive group at that time. </sentence><sentence id="439">We were striving to teach enough skills so that they would say next time around, we want a baseball team, we want a baseball team and didn't happen that way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="440"> QW: So you were allowed to play in Berlin because you were in a non-competitive sport? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="441">A: I think that would be one reason that the American Olympic committee chairman uh Norman Armitage uh did not have any feeling against me or against Jews that he was visibly going to show. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: From the Olympic village did you ever travel around or go into Berlin and have any unusual experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Yes, there were opportunities to go from the Olympic village into the city of Berlin uh every 30 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="493">It was a special bus arranged for the athletes from different countries. </sentence><sentence id="494">I can recall one event when Marty Glickman a friend of mine from Syracuse University had an opportunity to go downtown together and we went on, we went out on the road ready to thumb a ride into, into the town and uh it the way it worked out was that a German jeep uh or a, or a with sidecar came by and saw our thumbs out waiting for a ride and so they stopped and they invited us in. </sentence><sentence id="495">We went in, into their vehicle and we moved along very rapidly and at one point in the ride, the German driver said to us um can I see your uh passport. </sentence><sentence id="496">Your (autograph?) </sentence><sentence id="497">And he said to me can I see your autograph also in German. </sentence><sentence id="498">And uh we had them with us but we didn't think it was their right to have them and so I went beyond that and I said um, uh tell me did will Yaquie Wilson from Veronichastaten from North America be boxen heint, I was really speaking Yiddish, the word heint meaning tonight and instead of saying hoyte which is tonight in German, I said heinte and so that aroused their concern somewhat and um they asked us to stay over on the side of the highway. </sentence><sentence id="499">They talked to us a little bit, much of which we couldn't understand but they asked for our autographs in spite of the fact that they were saying to themselves, these are two Jewish athletes. </sentence><sentence id="500">We were dressed in uniforms so they knew what, what we were doing there. </sentence><sentence id="501">Uh the uh opportunity for knowledge of other country would be helpful to them so they asked us for our autographs but being stopped on the road, driving along with him and then being stopped to be asked uh what, what your autograph, what your number was and then linking that to uh, a request for an autograph was unusual, that did happen yes. </sentence><sentence id="502">And it was frightening. </sentence><sentence id="503">12    13 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: We were in the, in the, in the bus and uh we were um asked for our autographs. </sentence><sentence id="545">We wondered why and they were beginning to understand when they said, when they saw my autograph, Herman Goldberg, yiddishman, a Jewish man that it was something that they should have been more cautious about. </sentence><sentence id="546">At least they were very scary to us at the beginning and we did our very best to steer clear of them and we walked the last mile or 2 into, into town and I, I went to where I wanted to go to the uh music hall to hear the, the opera Die Fleidermaus and Marty went to some event that I can't recall what he went for. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="550">Q: In Berlin itself were there signs of the Nazi regime? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="552">A: Uh no there were, they were not, they were being very careful to uh keep those hidden from direct public view. </sentence><sentence id="553">There were uh some evidences where um news people news syndicated people, syndicate people wanted to see if there were troubles going on between Germany and the United States because of the existence of Hebrews on the American team. </sentence><sentence id="554">And uh it was clear to us that they wanted those signs down and so there were some ladders maybe 4 to 6 feet tall that I noticed very carefully and there were men and women on that ladder corps. </sentence><sentence id="555">13    14 Uh directing whether or not those people were going to stay on that uh were going to move away from it. </sentence><sentence id="556">Uh. </sentence><sentence id="557">There was no smooth sailing. </sentence><sentence id="558">It was dreadful to think of what might be coming ahead. </sentence><sentence id="559">You couldn't quite tell everything. </sentence><sentence id="560">Um the preparations for athletic events, the preparation for musical events, et cetera were all things that were good things and you couldn't tell immediately that there uh anxiety over seeing what they could do to Americans could be completed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="571">Q: Did you have any other experiences where you were alarmed or felt that there was danger or that this anti-Semitism was rampant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: Yes, there was one series of events where I felt that the uh some news syndicates in America who were very anxious to get evidence that things were not going well for American athletes and that they would like to have me and then perhaps others spread the story through their syndicated news service, spread the word that uh things were not going to be good for American athletes of Jewish background. </sentence><sentence id="574">Um the, the possibility of manufacturing such events when they really didn't exist, was presented by one person from an American news syndicate. </sentence><sentence id="575">It was a kind of situation where um my, my greatest hope would have been the ability to just knock them out on the floor uh and get them off the boat. </sentence><sentence id="576">He followed the boat out into the river and then met the boat 80 miles from New York checking on where could he get where could he dig a good story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="583">A: But there was no foundation for that, that's correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="585">Q: Speaking of the boat ride over, what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="586">was it exciting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="589">A: It was very exciting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: Say the boat ride over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="593">A: Yes, the, the boat ride over was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="594">People were thinking about um Eleanor Holmes Jarrett, wondering about the allegations that she was drinking, using alcohol, using tobacco, there were statements having to do with I think a reduction in the credibility of some of the American athletes was rampant. </sentence><sentence id="595">And uh it got cleared up I think after the thing was laid out on the table and was forcefully presented. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="596"> QW: What was special about this boat ride over? </sentence><sentence id="597">What was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: What was happening was the athletes were not sitting around, they were in training. </sentence><sentence id="599">I was surprised. </sentence><sentence id="600">Jesse Owens, Marty Glickman uh Marty Stoller a whole bunch of athletes, running, jumping. </sentence><sentence id="601">14    15 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="606">Q: I need you to say that over because you said Marty Stoller instead of Sam Stoller. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="608">So what was going on on the boat? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="609">A: Uh there was a great deal of activity going on, on the boat. </sentence><sentence id="610">They were practicing in their events. </sentence><sentence id="611">They were movement, there was, there was nobody sitting around reading a book. </sentence><sentence id="612">Uh they were trying hard to keep their weight down. </sentence><sentence id="613">They worked very hard in every aspect of uh self care. </sentence><sentence id="614">And it was important because these athletes needed to have that great uh spirit, the great ability, the great uh uh bodily condition in which to participate and I think the Americans had it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="621">Q: Was this an exciting opportunity for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="623">A: It was an exciting opportunity for me for the first reason, Mickey Cochrane was aboard ship and one wondered why would the manager of the Detroit Tigers be on board ship. </sentence><sentence id="624">Well uh all the um anxiety about it ended for me when I got word that I was picked up by the Detroit Tigers to become a member of the Detroit Tigers as, baseball team and to become a member of that a rookie staff and then to play with that team. </sentence><sentence id="625">And to play with Buffalo in the International League. </sentence><sentence id="626">Uh they were all very excited to have major league managers talk to you and who knows how much they were watching and what notes they were taking, who knows. </sentence><sentence id="627">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="628">But at any rate it was a great feeling that um having important people on board ship was present and they were taking um plenty of time to talk to athletes and to be with them and to try to assess what they were really like and uh I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="629">I happened to hook on well with the Detroit Tigers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="637">Q: The games themselves, what was it like being there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="639">A: It was thrilling in so many ways because you looked out on the playing field and you saw room for 125,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="640">Not every event drew 125,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="641">Some drew fewer numbers than that but however it was a very exciting thing to see that size crowd. </sentence><sentence id="642">Also to see a group playing a game that they weren't used to. </sentence><sentence id="643">The foul lines were white ribbons four inches wide and they didn't put plaster of paris or yellow uh white dirt down on the field. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="649">Q: ...-move on...the atmosphere, the general ambience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: In the stands where I sat next to Marty Glickman for several weeks while events were going on there were some things happening that uh gave you some more idea of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="652">Hitler did not stay in the visible area of his private balcony when a German athlete won an event. </sentence><sentence id="653">When a German athlete won an event he walked out on his little balcony. </sentence><sentence id="654">He raised his hand. </sentence><sentence id="655">There as a lot of applause and then uh he went back in. </sentence><sentence id="656">When a black athlete perhaps Jewish athletes too, there were very few of us. </sentence><sentence id="657">I couldn't count, there wasn't time to count uh the Jewish athletes and the black athletes especially caused Hitler to turn around and to walk out of his own private balcony. </sentence><sentence id="658">In other words he did not 15    16 want to be seen praising a black athlete even in his own track and field area. </sentence><sentence id="659">He just didn't want to be seen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="670">Q: So what you're saying is, explain this to me once more. </sentence><sentence id="671">You could see Hitler from where you were sitting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: From where I could see Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="675">I could see Hitler every single day. </sentence><sentence id="676">I could see him every day because his travels were mainly going from inside the balcony, outside. </sentence><sentence id="677">Some applause for the German athlete. </sentence><sentence id="678">His hand down when a black athlete won an event and his reverse and his walking out of his balcony when some the country became the winner of an event. </sentence><sentence id="679">He did not demonstrate the uh real feelings of uh Olympic history, Olympic meaning, Olympic strength. </sentence><sentence id="680">He did not demonstrate that at all. </sentence><sentence id="681">It was only what he could gain out of his own team's participation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="690">Q: And so he didn't even salute other white athletes basically just his own? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="692">A: He did not salute white athletes, he stayed away from any opportunity to applaud an athlete who won an event who came from a country that he didn't like perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="693">I can't describe it another way but it, I would say it would be accurate to say that uh he removed himself from his own private balcony as often as he wanted to, to demonstrate his own feeling and uh that's what I saw all the time. </sentence><sentence id="694">Marty and I were very close to the balcony where, Hitler's balcony were not far away. </sentence><sentence id="695">We could see that happening, his walking back and forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="700">Q: What was it like seeing Hitler up close like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="702">A: Uh I was no more than five feet away from him in the swimming meets. </sentence><sentence id="703">I went to the swimming meets and I learned that Hitler went to many of the events without prior notice. </sentence><sentence id="704">For example wrestling. </sentence><sentence id="705">Swimming. </sentence><sentence id="706">Uh the kinds of events that didn't draw big crowds and without prior notice. </sentence><sentence id="707">In other words he didn't tell all on the phone the committee connected with a particular event. </sentence><sentence id="708">He would just arrive there I his car, get out, follow his entourage, get up in the stands, sit there for 3, 4, 5 minutes, get out, go to the next one. </sentence><sentence id="709">That we saw very often. </sentence><sentence id="710">Um there was nothing that I can report that indicates that some one in charge of an athletic event of such great importance would behave that way. </sentence><sentence id="711">I could, I could sense it yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="722">Q: Was there something frightening about him? </sentence><sentence id="723">Something awesome about him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: Yes because. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="728">Q: I need you to say the whole thought. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: Yes, I, I think there was some frightening um characteristics of that type of behavior because it was evident that he did not wish to demonstrate fairness to uh 16    17 athletes from several different countries. </sentence><sentence id="731">Uh he avoided the opportunity to be even handed as often as possible which is one of the, one of the credos of the Olympiad to, to be fair to all the countries of the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="735">Q: Was there anything just viscerally significant about his presence? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="737"> As: -- Uh, walking out onto the field, he did that at the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="739">Q: Please say that again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="741">A: When Hitler was walking out onto the field and that happened several times, it was very, very difficult to understand uh how he could possibly behave one way in the stands, another on the field, another way to the press. </sentence><sentence id="742">Another way to perhaps his own political leadership. </sentence><sentence id="743">It was very difficult to understand that because um the uh work of the Olympiad is entirely different than, than being angry at other people. </sentence><sentence id="744">It's being friendly, it's being togetherness, trying to work together, trying to understand each other from different parts of the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="749">Q: Did he have a commanding presence? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="751">A: What is it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="753">Q: Did he have, did Hitler have a commanding presence? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="755">A: Hitler had a very commanding presence. </sentence><sentence id="756">Never strong enough to present it solo but always second or third line with other protective units around him all the time. </sentence><sentence id="757">Never, never walking into a situation by himself but at least Goebbels and many of the others, 10, 12 people surrounding, walking uh in a way that would, would give you a fright. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="761">Q: And the audience went wild for him. </sentence><sentence id="762">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: When he entered the stadium, when Hitler entered the stadium there was great applause. </sentence><sentence id="766">There was tremendous attempt for his own citizens, his, his German participants, his German spectators to applaud uh the, his, his presence yes that's true and they felt that he was the producer of this grand spectacle, this grand spectacle to make it possible for the rest of the world to be waiting and watching uh what was going on in Hitler, in Germany at this place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: I wanted to ask you a question again about your role over there because I know that in Berlin you played exhibition games and after that you did what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A: After we played an exhibition game, we would assign a series of locations where the 28 of us on the Olympic baseball team were divided into squads and working with local uh physical education teachers and leaders uh to teach baseball to clubs, to teams, to, not to fight them against their great desire to play soccer but to 17    18 teach them that there was another sport and that the rest of the world was waiting for them to come into baseball. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: Did you play exhibition games in these locations? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="778">Q: Did you ever experience any anti Jewish sentiment while you were doing this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: None whatsoever on my, my part, none on my part. </sentence><sentence id="781">The only anti-Semitic feeling that I had slight touch for had to do with the um the newspaper syndicated people who wanted to meet a manufacturer's story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
