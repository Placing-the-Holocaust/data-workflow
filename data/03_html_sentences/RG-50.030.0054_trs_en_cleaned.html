<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: When was he taken? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: He was taken May 26th, 1943--with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="651">In "40...after "42, times were horrible. </sentence><sentence id="652">Times were very intensive, and as I said I was in the Creche and then the, uh, razzias started taking people from the streets, bringing in people from hiding. </sentence><sentence id="653">Everybody went to the Schouwburg as we said before, and that is when the ordeal started with the Creche and the Schouwburg where there were three transports during the week. </sentence><sentence id="654">Now I don't recall exactly what evening. </sentence><sentence id="655">There was one Friday night. </sentence><sentence id="656">There was probably one Monday night, Tuesday or Wednesday...I don't recall the evenings. </sentence><sentence id="657">That meant that the children who were given to the Creche to taken care...to be taken care of, to be loved by everyone, they went on transport, transport...those...during those nights, and that was terrible, the way it went. </sentence><sentence id="658">You see, the Creche was meant for children of parents who worked during the day. </sentence><sentence id="659">They used to come there at eight o'clock, seven-thirty, between seven-thirty and eight o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="660">The parents delivered them, mother usually, and then they got clean clothes and they got breakfast and we played with them. </sentence><sentence id="661">In the afternoon they got a meal. </sentence><sentence id="662">They rested. </sentence><sentence id="663">They were  USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 11 there till five, five-thirty I believe. </sentence><sentence id="664">When the mother was through with work, she came and picked up the child. </sentence><sentence id="665">Now an influx of new children came there, that were taken away from their parents. </sentence><sentence id="666">The Creche was changed then. </sentence><sentence id="667">It used to have...imagine a building...you enter...there's a big hall. </sentence><sentence id="668">Where you enter is a big door. </sentence><sentence id="669">Next door, next to that big door is a smaller door with a smaller hallway. </sentence><sentence id="670">That is the place where the children were given to us in the morning by the parents when they went off to work. </sentence><sentence id="671">The big doors, they were usually not even opened. </sentence><sentence id="672">Every...the whole traffic went through there. </sentence><sentence id="673">Now let's get back to the big door. </sentence><sentence id="674">On the right hand side when you come in, there's a door. </sentence><sentence id="675">That's where the Directrice, Miss Pimentel lived. </sentence><sentence id="676">The following door on that hall to the right is a dining room for the personnel. </sentence><sentence id="677">On the left hand side, there was a small room where the babies used to be. </sentence><sentence id="678">Mothers had babies too, and the babies came there too during the day, so from any time after birth till they were about a year old, they were in that room, in the wicker baskets, in the little beds, and they were very well taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="679">Next to that baby room, on the left-hand side, was a huge kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="680">In my mind, huge then, you know. </sentence><sentence id="681">Uh, then when you go a little bit through the hall, there was a large room but that was where the diapers were washed, because we didn't only take care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="682">We also had to wash their clothes, at least their, the diapers and the the underwear, etc. </sentence><sentence id="683">It was a heck of a smell always (laughter), it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="684">And we didn't look forward to have, to have "corvee," as it was called. </sentence><sentence id="685">There was a big staircase going upstairs, with a balcony. </sentence><sentence id="686">There was to the left, if 1 remember correctly, a room, a right room and the room to the street must have been up front, a huge big room. </sentence><sentence id="687">Uh, at the original time it was used for...we had baby little, little, yah, cots standing there, because the kids would sleep during the day. </sentence><sentence id="688">But now it was converted to a real dormitory. </sentence><sentence id="689">Cots, little beds, everything that could hold a child would stand there. </sentence><sentence id="690">The big huge room in the up front, was then used for the age from about the time they were born "til four or five, and the bigger children would be in another room. </sentence><sentence id="691">I had, uh, charge of children from zero till four or five years old. </sentence><sentence id="692">I was in charge of them. </sentence><sentence id="693">The baby room was moved upstairs because the baby room now became an office where Mr. Stiskind, who was working in the Schouwburg, who was in charge of all the registration of all people who came in there, so he had a room in the Schouwburg; and the Directrice converted [NB: conversed] with him--secretly always--in that baby room. </sentence><sentence id="694">Am I clear? </sentence><sentence id="695">Yah? </sentence><sentence id="696">Uh, by "42, not too many children came in but we knew we could count on many more because there were transports but not as regular yet as it would be by the end of "42, middle of "42, "43. </sentence><sentence id="697">Then really the whole Jewish population was taken away, and they needed every...every centimeter of space they had to put up the children and to put up the people there. </sentence><sentence id="698">So, they came. </sentence><sentence id="699">Uh, let me start a day during occupation, during razzias. </sentence><sentence id="700">They came by tram from the city. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="752">Q: Who came by tram? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="754">A: The...the Jewish people that were picked up in razzias. </sentence><sentence id="755">The bridges were going up. </sentence><sentence id="756">The Germans came in the district. </sentence><sentence id="757">They combed every house. </sentence><sentence id="758">They first with the big, uh, things...with the how do you call them? </sentence><sentence id="759">I forgot...where you...where you can call through [megaphones]. </sentence><sentence id="760">I forgot the name for that thing. </sentence><sentence id="761">Not in Dutch nor English I know. </sentence><sentence id="762">Uh, they screamed in the streets for people have to come down and old people, young people, men, women, children...everybody had to get down in the streets. </sentence><sentence id="763">There would be big trucks, huge  USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 12 trucks to pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="764">They were beaten into the trucks...trucks. </sentence><sentence id="765">Uh, I saw that... have seen personally that they threw older...an older neighbor of mine, all the way down from the staircase because he didn't want to come down, and, uh, that was only once. </sentence><sentence id="766">Then once I was in the Creche, I wasn't in the city anymore. </sentence><sentence id="767">I was there. </sentence><sentence id="768">Maybe lucky, I don't know, because the day my parents were taken away from their home with my brother and the whole family- -May 26th, 1943--I was not home. </sentence><sentence id="769">I was in the Creche. </sentence><sentence id="770">I was there day and night. ( </sentence><sentence id="771">Cough) So, uh, the children, the parents, they came in the tram, were pushed out of the trams. </sentence><sentence id="772">They were standing in front and then in the hall of the Schouwburg and they were registered by people there from the Joodse Raad. </sentence><sentence id="773">The Germans were there standing guard and they were Just seeing to it that everything went correctly, that they were registered correctly by name, by number. </sentence><sentence id="774">So what they tried to do there, they tried not to register children. </sentence><sentence id="775">They tried if possible, if they could, they tried, uh, a family with four children...uh, mama, papa, child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: This is the Jewish Council, or the Joodse Raad? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="802">They would try, if possible. </sentence><sentence id="803">And that was mainly the intent of Mr. Walter Stisskind, with some other people too, because nobody worked alone, nor in the Creche nor in the Schouwburg nor in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="804">It was all a combined effort. </sentence><sentence id="805">At...in the beginning, nobody knew what he was doing, just, uh, trying to save, uh, relative, an acquaintance, somebody. </sentence><sentence id="806">But very soon it became a joint effort to try to save as many as you could in the Schouwburg. </sentence><sentence id="807">So, as I said before, the people in the Schouwburg, they were crowded. </sentence><sentence id="808">Imagine...I don't know how big the theater was...maybe two hundred people at the time...that would have been a big theater I suppose at the time. </sentence><sentence id="809">Many hundreds were sent in there. </sentence><sentence id="810">No beds. </sentence><sentence id="811">No nothing. </sentence><sentence id="812">They were just sitting on very uncomfortable chairs. </sentence><sentence id="813">Uh, there must have been two, maybe three, maybe one...I don't know...toilets. </sentence><sentence id="814">How was that, uh, sixty, seventy years ago when they built the theater? </sentence><sentence id="815">Maybe there was one toilet, so you can imagine what went on there. </sentence><sentence id="816">And, uh, so the Germans decided, "All the children, out" And that's where the Creche came in. </sentence><sentence id="817">We...after awhile, we--the three girls--got orders from our Directrice who was always in touch with this Mr. Stisskind. </sentence><sentence id="818">She sent us to get the children from there and bring them to the Creche. </sentence><sentence id="819">Now we all had...the three of us were all in charge of a group, so we all had a number of girls working with us, and something I regret for the rest of my life is--and my husband knows because he became involved there, too--uh, I had a book with every name of every child, when it came in, who the parents were, when it was born, and when it left. </sentence><sentence id="820">On the last day of the Creche, we left--that's another story--and I couldn't take it with me because that was too dangerous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="841">Q: How did you avoid this entire time being deported yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="843">A: Uh, there was no question of avoiding. </sentence><sentence id="844">Since we were.... the Directrice was supposed to be there... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: Was she Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="849">A: She was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="850">She was necessary there. </sentence><sentence id="851">The three of us were necessary there. </sentence><sentence id="852">The other  USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 13 girls that worked there were necessary there. </sentence><sentence id="853">However, I have here with me a picture of the Directrice with the, as was called, the "Onderdirectrice" [assistant director], the director. </sentence><sentence id="854">She was a non-Jewish woman. </sentence><sentence id="855">She had to leave the premises I believe already in the beginning of 1941 because she was non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="856">So we were all Jewish there, and the Germans would say, "We have...we need some" ...through the Joodse Raad, I suppose..."We need so many people there, and this person, this person, this person...they are necessary because you can't leave those children alone," so there was no doubt for me that I would stay on. </sentence><sentence id="857">So was the Directrice. </sentence><sentence id="858">So were the others. </sentence><sentence id="859">Now we discussed once in a while, what if something, ...heh?But we dismissed it from our minds. </sentence><sentence id="860">We were busy. </sentence><sentence id="861">We were young. </sentence><sentence id="862">We didn't think the worst. </sentence><sentence id="863">We...it it ..now I can honestly say that the big tragedy didn't even penetrate at the time because the people went out to the camps to work. </sentence><sentence id="864">Who could imagine what was intended for them. </sentence><sentence id="865">Who could imagine? </sentence><sentence id="866">Nobody. </sentence><sentence id="867">So, uh, we just hoped that everybody would come back. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="902">A: Three...and I saw them because I saw them in the tram as they...as they drove...they were not even in the Schouwburg. </sentence><sentence id="903">They went directly to the Poldeweg or where ever station...whatever station. </sentence><sentence id="904">They were going straight to Westerbork. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: Because, uh, we found out the same day because other people were brought in and I don't know where the choice was made...this one goes through and that one doesn't go through and this one goes in the Schouwburg. </sentence><sentence id="912">My parents never made it to the Schouwburg. </sentence><sentence id="913">They went through, and uh...yeah that was known so fast because that is such an operation. </sentence><sentence id="914">All the bridges go up. </sentence><sentence id="915">Nobody comes through. </sentence><sentence id="916">Not a gentile, not a Jew, nothing, nobody. </sentence><sentence id="917">So that was known, I think, the same half hour that it started, and messages someway always slip through, come through, and in the Schouwburg they must have known, because they must have been told by the Germans that they could expect many children, many people, many everything. </sentence><sentence id="918">You asked me something I really, uh, never thought of, but we knew what we kew. </sentence><sentence id="919">We knew it. </sentence><sentence id="920">My luck, call it luck...was that I wasn't home. </sentence><sentence id="921">If I would have been home, I would have had the same fate as all the others. </sentence><sentence id="922">But, uh, the children came, kept on coming and by that time there were some organizations going without my knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="923">I mean the underground, the, the, uh, the VN that operated in Brabant and there was an organization in  USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 14 Utrecht and there was an organization in Amsterdam, but unknown to us, because we occupied ourselves only with the children...get them ready, get them from the parents, keep them quiet, play with them, dress them, get them ready for transport, because three times at nig...during the week, the transport would leave at ten o'clock at night. </sentence><sentence id="924">That meant that we knew in the morning already that kids would have to be delivered to the Schouwburg. </sentence><sentence id="925">Now which kids? </sentence><sentence id="926">Most of them. </sentence><sentence id="927">Sometimes it was a lucky one, the one who was not registered. </sentence><sentence id="928">There were very few of them. </sentence><sentence id="929">Those children were hidden within the Creche and my husband can tell his story better than I do, but he stayed with the children that were hidden upstairs in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="930">That those were mostly bigger boys because how could you do it with very young ones, you know, so they must have been so in the age from eight or twelve, thirteen, fourteen...1 don't know exactly anymore. </sentence><sentence id="931">They were taken out. </sentence><sentence id="932">They were either on a walk or, uh, over the hedge...over the edge from...over the...over the...yeah...over the gate in the back. </sentence><sentence id="933">I have never seen it. </sentence><sentence id="934">I haven't even ever known it, because everybody did their own bit secretly. </sentence><sentence id="935">Nobody told anybody. </sentence><sentence id="936">Nobody...you didn't tell your best friend, whatever, because it was just too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="937">Not too dangerous...you didn't realize it was dangerous for you, but it was dangerous for the children. </sentence><sentence id="938">If you would say, "This kid is not registered," then it goes out, then that couldn't be told; and I don't even think anybody knew that that child wasn't registered. </sentence><sentence id="939">That was something absolutely between something absolutely between Mr. Stiskind in the Schouwburg and the Directrice in the Creche. </sentence><sentence id="940">Uh, to take the children to transport was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="941">They were all little. </sentence><sentence id="942">As if they felt, you had to wake them up at nine o'clock to have them ready by ten, and, uh, to get them dressed as if...and as if they felt it. </sentence><sentence id="943">I don't remember anybody cried, ever. </sentence><sentence id="944">As...there was such a terrible atmosphere, such fear of not knowing what is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="945">Nobody knew they were going to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="946">You, you, you knew...you didn't know whether they stayed with the parents, maybe in a work camp, maybe...there were work camps, even in Holland you didn't know about. </sentence><sentence id="947">Uh, there were work camps...they called "work camps" later, when you heard the word "concentration camps." </sentence><sentence id="948">We didn't know, and that is the tragedy of it all because the people didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="949">Maybe...maybe the Dutch population would have done more if they would have known, but they were scared. </sentence><sentence id="950">They were not helpful. </sentence><sentence id="951">They, uh...there were some...I would say maybe five percent...I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="952">According to my knowledge, what I saw in my neighborhood, in my...of the people that were saved through others, maybe...maybe a very, very small percentage of the people did something. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="998">That's what I just explained. </sentence><sentence id="999">How could you know? </sentence><sentence id="1000">How? </sentence><sentence id="1001">How could you know? </sentence><sentence id="1002">They went to...with their parents to to work camps. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Now a work camp, that was something not pleasant but you had to work there, maybe in a factory, maybe make I don't know what; but the children went with the parents. </sentence><sentence id="1004">Now we were told, the three of us were told an org..., underground organizations were set up. </sentence><sentence id="1005">An underground organization, people--individual people--they they would contact people...not that I knew it at the time but they would contact people in, say, Friesland, Limburg, in the country; and they would ask, ask people, "Would you have room for a little Jewish girl or a little Jewish boy?" </sentence><sentence id="1006">This one would be able to have one if it would have blue eyes and blond hair. </sentence><sentence id="1007">The other one needed a four-year-old with  USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 15 dark hair and blond eyes...uh, uh, blond hair and dark eyes, so it would fit in the family. </sentence><sentence id="1008">Those messages came through, through the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Even so, it sounds incredible. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Finally through Stiskind who was, of course, completely underground-minded with all he did with the Joodse Raad. </sentence><sentence id="1011">He got the message back to the Directrice; so when we had children that fitted that image, that child would be kept away. </sentence><sentence id="1012">That child...but you couldn't keep a child away from the parents without the parents giving consent to give it away, so the three of us, we were sent to the Schouwburg with the message to the parents as follows. </sentence><sentence id="1013">In your own words: "Look, we don't know what is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1014">We don't know where you are going to be, under what circumstances you will have to live with your children. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Would you mind if we tried to find a family, a foster family, for your child, which will keep it until you come back?" </sentence><sentence id="1016">You can imagine the questions would follow. </sentence><sentence id="1017">The mother: "For how long?"

" </sentence><sentence id="1024">Yah, to somebody who will take care of your child." </sentence><sentence id="1025">So you speak in, in, in kind of a veil...in kind of... How would you call it? </sentence><sentence id="1026">Uh, in, in a language that people don't understand, the people cannot trust it. </sentence><sentence id="1027">They trust me probably, so few gave up their children. </sentence><sentence id="1028">Too few, because of...you want to keep your child with you. </sentence><sentence id="1029">If I would have the choice today, I would say, "I keep it. </sentence><sentence id="1030">I keep my child with me;" because those we are talking about...children from from year old to five years old, six years old. </sentence><sentence id="1031">So the few people that gave up their children...there were not so many I would say. </sentence><sentence id="1032">Those children we kept in the Creche when the other children went on transport, but we came to the door...Family A has four children. </sentence><sentence id="1033">The Family B has three children. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Everybody was accounted...had to be accounted for, so now came the family who had given up a child to go in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1035">We didn't use the word underground with those people because that word didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Hiding didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="1037">No, they would be foster children to someone. </sentence><sentence id="1038">So at night when we came to be counted for, what we did...we took instead of the children, of instead of that particular child that they had consented to go in hiding, we we had a little blanket, blanket with a little piece of rag in there or a doll or whatever looked like a, a child. </sentence><sentence id="1039">If the child would be bigger, a little bit bigger, we would really have something big there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1040">It was scary. </sentence><sentence id="1041">It was really scary. </sentence><sentence id="1042">But you didn't think. </sentence><sentence id="1043">It was just in the way of work. </sentence><sentence id="1044">You did it uh and you hoped only that the parents wouldn't allow anybody to look at the child. </sentence><sentence id="1045">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1046">Oh, God forbid! </sentence><sentence id="1047">I still, I still get the creeps when I think of it; that the German would say, "Let me see the child." </sentence><sentence id="1048">Which never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1049">LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1167">Q: That translates to... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1169">A: That translates to a whole room where children are asleep, a dormitory, and suddenly twenty Germans come in with their boots stamping and screaming and shouting; and there am I, and I call out, "Get out of here! </sentence><sentence id="1170">How dare you to come in here! </sentence><sentence id="1171">How dare you to disturb children that are asleep! </sentence><sentence id="1172">I don't want to see you. </sentence><sentence id="1173">Get out!" </sentence><sentence id="1174">And with that they left. </sentence><sentence id="1175">Unbelievable as it sounds. </sentence><sentence id="1176">Incredible, but it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And from that time on, to the Germans I was "Das freche Weib." </sentence><sentence id="1178">They called me... they called me that. </sentence><sentence id="1179">One day I was called to the...because  USHMM Achives RG-50.030*0054 17 once in a while you gave up your...you gave up your bed because one of the other girls had family in the Schouwburg, and they wanted to see them for the last time. </sentence><sentence id="1180">For the time being they didn't know, but for the last time, their family or their friends, so we exchanged the beds and she went, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So one day I was called and I was said, "You go on transport," and I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="1182">And L...and they said, "Because you have a nerve giving your bed to somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1183">You are supposed to come here and you gave it.... You go on transport." </sentence><sentence id="1184">So I said, "So send me. </sentence><sentence id="1185">Big deal. </sentence><sentence id="1186">My parents are there. </sentence><sentence id="1187">You took my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I go to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Take me. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I go." </sentence><sentence id="1191">Whereupon he gave me back my bed and told me to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1192">I don't want to use the word, but to get out fast, go back to the Creche. </sentence><sentence id="1193">So that's my story about "Das freche Weib"; and when I was at the Poldeweg we didn't, between three thousand people, and they called off my name, then Virrie Cohen went because after all she was the daughter of Professor Cohen, and then they needed me. </sentence><sentence id="1194">They put me in a in a truck with all Germans around me. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I think I was stiff with fear. </sentence><sentence id="1196">I, I think I couldn't move a finger. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And they drove off, changed trucks, put me in another truck, and dropped me in front of the Creche in the middle of the night, not a single person in the street, anybody, nobody; and I came back to the Creche, and Mr. Siiskind and all the others were standing, not outside the Schouwburg but in the Schouwburg within the glass, without...within the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1198">When they saw me, they couldn't believe their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And the Germans gave them order, "From now on she is in charge here in the Creche." </sentence><sentence id="1200">But then I was nineteen, and the daughter of Professor Cohen came back the next day and she was something like twenty-five, twenty-six and she was a registered nurse; so it was the logical thing that she would be in charge and she became in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1201">So we stayed in the Creche then "til the end. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I think it was the 29th of September... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1294">A: Uh, you ask me a question which is very difficult to answer. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I know I have seen in in in different articles the amount of thousand children. </sentence><sentence id="1296">The number of thousand children, to me, seems almost not possible. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I have always thought from the start when we talked about it while we were in hiding, that the number of children saved from the Creche, actually from the Creche, would have been around three hundred, because it was so difficult; but then I don't know what else played without my knowing. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Uh, to me it always seemed a reasonable number, three hundred. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I've talked about it with some other people too, who thought so....But, yah...1, I don't dare to say thousand is impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1300">A thousand maybe would be possible if you calculate the children that were picked up in the streets and were not taken to the Creche, but were were taken immediately to to Westerbork or wherever; but a thousand children...it seems an awful lot to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
