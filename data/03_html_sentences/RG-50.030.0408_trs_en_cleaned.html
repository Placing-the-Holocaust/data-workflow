<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Tell me, what was your full name at birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Well, actually, it was Jean, J-e-a-n. Jean Ernest Dolibois, pronounced Dolibois in Luxembourg because it is a -- a French name. </sentence><sentence id="8">My father is Parisian -- Parisian ancestry, so in -- in Europe it's Dolibois. </sentence><sentence id="9">But Dolibois like Illinois in the United States, it makes it a lot easier, so that's just a -- but a -- when I became naturalized, I paid a dollar extra for the naturalization fee, to change the Jean, J-e-a-n, which would be pronounced Jean, to John, J-o-h-n. So at least my first name is still a -- Americanized. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And tell me what year you were born and where in Luxembourg you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: I was born in Luxembourg City, actually a s-s -- the suburb Bonava, of Luxembourg City, on the avenue -- on the Rue de Chicago, predestination apparently. </sentence><sentence id="16">And the -- I was born on December fourth, 1918. </sentence><sentence id="17">My -- was immediately after -- shortly after the signing of the armistice and I was born the youngest of eight children. </sentence><sentence id="18">Unfortunately my mother died 10 days later. </sentence><sentence id="19">So my oldest sister Marie had to step in and -- and play the role of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="20">And she actually raised me. </sentence><sentence id="21">In fact, up until the day she died, I called her mom, you know, she was -- al-although she was my sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: That's interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: But she actually is involved in my coming to the United States as an immigrant. </sentence><sentence id="32">I don't know if you want to hear that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: Yeah, I do, I do, yes, I kn --    </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: -- romantic story, because it is that. </sentence><sentence id="35">Well after World War I, we did have American occupation troops in Luxembourg because the United States -- the Americans had liberated Luxembourg from four years of occupation by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="36">So there were American troops stationed in Luxembourg and some Americans were billeted in our home. </sentence><sentence id="37">And as things would happen, my sister was 19 years old, fell in love with one of the Americans, and they planned to get married, if -- when he got out of the service. </sentence><sentence id="38">But then I was born, my mother died, and my sister had to take care of the rest of the family and play the role of mother. </sentence><sentence id="39">So the American came back empty handed, but they corresponded with each other for 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="40">He came back in 1929 and married her and brought her to the United States, to Akron. </sentence><sentence id="41">Meanwhile my brothers and si -- brothers and sisters had all grown up and married, and my father and I were all alone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="42">So my father, who had pretty good political sense, and could look across the Mosselle river and see what was happening in Germany, and he didn't see much of a future for -- for me, at least, in Luxembourg, and he thought history could repeat itself, so he decided we ought to get out, come to the United States and take advantage of the land of opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="43">And so my father and I came to the States in 1931 -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: Let me ask you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: -- and joined my sister now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="48">It's quite a story about your sister -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: -- I must say, 10 years of correspondence that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: -- I'm sure is a rare -- rare story. </sentence><sentence id="54">I -- 1 -- I understand from your autobiography that your -- your dad and you were quite different and your interest in education did not match his interest, is that true? </sentence><sentence id="55">Was that difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yeah, my -- my father, who was a -- a very loving father and I respected him greatly, and -- and love him dearly, but he was not what we think of as a dad in the United States, there. </sentence><sentence id="60">There was no such thing as going to a ballgame or even going on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="61">I don't remember my father ever taking me on a vacation trip or anything. </sentence><sentence id="62">He worked -- he worked hard, he was in the construction business. </sentence><sentence id="63">But we had eight children, I was the -- the youngest of the eight and my father had been quite successful in business. </sentence><sentence id="64">All of my brothers, with one exception, all worked for my father. </sentence><sentence id="65">They all went into the building trade, plastering and bricklaying and carpentry, and each one of them had a specialty and they worked in my father's company. </sentence><sentence id="66">And naturally that's what was in store for me. </sentence><sentence id="67">Well, for some reason or other I had different ideas, I'm -- I had ambitions. </sentence><sentence id="68">So when we came to the United States my father resisted my interest in having an education, and he -- he liked to point out that he never went to college, and he never even went to high school, and he was a success in life, why did I want to waste my time? </sentence><sentence id="69">And he had peculiar ideas, and -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="70">Don't read so much, you" ll ge -- you" lI ruin your eyes. </sentence><sentence id="71">And he didn't even want me to have a bicycle because he said it was a useless article, y-you pump your legs off to give your rear end a ride, you know. </sentence><sentence id="72">But he had very narrow views about that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="73">But strangely enough, when I insisted and followed my own path, he was the first one to step up front and point with pride. </sentence><sentence id="74">And he did really enjoy whatever success I had in school. </sentence><sentence id="75">He -- he took upon himself to let everybody know that -- when I became a valedictorian in high school, he -- he patted himself on the back, too, it's -- it's a --    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Do you think he was frightened in some way of the difference that -- how you were different from -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Of -- that's absolute -- that's absolutely right, he -- he -- he never adapted. </sentence><sentence id="95">And he made the sacrifice, coming to the United States, for my sake. </sentence><sentence id="96">And I've always given him credit for that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="100">But he never assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="101">He never wanted to be part of the -- he -- he didn't even bother to learn the language. </sentence><sentence id="102">He wanted to just remain what -- what he was. </sentence><sentence id="103">And proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="104">But -- and so I didn't fit that pattern, right, I created a pattern of my own. </sentence><sentence id="105">And naturally, with his old fashioned, basically European viewpoint, he just didn't -- didn't see that. </sentence><sentence id="106">He couldn't agree with that. </sentence><sentence id="107">I mean, we didn't have any arguments about it, but he would just pooh pooh the idea, na -- da -- you don't need to do that, I never did it, look at me. </sentence><sentence id="108">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: And did your sister support your -- your doing what -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Oh yeah, she -- as much as poss -- but I had to be pretty much on my own, because I -- I was - - made perfectly clear that I wasn't going to sponge off of my sister and her family. </sentence><sentence id="111">She had her - - her own child, she had one daughter, Madeline. </sentence><sentence id="112">And -- so it was still possible to do it in the United States -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: -- the land of opportunity, and for me it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Did your dad work when he came over here, or did he stop working? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Well, he wa -- he was really -- he stopped working as far as following his trade was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="119">But he did work around the neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="120">He would, you know, repair things for -- for people and do some small building jobs and that sort of thing, and -- but we sold our family homestead -- our family home, and my father could pretty much live on that. </sentence><sentence id="121">He -- he was up in years, he was a -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: -- see, well it's the 50 -- he was born in 1972 -- a -- 1872 rather. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: 1872. </sentence><sentence id="131">Right, so he wasn't such a young -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: So, he was retired. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: And so. </sentence><sentence id="136">But he did manage to keep busy around the neighborhood and -- in Akron and earn some pocket money and so forth, but there was never a -- never any want, I mean -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: So he never learned English? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: He -- oh, he never [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: He never learned English? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: No, no, it -- he could -- he'd read the paper, at least he pretended to read, and he kept pretty much informed of what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="145">But there was a German church in -- in Akron that he went to. </sentence><sentence id="146">At least one sermon was preached in German in Saint Bernard church, I recall. </sentence><sentence id="147">So he kept up his contacts that way, and he subscribed to a -- a Luxembourg paper and a German paper. </sentence><sentence id="148">He could read German. </sentence><sentence id="149">Although he was born in f -- in France, his French was not very good. </sentence><sentence id="150">He was primarily Germanic because his family had moved from Paris to the Saar Basin, at the time that Saar was still a part of France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Of course, the Saar went back and forth and one time German, then it was independent, and then it was again part of France. </sentence><sentence id="161">So in the Saar almost everybody spoke French and German, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: But my father primarily spoke the Saar dialect, which is very close to the Luxembourg patois. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: Did you like -- did you like the idea of coming to the United States? </sentence><sentence id="169">Were you happy about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Well, I think -- you know, I wa -- I was -- the only movies I saw at Luxembourg were American movies and they were cowboy movies, Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson. </sentence><sentence id="173">And the idea of cowboys and Indians appealed to me. </sentence><sentence id="174">There's an author that every boy in -- in Luxembourg, and for that matter, I think in western Europe reads as a boy and those are a series of novels about the American Indians and cowboys, written by Karl May. </sentence><sentence id="175">And everybody has read Karl May, as I did. </sentence><sentence id="176">And so I fantasized, I had ideas of what life was like in United States. </sentence><sentence id="177">That part appealed to me very much, but I was 12 years old, going on 13, and the idea of also leaving all my friends, and the culture that I was used to in Luxembourg, that created some problems, so I had a conflict. </sentence><sentence id="178">I was excited in one way, and another way a -- I could hardly wait to have it happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Yet, I -- I was afraid of it. </sentence><sentence id="189">So the -- I didn't want to leave, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Wh-When you came here in "31, it's two years prior to the Nazis taking over in Germany. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="191">When they take over in Germany, does that impact you at all? </sentence><sentence id="192">I mean, you're still European in some way, so the consciousness of what's going on in Europe -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Oh, I think I was too young to be aware of -- of really what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="194">I don't think that I became particularly interested in what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="195">Wa -- once we got to the States, I did, I think, what I now think every immigrant should do. </sentence><sentence id="196">First of all concentrate on learning the language, and I -- I couldn't speak a word of English, so I had work pretty hard, because I went to school, public school, and they immediately sent me back two years. </sentence><sentence id="197">I should have been in the eighth grade, and I ended up in the sixth grade, but before that I -- they put me in kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="198">And here I am 13 years old, and I'm in kindergarten, the biggest boy in class, but that was the only advantage. </sentence><sentence id="199">But I had to learn English from the bottom up, and I spent th-three months in kindergarten and then a couple of more months in the third grade. </sentence><sentence id="200">And then moved me up to, finally, the sixth grade, and I went on from there. </sentence><sentence id="201">But I think I concentrated on becoming a Boy Scout, and becoming Americanized, and I -- I loved the Boy Scout experience. </sentence><sentence id="202">That contributed a great deal to my Americanization. </sentence><sentence id="203">And learning the language was -- was a challenge. </sentence><sentence id="204">And as I say, assimilating, which I -- I think is essential to become a part of the American scene, you know, you should. </sentence><sentence id="205">So I didn't -- I really sort of forgot all about Luxembourg and -- to the point where even corresponding with my friends became secondary and I didn't do much of it any more. </sentence><sentence id="206">That all came back later, see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="222">But all of your brothers and sisters, except for Marie, are -- are in Luxembourg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: One more brother had come to Chicago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: [had a brother in Chicago, my brother Ted. </sentence><sentence id="230">And my sister Marie in Akron. </sentence><sentence id="231">All the others were -- were back in Luxembourg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: So was there some concern then, when the war started in "39 -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Very much so, and of course, after the war started, there was no communication, and no mail, we couldn't get any. </sentence><sentence id="237">After the -- the Germans occupied Luxembourg, mail service to the United States was just unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="238">The only way -- I think once or twice we did get some communication from one of my brothers, because somebody who was going to another country, mailed a letter for him, I -- I do recall my -- my father getting a letter once from my brother Heinrich that way. </sentence><sentence id="239">But there was no communication. </sentence><sentence id="240">N-No such thing as transatlantic telephone    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="246"> calls, and -- and the mail service was nonexistent. </sentence><sentence id="247">But there th -- there's definitely a -- a cessation of communication. </sentence><sentence id="248">There was just no -- no way of being in touch, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: So when did you gra -- you graduated high school when, in "38, deg39? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: 738? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="255">Akron -- Akron North High School. </sentence><sentence id="256">That -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: So then the question is w-well now what? </sentence><sentence id="258">Because now you have to pave the way for the next step [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Well, I had -- as I say, I had pretty much made up my mind, and -- and -- and this is a -- again, the -- the a -- the hero worship that we're all guilty of in our youth, and I had picked my hero. </sentence><sentence id="260">He was a scout executive, a camp director. </sentence><sentence id="261">My favorite place in the United States as a boy was the scout camp, Camp Manatoc in Akron, Ohio, that I attended regularly. </sentence><sentence id="262">In fact, I remember my junior year in high school, I spent more nights at camp than I did in my own bed at home. </sentence><sentence id="263">But I loved Camp Manatoc, an -- an -- an ideal boy scout camp, and the man who was camp director of it, was just the -- he was my idol. </sentence><sentence id="264">He was the kind of man I wanted to be in every way. </sentence><sentence id="265">Tall, and handsome and -- and a beautiful singing voice, a speaking voice. </sentence><sentence id="266">A lot of personality and that is what I wanted to be like. </sentence><sentence id="267">And I decided I would be a professional scout executive so I could be like Mr. Josselle and follow in that -- that pattern. </sentence><sentence id="268">So naturally that meant an education and going to college, and my ambition was to get a college degree and go into professional scouting. </sentence><sentence id="269">And I had the audacity at that time to write to the chief scout executive, Dr. James E. West, I recall at that time, professional scout executive. </sentence><sentence id="270">And they answered my letter, and we started up a correspondence. </sentence><sentence id="271">He s -- sort of became my -- my mentor by mail, encouraging me on what to study in high school and college and preparing myself for a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="272"> professional career in scouting. </sentence><sentence id="273">So that was my idea. </sentence><sentence id="274">Well, at scout camp I met some of the younger leaders, who were students at Miami University. </sentence><sentence id="275">And there was also one who was a -- a graduate of Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania. </sentence><sentence id="276">And both of these interests, they started recruiting me for their particular institution. </sentence><sentence id="277">And I did get a scholarship at Washington and Jefferson. </sentence><sentence id="278">And it was worth a lot more financially than another scholarship I had at Miami University, so I decided to go to Washington and Jefferson. </sentence><sentence id="279">And I would graduate and then go to the Schiff scout reservation and become a professional scout executive. </sentence><sentence id="280">That was my ambition. </sentence><sentence id="281">Then I fell in love and -- during the summer of 1938, I met the young lady whom I subsequently married. </sentence><sentence id="282">And we decided during our summer romance that we would go to college together. </sentence><sentence id="283">And that meant going to a co-educational school. </sentence><sentence id="284">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: You switched. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: Washington and Jefferson was a male school, all male. </sentence><sentence id="287">So I ended up taking the scholarship from Miami University because then we can go together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: That wasn't the only reason. </sentence><sentence id="293">Miami also had a good reputation, was a good school and there were a lot of alumni who influenced me at scout camp. </sentence><sentence id="294">So we made a very happy choice. </sentence><sentence id="295">And we both enrolled at Miami University and went all through college together, four years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: And what were you studying there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Oh, I majored in psychology, again at Dr. West's suggestion. </sentence><sentence id="303">As a scout executive he thought psychology ought to be my major because it's working with people, understanding people, and working with scouts and the whole leadership concept, so I majored in psychology for that particular reason, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Which became very fortuitous for you later on when [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Yeah, came -- s-served me -- it served me very well -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: -- later on too, see, Particular at -- it tied in as part of my pattern of circles into what eventually did happen during the war and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: -- my career in the military and afterwards, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Now, by the time you're at the university, you're a young man, you're in love and having a rela -- a relationship. </sentence><sentence id="311">Are you now much more conscious of the war in -- in an everyday way? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Oh yes, th-the -- the minute wore broke out we became very conscious of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: And of course we were in school, we were in -- you know, in an education institution and I was taking a lot of courses that involved current events and development in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="317">And then because of my European connection, I really went into that as a -- I became an avid follower of the news, of what was happening in -- in -- in Luxembourg particularly after the Germans invaded Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="318">You know, after all, they were invading my homeland. </sentence><sentence id="319">Now I became very much concermed and followed it very closely. </sentence><sentence id="320">And I think what -- what added to the -- the stimulus there was not being able to communicate with anybody in Luxembourg, and that sort of added an extra challenge, or pizzazz to the whole relationship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: But I was very conscious of what was going on in Europe by then, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: Were there courses on the rise of Nazism, on th-the kind of society, or -- or was it too soon for that sort of thing? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: Much too soon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Much too soon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Actually, a -- an-and this is something that -- that really struck me during the war and after the war and now, in retrospect, how very little we knew about what was going on in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="335">We really -- from the in -- the military intelligence standpoint and the political intelligence standpoint, we had no idea what Nazism was all about, I mean the headlines, nothing in depth. </sentence><sentence id="336">And much of what we did learn, scratchy as it was -- sketchy as it was, was written off as propaganda. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: You know, it's the sort of thing we -- we said about the Germans in World War I. And you know, there were the America [indecipherable] who were very active in the early stage, 1939 - 1940, before Pearl Harbor and before we got involved. </sentence><sentence id="343">And there was this feeling of this is not our war, this is none of our business, and -- so what little we did know that could be introduced in a history class or political science class was either propaganda or as I say, was on the surface, nothing really in depth. </sentence><sentence id="344">And it wasn't, until we got involved in the war, and began to make personal contact with prisoners of war, and with German government officials, that we began to become aware of what Nazism is all about. </sentence><sentence id="345">And this is what made my own assignment such a big challenge. </sentence><sentence id="346">We were pioneering in military intelligence work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: So tell me, when -- le-let me just go back a little bit, although I'm trying to figure out how old you were. </sentence><sentence id="353">In 1938, when Kristallnacht happens in Germany and there's all these riots and 30,000 pe -- Jews are put into -- arrested, do you hear about this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: You don't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: What -- what we did here, as I say, was -- was very sketchy. </sentence><sentence id="361">Remember now, we were no longer allowing refugees to come to United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: Which -- you know, Miami University, like many other institutions, Miami University is a state institution and very strict regulations. </sentence><sentence id="421">I remember when we started going to college, my freshman year boys and girls didn't even sit together at a football game. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="426">A: I mean, we had a woman's section and a men's section. </sentence><sentence id="427">And that changed during the course of my freshman year. </sentence><sentence id="428">But there was a lot of strict regulation. </sentence><sentence id="429">Girls had to be in at 11 o'clock at night on Fridays, 10 o'clock during the week. </sentence><sentence id="430">No telephone calls after 10 o'clock, or before three o'clock in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="431">It was very rigid. </sentence><sentence id="432">The idea of two students being married to each other and going to school at Miami University was -- that just didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="433">Well, then came Pearl    Harbor, in December "40 -- 1941, and I -- I felt -- I -- I really felt that I wanted -- not only would get involved, but wanted to get involved. </sentence><sentence id="434">And so I signed up for the navy, a special [indecipherable] program. </sentence><sentence id="435">I was going to go in the navy and get -- when I graduated, and through [indecipherable] program I could go to a special training school and graduate as an ensign in the navy and that would be the natural thing for me to do. </sentence><sentence id="436">So we knew that was going to happen, and if that's the case, then we wanted to get married before I left. </sentence><sentence id="437">So the university had, meanwhile, changed the rules after Pearl Harbor and many of the students who wanted to get married, could. </sentence><sentence id="438">Now we were the first to sign up. </sentence><sentence id="439">So in January 17", 1942, a month after Pearl Harbor, a little over, we got married on the weekend in Oxford. </sentence><sentence id="440">I remember our classes were dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="441">Our professors came to our wedding. </sentence><sentence id="442">We still have a -- a film of a -- of our wedding that my father- in-law took, and -- of all my professors coming to our wedding, including the president of the university and his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Upham. </sentence><sentence id="443">And they gave us special permission to get married. </sentence><sentence id="444">And we started it and then of course there were others who did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="445">Well, as it turned out, I didn't get that navy program because I hadn't been a naturalized citizen long enough. </sentence><sentence id="446">You -- you -- and I don't know if the navy still has that rule, but you could not become an officer in the navy, air force or marines, unless you'd been a American citizen 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="447">You could be an officer in the army, but not in the other branches. </sentence><sentence id="448">So I had gone through all the procedures of joining this [indecipherable] program when they decided I hadn't been a citizen long enough and didn't qualify. </sentence><sentence id="449">So I just continued my course. </sentence><sentence id="450">Then the draft board got me. </sentence><sentence id="451">Naturally, and we expected that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: And they put me in one B. That was a -- one A were drafted immediately, one B you were postponed because you were in school, or -- and I had a slight vision problem in my left eye, which I didn't even know about. </sentence><sentence id="482">So they classified me one B, which meant we could get married -- we could graduate. </sentence><sentence id="483">We were married, we could graduate. </sentence><sentence id="484">So we actually graduated in June of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="485">And meanwhile I got a job with Proctor and Gamble in Cincinnati, and we set up housekeeping in Cincinnati. </sentence><sentence id="486">And then in November of "42, one B number came up and my postponement -- postponement had ended. </sentence><sentence id="487">So on November 13", 1942, I got the word, you know, you're now in the army. </sentence><sentence id="488">So that changed everything, so we were ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="489">We anticipated it all along, just a matter of time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="490">And believe it or not, you know, I was drafted, but I really was eager to go. </sentence><sentence id="491">I felt I'd benefited so much and -- and I don't have a false sense of patriotism, it's very genuine. </sentence><sentence id="492">I really thought I wanted to serve and at the same time there was a relationship with -- I wanted to help liberate Luxembourg, so there's a little bit of that entered into it as well, so it was a -- a mutual, satisfying agreement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="506">Q: So do you go first to basic training? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="508">A: Oh yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="510">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: Basic training. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="514">Q: How basic was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="516">A: Well, th-that, of course, is a -- you know, every once in awhile I ma -- I'm making a speech and -- and I have a lot of fun explaining how I actually ended up where I eventually did. </sentence><sentence id="517">But I know when I was inducted at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and a -- a -- a young personnel officer, I think was a corporal or a PFC asked me what I could do, and I told him I could speak German fluently and I'd like to get into -- into military intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="518">And his answer, "Well did you ever drive a truck?" </sentence><sentence id="519">I said, "No, but I can speak German fluently." </sentence><sentence id="520">I wasn't going to give up so easily. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="521">But he wanted to know if I could drive a bus or a tractor, or -- or plow with something heavy, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="522"> with air brakes, and -- and no | didn't qualify for any of that. </sentence><sentence id="523">But by that time my minute and a half was over, and I ended up being sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky to be a tank driver. </sentence><sentence id="524">That's what they needed that particular day. </sentence><sentence id="525">So I started my career in the army being trained to be a tank driver. </sentence><sentence id="526">I was in the armored force, armored force replacement training center at Fort Knox. </sentence><sentence id="527">So I learn how to drive a heavy vehicle in the armored force, even a motorcycle, which I hated. </sentence><sentence id="528">But the big trucks and armored cars and tanks; fired every weapon from a revolver on up to the big Howitzers and, you know, it's kind of exciting, right? </sentence><sentence id="529">I -- I -- I kind of liked it. </sentence><sentence id="530">So, after I finished my basic training, I did have a college degree, the army decided I was officer material. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="531">So I became one of those 90 day wonders. </sentence><sentence id="532">I went to officer's candidate school and after 90 days at Fort Knox, I got a commission as a second lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="533">And incidentally got my commission from General George S. Patton, Jr. General Patton was the commencement speaker when I -- I graduated. </sentence><sentence id="534">And my commission was in mechanized cavalry, and since Patton was a cavalry general, he pinned a cavalry insignia on the -- the members of my class who were taken into the mechanized cavalry, there were 10 of us -- 10 of us. </sentence><sentence id="535">So I thought that was a -- a good beginning of my career. </sentence><sentence id="536">Course Patton wasn't as famous then as -- as he subsequently became, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="537">Q: Can you explain what mechanized cavalry is? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="538">A: Well, you know, the horse cavalry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="540">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="542">A: Well, during World War II, we're -- we're now -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="543">Q: [indecipherable] horses. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: -- mechanized cavalry, and the mechanized cavalry is light -- light tanks and fast moving vehicles, Jeeps, light tanks and light armored cars, half tracks, actually. </sentence><sentence id="545">And the mechanized cavalry is used for reconnaissance. </sentence><sentence id="546">They're in the forefront, they're reconnoitering th-the terrain and enemy strength. </sentence><sentence id="547">So reconnaissance is the -- the spearhead of an armored division, and armored division, of course, are your heavy guns and your heavy tanks, and you have your c- cavalry reconnaissance for the lead, to explore the territory ahead, so -- and that was the purpose of the mechanized cavalry. </sentence><sentence id="548">I was assigned to the 23" cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 16" armored division, Camp Chaffee, Arkansas. </sentence><sentence id="549">So after I got my commission, that was my first military assignment, in Arkansas, 16" armored division, so -- then, months later, the army found out I could speak German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: It finally got to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="559">A: And that ties into what -- what I said earlier. </sentence><sentence id="560">We were ready to invade North Africa and we were going to begin to make our first eyeball to eyeball contact with the enemy and it suddenly occurred to somebody here in Washington that gee, you know, what are we going to talk to them about? </sentence><sentence id="561">And who's going to do the talking? </sentence><sentence id="562">We hadn't thought of setting up ike -- IPW teams, or counterintelligence teams, or -- we hadn't even thought of military government, in case we won the war. </sentence><sentence id="563">So all of a sudden the lights went on and they decided we got to round up all the people who can speak German. </sentence><sentence id="564">So regardless of where you belonged, or regardless of what your background was, if you spoke German, you -- you got yanked into military intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="565">And just a -- acry went out, order went out, cooks, bakers, quartermasters, even some medical personnel, all put in the military intelligence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="573">Q: Hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="575">A: And we were sent to Camp Richie, Camp Richie, Maryland, which is the Maryland National Guard camp, about 90 miles north of Washington. </sentence><sentence id="576">And that became the secret training center for military intelligence personnel. </sentence><sentence id="577">And that's where I ended up on very short notice, from Arkansas    to Camp Richie, Maryland. </sentence><sentence id="578">So I was transferred from the armored force to military intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="579">And my specialty then wa-was interrogating prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="580">That's what I was trained to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="588">Q: How many of you were sent there [indecipherable] Richie, Maryland, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="590">A: Oho, that is a -- you know, i-if I were younger and had the ambition, I'd write another book and I -- I would just write about Camp Richie, because that was the most fascinating place. </sentence><sentence id="591">You could -- there was a poem that a very intelligent military intelligence officer wrote, and it starts out, was you ever at Camp Richie, the [indecipherable] of all, where the sun comes up like [indecipherable] recorded bugle call. </sentence><sentence id="592">And that's the way the poem starts out. </sentence><sentence id="593">You could hear every language under the sun spoken at Camp Richie, Maryland. </sentence><sentence id="594">And they brought in people -- not just German speaking, French, Italian, Arabic, everything. </sentence><sentence id="595">You -- you -- we had a conglomeration of people. </sentence><sentence id="596">And quite a few, including quite a few Jewish refugees who had come to the United States earlier, who had been taken into the army, they were all sent to Camp Richie because they were the only ones who could speak fluent German still. </sentence><sentence id="597">And they were the ideal military government and military intelligence personnel. </sentence><sentence id="598">Their -- their f -- their German was fluent. </sentence><sentence id="599">There were very few a -- a that type of German speaking military personnel available. </sentence><sentence id="600">So most of the others were people who had studied German in school, or majored in German in college, or had German parents who spoke German at home. </sentence><sentence id="601">But the real fluent German speaker -- and a lot of our intelligent officers were -- were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="602">My colleagues at -- that I lived with were all refugee families who had come to these United States early, in the 30's, with their families. </sentence><sentence id="603">So all these people were thrown together and they had different sections, there were eight sections all together, and I was in section five, that was the IPW section. </sentence><sentence id="604">But there were the CIC, the counter-intelligence, there was the photo interpretation, the photo intelligence, people who studied aerial photos and -- and could make sense out of -- out of that particular effort. </sentence><sentence id="605">And </sentence></p><p><sentence id="606"> th-there were the OSS people, and ha-hand to hand combat people who worked behind the lines, the forerunner of the CIA. </sentence><sentence id="607">We -- we trained them in everything, and we had regular German prisoners of war, the very first who had been taken in North Africa were brought to Camp Richie. </sentence><sentence id="608">And the -- we -- you know, we had a chance to practice first hand -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="609">Q: I was going to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: -- with real German prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="611">So it was a -- a very exciting place. </sentence><sentence id="612">What we taught then was German army organization, which we knew nothing about. </sentence><sentence id="613">National Socialism, which we knew very little about. </sentence><sentence id="614">All the paramilitary organizations under the Hitler regime, we didn't know what the NSKK was, or the NSFK, the National Socialist Flying Corps, National Socialist Motor Corps. </sentence><sentence id="615">This was the paramilitary that the Hitler regime had organized. </sentence><sentence id="616">These people were getting subtle military training by belonging to the truck driver's corps, or the flying corps, but they were being prepared for military. </sentence><sentence id="617">So there were a lot of those. </sentence><sentence id="618">Germany was limited to a hundred thousand man army, but bor -- by the time Hitler was ready to invade Poland, he had more than a hundred thousand men, I mean, well trained from the Hitler youth on up. </sentence><sentence id="619">We didn't know that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="620">We had to learn about all these things. </sentence><sentence id="621">We learned about the characteristics and the personalities of the high ranking Nazis; we knew nothing about them. </sentence><sentence id="622">If you've heard of the film, "Triumph des Willens", that was our -- our text -- o-our textbook, I should say. </sentence><sentence id="623">Every Thursday I recall, all the classes -- the German classes were brought together in a theater at -- at Camp Richie, and we showed Leni Riefenstahl's, "Triumph des Willens," a three hour documentary of a Nuremberg rally. </sentence><sentence id="624">And that was the only documentary film, and the only photographic evidence we had of the Nazi leaders, like Hess, and Goering, and Stryker, and Lie, and seeing them perform in this, "Triumph des Willens," in this film, was the only way that our -- our trainees could learn anything about what these Nazis even looked like. </sentence><sentence id="625">That was the beginning of it, and that's all we </sentence></p><p><sentence id="626"> had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="627">So our training was somewhat primitive. </sentence><sentence id="628">We had limited intelligence, really, because we hadn't done much over there in the way of gathering information, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="629">Q: So who were -- who were the teachers? </sentence><sentence id="630">Were they historians, or were they mil -- another set of military intelligence people? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="631">A: They were -- they were people like me. </sentence><sentence id="632">For instance, the course lasted two months, and during that time you learned or-order battle and German army, all the things that I mentioned. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="633">Then you were sent overseas as a member of an IPW team, which consisted of two officers and three or four enlisted men, all trained at Richie. </sentence><sentence id="634">And you would go overseas and be assigned to a division, or -- or a regiment, or even an army group, or an army, as interrogator and when those units advanced and took prisoners, the IPW team interrogated them. </sentence><sentence id="635">So Camp Richie was feeding all these interrogators and other intel-telligence personnel to the different divisions as fast as we could produce them. </sentence><sentence id="636">Well, every once in awhile there'd be a graduate like me, who also had pretty good training -- [phone ringing] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="637">Q: Excuse me [indecipherable] stop? </sentence><sentence id="638">Are we okay? </sentence><sentence id="639">I'm sorry, I didn't unplug the phone. </sentence><sentence id="640">They should know when to call back here. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: Changing film? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="647">Q: Can you find the plug? </sentence><sentence id="648">That's -- you're having trouble [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="649">All right, we're back from our little interruptions. </sentence><sentence id="650">You were talking about -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: Yeah, well, there were people like me -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="652">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="654">A: -- with -- with a -- a college education, and particularly a psychology major, which was exactly the sort of thing they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="655">To interrogate prisoners of war you kind of have to have a little bit of a psychological background -- the -- from the technique of it. </sentence><sentence id="656">And then the German language. </sentence><sentence id="657">But th-the military training I had gave me an advantage over those who came from the quartermaster corps, or the cooks and bakers school, and -- or some other branch of the service which was not as military as technical. </sentence><sentence id="658">So I became a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="659">And I started training others, instead of going overseas as a member of an IPW team, I became one of the -- the staff members in section five. </sentence><sentence id="660">Our commanding officer was the colonel, Colonel Warndorf, and the -- the other teachers in that section, in the German section were graduates of the Richie school who had been picked because they had specific background that made good teachers of them. </sentence><sentence id="661">So they were the ones who were teaching others. </sentence><sentence id="662">By then we were also getting not just people that we were training in interrogation, but we were also getting general officers and field grade officers from military divisions in the country and also some from units already overseas, who were brought back to get some special training in military intelligence, particularly aerial photos and interrogation and -- and order of battle, German army organization, that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="663">So our students were not only in a German section IPW members, they were also what we call the $2 and G2 officers of different divisions. </sentence><sentence id="664">So I was a second lieutenant and a lot of my students were general officers, who were the G2 of their divisions, who came for their special training course at Camp Richie. </sentence><sentence id="665">It was a very exciting, a very interesting time. </sentence><sentence id="666">And our staff sergeant at the -- in section five, for instance, was Walter Schneider. </sentence><sentence id="667">Walter Schneider was an assistant manager the Waldorf-Astoria. </sentence><sentence id="668">Our chef in the mess hall a-at Camp Richie was a chef from one of the leading -- I forget which -- hotel of -- of New York or Boston, but he was a super chef and the food was superb. </sentence><sentence id="669">It was served on metal trays, but it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="670">It was gourmet food. </sentence><sentence id="671">The food was superb because the people we brought in to Richie, we -- were special -- specialists in different fields, including cooks and bakers. </sentence><sentence id="672">So -- so we had the best. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="693">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="707">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="709">A: They -- the Holocaust and the atrocities as-associated with the Nazi regime was not part of the military. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="867">Q: And do you know your destination? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="869">A: No, that was all -- that was top secret. </sentence><sentence id="870">I had no idea what I was going to do or where I was going. </sentence><sentence id="871">We left out of Camp Kilmer, New York on a troop train -- troop -- on the troop ship. </sentence><sentence id="872">That was the -- the Ile de France, a luxury liner which had been converted into a -- a troop ship. </sentence><sentence id="873">And we went from New York then to Greenark, Scotland and from there by train all the way south to Southampton, England. </sentence><sentence id="874">And then by ferry boat, actually, ferry steamer across the channel into Le Havre and then by troop train from Le Havre, eventually to Paris after doing a lot of zigzag-ing because somebody gotten our orders messed up, we were -- ended up in the wrong place, and the ship back to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="875">Then I was in Paris about five days, in La Vaisame, which was the temporary headquarters of military intelligence in Paris at that particular point. </sentence><sentence id="876">And then I was assigned to the 6824 DIC. </sentence><sentence id="877">6824 detailed interrogation center. </sentence><sentence id="878">Now here I have to distinguish between the regular IPW team that I mentioned earlier. </sentence><sentence id="879">Their function was to get tactical information. </sentence><sentence id="880">Tactical meaning what's going on across the river, or what unit is our unit facing. </sentence><sentence id="881">When are they planning to attack, how strong are they. </sentence><sentence id="882">That's t-tactics. </sentence><sentence id="883">We were also interested now, at this late stage of the game in strategic information. </sentence><sentence id="884">Again, we want to know more about do the Germans have the atom bomb? </sentence><sentence id="885">What's this V1 and V2 business? </sentence><sentence id="886">Chemical bacterial warfare. </sentence><sentence id="887">All of those things we knew nothing about. </sentence><sentence id="888">That was strategic information, and we call that detailed interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="889">So we had a center in the Ardens in northern France, [indecipherable] way up the point where the Mers river goes into Belgium and then comes back down, we were there in a hunting lodge. </sentence><sentence id="890">And we'd taken over this little town of Revan. </sentence><sentence id="891">We were billeted in private homes and -- and used a hunting lodge for our working area. </sentence><sentence id="892">And we brought prisoners who had strategic information, like general officers, members of the German generals staff. </sentence><sentence id="893">Chemists, scientists, physicists, working on the V1, V2. </sentence><sentence id="894">Anybody who had information at a strategic, high political level, we would bring to this -- taken prisoner along the battlefields anywhere, we would bring to this detailed interrogation center for strategic information. </sentence><sentence id="895">Some of them we would find would have such valuable information that we bring them to the States. </sentence><sentence id="896">Now we had a very secret place, whose name I still don't know, right here in Washington, where we brought German prisoners of war who knew inside information on a very high ranking -- well, anyhow, my assignment was a really exciting one. </sentence><sentence id="897">I was given a Jeep and a driver, and orders by command of General Eisenhower, I could go anywhere I wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="898">And my job was to go wherever there were prisoners, which was now everywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="930">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="932">A: And screen prisoners that we thought might have this kind of strategic information. </sentence><sentence id="933">A lot of German generals put on enlisted men's uniforms and were taken prisoner as ordinary corporals and privates, but they were really general officers. </sentence><sentence id="934">So we had to find that kind of people, and those who were scientists and -- and had this kind of information we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="935">If they did, I would arrange to have them shipped back to Revan for detailed interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="936">So my job was to travel all along the front wi -- as we were advancing toward the end of the war, and talk to interrogation officers who thought they had a prisoner who -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="937">Q: Who would fit this. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="938">A: -- who -- who will fit that category, and then I would interrogate him and if he did, then I bring him back to Revan, to 6824DIC. </sentence><sentence id="939">So that was my job. </sentence><sentence id="940">So, I could go wherever I wanted, which opened up a lot of adventures, you know, like the Lipizzaner horses that I mention in my book. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: L arrived there the day after Dachau was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="953">Or, going back in my own unit, I found out where the 16" armored division that I had trained with in Arkansas, I found out where it was, so I could say, okay, let's go there. </sentence><sentence id="954">So even up to Czechoslovakia, and the 16" armored division was going into Pilsen, and so I saw some of my old colleagues again, friends that I had trained with in Arkansas, pattern of circles. </sentence><sentence id="955">I met them just outside of Pilsen, Czechoslovakia during the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="956">And that's where we had the Lipizzaner horse adventure, and that's when -- where the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="957">That's where I happened to be when it all came to an end, so -- so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="958">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="959">Well, the -- the tape is running out -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="960">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1015">Q: So you didn't know what you were seeing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1017">A: Yeah, I -- I didn't realize, I thought it was a prison camp where the prisoners were just not properly treated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1019">Q: So tell me, did you walk around, or you just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1021">Q: -- you just looked from your Jeep? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1023">A: No, frankly, I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I -- I'm -- I have a weak stomach. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I -- I really -- you know, for a long time, I -- I -- I still have difficulty -- "Schindler's List," was the first movie I ever saw in which a concentration camp was depicted that I -- that I could tolerate, because I -- I thought it was very tastefully done. </sentence><sentence id="1026">Was excellently -- and yed -- you know, he didn't dwell on -- he just showed enough to realize the horror of it without going into the detail that some of the films do. </sentence><sentence id="1027">But I -- I don't -- I don't like to read books that have a lot of graphic murder scenes in it, I -- I -- | have a weak stomach. </sentence><sentence id="1028">That probably isn't the best way to say a we -- weak stomach, I -- I just -- "m just softy, I'm a softy, I don't like to see people suffer. </sentence><sentence id="1029">I don't -- I don't li-like to see animals suffer, I certainly don't like to see people suffer. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So I'm afraid I'm like a lot of other people, you know, if you don't know what you're seeing, you'd just rather not look at it anyway, if you don't have to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1040">Q: Were you frightened? </sentence><sentence id="1041">When you wa -- when you came to that place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1044">A: No, more -- more shocked. </sentence><sentence id="1045">The -- the idea of, you know, inhumanity that was evident there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1046">And as I say, I thought this was just a prison camp, where -- where prisoners were kept. </sentence><sentence id="1047">Under those circumstances, how could they treat people like that? </sentence><sentence id="1048">Even if they deserved rough treatment, they shouldn't be treated -- that was my reaction. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1050">Q: And how long did you stay -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: Oh not more -- we were just couple of hour -- not even couple of hours, we just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1052">Q: Did your driver walk -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1053">A: -- going through. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1059">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1061">A: And I saw -- I actually saw one person die. </sentence><sentence id="1062">He was too weak to even -- a man who was just too weak to even talk. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And that -- that was devastating to me. </sentence><sentence id="1064">I had -- I didn't want to see much more of it. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I saw corpses. </sentence><sentence id="1066">I saw one building that had obviously been torched with people having been locked in the building, and then tried to dig their way out underneath it. </sentence><sentence id="1067">That w -- that was it, that was the -- the worst of it all. </sentence><sentence id="1068">So beyond that I didn't want to see any more. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And I -- I just - - I saw enough to realize how horrible it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1079">Q: Did you talk to the American troops who were there? </sentence><sentence id="1080">Were they finding guards that you might have interrogated, or did you just want to get out of there as fast as you could? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1103">Q: Why don't you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1104">A: Well, th-the Buchenwald thing actually didn't come to my attention until the trials and then Buchenwald was just a name of other camps that had been there. </sentence><sentence id="1105">But it became personally close to me during my embassy days, 40 years later. </sentence><sentence id="1106">In Luxembourg there is an Amicale de Buchenwald, and these are Luxembourgers, some Jewish, non-Jews, some were deserters of the army, some were the parents of Luxembourgers who had been forced into the German army, who deserted and then the parents were thrown into the concentration camp, so we had a -- a    </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1129">And a bunch of them are coming back to Europe to celebrate the 40" anniversary of the end of the war and the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And they want to come to Luxembourg, and they asked me if I would speak to them at the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1131">A lot of these veteran's groups did that. </sentence><sentence id="1132">During a 10 month period of celebrating the end of the war and the liberation of Luxembourg, I was at that cemetery 69 times in 10 months, officially, not counting times when I would take a visit or two, to visit. </sentence><sentence id="1133">A Colonel Reed from Louisville, Kentucky, he wrote to me and -- and said that he was bringing a group of veterans and would I speak to them at the cemetery and of -- I said of course I would. </sentence><sentence id="1134">But could you arrange to make your visit at a time when we could also have the Amicale de Buchenwald at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1135">I -- I mention this incident in my book, because it -- it was one of the highlights I think of my embassy career. </sentence><sentence id="1136">When I arrived there -- it was all -- always arranged for the ambassador to be the last one to arrive, when everybody's -- ev -- everything is in place. </sentence><sentence id="1137">American flag on the fender, and ambassador flag, and -- and a lot of whoop-de-doo. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And I arrived, and was quite a shocking experience because there were two groups standing at General Patton's grave, and then 5,000 white marble crosses and Stars of David behind them. </sentence><sentence id="1139">It's -- it's a memorable scene every time. </sentence><sentence id="1140">You don't visit that cemetery without getting a lump in your throat. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Every one of these people buried there died during the Battle of the Bulge, at the military cemetery in Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And then General Patton's grave is right at the front of it. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I arrived there, and here were the -- the Americans on one group and -- and the Amicale de Buchenwald, Luxembourgers in the other group, just looking at each other. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Nobody knew what to do, or what to say, because you know, you could -- the atmosphere was so heavy you could -- you c -- cut it. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And I thought, oh what have I wrought here, you know, I've brought these people together, how am I going to break this -- break the ice here. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And just as I walked up -- and I knew the Luxembourgers of course, and -- and just as I walked up I heard one of the Luxembourg women say to one of the Americans, "I think I remember you, isn't your name Buddy?" </sentence><sentence id="1147">And it was, and these two got together and hugged each other, and -- and that broke the ice, I didn't have to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Th-They s-started mingling then an-and introducing themselves to each other, and -- and that was just a -- a moving experience. </sentence><sentence id="1149">The leader of the Amicale de Buchenwald, or the president of it was the mayor -- at that time the mayor of a little town called Beaufort where there is a very historic and romantic castle ruin in Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="1150">There are quite a few castles in Luxembourg, 74 of them to be exact, and Beaufort is one of the - - the most romantic because the ruin is fairly well preserved and you can tour it and imagine you can still see the dungeon and -- and the torture chamber and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So it's a big tourist attraction, and the mayor, of course, is responsible for the community and the chateau which belongs to the community. </sentence><sentence id="1152">He invited the entire sixth armored division bunch to come to Beaufort as his guests and sure the -- the buses loaded up and they spent the rest of the day -- they changed their whole itinerary. </sentence><sentence id="1153">They spent the rest of the day at this site and having their dinner in Beaufort, and mingling with the people and -- and they were just a very warm experience. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And to this day, and every time we've gone back now since our embassy days, we always go to Beaufort, look up the mayor and -- and reminisce about the days. </sentence><sentence id="1155">They published a book about Buchenwald and it tells the whole story of the liberation and -- and the inmates and what -- what it was like, the condition. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And it ends with pictures of this reunion group at the 40" anniversary. </sentence><sentence id="1157">It's -- a-and this might well be a book that ought to be in -- in the museum library, too, I -- P'll -- "ll see to that, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1158">But I learned more about Buchenwald from those people, associating with them than I did Dachau because as I say, i-it's a real emotional challenge, more than I could cope with. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I'm -- I'm not -- you have to really have a strong stomach. </sentence><sentence id="1160">People who don't believe the Holocaust ever happened ought to make a visit. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Not now, should have been there, see the real thing. </sentence><sentence id="1162">The -- they'd find out it happened, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1219">Q: Let's go to a -- a more -- a happier story -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1220">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1221">Q: -- although it's still involved in this time period, where you got to save the Lipizzaner horses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1223">Let's talk about that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1224">A: Well, yeah I -- I don't -- I don't think -- well, maybe -- maybe I'm -- I'm the savior of the -- the mares anyway, not the stallion. </sentence><sentence id="1225">There are two stories about the Lipizzaner horses and they always get mixed up. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Walt Disney got them all -- got it all mixed up in his, "Miracle of the White Stallion." </sentence><sentence id="1227">But I'm in that movie. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1232">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1234">A: Yes, but now identified -- the role in -- in that movie actually did happen that way and -- and I was involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="1235">I had arrived there with my driver on a search for -- actually I was looking for Heisenberg, you know, Heisenberg the physicist Nobel prize winner. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And our Manhattan project people were convinced that Germany was working on an atom bomb. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And they wanted to know what Friedisch and Weisecker, and what Heisenberg had done and how far they had gotten. </sentence><sentence id="1238">And the truth of it all is that the Germans really were not working on an atomic bomb. </sentence><sentence id="1239">They weren't, but we didn't know that, so we were looking for people who knew something about Heisenberg, and von Weisecker and atomic research and if nothing else it gave me an excuse to go hither and yon, and go everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So anyhow, that's who I was supposedly looking for and it -- and I managed to be where the 16" armored division was, near Hofe and [indecipherable] Germany, right near the Czech border. </sentence><sentence id="1241">I was the only one at -- and there was a s -- a second armored </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1242"> cavalry regiment which was heading in that particular sector. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And the colonel who was in -- in charge of that particular battalion couldn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1244">But one evening I was playing cards with somebody and they need an interpreter and the colonel sent for me and I went over to interpret for him, the reason being that a German captain had voluntarily surrendered and was brought before the colonel to be interrogated and he -- the colonel couldn't talk to him because he couldn't speak German, so I was called in to be the interpreter and Disney does have that scene in the movie. </sentence><sentence id="1245">The colonel is actually eating his dinner and when the prisoner is brought in and I do the interrogating. </sentence><sentence id="1246">In the movie the prisoner tells the colonel about a horse farm, but that didn't -- that -- that wasn't the case at all. </sentence><sentence id="1247">He was telling the colonel about dienst stella ost, service station east, translation. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Which is a military intelligence unit, German military intelligence unit, very much like ours, detailed interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1249">This was a German intelligence unit gathering information about the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="1250">And they were in a hunting lodge in the Bohemian forest, just halfway between the border and Pilgrin, and they were interrogating German -- I mean, Russian PW, who had information of a strategic nature, like we were doing on our side. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1251">This unit had been in existence for five years and they had maps of every airport in the Soviet Union, of every bridge, of every installation, every weapon, anything you wanted to know about the Soviet army, they had it. </sentence><sentence id="1252">The Soviets were about five miles to the east of them, the Americans about five miles to the west of them, they were in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Now what should they do? </sentence><sentence id="1254">Do nothing, Soviets might get there first. </sentence><sentence id="1255">If they find out what the Germans had been doing there, it'd be their heads. </sentence><sentence id="1256">They could just destroy everything they had and take to the woods, but that wouldn't be German. </sentence><sentence id="1257">They're not going to destroy anything they've been gathering for five years. </sentence><sentence id="1258">So their third option was to surrender to the Americans before the Soviets would get there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1259">So this captain voluntarily came to our unit and surrendered and told my colonel all about his </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1260"> dienst stella ost. </sentence><sentence id="1261">They wanted to surrender to us and turn over to us all of the documentation and all of the interrogation reports, maps and everything they had about the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="1262">So they needed a German speaking officer and I was the only one there, so the colonel said, you know, "Doli, your -- you go in, we'll arrange this." </sentence><sentence id="1263">So we had a two and a half ton truck and driver and enlisted man guard and then the sergeant and I in the Jeep -- and sergeant [indecipherable] the truck and I in my Jeep with my driver and we drove into this hunting lodge. </sentence><sentence id="1264">It was an air force colonel -- Luftwaffe colonel, a lieutenant colonel, actually, who was the commander of this unit, Holters was his name and he made a big show, a very formal first wor -- World War I general staff officer, with a surrender s -- the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1265">We loaded all the stuff on the trucks and there were just a few officers and enlisted men and they got on the truck with the documents and the colonel got in the Jeep with me and then we drove back to our place. </sentence><sentence id="1266">The whole thing didn't take more than about 20 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1267">But on the way Colonel Holters told me -- asked me if I knew anything about horses. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And I didn't know a thing about horses. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Well, particularly he wanted to know if I knew anything about the Lipizzaner horses. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And I didn't know anything about them either. </sentence><sentence id="1271">So he proceeded to tell me about Spanish riding school, and the history of the Lipizzaner, very fascinating. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And then I found out the purpose of it all was to tell me that there was a -- a gut -- stut -- stud -- stud farm under the German department of agriculture, which had been brought to this place -- I forget the name of the owner of the estate now, Arco whatever it was, located just in Czechoslovakia, sort of a equivalent to a bluegrass region, which particularly fertile grass and particularly good region to breed horses. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And the German Department of Agriculture had brought these mares and some stallions and other horses of a different breed, Caucasians and some were from the Russian steppes. </sentence><sentence id="1274">About 200 horses, but primarily Lipizzaners for breeding purposes to this stud farm. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And they were just about two miles south of where w -- two </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1276"> kilometers south of where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And he told me all about this, so when he explained the Spanish riding school to me, I -- I just felt well, we ought to get involved here. </sentence><sentence id="1278">So we took a detour. </sentence><sentence id="1279">I sent a sergeant and a truck with the other prisoners, and documents and everything on, and we took a little detour and this how we came upon this stud farm. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And th-the -- they -- there were all the lipi -- my first look at Lipizzaner horses, a beautiful sight. </sentence><sentence id="1281">This is in May, and the meadow was in bloom and everything else is just beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And I had learned enough about the horses to really appreciate this. </sentence><sentence id="1283">There were some young horses who were frolicking in -- in the meadow and doing things that is officially described as airs above the ground, which are the things that we train the stallions to do -- I mean we -- they trained the stallions to do at the Spanish riding school and wherever they have Lipizzaner horses, there are two farms here in the United States where they train lipid -- breed and train Lipizzaners. </sentence><sentence id="1284">Anyhow, these foals -- th- these horses we-were -- were doing these things naturally. </sentence><sentence id="1285">The trick is to teach them to do it on command. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And that was the beauty of this development that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Anyhow, the point was that I had the opportunity to -- to meet Colonel Potisky, who was the leader of the Spanish riding school, who happened to be there at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Well, to make a long story short, from the stud farm, once I saw it, I took some pictures and I went on back then, reported to Colonel Reed what I had seen. </sentence><sentence id="1289">He had a brother who -- who had performed an e -- an eques -- equestrian of the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And he went riding a horse that was named Potisky in honor of Colonel Potisky of the Spanish riding school. </sentence><sentence id="1291">So he knew all about them. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And I said, "Well, there's a stud farm." </sentence><sentence id="1293">Here we are and -- so he took over. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And we had German PW and a lot of Polish DPs who were in the area, who then helped some of our American forces move the horses back into Germany because the fear was that the ri -- Soviets would get there first, and they would eat them, because the rumor, and it's -- I guess it was true, too, there was a Spanish riding school in Budapest, and </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1295"> the Soviets tried to get those horses to use them to pull wagons and the Lipizzaners wouldn't respond, so they ji -- but-butchered them. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And so they were afraid this what would happen to the Lipizzaner. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Plus the fact that the Polish DPs didn't like the Germans, and they would take care of the Lipizzaners also if they got a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1298">So we rescued them, we -- we brought them. </sentence><sentence id="1299">Some of the stallions were there, but mostly they were the -- the mares and the foals and some of the other horses. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And we moved them across into a sector of -- of Germany, Schwartzburg, which is in the command of the second armored cavalry regiment. </sentence><sentence id="1301">That's the story that I was involved in. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1302">Meanwhile, at about the same time, General Walker of the 20" corps came into Austria to St. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1303">Martin in -- in Crise, and came to an estate there which they set up as their headquarters, where the stallions of the Spanish riding school from Vienna had been brought by Colonel Potisky. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And colonel -- General Walker was quite impressed and knowing that Patton was a horse lover and cavalryman, notified Patton, who was at that time I think in -- in Frankfort. </sentence><sentence id="1305">And Patton and the deputy secretary of war, who was visiting the front at that time, got into Patton's plane and they flew to Saint Martin's and the stallions from the Spanish riding school put on a show for Patton - </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1306">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: -- with the result that Patton put the Lipizzaners under the protection of the United States army, all Lipizzaners, which included the ones from the stud farm, who were included in that general order. </sentence><sentence id="1308">Nobody could touch the Lipizzaner horses who were under the protection of the United States army, because Patton was quite impressed with them. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And it turned out that he had wid -- ridden in the Olympics in 1912 against Colonel Potisky. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And the most famous quote to me, a Patton quote is -- I don't have the exact quote, but he was quite peevishly concerned that why the Austrians used 57 healthy, well-trained men to teach horses how to dance, when they </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1311"> should be at the front fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1312">I mean, that was the gist of it. </sentence><sentence id="1313">Imagine these guys teaching horses to dance instead of fighting for their country. </sentence><sentence id="1314">But nevertheless he -- he did protect the horses, and -- so Patton really is the liberator of the Lipizzaners. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And that's the Disney story. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Now Disney had the whole thing -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1317">Q: Together. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1318">A: -- brought together, you know, and there was fighting and -- and that -- there was resistance, and -- but not really, it was a very peaceful operation, but a great adventure. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And the sequel was that my pattern of circles again, is that 50 years later, my wife and I were in Vienna, were going to Vienna and wanted to go to the Spanish riding school, to see a performance there. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And we had our youngest son Brian with us. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And we couldn't get any tickets. </sentence><sentence id="1322">It was the opening performance, September 12" and they were all sold out. </sentence><sentence id="1323">Nobody could get me any tickets. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And consequently, I had a photograph and I brought some of the photographs with me of Colonel Potisky and myself shaking hands, with a Lipizzaner standing next to us. </sentence><sentence id="1325">So I -- very brash, I wrote a letter to Colonel Potisky, commandant of the Spanish riding school in Vienna, Austria and I included that picture. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And told him, you know, this is me, and [indecipherable] the incident of our -- our -- our visit and said that I was trying to get tickets for the opening performance and if he could possibly help me I would appreciate it, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1327">I didn't hear from him until about a week before we left for Europe on our vacation trip. </sentence><sentence id="1328">I got a letter from the Spanish riding school, not from Colonel Potisky, saying that he had retired, he's on a trip around the world, my letter had caught up with him in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And they had tickets for the three of us to come to the Spanish riding school performance, and I should pick them up in the -- before 11 o'clock on the performance on that day. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And sure enough, we stayed at the Sarka hotel, and that morning I went to -- I had this -- the whole [indecipherable] where the school performs, there's a big line of people standing in line to buy tickets for standing room only because they're sold out. </sentence><sentence id="1331">But you could buy tickets on the day of the performance to stand. </sentence><sentence id="1332">Well, only -- only time in my life I've ever crashed a line. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I went to the front, got a lot of dirty looks, but I presented the letter from colonel -- from that Spanish riding school and sure enough they had tickets for me. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Had to pay for them, they weren't free. </sentence><sentence id="1335">I paid for the tickets, went back hotel, got Winnie and our -- our son, and then at 11 o'clock we went back for the performance. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And as we came in there to present our tickets, the usher looked at the tickets and held up his hand and motioned to somebody who took us in a direction different from where everybody else was going. </sentence><sentence id="1337">And I thought there's a mistake made, and we -- our tickets aren't any good. </sentence><sentence id="1338">But instead they took us to the royal box, and we had the perf -- we sat in there, in the royal box of the Spanish riding school. </sentence><sentence id="1339">That was a big, big thrill. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1363">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1365">A: And when the horses came in in the opening, they all come in single file, 16 of them, and they come right toward the royal box, and they -- simultaneously the riders tip their hats. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And everybody thought we must be somebody very important. </sentence><sentence id="1367">That was a thrilling moment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1371">Q: I bet it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1373">A: And that was -- and that's 50 years after this particular incident, so it had a special meaning. </sentence><sentence id="1374">That -- that's the Lipizzaner story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1377">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1378">Your next assignment, I gather, is to go to the Palace Hotel in Mondorf, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1381">A: The war is over, in fact the war ended, unbeknownst to me at the time, this unit of the dienst stella ost, Colonel Holters and two of his officers -- we decided to send them to Augsburg, and then from Augsburg to our special service sta -- our own detailed interrogation center, our own service station in the Ardenst, in Revan. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And meanwhile my driver and I headed back to Revan, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1383"> and I continued on that particular project for about a week or so in Revan, of Colonel Holters and -- and his staff. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And it was a wonderful time because we got back the day the war ended, got back into Revan. </sentence><sentence id="1385">And the next day we had a victory parade, full dress uniform, just my unit, 6824DIC, we had a drummer who played the drum, no -- no band, orchestra, and an American flag, and we got all dressed up, officers and enlisted men, and we had a parade right through Revan, and th-the French people cheering us on, viva l'Amerique. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And it was a great -- a great victory. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And the next week or two I had a wonderful time going down to Rans for the opera, and interrogating -- finishing the job of Colonel Holters. </sentence><sentence id="1388">Then we ran into trouble cause our war department wasn't interested in having that information about Soviet Union, cause that was our - - they were our allies. </sentence><sentence id="1389">And so there was a resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And then the fact my commanding officer was -- supposedly I heard, reprimanded for either -- either -- for even gathering this information. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1391">But you probably know the name Bob Lovitt, and Bob Lovitt was a deputy secretary of state, I believe at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1392">And he used his influence and eventually Colonel Holters, the two officers, and all the documents we -- we captured in the Bohemian forest were brought to this secret location here in Washington. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And that's the end of that relationship, that's all I knew about. </sentence><sentence id="1394">My commanding officer called me in and said I had a new assignment, and our detailed interrogation center was going to be dissolved and I was going to go to a place that he had never heard of before, and that's Mondorf, Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Meanwhile, I had made one trip to Luxembourg on a special assignment to go back and see if I could locate any of my family. </sentence><sentence id="1396">So this transfer to Luxembourg came as a real surprise. </sentence><sentence id="1397">In fact, I had -- I had no idea there were even Americans stationed in Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="1398">I assumed, of course, but I hadn't pursued that. </sentence><sentence id="1399">So that was a real assignment, to get back into Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="1400">And that assignment was to the central prisoner of war enclosure number 32, which was also coded in our orders as Ashcan. </sentence><sentence id="1401">That was the code word </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1402"> that they used, send us to the place. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And that's all I knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="1404">I had no idea what the place was, what it was used for or what I'd be doing. </sentence><sentence id="1405">All I know is I was transferred. </sentence><sentence id="1406">The good news was that my best friend and colleague, Malcolm Hilkey, with whom I had been at -- at-at -- in Vienna, and -- and in Paris, and also at Revan, was going to the same place. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And my commanding officer would be Captain Sensnik, whom I had met at Camp Richie, Maryland. </sentence><sentence id="1408">So I would be with old friends and -- and ready for whatever they had in store for me. </sentence><sentence id="1409">So I arrived in Luxembourg, my second visit, this time on official assignment. </sentence><sentence id="1410">There was a lot of talk when the war ended that we were now going to go to the far east in military intelligence, and I anticipated that that's probably what would happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="1411">But instead I was sent to Luxembourg, which to me was a miracle, and which shouldn't have happened that way, but I didn't question it. </sentence><sentence id="1412">So I arrived in Mondorf. </sentence><sentence id="1413">I knew Mondorf because I had gone there with my brother Heinrich who is married, when I was still in Luxembourg as a boy. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And he and his wife had taken me to Mondorf on occasion. </sentence><sentence id="1415">There was a little train called the Jongelly that went from Luxembourg city to Mondorf, for people who went there, this resort, Mondorf was a -- a spa, mineral water and health resort health spa. </sentence><sentence id="1416">And I knew the place that I was assigned to, that was the palace hotel. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1417">Four story hotel casino, with gambling tables and the works. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And guest rooms, and all of the facilities for casino for -- for a health resort. </sentence><sentence id="1419">So I reported there and then I found it -- it had changed quite a lot from what I remember as a boy. </sentence><sentence id="1420">A fence around it, Klieg lights overheard, camouflage material, and [indecipherable] hanging, you know, you couldn't see what was going on inside. </sentence><sentence id="1421">There were machine gun towers on each of the four corners of this fenced in area. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And there was a roving guard, a Jeep, military police riding around, I think, constantly. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And all I knew is I been transferred to CCPW number 32, I didn't know what was -- what was going on inside there. </sentence><sentence id="1424">So I asked the sergeant of the guard in the Jeep, say what's going on here? </sentence><sentence id="1425">And hi -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1426"> his answer is very typical of sergeant of the guard, he said, th-the -- "Well," he said, "I've been here three weeks," he said. " </sentence><sentence id="1427">I've never been inside. </sentence><sentence id="1428">All I know is to get in here you have to have a pass signed by God, and somebody has to verify the signature." </sentence><sentence id="1429">So that aroused my curiosity, but I had the right papers, and they let me in, they -- I was expected. </sentence><sentence id="1430">There was a noncommissioned officer in the lobby of the hotel when I walked in, and he read my orders, and signed me to my room. </sentence><sentence id="1431">He said, "This is where you're going to live, and that's also where you're going to work." </sentence><sentence id="1432">And I asked him, "What kind of a place is this?" </sentence><sentence id="1433">And he said, "Well, it's an interrogation center, it's a wa -- interrogating prisoners of war." </sentence><sentence id="1434">So I assumed this is continuation of what we've been doing at the -- at Revan, at DIC. </sentence><sentence id="1435">So as I was in -- in the process of unpacking my belongings in my room, which was rather sparsely furnished, but comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="1436">And I heard a knock on the door, and I thought this is one of other officers coming in to introduce himself. </sentence><sentence id="1437">So I opened the door, and before me stood none other than Herman Goering, the Reichsmarshall of the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="1438">So I was the most surprised person in the world, and stood there with my mouth open. </sentence><sentence id="1439">He clicked his heels and says, "Goering, Reichsmarshall." </sentence><sentence id="1440">So I asked him to step inside. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1441">He was carrying a pair of trousers and he said, "This an extra pair of trousers." </sentence><sentence id="1442">I couldn't understand this, but he, in a smirking fashion -- he had a way of delivering his lines with a smirk on his face. </sentence><sentence id="1443">He said, "Well, I wanted to be a model prisoner, and several days ago we were declassified. </sentence><sentence id="1444">We are now ordinary prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And we only permitted a certain amount of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And I overlooked this particular pair of trousers. </sentence><sentence id="1447">I didn't want to get in trouble, so I want to turn them in to you." </sentence><sentence id="1448">Well, I -- I wasn't quite in tune with what he was leading up to, and then it suddenly dawned on me that he needed an excuse to come and see me and I think he was sacrificing an extra pair of trousers for an excuse. </sentence><sentence id="1449">I didn't know anything about the operation yet, but it ma -- was made clear to me later on. </sentence><sentence id="1450">What he wanted to know is he wanted to know who I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1451"> was. </sentence><sentence id="1452">He fancied himself the -- the leader of the group that was imprisoned. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And I didn't know who they were, but I knew now that one of them was Goering. </sentence><sentence id="1454">So it was his business to find out who the newcomers, who the arrivals were. </sentence><sentence id="1455">And he had seen me coming in through the gate, so he followed procedure and came to see me, using the trousers as an excuse. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And then he asked me, "What is your particular assignment here? </sentence><sentence id="1457">You're a young man, what are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="1458">I was 26 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And before I could answer him, he said, "Are you by any chance the welfare officer, who would see to it that we all get treated properly, in accordance with the rules of Geneva convention?" </sentence><sentence id="1460">So I was just going to say no, I'm an interrogation officer, but when he suggested I might be the welfare officer, I said, "Oh yeah, I'm going to see to it that you get treated properly," and he was satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="1461">So he then started a list of complaints. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And he was unhappy with the way he was brought here, that he was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1463">Q: Wa -- wa -- can we wait just one moment? </sentence><sentence id="1464">Is that [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1465">Okay, I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1466">A: Well he had -- he had decided then -- well, I had decided, rather, that I would see to it that they would all get a square deal. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And he lodged his cam -- ki -- campaign of complaints about he was supposed to go to -- go into exile. </sentence><sentence id="1468">He had brought with him 11 suitcases, with all of his uniforms and decorations and his Reichsmarshall baton, all his belongings. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And he, after all, was the head of the German state, successor to Hitler and he was going to go to -- into exile like Napoleon or any head of state. </sentence><sentence id="1470">Instead they brought him to this very meager hotel, with a folding army cot, straw mattress, and he was very unhappy with that whole arrangement. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And I said well I knew nothing about that. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And that ended our conversation, he clicked his heels and bowed and left. </sentence><sentence id="1473">That evening at five o'clock, I was to report to my commanding officer, to Captain Sensnik. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1474">And I was a first lieutenant at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And I reported to Captain Sensnik and I told him that I had a visitor. </sentence><sentence id="1476">I told him of this particular visit from Goering. </sentence><sentence id="1477">And Captain Sensnik, "That's </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1478"> great," he said, "that's your cover." </sentence><sentence id="1479">He said, "Every one of us needs a cover, and by the way, use a different name, don't use your name. </sentence><sentence id="1480">You still have relatives in Europe, brothers and sisters, and we don't know what's ahead, but most of us are using different names, so pick a name." </sentence><sentence id="1481">Well, I picked a n -- a name of a -- a good Luxembourg name, Gellen. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Said, "Okay, I'll be John Gellen." </sentence><sentence id="1483">He said, "Okay, that's your name from now on. </sentence><sentence id="1484">All your orders, everything you get will be in the name of John Gellen. </sentence><sentence id="1485">And you pretend to be the welfare officer. </sentence><sentence id="1486">You visit all the prisoners, listen to what they have to say, keep a file of what you hear, and we'll coordinate that with our interrogation reports. </sentence><sentence id="1487">So yi -- ni -- that's your job from now on, that's your cover." </sentence><sentence id="1488">Then he explained to me that all the prisoners were on the third and fourth floor, some two in a room, some single rooms. </sentence><sentence id="1489">The second floor was a buffer zone, nothing was happening on that floor. </sentence><sentence id="1490">The first floor, where we were -- we were billeted in our sleeping rooms and also our working offices, but we were trying to find private billets outside of the compound so we could go home at night after work, so we wouldn't be in the same building with the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1491">The ground floor was a dining room, where the prisoners would eat, a lounge where they could read, under supervision. </sentence><sentence id="1492">If they wore glasses, their glasses were kept on the rack in the lounge, they weren't allowed to take their glasses upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Danger of suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1494">They might break their glasses and cut their wrists, as some of them had tried to do. </sentence><sentence id="1495">There was a veranda around the front of the hotel where they could sit and sunbathe. </sentence><sentence id="1496">They could actually walk in the garden, a nice little garden. </sentence><sentence id="1497">But they had to stay within a barb wire enclosure and there's an electric -- electric wire. </sentence><sentence id="1498">I had a picture of that, by the way, of the electric wire, with a German sign warning high voltage so they wouldn't beyond that. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And of course there was a machine gun tower. </sentence><sentence id="1500">Now I have my own theory of why we had this heavy guard around the place. </sentence><sentence id="1501">None of these people is going to s -- going to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1502">W-We didn't have to worry about that. </sentence><sentence id="1503">We had to worry about the people on </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1504"> the outside who might want to get at them. </sentence><sentence id="1505">So they were more defense, and guard were more to protect them from the outside and keep them alive and in good shape for the trials, than otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Each room was equipped with a folding army cot, straw mattress, two or three GI blankets, a four legged stool and a bucket of water, and a cake of Lifebuoy soap. </sentence><sentence id="1507">The -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1508">Q: Lifebuoy? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1509">A: Lifebuoy, the original Lifebuoy. </sentence><sentence id="1510">The kind your mother put in your mouth when you used a dirty word. </sentence><sentence id="1511">That was the offi -- the official issue, a deodorant soap. </sentence><sentence id="1512">There were no doorknobs on the doors because they could use the screws to -- use the sc -- the sharp end of a screw if they wanted to hurt themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1513">The flush toilet were the kind with the tank above and the chain, that was removed. </sentence><sentence id="1514">The chain was removed cause they might use the chain. </sentence><sentence id="1515">They were not pu -- permitted to wear belts, neckties, shoestrings -- which was a real problem. </sentence><sentence id="1516">How to keep them in their shoes if they wore hightops without shoestrings. </sentence><sentence id="1517">We had to get special permission and they were allowed four inch shoestrings so they could at least tie the top two holes together. </sentence><sentence id="1518">It's kind of humorous and they made much of that when they exercised a little -- a little sense of humor. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1519">They had absolute freedom to move within the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1520">This is how Goering came to my room. </sentence><sentence id="1521">He could see who was going where and follow and knock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="1522">This was by design. </sentence><sentence id="1523">This -- this helped to stimulate communication. </sentence><sentence id="1524">It allowed them to visit each other, they could go to each other's rooms and get involved in discussions and arguments, and get mad at each other and we benefited from that. </sentence><sentence id="1525">That was part of our technique of gathering information. </sentence><sentence id="1526">What did one prisoner say about the other prisoner, especially if he was mad at him. </sentence><sentence id="1527">This -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1528">Q: Did -- did you walk around a lot so you could watch what the socialization was, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1529">A: Yes -- we -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1530">Q: -- and see how they were interacting? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1531">A: -- we -- we -- we -- we took advantage of their mutual -- of their -- the way they communicated with I -- who spoke to whom, and who snubbed whom, because we would then play that guy off with a -- against the other one and -- and get information out of him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1533">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1535">A: It was very effective. </sentence><sentence id="1536">We -- we did -- we didn't use any what we now consider modern interrogation [indecipherable] like recordings. </sentence><sentence id="1537">There were no secret tapes, definitely no torture devises, I mean we didn't -- thumbscrews or any kind of torture device. </sentence><sentence id="1538">We didn't need it. </sentence><sentence id="1539">They were all willing to talk, a-and they're quite willing to talk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1545">Q: Why do you think that was so, that they were so willing to talk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1547">A: First of all, the more they were interrogated, the more important they were, because if -- if you had a lot of interrogations, in the eyes of the other prisoners, the enemy considered you a decision maker, you were obviously one of the top men. </sentence><sentence id="1548">If you were not interrogated at all, which was true of some of the people, I don't know why we had them, I mean, they shouldn't have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1549">Nobody knew who they were. </sentence><sentence id="1550">But they had a uniform on and they happened to be at the wrong place at the right time and were taken prisoner, cause they had a title, or they were with somebody, if they were in the presence of Goering. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Like his -- his adjutant, or his aid. </sentence><sentence id="1552">They were all taken prisoner, unfortunately because they happened to be Goering's aid, but they had no intelligence value, and they were not permitted to continue to be his aid. </sentence><sentence id="1553">They just became ordinary prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1554">So we -- we had prisoners who -- who -- who just -- we didn't know why they were there, and they didn't know why they were there, and they wanted to be interrogated so they could -- they could at least feel that they were important. </sentence><sentence id="1555">That was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1556">The other thing was none of these prisoners presented themselves as a unit, a -- a -- none of them worked as part of a team, a united effort to protect each other. </sentence><sentence id="1557">They were all protecting only themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1558">Not a single one ever thought in terms of protecting the German general's staff, or protecting the -- the Nazi element, or the bureaucracy, the bureaucrats whom we had. </sentence><sentence id="1559">And those were the three categories that automatically they divided themselves into. </sentence><sentence id="1560">The general's staff pretty much stuck together socially in the prison, in their -- their discussion groups and their cliques. </sentence><sentence id="1561">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1562">When they sat on the veranda or in the lounge, or when they ate together, they pretty much stuck together, and the Nazis pretty much stuck together. </sentence><sentence id="1563">And the same thing with the statesmen or the ministers and some of those. </sentence><sentence id="1564">So each one was out to save his own neck. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And they had grievances that went back to Hitler's time, back to 1934 - 35. </sentence><sentence id="1566">If Goering snubbed this particular general, this general now had an opportunity to spill the beans about Goering. </sentence><sentence id="1567">Petty stuff, but this is exactly what we wanted -- w-we wanted to hear. </sentence><sentence id="1568">So the socializing with each other and visiting with each other was all part of a interrogation scheme. </sentence><sentence id="1569">We had a conflict of our own, cause on one hand, there were five of us, five interrogators. </sentence><sentence id="1570">And we belonged to the Richie crowd, we were the trained military intelligence personnel. </sentence><sentence id="1571">We had nothing to do with the operation of the prison, of how the prisoners were fed, or how they were housed or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1572">That was under the command of the -- of Colonel Andrews, Burton C. Andrews, of the 391deg anti-tank battalion -- were his personnel. </sentence><sentence id="1573">Andrews actually was brought into this job in charge of this detention center from a -- a prisoner of war -- not a prisoner of war enclosure, but a regular prison -- what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="1574">A prison camp. </sentence><sentence id="1575">For military prison camp, American prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1576">He was in charge of -- of a prison camp. </sentence><sentence id="1577">So he was a trained military warden, and he was in charge of this prison. </sentence><sentence id="1578">We had f -- about 40 or so ordinary German soldiers who were ordinary prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1579">They were the cadre, the work cadre. </sentence><sentence id="1580">They we -- they did the manual labor. </sentence><sentence id="1581">The prisoners didn't do their own cooking or serving of the food or cleaning up, except their rooms, they had to clean their own rooms. </sentence><sentence id="1582">But they didn't run the sweepers, or -- or do the dusting or anything in the public rooms. </sentence><sentence id="1583">So we had German soldiers who were carpenters, electricians, cooks, bakers, even the chaplain, a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1584">Most anything we needed to run a prison. </sentence><sentence id="1585">But these were ordinary German prisoners who were now in a position to be associated with the -- what they called the bunsin, the big animals who had run the -- the dictatorship under Hitler's regime. </sentence><sentence id="1586">Was quite a -- that interplay was very interesting to watch. </sentence><sentence id="1587">Well then we had the prison guards, the Americans, who supervised all of this, who directed the German PW, who were the work cadre. </sentence><sentence id="1588">And they were responsible for the security and -- and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1589">Now Colonel Andrews came from a regular detention center, from a prison. </sentence><sentence id="1590">We had difficulty convincing him that these were not people who were being punished. </sentence><sentence id="1591">They were people who were being interrogated in preparation for a trial. </sentence><sentence id="1592">And that we needed them in pretty good physical condition and good mental condition in order to get their cooperation while we interrogated them. </sentence><sentence id="1593">But he looked upon them as criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1594">And he was the -- the prison warden. </sentence><sentence id="1595">So if they didn't exactly behave as he thought they should, like if they didn't have their room very clean, then he would put them in solitary confinement. </sentence><sentence id="1596">They'd stay in a basement for 24 hours, or maybe two days if their shoes weren't shined properly. </sentence><sentence id="1597">And we'd say that doesn't help our interrogation, because if they get mad and resentful, then they won't cooperate with us. </sentence><sentence id="1598">So we had that interplay, so -- and we finally had to go pretty high up, as high as Wild Bill Donovan, the commanding general of the -- what was then the OSS, who was our mentor. </sentence><sentence id="1599">He is the one who coached us on how to get information out of the prisoners, he was a -- an expert in that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1600">And Donovan then had to use his general rank to get Colonel Andrews to cooperate with the idea that this was a -- a processing center, not a center for punishment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1657">Q: We're going to have to stop the tape now -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1660">Q: -- because we're running out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1662">End of Tape Two    Beginning Tape Three </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1665">Q: We -- when we completed the last tape, you were talking about the problem with Colonel Andrews -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1666">A: Andrews, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1667">Q: -- and his view of the prisoners versus -- or were these prisoners, were these criminals, who were these people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1669">A: Well, he treat -- as far as he was concerned, they were prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And one of my jobs -- Andrews took a personal liking to me, primarily because I knew my way around Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="1671">So whenever we had a VIP visitor like General Eisenhower, or -- or any one of the higher officials who came to visit, I would be ap -- appointed tour guide. </sentence><sentence id="1672">So that became one of my functions. </sentence><sentence id="1673">In addition to what I had to do, I would take them around Luxembourg and show them places. </sentence><sentence id="1674">Well, Andrews enjoyed that part of it himself because he would always go along and -- and I'd on a couple of occasions invited Prince Felix, who liked American bourbon. </sentence><sentence id="1675">And bourbon was just not available anywhere, except as we got it in our liquor ration in Mondorf. </sentence><sentence id="1676">So every once in awhile, on Saturday nights, the few of us officers would get together and have a little party, and we invited Prince Felix to a couple of these affairs, which impressed Colonel Andrews very much. </sentence><sentence id="1677">So we finally got around to the point of where he saw our viewpoint in addition to the official persuasion he got from above. </sentence><sentence id="1678">You know, we can't treat these people like convicted criminals serving their sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1679">We have to try them first, and before we can try them, we had to interrogate them, and -- and that public relations effort helped considerably. </sentence><sentence id="1680">It also resulted in my being at Nuremberg when I had done everything possible to avoid going to Nuremberg, cause I was tired of the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1681">But once I arrived there on temporary duty, Andrews snagged me and he wouldn't let me go because he wanted me back on his staff again. </sentence><sentence id="1682">So it had its -- its pluses and minuses. </sentence><sentence id="1683">But he used me also to translate his messages to the -- the prisoners whenever -- for instance, when Streicher arrived, Doenitz refused on behalf of the other prisoners, to eat in the same dining room with Streicher. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Well then Andrews wrote a message to be delivered to them, and I -- of course I translated that and read the message to the prisoners and -- which we told them it -- you have no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1685">I mean, he's your boy and you're going to eat with him whether you like it or not, cause you're all alike. </sentence><sentence id="1686">We're not looking at you as a grand admiral, or you as a Reichsmarshall. </sentence><sentence id="1687">We're looking at you as a declassified prisoner of war, and that's what Streicher is, and you're going to eat in the same dining room, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1688">That -- that's the kind of message that Andrews enjoyed delivering and -- and always -- he had a riding crop that he carried all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1689">High polished boots, polished helmet, he was sort of a spittin" image of General Patton when it came to dress and bearing and he loved to play the commanding officer, which sometimes the Nazis u-used against all of us in a humorous sense. </sentence><sentence id="1690">For instance, one general, I forget what his name was, had not -- Andrews came walking into the room and -- and the general didn't stand up and click his heels, so he was punished and he was put in the basement room which Andrews kept for solitary confinement. </sentence><sentence id="1691">And then he wrote an order that whenever he walked into a room they were to stand up at attention and -- and salute him. </sentence><sentence id="1692">Well, they carried it to the other extreme so whenever any one of us entered the room they did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1693">And it got to be sort of humorous, here I was a first lieutenant and if they were all sitting on the vera -- veranda in the afternoon, about 30 or 40 of these guys, and I would come back from lunch and walk it up -- they would all stand up and click their heels and bow, and say good afternoon Herr [indecipherable] you know. </sentence><sentence id="1694">And it got to be a joke until they got tired of it, but we had a -- light moments with them too. </sentence><sentence id="1695">But we did convince Andrews finally to let us do our -- our thing, as long as the prisoners didn't violate any of the rules he'd go along with it, but that was one of the challenges. </sentence><sentence id="1696">Other than that, our interrogation technique, as I said, was one of -- in my particular case I was the welfare -- I pretended to be the welfare officer. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Well, I was the welfare officer because I made the rounds. </sentence><sentence id="1698">I would go from room to room and I would ask the prisoner how -- how are you today, and at first they were very busy writing letters to General Eisenhower, to President Truman, to -- you know, they were heads of state, or former heads of state. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And they were complaining about their treatment and making demands. </sentence><sentence id="1700">And our job was to translate those letters, send them -- send them out through channels. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And we never got any replies, I assume they're still going through channels. </sentence><sentence id="1702">But -- so if they had a letter that they wanted to write to someone, they would give it to me to translate for them, and send it on. </sentence><sentence id="1703">Or if they wanted to locate their family. </sentence><sentence id="1704">You know, I -- I don't know where my wife is, could you try to find out where she is? </sentence><sentence id="1705">And we would, which is very simple thing because for instance, a lot of them lived -- th-the Nazi -- I always refer to them as the bunsin, the big -- the big boys -- a lot of the Nazi leaders, they had a tendency to cluster. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Ma-Many of them had their villas at Tegernsee in Bavaria. </sentence><sentence id="1707">So if Kesserling wanted to locate his wife the last time he heard from her, we could contact a military unit of ours stationed near Tegernsee and ask them to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And we got to the point where we could sometimes forward letters. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And that helped tremendously in getting their cooperation and telling me things that -- that we wanted to hear. </sentence><sentence id="1710">So I would make the rounds and -- and somebody would say, I don't have any toothpaste, could you get me a -- an extra ration of toothpaste, shampoo, or I have a dandruff problem. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Goering had a skin problem and he always -- he wanted special lotions and special soaps, which we couldn't furnish, but at least I listened to his complaints and -- and by listening and sympathizing with him, that -- that helped pave the way. </sentence><sentence id="1712">What happened then was that every one of us had a specialty. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I really specialized in the German general's staff. </sentence><sentence id="1714">The history of the German general's staff, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So a lot of my interrogations were of the high ranking generals, based on military strategies and organization and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1716">With the result that each one of the five of us would have only a certain number of prisoners under their jurisdiction and they wouldn't get to know anything about any of the others. </sentence><sentence id="1717">Well, I was the welfare officer, so I got to meet a lot of them, even though I never interrogated them. </sentence><sentence id="1718">But I would g-go in and chat with them, ho-how are you doing, how do you feel? </sentence><sentence id="1719">And I would end up getting a lot of information that helped my performance, because I kept this gossip file about one s -- prisoner said about the other. </sentence><sentence id="1720">But one in particular stands out, was old Papa Schwartz, Franz Xavier Schwartz, was called Papa Schwartz. </sentence><sentence id="1721">He was the Nazi party treasurer. </sentence><sentence id="1722">Simple, kind old guy, really. </sentence><sentence id="1723">He didn't know what the score was. </sentence><sentence id="1724">But he was a very popular politician in Bavaria and Hitler used him to collect the dues. </sentence><sentence id="1725">If you belong to the Nazi party, you paid yo-your party dues. </sentence><sentence id="1726">And that's all Schwartz did, he collected dues. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And now you think Nazi party treasurer would have been a very important guy, who certainly would have a lot to do with buying property and -- and receiving big contributions. </sentence><sentence id="1728">That wasn't Schwartz's job, that was somebody else's responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1729">That was Funk, and to a certain extent at first, Schacht. </sentence><sentence id="1730">So Schwartz, I don't even know why we -- we brou -- he was never interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="1731">He really served no particular purpose. </sentence><sentence id="1732">And his son, Franz Xavier Schwartz, jr. </sentence><sentence id="1733">was the president of German breweries, which really had no particular connection, but he did have a - - a paramilitary rank in th -- either the SS or the SA. </sentence><sentence id="1734">A lot of people, if you made a big contribution financially, if you were an industrialist, you would got a -- get a rank like a sturmbondfuhrer in the SS, which was nothing more than an honorary title, and i -- and you could -- got to wear a uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1735">So if you were president of the breweries, you could wear a uniform as a brigadier general in the SS, but you really had nothing to do in the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1736">But it did put him in the automatic arrest category, because everybody who was an SS officer was automatically arrested by us. </sentence><sentence id="1737">So we ended up with a lot of these deadbeats. </sentence><sentence id="1738">Well, Schwartz looked very much like my father, physical image. </sentence><sentence id="1739">My father had sort of a white mustache, little [indecipherable] like Hindenburg. </sentence><sentence id="1740">And Schwartz looked like my father and the first time I went in to see Schwartz, I was taken aback because it looked almost like my own papa sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And he noticed that and wanted to know what -- you know, what made you -- he said -- upshraken was the German word, la -- what made you pull back. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And just in a moment of candor I said, "W-Well, because you look very much like my father." </sentence><sentence id="1743">And then I showed him a picture of my father. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And he -- he started to cry, he got -- he -- he got very emotional about that. </sentence><sentence id="1745">He th -- he thought that was just a wonderful coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="1746">He's -- he's a Roman Catholic, he was very devout, and he thought surely that God had ordained for this to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1747">Well, I -- I had to take advantage of that because all the other prisoners kind of looked upon ov -- Schwartz as almost a father confessor. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And they would go to Papa Schwartz and tell him things that they didn't tell anybody else, especially after an -- an interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1749">They were going to Papa Schwartz and say, well they asked me about this, but I told them that, but the truth of the matter is. </sentence><sentence id="1750">Well then, after I showed -- after wa -- won the confidence of Papa Schwartz, I could go to him, he'd say, don't trust so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1751">And he would -- he would tell me things about what the prisoner had said to him. </sentence><sentence id="1752">And it was that kind of play that -- that resulted in our getting more information than we really knew how to cope with, in addition to our official interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1753">We worked for the Nazi war crimes commission, which was headed by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, who was to be our prosecutor for the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And they were located in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1755">And -- and this was his staff, th-the general, General Telford Taylor, and Colonel Amon and others who were the assistant prosecutors. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And they would make up questionnaires, what they wanted to know about a certain prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1757">They were preparing the case for the prosecution against, say Karl Doenitz, Grand Admiral Doenitz. </sentence><sentence id="1758">So they had questions about him. </sentence><sentence id="1759">Was he present when this particular treaty was signed? </sentence><sentence id="1760">Was he there when -- at the Wannsee conference when the final solution was decided on? </sentence><sentence id="1761">And then we would get those questionnaires, and then we would have a staff meeting. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And Captain Sensnik would say, okay, we have a questionnaire on Doenitz, Dolibois, you -- you handle that one. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And then I would -- I would get that questionnaire and then I would prepare my interrogation of Doenitz, the intent being to get the answers to those questions, but -- but building it around a autobiographical sketch sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1764">And these were very fascinating because the prisoner would brag about his accomplishments, what he had done and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1765">And in the course of that you could work in the pas -- specific questions that colonel -- Justice Jackson wanted answered for his staff. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And this is what made the -- it's kind of a -- a -- an interesting challenge, an interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1767">Well that was the job of each interrogator. </sentence><sentence id="1768">We'd interrogate and sometimes it would go on for a week, you'd do nothing but interrogate one prisoner, then spend the afternoon writing up your report. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1887"> put down in our -- in our reports. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Sometimes we'd take a break and then quickly jot down the things that I want to remember and then continue the interrogation, and then from the jotted notes later. </sentence><sentence id="1889">But if you sat there with a pencil and asked questions, they freeze, and they would -- but if they could just go on and -- and ex -- expound on what they had accomplished, and I did this and I did that and thanks to me this was done. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And that's the sort of thing we were encouraging. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1895">Q: Now tell me, were they not suspicious of you five guys walking around talking with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1897">A: Well, they knew it -- first of all, they didn't believe if they were anything but prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1898">To tell them, you're going to have a trial, and you're going to be tried, that is something that -- that was ri -- in the book. </sentence><sentence id="1899">There's nothing in the Geneva Convention or the Warsaw Treaty that says if you lose the war and you're arrested and you become a prisoner, you might be tried for your crimes. </sentence><sentence id="1900">I mean, what -- what is a war crime? </sentence><sentence id="1901">That had never been decided until the Nuremberg trial. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And then it isn't quite clear. </sentence><sentence id="1903">Look what we're doing now. </sentence><sentence id="1904">I mean, nobody really knows what a war crime is. </sentence><sentence id="1905">This -- this business in The Hague going on now with international criminal court, they haven't defined a war crime as yet. </sentence><sentence id="1906">When somebody in Bosnia, a Serb, rapes a -- a Muslim woman, is that a war crime? </sentence><sentence id="1907">Or is it a crime against humanity? </sentence><sentence id="1908">What international court is going to try that per -- well, these are the -- the philosophical, legal things that hadn't come up. </sentence><sentence id="1909">So these people didn't expect to be tried. </sentence><sentence id="1910">They were prisoners of war, special prisoners of war because of their high rank in -- in the government, or -- and therefore sometimes they would tell you things that they wished they hadn't told you when they finally went to trial. </sentence><sentence id="1911">The trial in itself really wasn't decided, the specifics of it, until an agreement was reached I think sometime in July or August of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1912">Back in May when we were beginning to interrogate these men, nobody knew that there was going to be a trial, per se. </sentence><sentence id="1913">We knew that something was going to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1932">Q: But you didn't know what. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1934">A: But we had to get a lot more information before that decision could be reached. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And that was really the function of the detention center Ashcan in Luxembourg, to sort of gather information to assist the prosecuting staff in developing a case -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1936">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1937">A: -- which then would be s -- like a grand jury, yes? </sentence><sentence id="1938">A crime has been committed, so now this person is going to be tried for it. </sentence><sentence id="1939">A-And that is the -- the function. </sentence><sentence id="1940">And we were the investigators for the so-called grand jury, the war crimes commission. </sentence><sentence id="1941">Now in my case, in addition to getting these interrogation, I would -- I would go around and -- and collect gossip of what [indecipherable] and do them little favors, you know, if -- if the shoestring broke, I'd get them another shoestring. </sentence><sentence id="1942">Just little simple things, little toothpaste, a -- or if they had a problem, you know, I've a got a toothache, I'd arrange for the dentist to see them, and -- and in that way they - - they just started talking. </sentence><sentence id="1943">Never -- no, I shouldn't say never, seldom, about themselves, when it came to I'm guilty of this, or I'm guilty of that, or -- I knew about concentration camps, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="1944">But they would say, oh, Dachau, yeah, there was a place like -- ask so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1945">He was involved in that, a-and -- you know, this was the kind of leads that would help us in our interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1946">So our summer travail -- travails in -- in Luxembourg was primarily to get to know the prisoners, their character, their personalities, which would help the prosecutors in developing their approach when they tried them, and also for historical purposes. </sentence><sentence id="1947">We had a lot of historic war cri -- war department commissioned historians who wanted to interrogate these prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1948">So many times we would have a -- a professor from the Hoover Institute or some other think tank, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1949"> who was working on a particular aspect of the war history that would come and we would interrogate on their behalf, they would sit in on it, but they couldn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1950">And we would interrogate the prisoner, and get the information they wanted for their historical prese -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1951">Q: And how would you explain that visit to the prisoner, just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1952">A: We tell them the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1953">Say this man is an historian -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1954">Q: And then when -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1955">A: -- and he's writing the history of the tank -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1956">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1957">A: -- as used by the German command. </sentence><sentence id="1958">A-And the -- the tactics that Rommel used in -- in Africa, or Goodarian in his tank warfare. </sentence><sentence id="1959">And oh yes, they"! </sentence><sentence id="1960">tell you all about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1981"> encompasses everybody who was anybody in the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="1982">They would stay with us maybe a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1983">We had another place near Wiesbaden, it was called Dustbin. </sentence><sentence id="1984">And somebody had a good sense of humor, between Ashcan and Dustbin, I like to say we all got a lot of trash between Ashcan and Dustbin. </sentence><sentence id="1985">So somebody at -- at Wiesbaden would -- would want to interrogate a certain prisoner we had in Mondorf and we -- that prisoner would be with us, and then we'd se -- Albert Speer, for instance, Speer was traveling all over Europe because people in Paris wanted to interrogate him and then he was up in Wiesbaden and then he went somewhere else, some other installation. </sentence><sentence id="1986">Wherever we had a military unit working on something particularly interesting for that prisoner, we'd move him out. </sentence><sentence id="1987">So, nevertheless, the prisoners were divided into three distinct categories. </sentence><sentence id="1988">We had members of the German general's staff. </sentence><sentence id="1989">A field marshall -- a generale fieldmarshall, General Fieldmarshall Keitel, the chief of the armed forces high command, the equivalent to Colin Powell as the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, in that position. </sentence><sentence id="1990">He was undoubtedly the highest ranking of the Nazi generals. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And I call him a Nazi general because he was a member of the general's staff who was a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1992">He wouldn't have been the ch -- with his limited ability, he would never have been the chairman or the -- not chairman, but the -- the commander in chief of the armed forces high command if he hadn't been a Nazi and ardent Hitler supporter. </sentence><sentence id="1993">So we had Keitel. </sentence><sentence id="1994">His deputy, Jodl, generale august Jodl, Alfred Jodl, was the chief of operations. </sentence><sentence id="1995">Under Jod1 it was Warlimont, Walter Warlimont, who was my special project when I worked on the history of that German general staff. </sentence><sentence id="1996">He was very cooperative. </sentence><sentence id="1997">He was Colonel Geito, who commanded the [indecipherable] during the Spanish revolution when the German -- German army was in -- a German military was supporting Franco in -- in Spain. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1998">He was a very interesting guy, spoke English fluently, had married an American girl whom he had met when he was attendin -- attending our army war college in 1928, and he -- he was a very </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1999"> helpful individual. </sentence><sentence id="2000">He was present at the attempted assassination of Hitler on July 20", deg44, and was seriously wounded, a brain injury. </sentence><sentence id="2001">So he had a medical discharge, which saved him from becoming one of the people -- probably he would have been tried at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2002">But he got a medical discharge and he was out of it after July 20", "44. </sentence><sentence id="2003">So a lot of the things that happened later on during the war, the -- the real war crimes, the violations of -- of the Warsaw Treaty and Geneva Convention, u -- Warlimont was out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2004">Now he was very cooperative and he helped us in -- in many ways, and I mention in my book an expedition I made with him to get an connection with the history of the general's staff, and -- and Warlimont was -- was a big help to me in gathering information. </sentence><sentence id="2005">And he was never tried. </sentence><sentence id="2006">And in fact, he was rele -- re -- released after a couple of months at Nuremberg and wasn't even around when the trials started. </sentence><sentence id="2007">Well, then there was General Blaskowitz, and there was von Woonstadt, leader of the Battle of the Bulge, von Blumberg, a former chief of staff. </sentence><sentence id="2008">These were members of the German general staff, career, high ranking, elite. </sentence><sentence id="2009">In some cases men of principle because they belonged to the highest social class you but -- you could belong to in Germany, the ger -- genralshtapper, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2010">But with a few exceptions, they were not necessarily in sympathy with the Nazi way of doing things, at least as far as we could tell. </sentence><sentence id="2011">I don't think we could ever link von Blumberg, who was a victim of -- of Hitler's doings -- von Blumberg was kicked out on a manufactured story and Keitel took his place because Keitel polished the apple and did what Hitler wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2012">You couldn't hold those guys responsible for the atrocities because they really were not a part of that. [ </sentence><sentence id="2013">indecipherable] wouldn't have been tried under those circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="2014">So they were very cooperative in working with us, and if you did come to a point where you were discussing war crimes, or tried to weave them into the atrocity aspect, their answer was always, hey, I was just a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="2015">I -- I followed command. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Keitel is the guy who was the -- the chief of the armed forces high command, talk to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2017"> him. </sentence><sentence id="2018">The admirals, Grand Admiral Doenitz, who was the successor to Hitler and Grand Admiral Raeder, commander in chief the German navy, were part of this, they were members of the German general's staff, and they were in that category. </sentence><sentence id="2019">In the second group we had what I call the real Nazi trash. </sentence><sentence id="2020">The leader of which, of course, would be Julius Streicher, the Jew baiter, who prided himself of being a racist. </sentence><sentence id="2021">And he, to the very end he was beating his chest with pride, I'm -- I'm the leading racist, I'm -- I'm a [indecipherable] he called himself a [indecipherable] minister. </sentence><sentence id="2022">Hasa, the word -- German for hate, and rasa, the word for race, of course, y-you could just see that in -- in Streicher right from the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2023">Streicher, gaolighter Franconia, publisher, editor, pornographic anti-Semitic newspaper, Der Sturmer. </sentence><sentence id="2024">Robert Ley, Labor front leader, who succeeded in strangling himself before the trials began. </sentence><sentence id="2025">Leader of the arbeitsfront, the German labor front. </sentence><sentence id="2026">You couldn't get a job in Germany without belonging to the labor front. </sentence><sentence id="2027">Fritz Sauckel, who was the procurement officer for bringing in slave labor to work in Albert Speer's factories and mines and munitions industries and to build up the war machine and maintain it during the war. </sentence><sentence id="2028">Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who betrayed Austria, later became the military governor of the Netherlands. </sentence><sentence id="2029">Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader. </sentence><sentence id="2030">Hans Frank, the butcher of Poland, governor general of Poland, who was willing to admit that he signed the documents responsible for the execution of more than two and a half million Jews in -- in Auschwitz and Birkenau and the other camps in Poland, for which he had the responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="2031">And in this particular case, confessed it, admitted it. </sentence><sentence id="2032">Let's see, in that category were men like Kaltenbrunner, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the successor to the hangman Heydrich, who had -- was assassinated in Czechoslovakia as you know. </sentence><sentence id="2033">I mentioned Hans Frank -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2034">Q: Rosenberg -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2035">A: -- some others come -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2067">A: They were opportunists. </sentence><sentence id="2068">They went with whatever political wind was blowing. </sentence><sentence id="2069">So when you take all these people, put them under one roof, you get a real mix, and y-you -- you tend to have a cliquish development, where they just set off in groups by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2070">And that, from the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2071"> psychology of interrogation was very much in our favor, because we just played one off against the other. </sentence><sentence id="2072">We wanted to know about the generals, they told us all they knew about the Nazis. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2073">And if we wanted to know about the Nazis we asked the -- the statesmen, or vice versa, we could -- and in that respect they were more cooperative than we wanted them to be because it just made us work that much harder. </sentence><sentence id="2074">I mean, the more information we got, the harder we had to work in writing it all up. </sentence><sentence id="2075">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2076">Q: After you're there for a couple of weeks doing this, is -- does this wear on you, having to talk with these folks? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2077">A: Definite -- definitely so. </sentence><sentence id="2078">And it got to the point where just living in the same building with them was a real hardship and soon, within three or four weeks after I got there, we moved out. </sentence><sentence id="2079">And we would just come to work in the morning, do our interrogation, and our -- our write-ups and do our office work and then at five o'clock go home, and -- unless we had a visitor that we had an evening interrogation with a special commission coming up. </sentence><sentence id="2080">A-And -- and that was necessary for your own state of mind because frankly, you got -- you got tired of the smell of it all. </sentence><sentence id="2081">It was -- even in -- in what used to be a luxury hotel, it had a prison smell, most of all because sanitary conditions weren't such that these guys could take a shower every morning, and they didn't have fresh clothing to put on. </sentence><sentence id="2082">You know, they were wearing, a lot of times, the clothes that they were taken prisoner in, and months later they're still wearing the same clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2083">Now we did try to -- we had a prison laundry, but the laundry service wasn't exactly a resort hotel style. </sentence><sentence id="2084">That whole atmosphere, you never really had the privacy. </sentence><sentence id="2085">You couldn't just walk from my office in room 32, I couldn't just walk down a hall and go to Captain Sensnik's office without meeting one of the prisoners maybe along the way who wanted to gripe about something, or had a question about something, or who wanted something. </sentence><sentence id="2086">And you kind of got tired of seeing them. </sentence><sentence id="2087">They're under foot all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2088">So we needed to get away. </sentence><sentence id="2089">That definitely was -- was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And in my case, personally, because I was playing this role of welfare officer, I was seeing more of them than the other officers were. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Consequently, you had the wearing -- wearing thin happened a lot quicker with me, probably, than it did with the others. </sentence><sentence id="2092">But we all had the same feeling. </sentence><sentence id="2093">If I never see another Nazi again I'll be perfectly happy. </sentence><sentence id="2094">That was sort of the -- the slogan we all adopted there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2114">Q: But you also had to appear kind of sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="2115">You were not just asking questions and trying to get answers. </sentence><sentence id="2116">You were creating an atmosphere so that they would trust you. </sentence><sentence id="2117">That puts you in a -- almost a schizophrenic situation, that's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2118">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Yeah, that wa -- that was the other as -- especially in cases where families who were involved. </sentence><sentence id="2120">Now I did visit -- I didn't begin to visit, actually, families, until we moved out of Luxembourg and went to Oberhausen. </sentence><sentence id="2121">And a part of the group went to Oberhausen, mostly the general officers and then others went directly to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2122">Then I went from Oberhausen to -- excuse me, to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2123">But during that period, when I started seeing families with children, even Edda Goering and -- and Herman Goering would write a letter to his daughter, and I would read his letter to his daughter sitting on my lap, and that had to get to me, and -- but the difficulty -- and I think this is where our training at Richie was emphatic, on this don't get personally involved. </sentence><sentence id="2124">Don't show sympathy, don't show understanding even in body language. </sentence><sentence id="2125">And we were trying not to agree, not to nod your head when they made one of their profound statements which might make them think, he agrees with me. </sentence><sentence id="2126">He would have done the same thing if he were in my shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2127">You had to avoid giving them an opportunity to transfer their doings to you -- their -- their philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="2128">In other words, yeah, he may be the enemy, but he agrees with me, cause I saw him nod his head, or I saw him smile when I said that. </sentence><sentence id="2129">So we had to learn to be very impersonal and </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2142"> stone faced, and not to let ourselves be moved by -- by what they -- they said, or what they sometimes did. </sentence><sentence id="2143">So body language is very important in talking to them, especially someone -- I -- I -- I like to move my hands when I'm talking so it was very difficult to -- to sort of sit still and -- and -- and just listen. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Little things, like Herr Streicher, a man who couldn't talk for five minutes - - oh, two minutes, without becoming anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Every conversation would lead into his hatred of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2146">Whether he thought that sometimes you felt like giving him a real argument, or even punching him in the mouth, because his conversation could rub you the wrong way. </sentence><sentence id="2147">He was a foul mouth to begin with, a-and his -- his language was just uncouth. </sentence><sentence id="2148">So that was difficult to just tolerate. </sentence><sentence id="2149">But that same man, when his wife Adele came to the prison, and I told him -- your wife -- now, they couldn't have visitors, and this happened in Nuremberg, not -- not in Luxembourg, but I take that out of sequence here. </sentence><sentence id="2150">I told him, your wife is here, what do you want me to tell her? </sentence><sentence id="2151">And our purpose for being -- for playing this role was to get information. </sentence><sentence id="2152">We wanted to know more about th-the prisoner, about his family. </sentence><sentence id="2153">Sometimes the wife would tell us -- tell us things about his activities that he hadn't revealed, just through a short, 10 minute visit. </sentence><sentence id="2154">When I told him his wife was there, and that's the only time she came to visit, he gave me a message for her, telling me she should visit hospitals and visit the sick and do whatever she could to help any orphan children. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Well, he was obviously playing up to me. </sentence><sentence id="2156">I don't -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2157">Q: This was Streicher? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2158">A: Streicher. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2162">A: 1-- I can't believe that he really was that concerned, because if -- if you read my report on him, he's not the kind of a guy who would worry about orphans. </sentence><sentence id="2163">But then he suddenly walked up to me, and he put his arm on my -- my -- his hand on my arm right here. </sentence><sentence id="2164">And he just held it there    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2165"> for a moment and I didn't know what to make of this because we had no physical contact, we never shook hands, and we never addressed them by their -- their titles, it was always Herr Streicher. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And they very seldom knew our names, even so that they couldn't call us by name, unless they specifically asked, then you told them your name, but we used false names anyhow. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2167">But he put his hand right here on my arm and for a moment I didn't know what to make of this, and he held it there. </sentence><sentence id="2168">And then he stepped back and he said, "When you see my wife, tell her to put her hand in the same place on your arm, so we can be -- so we can be close to each other." </sentence><sentence id="2169">Now, that sort of thing haunts you because it comes from a man who you've already decided, hard-hearted, cold, the originator of the Nuremberg Laws, his pornographic, anti-Semitic newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="2170">But then a gesture like that catches you completely unawares. </sentence><sentence id="2171">And -- and there were incidents like that in their correspondence or their conversation where you -- you had to really steel yourself to avoid being sympathetic or giving the impression that yeah, I think you have a point. </sentence><sentence id="2172">I agree with you. </sentence><sentence id="2173">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2174">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2175">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2183">A: Well actually, that aspect of it, to me personally, didn't come to light -- now, two of my colleagues were Jewish, two of about five officers. </sentence><sentence id="2184">And one of them had lost his -- his parents at Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2185">He knew, he -- he knew the sa -- a-and -- and the -- the tales he -- but his knowledge of it was limited to his own family experience. </sentence><sentence id="2186">He had no idea of what -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2419">Q: -- to start talking about Wilhelm Frick -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2420">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2421">Q: -- and your experience with him, what kind of a person was he, and what was your experience in talking with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2423">A: He was a nonentity, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="2424">And even the Nazis considered him a -- a nobody. </sentence><sentence id="2425">He was powerful because, you know, the Minister of the Interior in Germany, even today in -- in many European governments, is in charge of the police force, and has a lot more power than the Secretary of the Interior does in -- in -- comparatively in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2426">So the Minister of the Interior was truly a -- an important position. </sentence><sentence id="2427">But once Hitler became the fuehrer, when he was -- you know, Hitler held three jobs. </sentence><sentence id="2428">He was the fuehrer, that's the leader of the Nazi party, that was really the title fuehrer, and the one that he preferred, which incidentally Streicher gave him. </sentence><sentence id="2429">When they first met, in a beer hall in -- in Munich, and Streicher, who was the leader of an anti- Semitic faction in Nuremberg, heard about this labor party group in Munich, which was headed by Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="2430">And he went to Munich to hear this man Hitler, about whom he had heard, speak. </sentence><sentence id="2431">And he describes in his testimony, he thought he actually saw a halo around his head, he thought this is the Messiah, this is the man who is going to ser -- s-save Germany, whereupon he went to Hitler, and said, "You are my fuehrer. </sentence><sentence id="2432">I will follow you, and everything I have is yours." </sentence><sentence id="2433">In his famous words. </sentence><sentence id="2434">And Streicher was one of the few members of the inner party who could dootz Hitler, address him in the familiar German du. </sentence><sentence id="2435">Streicher was one of the few who cou -- even Goering didn't have that power, but Streicher could -- could do that. </sentence><sentence id="2436">And Hitler liked that fuehrer business, and it was Streicher, at their first meeting, who suggested it to him. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And it was the union of those two parties from Nuremberg and from Munich that made the -- the dare -- day ap -- the deutsche arbeit party of Munich a national deutsche arbeit party, because the two communities merged, thanks to Streicher, which was why Streicher was particularly dear to Hitler, and considered him very close, and vice versa. </sentence><sentence id="2438">Well, Frick was important at -- at the beginning, and he was a -- I think he wanted to be the police, or he was the police commissioner in -- in Munich at the time of the putsch. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And he was active in Hitler's political endeavors, and of course became one of the followers. </sentence><sentence id="2440">And then he was elected to the Reichstag and Hitler became chancellor and named him Minister of the Interior. </sentence><sentence id="2441">But then when Himmler came into the play, and took over the Gestapo and the -- the -- the SS and all -- all the police duties and the security services went to Himmler and Frick really had nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="2442">He -- his position was strictly a -- up until beyond 1935, he -- he was really nobody. </sentence><sentence id="2443">He really did -- didn't have much of a -- a role, and colorless, sort of a -- a gray aura about him. </sentence><sentence id="2444">His whole appearance, gray hair, gray face and gray clothes, he -- he was just -- in a bunch of people, he would never stand out. </sentence><sentence id="2445">Even if there were only two people in a room, he wouldn't stand out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2470">Q: Did he admit to being a racist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2472">A: He wa -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2473">Q: Did he admit to being a racist? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2474">A: Well, ya -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2475">Q: Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2476">A: Yeah, well, yeah -- yes -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2477">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2478">A: -- but it was legal. </sentence><sentence id="2479">You see, i-it was -- everything he did was legal. </sentence><sentence id="2480">He -- he was the -- a legal interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="2481">And yes, of course the Jews had to be done away with because that was the law, and the Nuremberg laws, and no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="2482">Now, if you say, did you have anything to do with the concentration camp -- which incidentally was not a question we -- I don't remember -- I don't think I ever asked it of anybody, cause I really didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2483">I -- I just -- wasn't in my -- I think with Streicher, it -- it had to come up, as I recall, o-of his -- of his own volition. </sentence><sentence id="2484">Where he would bring it up, but never the details, as far as people being abused or starved. </sentence><sentence id="2485">The concentration camp, as Streicher explained it to me, is very simple. </sentence><sentence id="2486">Here were these communists, and these communists were causing a lot of problems -- I'm giving Streicher's explanation. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And so when the big election came along, at which time Hitler was to be the plebiscite, when Hitler was to be the supreme being, the fuehrer of the political party and then the chancellor of the German Reich, which ran the government, and then the president of the German Reich, after Hindenburg. </sentence><sentence id="2488">So he was president, chancellor and fuehrer. </sentence><sentence id="2489">Political, organizational and ceremonial. </sentence><sentence id="2490">So he really had three jobs under the title of fuehrer. </sentence><sentence id="2491">Well, when all of this came into being, the communists had to be concentrated out of sight so that they couldn't cause any problems. </sentence><sentence id="2492">They were having demonstrations and disrupting political meetings, and the communists were causing problems. </sentence><sentence id="2493">So they were put into school buildings and even some abandoned factories, as a temporary measure to concentrate them out of sight where we could concentrate -- keep our eyes on them. </sentence><sentence id="2494">Then, after the election, and Hitler came to power, it was just convenient to keep them there. </sentence><sentence id="2495">It turned out that many of the communists were Jews, so it was natural for those communists, and those Jews to end up in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2496">But you couldn't keep them in these temporary facilities, so he had to build facilities for them. </sentence><sentence id="2497">And this is how Dachau came into being a concentration camp, to bring these people together from the school building and factories where they were tentatively kept, and put them into one camp. </sentence><sentence id="2498">That of course was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2499">The ultimate solution, of course was, as the camps grew bigger and more and more people ended up in them, and the problem of feeding them, and they could no longer buy their way out of Germany by surrendering their property to the German regime, they had to come up with a final solution, the final solution was extermination. </sentence><sentence id="2500">And that, of course is when Birkenau and -- and Auschwitz and the others came in -- into being. </sentence><sentence id="2501">And that was the whole pattern. </sentence><sentence id="2502">Now Streicher took responsibility only up to when the camps were built, like Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="2503">And then points out that he actually at Christmastime, as a Christmas gift, a humane gesture on his part, to prove what a big heart he had, he actually arranged for the release of some of these people from concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2504">Communists, never Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2505">He never arranged for a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2506">And this -- I'm quoting him now, how proud he was, "Nobody could ever accuse me of letting a Jew out of a concentration camp." </sentence><sentence id="2507">That had to be put in. </sentence><sentence id="2508">That was part of his -- his make-up. </sentence><sentence id="2509">But he had a Christmas party and he would invite the families of these people that he was releasing from the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And they didn't know it, the families didn't know what was going to happen, neither did the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2511">They were suddenly whisked away to some gym, or some public building, then the doors would be opened, and the families, and the -- the inmates would come together. </sentence><sentence id="2512">And you know, nine out of 10 of those would become members of the Nazi party in appreciation. </sentence><sentence id="2513">And this is why he did it, because he was the goodwill -- a lot of these communists became Nazis after he released them from the concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2552">Q: That's what he told you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2554">A: That was one of his accomplishments and -- and that was really his motivation, but he never let Jews out. </sentence><sentence id="2555">That was his kins -- his principles. </sentence><sentence id="2556">Well, Fr-Frick, as I said, his role in all of this was that he merely -- his job was to write the laws, interpret the laws as Minister of the Interior, and to follow those laws. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And nothing he did was ever illegal, according to him, he always followed the law. </sentence><sentence id="2558">So he did not -- couldn't understand why he was being put in with all these other people who were -- who -- who went beyond the law, obviously, because that resulted in all the atrocities. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2565">Q: How about Herman Goering? </sentence><sentence id="2566">Let -- let me quote -- quote you from your autobiography, you said he was the easiest Nazi to interrogate. </sentence><sentence id="2567">He was able, shrewd manager, brilliant and brave, tuthless and grasping. </sentence><sentence id="2568">At times almost a pleasure to be with, at other times a pain in the ass. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2573">A: Exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2575">Q: But it was always interesting to be with him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2577">A: Yup, well that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2578">Q: How about [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2579">A: -- that -- that is it in -- and I've saved that characterization because it -- it still fits in retrospect, looking back on it. </sentence><sentence id="2580">And first of all, Goering did not fit any of the three categories that I mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="2581">Nor was he accepted in those three categories. </sentence><sentence id="2582">Now, he was president of the Reichstag, which would put him in with the bureaucracy, wouldn't it? </sentence><sentence id="2583">With the government, the secretaries and the ministers. </sentence><sentence id="2584">Well, they didn't accept him. </sentence><sentence id="2585">They didn't want him. </sentence><sentence id="2586">He was not really one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2587">So he was shut out of that group, von Popham, and -- and Meisner, Selta, those, they wanted nothing to do with him. </sentence><sentence id="2588">First of all, because he was promoted over their heads. </sentence><sentence id="2589">They were the men with experience and everything else, and here he -- overnight, he became the president of the Reichstag, he wasn't really one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2590">Military man, yes, seven star general, Reichsmarshall, the highest military rank ever attained by anybody in history, except Hannibal maybe. </sentence><sentence id="2591">But he wasn't mem -- a member of the German general's staff. </sentence><sentence id="2592">He -- he was never considered the -- the red stripe of the generale's staff. </sentence><sentence id="2593">So they didn't accept him, none of the generals wanted anything to do with him. </sentence><sentence id="2594">I mean, imagine a guy who, you know, who comes from the rank of a -- a lieutenant in the riktorfin squadron suddenly becomes a seven star    Reichsmarshall of the Reich. </sentence><sentence id="2595">And so there was jealousy and there was lack of respect and they never took him seriously. </sentence><sentence id="2596">And incompetence. </sentence><sentence id="2597">Goering was not a very competent man in a sense of organization and -- he -- he could talk a big show, but he could never deliver the goods. </sentence><sentence id="2598">He really wasn't a producer. </sentence><sentence id="2599">So he was resented by the military and he wasn't accepted. </sentence><sentence id="2600">And he didn't really fit into the Nazi element because he was above them all. </sentence><sentence id="2601">He was strutting in his uniforms and make -- making himself super rich by his acquisitions of art and [indecipherable] and special train. </sentence><sentence id="2602">And then of course the -- the four year plan and the Herman Goering werker. </sentence><sentence id="2603">So he's also an industrialist, in addition to being the huntmaster of Germany, in addition to being the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe. </sentence><sentence id="2604">So the other Nazis never considered him part of their group, even though he had participated in the putsch. </sentence><sentence id="2605">So he's pretty much isolated. </sentence><sentence id="2606">He really wasn't accepted. </sentence><sentence id="2607">Plus, the conflict between Doenitz and Goering. </sentence><sentence id="2608">Hitler in his last will and testament specified that Doenitz, Grand Admiral Doenitz was to be -- to take his place and become the president or whatever, of the Reich, of the fourth Reich. </sentence><sentence id="2609">But as far as Goering was concerned, he was designated to be Hitler's successor, and it was only because Bormann either misinterpreted or withheld Goering's last message to Hitler from the [indecipherable] Salzburg to Berlin, which resulted in Hitler condemning Goering and supposedly sentencing him to death, to be assassinated by the -- by -- executed by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="2610">That really wasn't Hitler's doing, that was Bormann, who intercepted the letters and acted not on Hitler's behalf, but on his own behalf. </sentence><sentence id="2611">So as far as Goering was concerned, he was still the president of the class. </sentence><sentence id="2612">And this group photo I have, who sits in the middle? </sentence><sentence id="2613">The president of the class. </sentence><sentence id="2614">Who is the successor, Doenitz? </sentence><sentence id="2615">He's in the back row. </sentence><sentence id="2616">Well, those two fought each other all the time, never face to face, but to us they say, well Goering did this wrong, he did that wrong, and he's a nobody and then of course, Doenitz didn't do this and didn't do that right. </sentence><sentence id="2617">So that contest was going on all the time, competing for each other for the crown under those circumstances, which was amusing. </sentence><sentence id="2618">Now Goering personally then, to be with him was -- was -- the nice part was, when you left Goering, if you got bored with his pomposity and his braggadocio, you could just say, well Herr Goering, I -- [have to leave now, I have another appointment. </sentence><sentence id="2619">And as far as he was concerned, that's okay, I let you go now, I'm giving you permission to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2620">He was always condescending. </sentence><sentence id="2621">He never -- he never acted like he was a prisoner in -- he was always in charge. </sentence><sentence id="2622">When you went to interrogate him, you were visiting him. </sentence><sentence id="2623">It wasn't interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="2624">Or when he came to your room for an interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="2625">Sometimes an interrogation was done out in the gar -- on the garden. </sentence><sentence id="2626">We'd go for a walk together in the hotel gardens and talk. </sentence><sentence id="2627">But it was always, I'm free to talk to you now, you can come and see me. </sentence><sentence id="2628">Or I'll give you an appointment at one o'clock this afternoon for a visit to your room. </sentence><sentence id="2629">So he dismissed you and welcomed you always as the Reichsmarshall on [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2630">Secondly, you -- you had to take that with a grain of salt and that's part of the game. </sentence><sentence id="2631">Secondly, he had a terrific sense of humor, he really did. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And he enjoyed himself tremendously, h-his own jokes. </sentence><sentence id="2633">He could laugh harder at his own jokes than anybody I knew. </sentence><sentence id="2634">And I think I mentioned in my book that he had a collection of jokes being told about him in the underground, which he collected, he had written up in a little ba -- joke book. </sentence><sentence id="2635">And occasionally, if he was in the mood, he would produce his little book and that reminded him of a story, and he would tell you a joke out of his -- his little book. </sentence><sentence id="2636">Sometimes off-color jokes, but always with himself as the butt of the joke. </sentence><sentence id="2637">If you were caught telling a joke like that in Germany, that was good for six months in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2638">But he collected the joke and -- and save it. </sentence><sentence id="2639">He was able to laugh at himself, which is a strange thing to say about a man who took himself very, very seriously, and who spent every living moment making sure that you knew that he was really the leading Nazi and he was really in charge. </sentence><sentence id="2640">And he did this and did that, and he was one of the few who admitted building this and building that, and this was really his responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="2641">He accomplished that; I, Herman Goering. </sentence><sentence id="2642">Yet, he could tell jokes about himself if he was in the mood. </sentence><sentence id="2643">He had to be in the mood; he was a very moody person. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Part of which was due to the fact he's a drug addict. </sentence><sentence id="2645">He took paracodeine tablets -- well, the numbers differ. </sentence><sentence id="2646">Some writers say a hundred tablets a day. </sentence><sentence id="2647">I would say that was a little bit much. </sentence><sentence id="2648">But he -- he chewed them like M&amp;M's. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And he had a pocket full. </sentence><sentence id="2650">He actually arrived with -- with a box. </sentence><sentence id="2651">I think he confiscated all the paracodeine in Germany before he was taken prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2652">And these were tablets that he just chewed. </sentence><sentence id="2653">One individual tablet probably very weak, but four or five would have the effect of a Valium, and he would take a handful and just chew on them, and then maybe a half an hour later, take another handful. </sentence><sentence id="2654">And we guessed that he consumed -- by Dr. Flicker, who was the German doctor, and we had an American doctor as well, estimated that he was taking between 60 and 80 a day of -- of these little paracodeine tablets, about the size of M&amp;Ms. </sentence><sentence id="2655">They broke him of the habit, with his cooperation, by reducing the dosage. </sentence><sentence id="2656">At first he didn't realize they were doing it, and then gradually he participated, and then willingly, and almost proudly, to the extent that he lost weight, he lost 80 pounds while in prison, and actually began to feel pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="2657">As he would say, prison life was good for my health, and -- because he lost weight and said that physically he felt better after six months in Mondorf and Nuremberg than he had ever in his adult life, ever since the time of the putsch when he became morphine addicted, so -- but all the time that he was in the Reich, he was, of course, was a morphine addict, and went into the tank from time to time to be dried out and to take the cure. </sentence><sentence id="2658">And this paracodeine was a way of -- of setting that. </sentence><sentence id="2659">And when they broke him of the habit, he really -- by the time the trials began, he was in pretty good shape, compared to the flab that he was when he first was taken prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2660">Now, other times, if he was in a bad mood, we just stayed away from him because he wouldn't cooperate, he wouldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="2661">He would just say, "I don't feel like talk -- talking today, and -- I'm not interested, I don't want to talk to you today." </sentence><sentence id="2662">And that was it, nothing you could do about it. </sentence><sentence id="2663">He was afraid of thunder and lightning. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2780">A: Li-Literally cowed by it, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2781">One amusing anecdote, which is part of my pattern of circles, I -- [ tell in my book and is worth repeating, because it's quite significant. </sentence><sentence id="2782">As I said, Goering was pretty much isolated by the others, with the result that most frequently he would eat by himself, sometimes by choice because all the -- all the other guys were eating there, but here is where the Reichsmarshall eats. </sentence><sentence id="2783">When he did eat with somebody else, it would usually be because he wanted to discuss some important matter that came to mind. </sentence><sentence id="2784">Then he would actually make an appointment for lunch with -- or -- or dinner with -- with the people. </sentence><sentence id="2785">Well, we took turns, the duty officer on occasion, like the meal times. </sentence><sentence id="2786">And I happened to be duty officer, you know, during a dinner -- lunch time, once. </sentence><sentence id="2787">And as I said, we had ordinary German prisoners who delivered -- who prepared the food and -- and serve it. </sentence><sentence id="2788">And this German -- ex-German corporal, I think he was, who was a regular prisoner of war, worked in the kitchen, served -- came in. </sentence><sentence id="2789">And I happened to be standing near Goering's table when he sat down and this man brought plate of stew, set it before Goering on a heavy porcelain dish, no knives or forks permitted, they -- they ate with spoo -- they ate with the spoons and all the food that was prepared was spoonable. </sentence><sentence id="2790">They didn't need a knife to cut their food, there were stews and things of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="2791">1600 calories a day, no more. </sentence><sentence id="2792">That was prescribed by the Geneva Convention. </sentence><sentence id="2793">This man set the plate of stew before Goering and Goering looked at it and smelled it, then he pushed it aside. </sentence><sentence id="2794">And then he growled at this PW, he said, "Take that slop away. </sentence><sentence id="2795">I fed my dog much better than that back home." </sentence><sentence id="2796">And this PW took the plate of stew, and stepped back and he clicked his heels and bowed, and he said, "In that case, Herr Reichsmarshall, your dog ate much better than we German soldiers did." </sentence><sentence id="2797">Made an about face and walked out. </sentence><sentence id="2798">Well, that was quite a memorable occasion. </sentence><sentence id="2799">Forty years later, "m the ambassador in Luxembourg and the city of Mondorf decided to make me an honorary citizen of Mondorf, which is quite an honor over there, because the -- I don't know what -- what you get for it. </sentence><sentence id="2800">I think you don't get arrested if you speed, or you can park any place you want to. </sentence><sentence id="2801">Whatever, I've never taken advantage of it, but they have a street named for me, which -- which is great, I think that's a real thrill because every day somebody is mentioning my name. </sentence><sentence id="2802">They've got to -- you know, if they're arrested, or have groceries shipped to them, or apply for a driver's license, where do you live? </sentence><sentence id="2803">They've got to name me and so that's a -- that's an everlasting honor that's going to be there as long as the street is. </sentence><sentence id="2804">But I became an honorary citizen, they had a big ceremony, the mayor, and the town council and the boy scouts and girl scouts and the village band, everybody was out. </sentence><sentence id="2805">And Winnie and I arrived in the embas - - embassy car with the American flag, embassy flag. </sentence><sentence id="2806">One of those nice ego trips, of which we had many. </sentence><sentence id="2807">And we stepped out and they played the national anthems of both countries and -- and then the mayor, with his red, white and blue sash, his symbol of rank. </sentence><sentence id="2808">And we had a [indecipherable] there. </sentence><sentence id="2809">And then we met some -- met some of the other guests, including a man who was very Germanic in his approach, you know, the stiff legged, head bowing. </sentence><sentence id="2810">And he introduced himself as Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz, and he was a special guest because he had asked to be invited to this occasion because he had read in the paper that the American ambassador was a former interrogator and was being honored in Mondorf as an honorary citizen. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And since he had been a PW at the installation at that particular time, he was sure that he knew the ambassador, although Dolibois didn't mean anything to him, he knew me as Gillen. </sentence><sentence id="2812">So then he came -- then when he saw my face, he began to put two and two together and says, that -- that -- that was Lieutenant Gillen, Oberloitman Gillen. </sentence><sentence id="2813">So he was pleased to meet me and -- and made a big show of who he was and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2814">Well, I was pleased to meet him too, and we started to make -- compare some notes. </sentence><sentence id="2815">Then he tapped me on the shoulder, and he said, "Mr. Ambassador, Herr [indecipherable]," he said, "do you remember the incident when a soldier served a plate of stew to Goering?" </sentence><sentence id="2816">And said, "That was me, Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz." </sentence><sentence id="2817">It's the same. </sentence><sentence id="2818">I didn't recognize him because he's 40 years older. </sentence><sentence id="2819">But that was Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz. </sentence><sentence id="2820">P-Pattern of circles. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2873">A: The tables had been turned. </sentence><sentence id="2874">I classify that as one of my ironic experiences. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2891">A: And he -- he had -- he had all the history. </sentence><sentence id="2892">He -- he knew -- and he could go back to concentration camps of long, long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="2893">You know, he never -- he was not anti-Semitic according to him. </sentence><sentence id="2894">It all depended who the Jew was. </sentence><sentence id="2895">If he was an eastern Jew from Czechoslovakia or Poland, that's different, we don't want them, get them out of Germany, get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="2896">Now don't kill them. </sentence><sentence id="2897">He didn't believe in killing them, but he believed in getting rid of them by hook or by crook, just get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="2898">Don't torture them, don't kill them. </sentence><sentence id="2899">That was not his idea, he says. </sentence><sentence id="2900">Now, if he was a German Jew, and had not committed any crime against the government, he very frequently said that he protected them. </sentence><sentence id="2901">In fact, there was some good -- some people in his household who were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2902">Even his successor, Milch, was part Jewish, and he succeeded him as commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, and he claimed that he was criticized for that because Milch is part Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2903">But in Germany, I say who is a Jew and who isn't a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2904">That was one of his bylines. </sentence><sentence id="2905">So, he was an interesting character, no matter how you -- how you sliced it, no matter what mood he was in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2921">Q: But at one point in -- in your autobiography, you said it wasn't difficult to get them to talk, but what was really difficult was to try to figure out what the truth was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2923">A: What the truth was, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2924">And -- and what was deliberate gossip. </sentence><sentence id="2925">They were -- they were just gossiping, or -- or were they really telling the truth. </sentence><sentence id="2926">The challenge in that was for us to try to learn as much -- what -- I can only speak for myself, to learn as much about the German general's staff before I interrogated somebody about the staff, so that I could tell when -- you know, when he was pulling my leg, or when he was just stretching a point. </sentence><sentence id="2927">Which meant doing homework before you even begin an interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="2928">And that was difficult because we knew very little. </sentence><sentence id="2929">We knew more about Frederick the Great and the German general's staff back in the 18" century, but we didn't know anything about the relationship of the German general's staff to the rise of Hitler, the role that they played in his coming to power, or the role that they played in execution and planning of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2930">And this is what we needed to learn, we -- that's what our homework is all about. </sentence><sentence id="2931">And that is where this man Warlimont proved very valuable to me. </sentence><sentence id="2932">It got to the point where if I had a sp-specific interrogation report about the general's staff to ask of Doenitz, for instance -- Jodl -- I never interrogated Jodl cause he was very uncooperative, yes or no. </sentence><sentence id="2933">Everything was yes or no. </sentence><sentence id="2934">And -- and he -- he just -- you never got much out of him. </sentence><sentence id="2935">I don't know who -- I don't know of anybody of the other interrogators ever got anything out of him. </sentence><sentence id="2936">He was a very strict soldier, name, rank and serial number, and he played that for all he was worth. </sentence><sentence id="2937">And as far as he was concerned, the prisoner of war and you didn't have a right to try him. </sentence><sentence id="2938">So, if I would interrogate Kesselring, or Blaskowitz, or one of those guys, I go to Warlimont first and ask him the same questions, by way of doing homework. </sentence><sentence id="2939">And then doing the interrogation and verifying what Warlimont had given me in relationship to the answers to the questions I was getting from the prisoner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2958">Q: So what has hap -- obviously before the Nuremberg trial, there must be a huge number of people looking over all the confiscated papers, the documents. </sentence><sentence id="2959">Now, is Jackson and some of the people working for him coming down to Mondorf and talking with you folks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2962">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2968">A: -- we didn't -- we didn't -- they separated legal staff and the military intelligence staff completely. </sentence><sentence id="2969">We were -- it is just like a private investigator working on a crime, and giving his information to the prosecutor. </sentence><sentence id="2970">But the -- the investigator then doesn't become part of the -- the process. </sentence><sentence id="2971">And that's pretty much the role we play. </sentence><sentence id="2972">We were investigating the character and -- and the people and the incidents and verifying. </sentence><sentence id="2973">A lot of our stuff was, do you recognize this document, do you know what it means? </sentence><sentence id="2974">Is that your signature, or is that Goering's signature as you know it? </sentence><sentence id="2975">That's -- that type of thing. </sentence><sentence id="2976">Then after we got to Nuremberg -- I did no interrogating at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2977">At -- at Nuremberg I was strictly -- first sent there to get the information that Ley had, who claimed that he had some important information that he would give only to me -- in a letter he sent to Lieutenant Gillen. </sentence><sentence id="2978">So I was sent to Nuremberg on -- on temporary assignment for six days to -- to get that from Ley. </sentence><sentence id="2979">And after that I was to come back home. </sentence><sentence id="2980">But meanwhile, unbeknownst to me, Colonel Andrews pulled strings to keep me in Nuremberg because I guess -- well, because it was comfortable to have -- have me around, cause I brought back his days of power in -- in Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="2981">In Nuremberg Andrews didn't have much clout because Jackson was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="2982">And except for guarding the prison, Andrews really had nothing to do with the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2983">For that matter, I don't think he ever -- he -- he didn't see the prisoners day by day, face -- eyeball to eyeball like he did in Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="2984">And he missed that, and he -- he really was a figurehead in -- in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2985">So he wanted his old team back, so he tried to keep me there. </sentence><sentence id="2986">And that was -- but he had to find something for me to do. </sentence><sentence id="2987">So I became special assistant to -- to him, to carry out his orders. </sentence><sentence id="2988">Well, he had no orders, he really had none, except let him know -- if you talk to these guys, let me know if they're committing suici -- trying to commit suicide, or if they're doing something unusual. </sentence><sentence id="2989">Like one guy who was -- who had been Himmler's chauffeur, who listened to the radio all the time, putting his ear to the [indecipherable] dial, I mean that kind of stuff, and Andrews liked him, then it -- so then, in order to have something to do -- meanwhile, I was pulling strings to get out of Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2990">I was fed up with the whole operation, I didn't want any more of it. </sentence><sentence id="2991">And Andrews is trying to keep me, and we finally made a deal. </sentence><sentence id="2992">If I got somebody to succeed me, then I could go, and then he would stop trying to hold onto me; cause he needed me. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And that is when we got Gustav Gilbert. </sentence><sentence id="2994">I went through the Richie crowd, and Gilbert had been an interrogator, I think at Wiesbaden, so that when he came to Nuremberg -- he was a psychologist professionally and he got -- he had book written all over him before he came, and he was ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="2995">He had his book planned. </sentence><sentence id="2996">And -- and so Gilbert began to take over this visiting each prisoner in his cell. </sentence><sentence id="2997">And up to that point, the Rorschach analysis test came into play in that -- Major Douglas, Douglas Kelly was the prison psychiatrist. </sentence><sentence id="2998">He was a professional psychiatrist, whose job it was to test these prisoners, you get their IQ, their personality quirks, their state of mind. </sentence><sentence id="2999">Anything else that the inkblot test reveals. </sentence><sentence id="3000">A lot of these people were self-appointed. </sentence><sentence id="3001">Back in those days, really, for those first six months or so after the war, you could pretty much do what you wanted to do, and write your own orders cause everyb -- everybody's in turmoil. </sentence><sentence id="3002">And if you could just get somebody to say, okay, I'm appointing Lieutenant Dolibois chairman of the zoo, and I'd be chairman of the zoo. </sentence><sentence id="3003">So this guy Gilbert arrived -- Douglas arrives on the scene, and he's a prison psychiatrist, a-and he's primarily working for some institute, I think it was the Drexel Institute, to test these prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="3004">But the information would also be useful to the tribunal because it would help them understand. </sentence><sentence id="3005">So he became very important, prison psychiat -- except he couldn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="3006">So then they found out that I had majored in psychology in college, so I knew -- I knew that -- the terms, with the result I became the interpreter for the Rorschach analys -- which I loved, it was a lot of fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3048">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3050">A: And -- I just -- he gave the questions and I interpret -- translated and gave the answers. </sentence><sentence id="3051">And -- and then he would ask me to write what I thought after an interroga -- after an -- an interview, what'd you think of this? </sentence><sentence id="3052">And then I would write my layman's report of what I think the prisoner was like. </sentence><sentence id="3053">And then he combined that with his technological -- his -- his scientific analysis, and it made for a pretty intelligent report. </sentence><sentence id="3054">The layman could read his report, whereas if it had been all scientific, probably nothing would have -- not much would have come of -- and this is my first meeting with Hess, I had not interrogated Hess before, because he was in England. </sentence><sentence id="3055">So was my -- my meeting with Hess is strictly for the Rorschach analysis test. </sentence><sentence id="3056">And that was interesting, and of course on Goering and -- and Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="3057">And that opened up a whole new avenue of getting to know them from -- from that side, see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3067">Q: What did you learn that was different from doing these Rorschach tests than what you already knew, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3069">A: Well, our interrogation before was based on the questionnaires. </sentence><sentence id="3070">We were merely getting answers to what we were asked to get informa -- then, mine was supplemented by -- by me, when my -- my inquiring about their welfare, and how many children you have, and how is your wife, and where is your wife now, and where did you live. </sentence><sentence id="3071">What did you do before you became this. </sentence><sentence id="3072">That kind of gossip information. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3077">Q: Min-hm, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3079">A: And then the personality -- as I said, the gossip, who was sleeping with whom. </sentence><sentence id="3080">Who was having an affair with whose wife. </sentence><sentence id="3081">Bormann's thigh bones were actually abnormally short, did you know that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3085">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3087">A: Well, see now Buch told me that, I would never have known, that Bormann seldom appeared in public and seldom appeared in movies because he really was a little bit abnormal in his shorter thigh bone. </sentence><sentence id="3088">And Bormann also was quite an adulterer. </sentence><sentence id="3089">And Bormann had also made his wife into such a Nazi that she became estranged from her father and didn't speak to her father for decades. </sentence><sentence id="3090">Had absolutely nothing more to do with her father; that was Walter Buch. </sentence><sentence id="3091">And -- thanks to Bormann. </sentence><sentence id="3092">But that kind of gossip. </sentence><sentence id="3093">But that had nothing to do with the trial, that merely gave us a picture. </sentence><sentence id="3094">Now the Rorschach test then, gave us a complete characterization of the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="3095">First of all, the IQ. </sentence><sentence id="3096">The highest IQ was Hjalmar Schacht, who was close to genius. </sentence><sentence id="3097">Second highest Arthur Seyss-Inquart. </sentence><sentence id="3098">Third highest was Herman Goering. </sentence><sentence id="3099">He was a very intelligent man. </sentence><sentence id="3100">And then it went down on the line, all the way to the lowest IQ, was Julius Streicher with 106. </sentence><sentence id="3101">And so that -- that -- that was an interesting statistic. </sentence><sentence id="3102">Racial attitudes, Rosenberg, for instance, who was a -- a latvi -- you know, born in the Balkans -- in -- in Baltics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3119">Q: Baltics [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3120">A: You're not -- he was not a German. </sentence><sentence id="3121">Hess was born in Egypt, and never came to Germany til he was 15 years of old -- of age. </sentence><sentence id="3122">Hitler, to Hess, was a father image. </sentence><sentence id="3123">Hess, we learned -- this is the Rorschach test now, nobody told us these things, Hess was a man who was completely dependent on somebody else, he was not a man of his own, not a leader certainly, a follower. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3128">Always a good second in command, as long as somebody else told him what to do, he -- he was - - he was effective as a flunkie. </sentence><sentence id="3129">Keitel was in the same kind of a personality. </sentence><sentence id="3130">No leader, but -- but a -- a -- a good follower. </sentence><sentence id="3131">Hess was a flake, physically. </sentence><sentence id="3132">He had every ail -- ailment. </sentence><sentence id="3133">If he read an article about some disease, he ended up having it. </sentence><sentence id="3134">He saw every doctor, every quack in Germany about all the different ailments he had. </sentence><sentence id="3135">He took more pills, more medicines during his life -- he's a vegetarian. </sentence><sentence id="3136">When he was invited to dinner with Hitler he brought his own food, until Hitler finally forbade it, and wouldn't allow it any more because Hess, when I invite you to dinner, you eat the food I -- Hitler was a vegetarian too, but Hess was more of a vegetarian than Hitler, so he brought his own meal, his own food to a dinner at Hitler's home. </sentence><sentence id="3137">Well, that kind of information all revealed itself in the course of the Rorschach test. </sentence><sentence id="3138">Hess saw things in -- in the inkblots that other people never saw. </sentence><sentence id="3139">He -- he saw blood where somebody else saw valentines. </sentence><sentence id="3140">He -- it was all very fascinating. </sentence><sentence id="3141">Rosenberg -- I had a copy of Rosenberg's book out of the prison library. </sentence><sentence id="3142">His myth [indecipherable] the myth of -- "Myth of the Twentieth Century." </sentence><sentence id="3143">Not the mythos, mythis. </sentence><sentence id="3144">I wanted him to autograph it for me, and I asked him to autograph it for me, and I -- this is one of those memories -- memorable moments that stick out. </sentence><sentence id="3145">And he grabbed the book and actually put it behind his back, and says, "I can't let you have this." </sentence><sentence id="3146">Well, this is very amusing, and I said, "Why not?" </sentence><sentence id="3147">And he said, "Well, because when I wrote this book, I was looking for a new faith, a new belief, and I found it in writing the book. </sentence><sentence id="3148">And I'm afraid if you read this book -- and I found out that you're a good American officer, and you're a good Christian. </sentence><sentence id="3149">You'll read my book and you'll give up your faith and you'll give up your spirit of democracy, and you" ll accept my concepts of -- of the world, and I'll have that on my conscience." </sentence><sentence id="3150">Which -- thinking pretty much of his book. </sentence><sentence id="3151">But I promised that I would never read it, if he would just autograph it I'd have it as a souvenir. </sentence><sentence id="3152">So he did autograph it for me. </sentence><sentence id="3153">He didn't inscribe it, just A. Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="3154">I mentioned this to Hess. </sentence><sentence id="3155">I asked Hess if he had ever written a book. " </sentence><sentence id="3156">No, why do you ask?" </sentence><sentence id="3157">And I said, "Well, because I'm collecting books with autographs and I thought if you had one, I would look for it, and get your autograph." </sentence><sentence id="3158">And I told him about Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="3159">And his -- Hess said -- oh, I'm sorry, not he -- not Hess, Schacht -- Schirach, the you -- the youth leader, said that Rosenberg's book is the only bestseller that nobody has ever read, because it's a mish mosh of anti- Catholicism, anti-Christianity, anti-Semitism, anti everything that's decent [indecipherable] respect. </sentence><sentence id="3160">So that was von Schirach's answer to that particular incident. </sentence><sentence id="3161">He had never written a book either, Schirach. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3199">A: Yeah, th-tha -- there was a reason -- there was a reason for that. </sentence><sentence id="3200">I came through Rass on the day Jodl signed a surrender document, and -- surrendering unconditionally, and his signature was strictly Jodl, J-o-d-1. </sentence><sentence id="3201">And then under that, Generaloberst. </sentence><sentence id="3202">That was all. </sentence><sentence id="3203">But someone who was there, an at -- an historian, Colonel Hale, University of Virginia, mentioned this to me, and I thought, gee that's -- you know, I could have stopped in Rass and I could have seen Jodl. </sentence><sentence id="3204">Imagine -- I would have liked to have a -- see what the guy looked like. </sentence><sentence id="3205">This is before Luxembourg, so I didn't know I was going to end up in Luxembourg and actually live in the same building with Jodl for -- for months. </sentence><sentence id="3206">So when Jodl showed up in Luxembourg and everything, I thought, well here's -- I -- I'll get his autograph. </sentence><sentence id="3207">So I went to Jodl with a three by five card, and I asked him if he would sign this for me, like he signed the surrender. </sentence><sentence id="3208">And her accommodated me, Jodl, Generaloberst. </sentence><sentence id="3209">Then it occurred to me that I -- I had Jodl's, and I should have Keitel's, who signed the surrender on the eastern front, then I would have two. </sentence><sentence id="3210">And I had visions I'd frame it, have -- these are the signatures that appeared on the surrender that ended the war. </sentence><sentence id="3211">So I got Keitel's. </sentence><sentence id="3212">Well, apparently Keitel or Jodl told some of the other prisoners that I had asked them for an autograph. </sentence><sentence id="3213">I don't know why -- because when we were getting ready to move them from Luxembourg to Nuremberg, five or six of them came to me and said they'd like to give me their autograph. </sentence><sentence id="3214">Doenitz was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="3215">So they gave me their autograph on a piece of paper, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3216">So I became known as an autograph collector, and I really didn't have that in mind at all. </sentence><sentence id="3217">When I was sent [indecipherable] my commanding officer was Colonel Phelp, and on the occasion one time was having lunch with Colonel Phelp, and I told him about this. </sentence><sentence id="3218">I said, "Would you want to see the names of the -- the guys who signed the surrender document?" </sentence><sentence id="3219">And I showed them to Colonel Phelp. </sentence><sentence id="3220">He says, "Hey," he said, "that gives me an idea." </sentence><sentence id="3221">He said, "Why don't you get me the signatures of all those guys when you go to Nuremberg, next time you go to Nuremberg? </sentence><sentence id="3222">Get all their signatures and their photographs." </sentence><sentence id="3223">And he said, "I'Il make up a scrapbook, I'm going to give it to Eisenhower." </sentence><sentence id="3224">A scrapbook, a picture of each one of the high ranking Nazis and their autographs. </sentence><sentence id="3225">And I said okay, and that gave me an idea, I thought, well in that case, I'll get two autographs, I'll keep one for myself, and ["ll have a complete collection. </sentence><sentence id="3226">So that was my idea. </sentence><sentence id="3227">So that was my -- when I went to Nuremberg then to get -- to -- to talk to Ley about his master plan for the reconstruction of Germany, I had autographs in mind. </sentence><sentence id="3228">And I willingly got them, at least half a dozen others, but some refused to sign. </sentence><sentence id="3229">Hess, for instance, refused to sign his. </sentence><sentence id="3230">So I made up a certificate, mimeographed, [speaks German here]. </sentence><sentence id="3231">I certify herewith that this is my official signature. </sentence><sentence id="3232">Then I went to them, I said, you know, in relation to documents in a trial, we want to have your official signature on record. </sentence><sentence id="3233">And I got their autographs, two copies; one for me and one for the -- the scrapbook for General Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="3234">The sequel to that is that I had this collection, my own. </sentence><sentence id="3235">I didn't have any photographs, we weren't allowed to take pictures. </sentence><sentence id="3236">But I met a Navy officer, a Navy officer in Nuremberg, American, and -- in the Panther Pit, that's the bar at the Grand Hotel where a lot of us were billeted. </sentence><sentence id="3237">And we happened to sit at the bar together and I said, you know, what's the Navy doing in Nuremberg? </sentence><sentence id="3238">You know, there are no Navy ships here, and -- and he said well he'd been -- he was naval intelligence, and he was assigned to -- in the photo -- business of photo intelligence, identification of documents and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3239">And he said, you know, funny thing, Hitler's official photographer was just brought in a couple of days ago, and he had a whole suitcase full of pictures of all the -- the high ranking Nazis and where they lived and all that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3240">So here was my boy, and I told him that I was trying to get some photographs, could he -- he get me some copies. </sentence><sentence id="3241">So he very obligingly made copies of some of the photographs of all of the -- the Nazis that were in -- in Hoffman, the photographer's collection. </sentence><sentence id="3242">He gave them to me. </sentence><sentence id="3243">I mean, we met a few days later, I got copy. </sentence><sentence id="3244">So I had photographs and -- and autographs and I gave a set to Colonel Phelp. </sentence><sentence id="3245">There's a sequel to that, very recent one. </sentence><sentence id="3246">I told you earlier, I was not a souvenir collector, and there was a time a few years ago when -- when it was just -- at least in my part of the world, where having Nazi souvenirs sort of made you stand out if you showed them to anybody, as a Nazi sympathizer. </sentence><sentence id="3247">And I'm thinking of Marge Schott, who was even mentioned in the newspapers because she had a swastika armband -- in a negative way. </sentence><sentence id="3248">None of my grandchildren were interested in any of this stuff, so I found somebody who was interested, who said that he would give these to a museum connected with the Simon Wiesenthal Center in California. </sentence><sentence id="3249">And I gave them to him, the autographs and the pictures. </sentence><sentence id="3250">Gave them to him. </sentence><sentence id="3251">A month ago I got a book in the mail, by a man named John K. Latimer, M.D., doctor, who was a doctor at Nuremberg, off and on. </sentence><sentence id="3252">One of these guys who could -- I want to go see what it's like at Nuremberg, so he went there, and he went to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="3253">And actually, as a doctor, could interview some of the prisoners, which he did. </sentence><sentence id="3254">And just a month ago, his book came out, and the title of the book is, "Hitler's Fatal Disease, and Other Anecdotes." </sentence><sentence id="3255">He knew me, because I had interpreted for him a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="3256">So it's inscribed to -- he read my book, inscribed to Ambassador Dolibois and in parentheses, our Lieutenant Gillen from Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="3257">And he wrote this book, it just came out a month ago, and he sent me a complimentary copy, cause he had read my book, and reminded me, in a letter that I sent to him thanking him, I said, "How did you get my name?" </sentence><sentence id="3258">And he said, "About five years ago I wrote to you about your book and you sent me a complimentary copy and I'm returning the favor." </sentence><sentence id="3259">And I'd completely -- I don't remember it at all. </sentence><sentence id="3260">I had sent him a copy of my book with my autograph, because we met as a -- a -- a fellow -- a colleague or something, a fellow Nuremberger, cause I had interpreted for him. </sentence><sentence id="3261">Now his book comes out, on "Hitler's Fatal Disease," explaining why Hitler did the things he did and also some stories about some of the others. </sentence><sentence id="3262">Some of the stories based on my book. </sentence><sentence id="3263">And he credits me, he -- he does say, according to Lieutenant Dolibois, or Lieutenant Gillen at that point, so and so said what. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And then accompanying each one of these articles was their photograph and their autograph. </sentence><sentence id="3265">So I wrote to him, and I said where did you get those pictures, because some of the ata -- autograph have my own handwriting on them, where I write the -- the titles in, like generale fieldmarshall Keitel. </sentence><sentence id="3266">And he said he bought them from a collector, he didn't remember his name, but he paid a pretty good price for them. </sentence><sentence id="3267">So my photograph collection, and autographs are in the possession of Dr. John K. Latimer, who is a medical doctor and has written a book about Hitler's fatal disease. </sentence><sentence id="3268">Do you know what the fatal disease is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3341">Q: Tell me. </sentence><sentence id="3342">Tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3345">A: Parkinson's disease. </sentence><sentence id="3346">Hitler had Parkinson's disease, and this man analyzes this based on what other doctors who had interviewed Hitler, or people whom he interviewed who knew Hitler, and a series of photographs in the book, which is a feature. </sentence><sentence id="3347">Toward the end of his years, every photograph you see of Hitler, he is either clasping his belt with his left hand, or has his left hand in his pocket, or is -- is holding an umbrella or a staff or cane or something in his left hand, to prevent his showing the -- the Parkinson's disease symptoms. </sentence><sentence id="3348">And this Dr. Latimer has concluded on the basis -- on the interviews, and his medical observation and other tests, that Hitler suffered from Parkinson's disease and many of the decisions that Hitler made, like the invasion of the Soviet Union, were due to the fact that he knew he didn't much time left before his disease would be publicly known and he would lose his effectiveness with the German people, and he would no longer be able to fulfill all of his dreams. </sentence><sentence id="3349">So he made many fatal decisions based on the knowledge that he -- that he had a fatal disease of which he was going to die. </sentence><sentence id="3350">And that's the title of this book, just came out a month ago. " </sentence><sentence id="3351">Hitler's Fatal Disease, and Other Anecdotes," or stories about other Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3352">And my pictures are in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3362">Q: But how did he get these photographs if you donated the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3363">A: He bought them from a collector. </sentence><sentence id="3364">And the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3365">Q: But you donated them to the ba -- the Wiesenthal Center. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3367">A: I gave them to an individual who was going to give them to the Wiesenthal Center. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3369">Q: I see, right, so he lied to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3371">A: I sold my epaulets to that same individual, and for that I got paid, but he didn't say anything that he didn't -- he didn't say anything about selling the photographs. </sentence><sentence id="3372">All he said was I'm going to give these to the museum at the Wiesenthal Center. </sentence><sentence id="3373">And he had -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3374">Q: And the epaulet was from Goering? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3375">A: The epaulets were Goering's epaulet -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3376">Q: Goering's, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3377">A: -- which Goering gave to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3399">Q: Vitchell. </sentence><sentence id="3400">And how she got -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3401">A: Yup. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3402">Q: -- sa -- it's very -- it's sort of funny in a [indecipherable] a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="3403">She's the only woman -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3404">A: Yup, yup. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3405">Q: -- in the story, so I thought maybe it would be interesting for you to retell that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3407">A: Yeah, that -- there was several other women in the story, but very -- very briefly, one of them being Jodl's wife -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3408">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3409">A: -- and -- that I -- that I mentioned, and Streicher's wife -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3410">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3411">A: -- Adele. </sentence><sentence id="3412">But this Guyon Vitchell was -- she was a professional spy. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And she apparently had some relationship, whether a love -- whether it was a love relationship, but she knew one of the generals that we had in a prison da -- now we had in Nuremberg -- this is in Nuremberg now, not in Luxembourg, we didn't have any women in Luxembourg, but in Nuremberg, the top floor, one side of the top floor of the prison where all the Nazis were kept was reserved for women. </sentence><sentence id="3414">And Himmler's -- Himmler's secretary, and Ribbentrop's secretary were among the prisoners, mostly as witnesses, not because they were charged with any crimes, or intended to be. </sentence><sentence id="3415">And this Vitchell apparently, I don't know why she was taken prisoner, cause there were a lot of spies, and -- and some of them we even knew about. </sentence><sentence id="3416">But this one, I think because she had the connection with this general -- and we thought that was the -- the spy on the higher rank, because the relationship -- and they were exchanging notes with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3417">And we -- our curiosity was aroused by how -- how she could write a note and end up -- ends up in his cell. </sentence><sentence id="3418">So obviously one of our guards was delivering messages from one prisoner to another. </sentence><sentence id="3419">And that was strictly verboten, that wa -- that was not allowed at all. </sentence><sentence id="3420">So this was one of my functions, that -- that Colonel Andrews delegated to me when I became his special assistant. </sentence><sentence id="3421">So I was to find out how this note business was going about. </sentence><sentence id="3422">And wi -- the -- the whole incident was that I -- I went -- went to her cell, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="3423">And the guards were not allowed in the cells at all. </sentence><sentence id="3424">They were -- they had to stand outside the cell. </sentence><sentence id="3425">And up at that section I think was one guard for the whole corridor, we only had five or six women prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="3426">But I noticed that Vitchell, who was a rather striking looking woman, and when -- when I entered, she was dressed in a robe that came all the way to her feet. </sentence><sentence id="3427">And -- which I thought was unusual prison garb, but they weren't really being held as -- as criminals, so I didn't pay too much attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="3428">But I was asking her questions, and I forget how the sequel went, because I didn't attach that much importance to it, but I did notice that she had a good stack of American cigaret -- cigarettes brand -- American brand cigarettes, loosely, not in a pack, but i-in a tray on her table in -- in the prison. </sentence><sentence id="3429">And in the course of questioning, she -- I asked her where she got those cigarettes and she had no hesitancy at all in answering by just opening her robe. </sentence><sentence id="3430">And I found out she was abs -- absolutely stark naked underneath the robe. </sentence><sentence id="3431">Which was unusual prison garb also. </sentence><sentence id="3432">And then I put two and two together and I said, "Let me see if I have this figured right. </sentence><sentence id="3433">You get those cigarettes," because they were not prison issue, "you get those cigarettes from the guard. </sentence><sentence id="3434">And you give him peep show and he tosses in a cigarette," through the opening where we pass their food. </sentence><sentence id="3435">And she said I had that absolutely right. </sentence><sentence id="3436">Well, I don't know whether the guard was listening on the outside, which I think he was, and there really wasn't anything I could do about it, and it really wasn't that much of an issue. </sentence><sentence id="3437">But obviously one of the guards who was willing to carry the messages was giving extra cigarettes and doing her that favor, which -- it struck my sense of humor. </sentence><sentence id="3438">I don't think it was a criminal offense, I didn't want to -- but I knew if I reported this to Colonel Andrews, somebody would end up in the -- in the brig, and somebody would be severely punished. </sentence><sentence id="3439">So I -- [had a little fun, I came out of the cell, and the guard was standing in there, and just by looking at him, I could tell that he -- he knew what I -- what the conversation was, cause he's all red in the face, and -- and being extra polite and standing at rigid attention, almost like a statue. </sentence><sentence id="3440">So I just went up to him right face to face and looked at him and said, if you won't tell, I won't tell, or something to that effect, and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="3441">And he said, "Thank you, sir." </sentence><sentence id="3442">And he clicked his heels. </sentence><sentence id="3443">And I became very popular with the guards cause the word got around very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="3444">But I reported this to Colonel Andrews, who had no sense of humor at all. </sentence><sentence id="3445">And Colonel Andrews would occasionally repeat the same story, but he had it all mixed up. </sentence><sentence id="3446">And he was giving a -- I think it was Ribbentrop's secretary or one of -- one of those people's secretaries" credit for being the -- the person that exposed herself. </sentence><sentence id="3447">And that particular person was extremely ugly, and -- and nobody would give up a cigarette to look at her in the nude or even dressed. </sentence><sentence id="3448">So that made it good, but I never corrected the colonel cause he - - he enjoyed his story so much, but he did have it all screwed up. </sentence><sentence id="3449">He had one other joke that he had to tell every newcomer, saying that -- he said, hell, I always -- I thought -- I -- God's last name was damn. </sentence><sentence id="3450">When he grew up he thought God's last name was damn, and that was an hilarious story, when he though -- he thought that was just great until he found out otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="3451">But he had no sense of humor, compared to Reichsmarshall Goering, who had a pretty good sense of humor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3495">Q: [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3496">Tell me why it was that you visited the wives -- I guess at least three, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3499">Goering's wife, Kesselring, and Selta. </sentence><sentence id="3500">Why was it that you -- that you went -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3501">A: I -- I visited Kesselring and Selta's wife when I went to Tegernsee with Warlimont to get those documents a -- I don't know if you want to go into that story, but it's kind of humorous and interesting, too. </sentence><sentence id="3502">But Warlimont -- mind you now, he's general of the artillery, a three star general, came to me one day in Oberoszul and told me that he had a proposition, that he would like to visit his wife and his children, he had three children, two daughters and a son, at Tegernsee where -- where they lived on -- in Bavaria and that if I would take him there so he could visit his family, he would in turn make available to me, all the minutes of all the meetings of the German general's staff, bound in volumes all the way back to 1792 or "32, when the general's staff was founded. </sentence><sentence id="3503">Not only that but he would also have some other books and documents, manuscripts, he'd make them available to me, on the history of the German general's staff. </sentence><sentence id="3504">Well, that was extremely valuable, but the idea of my taking that prisoner to visit his family was just so ridiculous that I had repeat it as a joke to my commanding officer, I said to him, "Colonel, you -- you won't believe this," and -- and I told him. </sentence><sentence id="3505">And he thought it over, and he smiled a little bit, and made no other comment. </sentence><sentence id="3506">But the next day he called me in and said he had been thinking it over, and that I ought to just go ahead and take Warlimont, but we just keep quiet about it. </sentence><sentence id="3507">We wouldn't make this an o-official record, he would just give me the travel orders, by order of the commanding officer, and authorize me to go to Tegernsee, and be accompanied by PW W. Warlimont. </sentence><sentence id="3508">But we wouldn't talk to anybody about it, because we -- obviously wasn't going to be allowed by anyone higher up. </sentence><sentence id="3509">So | arranged a week later to take    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3510"> Warlimont on a tour in a Jeep and I had my 45 caliber gun, and he was dressed in civilian clothes anyway, because he was no longer active in the army when he surrendered to us. </sentence><sentence id="3511">No problem, but I passed him off as my interpreter and my driver. </sentence><sentence id="3512">The first problem we had was when we stopped in Stuttgart at a military mess to get lunch. </sentence><sentence id="3513">And the mess sergeant of course saw my orders, which I presented to him, and sure enough sir, you can eat and all the courtesy and everything else, he said, but the Kraut isn't going to get any food. </sentence><sentence id="3514">And I had convinced the sergeant that the Kraut was a pretty nice guy and he was my interpreter and give him a big sales talk and finally the sergeant relented and allowed the Kraut to get some food in the kitchen, but I heard him give a -- General Warlimont orders about washing his mess kit afterwards and cleaning it -- cleaning up after him, and he used a four -- a few selective phrases. </sentence><sentence id="3515">I wondered what he would have done if he had known he was talking to a three star German general, ordering him to wash his own mess kit. </sentence><sentence id="3516">Well, that story became interesting as we got to Tegernsee. </sentence><sentence id="3517">It seemed that Warlimont lived right next door to his in-laws. </sentence><sentence id="3518">His wife's mother and father, his ma -- wife's father was an opera singer, and the wife's mother was a native American, had been born in United States, related to the Anheuser-Busch family, a distant relative of the Anheuser-Busch family. </sentence><sentence id="3519">And he had met their daughter in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3520">He wa -- the opera singer Baron von Cleidorf was his name, had tour -- was touring the United States when he met this girl, whom he then married in 1903, and they had a daughter, and that daughter became the wife of General Warlimont. </sentence><sentence id="3521">So now Baron and Baroness von Cleid -- Cleidorf lived next door to the Warlimonts. </sentence><sentence id="3522">I stayed with them, and the general stayed with his wife and his three children. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3523">They had a very happy family reunion. </sentence><sentence id="3524">And we visited for three days and during that visit -- I then took off in my Jeep and went to visit Kesselring's wife and Selta's wife, and brought them news. </sentence><sentence id="3525">They had not heard of their husbands, where they were, if they were even alive. </sentence><sentence id="3526">So I was    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3527"> really the harbinger of joy. </sentence><sentence id="3528">And as a result of that visit, as a gift to me in the course of conversation, they developed an interest in my family. </sentence><sentence id="3529">And I pointed out that I had a little son at home, and so I ended up with a pair of lederhosen as a special gift from Mrs. Selta for my son. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3530">And those are authentic lederhosen, they're the real McCoy. </sentence><sentence id="3531">So I was very proud and happy to have them. </sentence><sentence id="3532">But it was on that occasion I visited those two wives. </sentence><sentence id="3533">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3534">Q: But -- go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3535">A: Go ahead, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3537">Q: No, no, go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3539">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3540">Well, the -- the whole purpose of that visit -- and that was fully understood -- in fact, I had orders. </sentence><sentence id="3541">Remember, there was a non-fraternization law, and American personnel were not permitted to fraternize with Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3542">You could get in real trouble just by seeing -- seeing -- by being seen talking to a German. </sentence><sentence id="3543">So I had a special set of orders, as to -- that I was a member of military intelligence, and was authorized to enter German homes, and also authorized to interrogate, investigate whatever mission Id -- I decided on. </sentence><sentence id="3544">But I had official authorization. </sentence><sentence id="3545">And this was on my -- on my orders, which I always carried with me, because like an instance, like if anybody, military police had seen me going into a German home, I could have gotten in real trouble if I wasn't authorized. </sentence><sentence id="3546">Course, there was a lot of fraternization going on throughout Germany, but it was one of those rules that was a little bit ridiculous because in my [indecipherable] here was our opportunity with an army of occupation to really do some brainwashing of the Germans, and convince them that our system is far superior to the Nazi system. </sentence><sentence id="3547">And we could have organized the German youth into basketball teams and soccer teams and football teams and tell them about American sportsmanship. </sentence><sentence id="3548">Instead, we weren't allowed to talk to them, which to me seemed a little silly. </sentence><sentence id="3549">We -- we missed a wonderful opportunity, which was reversed when the Marshall plan went into effect and we then did what we should have done immediately after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3550">But this fraternization policy was ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="3551">One more secret to the story of Warlimont is that on our way home -- and I did get the documents. </sentence><sentence id="3552">And I don't know what happened to all of the documents, but I do know that years later I purchased a book from my library written by John Wheeler Bennett, which was the -- the mc -- "Nemesis of Power; A History of the German General's Staff." </sentence><sentence id="3553">And I know that a lot of the research and documentation that appeared in John Wheeler Bennett's book had to come from the documents that we recovered through General Warlimont on this visit -- il-illegal visit to his family. </sentence><sentence id="3554">On the way home I didn't travel the Autobahn, I took the side roads, because just in case of an accident or something, I still would have trouble explaining what I was doing traveling with a three star German general who was really a prisoner of war. </sentence><sentence id="3555">So I took the side roads pretty much. </sentence><sentence id="3556">And we were right near the Bavarian headquarters of General Patton, who had been appointed the military governor of Bavaria. </sentence><sentence id="3557">And we were traveling along this somewhat isolated country road, heading back toward Oberoszul when there was a commotion ahead of us, and obviously some kind of a traffic disturbance. </sentence><sentence id="3558">And I pulled my Jeep over to side of the road and got out and stood by the road to see what was coming my way, and when they reached me with the sirens going, it was a Jeep with a flasher and siren, full blast, and then a staff car with license plate and four stars. </sentence><sentence id="3559">And in the back seat was no less a person than General Patton and his dog. </sentence><sentence id="3560">And of course I threw a fancy salute and General Patton acknowledged it by raising his riding crop, which he had in his hand, and passed on. </sentence><sentence id="3561">And a fantastic thought that occurred to me was that if I had only had enough nerve to stop the -- that particular convoy, and introduced General Patton to the German general, who had arranged all of the offensive and defensive maneuvers, including the invasion of Normandy, and say, "This is the guy who tried to stop you, general. </sentence><sentence id="3562">And this general is the man who -- whom you couldn't stop." </sentence><sentence id="3563">It would have been quite a meeting, but I would have had an awful time explaining what I was doing illegally with -- traveling with this important PW. </sentence><sentence id="3564">So that was the whole story of that. </sentence><sentence id="3565">Visiting Mrs. Goering was part of the same scheme, th-the agreement was -- and our military intelligence was that any way we could gather information be useful, and visiting their families was not only a gesture that opened up and loosened tongues, but it also gave us a chance to get another viewpoint as I -- I mentioned earlier. </sentence><sentence id="3566">So I went to -- went to visit Mrs. Goering. </sentence><sentence id="3567">The housekeeper answered the door and saw my American uniform and all but slammed the door in my face, she would have nothing to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="3568">So I went back and I told Goering that I tried to see his wife. </sentence><sentence id="3569">He knew that -- where I was going, I said I'm -- I was going on a trip and I was coming near where his wife was. </sentence><sentence id="3570">I think was one of the -- one of the chateaus that had once belonged to him, she was living in part of it. </sentence><sentence id="3571">He then gave me a -- a picture of himself and Emmy and their little daughter Edda, and wrote on the back of it that Oberloitman Gillen has my confidence and -- and trust, and signed Hermann Goering, and the date, August eighth, I remember, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="3572">It was August -- yeah, I think it's August eighth. </sentence><sentence id="3573">Anyhow, I went back there several weeks later on another business trip and stopped there, and this time I showed the housekeeper the photo and she took it into Mrs. [indecipherable] Miss [indecipherable] -- Mrs. Goering, and she herself came to the door and invited me in. </sentence><sentence id="3574">I only stayed a few minutes, just small talk and -- and talking to her a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="3575">I promised that I would come back, because I had someone else in the car with me as I recall, and I didn't want to make too much of a -- a visit out of it, other than my just delivering a letter, and so I promised to come back. </sentence><sentence id="3576">And I went back again a couple of weeks later with a letter to the little girl from her father. </sentence><sentence id="3577">And Mrs. Goering was in prison, she'd been arrested by military government -- government for the art treasures, and she certainly was involved in s-some of that art confiscation. </sentence><sentence id="3578">And the little girl was in a children's home. </sentence><sentence id="3579">So I went to visit her and actually held her on my lap and read her father's letter to her, which was a kind of an emotional experience that I wasn't soliciting. </sentence><sentence id="3580">But that was the occasion of -- of that partis -- personal visit. </sentence><sentence id="3581">Others were -- wives visiting Nuremberg during the time that I was working for Colonel Andrews directly, as sort of an assistant prison public relations officer. </sentence><sentence id="3582">And when they had visitors like that, I know Mrs. Jodl came, and Streicher's wife, and oh, two or three others that -- oh, von Ribbentrop's wife, who incidentally is a very ugly woman, personally di -- but she was a -- an heir to the Henkle champagne people. </sentence><sentence id="3583">In this case -- and he was a salesman for the champagne line, I think it was Henkle [indecipherable] Henkle or one of the others. </sentence><sentence id="3584">Anyhow, he married the boss's daughter and this is how he -- how he got ahead. </sentence><sentence id="3585">Von Ribbentrop, incidentally, I don't know if you knew that he was not really a von. </sentence><sentence id="3586">No, he -- h-he was born Ribbentrop, but there was an aunt who was married -- his mother's sister who was married to von Ribbentrop -- the other way around, brother, who was knighted, and he had the right to the title von Ribbentrop. </sentence><sentence id="3587">And at age 32, von Ribbentrop himself, the foreign minister, Joachim, arranged for his aunt, Mrs. von Ribbentrop to adopt him at age 32, so that he would become Joachim von Ribbentrop. </sentence><sentence id="3588">Which helped him tremendously because it helped sell him to Hitler, who was impressed by the von idea, plus the fact that von Ribbentrop could speak English and -- and other things. </sentence><sentence id="3589">But she was another one who came to visit in a relationship with families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3644">Q: I-I -- I understand that justice Jackson came and gave a seminar [indecipherable] international military tribune -- was this in Mondorf? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3648">Q: In Nuremberg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3650">A: No this is -- by the time the trials were ready to begin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3652">Q: So he gave the seminar to whom? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3654">A: To the staff, the American officers who were assigned, both the guard element and people like me, a-and the prison psychiatrist and anybody else involved in the trial procedure. </sentence><sentence id="3655">There were the -- the -- there was a tremendous judicial staff, lawyers and -- and others who were acting as the -- well, assistants to the prosecuting staff. </sentence><sentence id="3656">The prosecuting staff had, I think -- well, Colonel Amon was the deputy to Justice Jackson, Telford Taylor were the only two I ever had any relationship with. </sentence><sentence id="3657">I -- I interpreted for Amon on a few occasions, particularly the Ley episode where Ley was presenting his master plan, and -- and I'm -- I'm the one who took -- I took Ley's document to Colonel Amon and then he and Jackson ruled on insignificance of it and ordered me to -- to tell Ley that it wasn't any good. </sentence><sentence id="3658">So Amon and -- and Telford Taylor are the only two I had any connections with. </sentence><sentence id="3659">Justice Jackson decided he could give a talk, a seminar to all of the people connected with the prison. </sentence><sentence id="3660">And the purpose of the seminar was to explain the international tribunal, because again, none of us knew what we were really doing -- what this was all about, why we were having a tribunal and who was going to participate. </sentence><sentence id="3661">The organization of the tribunal. </sentence><sentence id="3662">The fact that we were having four judges and assistant judges from each of the major nations participating. </sentence><sentence id="3663">And the prosecuting staff of each of the four nations. </sentence><sentence id="3664">And the conduct of the whole trial, and -- and what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="3665">And even the -- the redesign -- not th -- the rebuilding of the Palace of Justice, which had been heavily bombed. </sentence><sentence id="3666">And we had SS men who were doing the hard labor on -- who -- building the tribunal room, which was ironic again, I thought, because their high ranking leaders were going to be tried in the courtroom that they were repairing, in the building that they were reconstructing for this purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3667">So Jackson's purpose was to explain this to us, and that was the first detailed account I ever received, the only one for that matter, of what the purpose of the trial was, and what we were doing and had been doing and why -- why we had been doing it. </sentence><sentence id="3668">And I was quite impressed with Justice Jackson, I thought he was quite a -- an outstanding person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3685">Q: And what did you think of his explanation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3687">A: Well, [had my own questions about it, but again, that's from the standpoint of a then 27 year old, rather naive person. </sentence><sentence id="3688">Question number one was, we had Soviet judges sitting at trial, for the kind of crimes that the Soviet Union had also committed. </sentence><sentence id="3689">Somehow here is the kettle calling the pot black, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3690">And I knew that if I were preparing a defense and it were allowed, I would certainly raise that question in a courtroom. </sentence><sentence id="3691">You know, you are accusing us and finding us guilty of crimes that one of the judges up here represents a country which committed the same crimes. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3692">That of course, was one of the first questions. </sentence><sentence id="3693">Next question was strictly out of naivete. </sentence><sentence id="3694">The moral position we were taking on the dropping of the atom bombs, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="3695">While I, even to this day say I think we did the right thing in dropping it, but from the standpoint of civilians being killed who really were not involved, and we were killing civilians too, weren't we, with that bomb? </sentence><sentence id="3696">I'd say do it again if we had to under the same circumstances, but it still raised the question in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="3697">It also made me think again about the very serious questions that Goering himself, and Doenitz, and two or three other of the more intelligent of the high ranking personnel that we had in captivity raised. </sentence><sentence id="3698">They said -- not a question, but prediction they made, the day will come when you wish Germany were on yo -- were on your side and helping you against the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="3699">That was only a year before the Cold War broke out. </sentence><sentence id="3700">Their prediction was true. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3701">Billions that we have spent in creating a bulwark between western democracy and Soviet communism [indecipherable] Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3702">And what we did in building up the -- the Marshall plan to begin with, in rebuilding Germany, to the point where I've asked myself, who won the war? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3703">And that question certainly came up in this discussion. </sentence><sentence id="3704">So while it was very informative from the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3705"> standpoint of the mechanics, from the standpoint of the philosophy of the trials, I had to ask myself that question -- those questions. </sentence><sentence id="3706">That was my -- not a reply to Jackson cause I wouldn't dare have stood up and asked those questions, but they came to mind, where th -- I still maintain to this day that the trial was fair, it was justice, I'm proud to have been a part of it, and my only concern now is as -- as I'm approach old age, is the imitation of the Nuremberg trials that's going on around the world. </sentence><sentence id="3707">And I think they take away from what the Nuremberg trials really tried to accomplish; that is to make it illegal to invade another country and enslave its people. </sentence><sentence id="3708">To make crimes against the peace, violation of treaties and non-aggression pacts an international crime. </sentence><sentence id="3709">To punish those who -- who practice crimes against humanity. </sentence><sentence id="3710">Thou shalt not kill. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3711">Nothing original about that, that goes back thousands of years, thou shalt not kill. </sentence><sentence id="3712">And people who do kill, whether they do it on behalf of their government or not, should be tried and punished. </sentence><sentence id="3713">And thirdly, if you have an agreement on how to conduct a war, war crimes, define what the rules are, and if you break those rules, you're guilty of war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="3714">Don't mix apples and oranges. </sentence><sentence id="3715">Don't mix crimes against humanity with war crimes or crimes against the peace. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3716">And these imitation international tribunals going on now in certain places, are -- th-they're not real, they're imitations. </sentence><sentence id="3717">They're not the real thing. </sentence><sentence id="3718">They don't have the same objective, they don't have the same basis for operation, or for being. </sentence><sentence id="3719">And we're -- we're opening doors there we might be sorry about someday. </sentence><sentence id="3720">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3721">Q: Why do you call them imita -- in what sense are they im -- imitate -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3722">A: The ha -- well, The Hague, the international -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3723">Q: No, I understand what -- to what you're referring, but why are you calling them an im -- imitation, and clearly you think they're a pale imitation, so why?

to Germany for an official visit. </sentence><sentence id="4305">And he thought that he shouldn't visit the German military cemetery, that would cause a lot of friction. </sentence><sentence id="4306">Arthur Burns knew what the score was. </sentence><sentence id="4307">And I agreed with him. </sentence><sentence id="4308">And then Arthur Burns said, "Why don't you make a counter-suggestion and have him come to the American cemetery in Luxembourg instead?" </sentence><sentence id="4309">And I said, "Why don't you, Arthur?" </sentence><sentence id="4310">And he said, "We're both passing the buck." </sentence><sentence id="4311">And he said, "I'm the host ambassador and if I get involved it's really a violation of protocol. </sentence><sentence id="4312">I -- I shouldn't do this, because I'm -- I'm supposed to go along with what the host government wants," and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4313">So I stuck my neck out and I sent a cable, and that was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="4314">There is such a thing as a White House signal, and that is a direct telephone line from an ambassador to a White House office, the president, vice president, and also the secure -- national security advisor. </sentence><sentence id="4315">And you use that for really important messages. </sentence><sentence id="4316">And I should have been brave enough to use the White House signal, be the only time I would have -- have used it. </sentence><sentence id="4317">You'd use it if Luxembourg is planning to declare war on the United States or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="4318">But I should have used it to call the president and tell him -- to invite him to come to Luxembourg, my proposal being that the helicopter, which is at his disposal would come from Bittburg where he was making an official visit to the military -- that was our biggest military base, and our most important -- 15 -- 15 minutes less than, he could be in Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="4319">He could land in a parking lot, I had it all described, and lay a wreath at General Patton's tomb. </sentence><sentence id="4320">Then go down 500 yards from the American cemetery, there's a German military cemetery where 11,000 Germans are buried. </sentence><sentence id="4321">And he could lay a wreath there at the tomb of the unknown soldier. </sentence><sentence id="4322">And they could play [indecipherable] and guaranteed no SS, Waffen SS is buried in that cemetery, the Luxembourgers would never stand for it. </sentence><sentence id="4323">The whole thing would take 45 minutes, he could be back in Bittburg, no harm done, everybody would be happy, nobody would criticize. </sentence><sentence id="4324">But I made the mistake of s -- using a regular cablegram, which goes to the state department. </sentence><sentence id="4325">And the state department routinely routes this to the European director, who routes it to the president's office as a recommendation from an ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="4326">And I think Michael Dever got it and f -- the gist of the cablegram I got back was in so many words, mind your own business. </sentence><sentence id="4327">This is all settled. </sentence><sentence id="4328">And that was the e-end of it. </sentence><sentence id="4329">I should have had the courage to -- cause I'd corresponded with the president, and I had occasion to meet him on several occasions, after I became ambassador of course, but he knew who I was, and it was on Dear John basis. </sentence><sentence id="4330">And I think I could have gotten through to him, and I've kicked myself ever since. </sentence><sentence id="4331">But anyhow, Reagan came to Bittburg and he went to the cemetery where some Waffen SS were buried, I forget, 49 or some -- what the number was. </sentence><sentence id="4332">Michael Dever had been there to inspect the site, but the cemetery was covered with snow, so he couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="4333">Well, he could have gone to the registration office, any high school kid could have told him that there were SS men buried in the American military ceme -- Waffen SS. </sentence><sentence id="4334">But he didn't [indecipherable] but that -- that was his problem, among others. </sentence><sentence id="4335">Well, then I received an invitation from the Jewish community congregation in Luxembourg, that there was going to be sort of a protest ceremony at the same time that Reagan was in Bittburg at the cemetery, at the American cemetery in [indecipherable].Would I accept to come? </sentence><sentence id="4336">And my good friend, Mr. Ocks, who was the president of the congregation was very surprised when I personally called him and said, "Of course, I'Il come, I'll be very happy to be there." </sentence><sentence id="4337">He couldn't believe it, he said, "Oh," he said, "we're putting you on the spot." </sentence><sentence id="4338">Beca -- I had a very good relationship with him, I used to give talks to a roomful of survivors from Luxembourg and -- and Rabbi Boltz is a -- a good personal friend, and used to invite him to our embassy, along with the Catholic Archbishop of Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="4339">Was always a very in -- but they real good buddies, they were real good friends, h-had a very nice relationship. </sentence><sentence id="4340">Talk about freedom of religion, they really have it over there. </sentence><sentence id="4341">The respect. </sentence><sentence id="4342">Grand Duke and Grand Duchess would come to synagogue on many occasions, and it was just a wonderful relationship. </sentence><sentence id="4343">Anyhow, when I accepted they were very much surprised, and I went. </sentence><sentence id="4344">And that's where I met Rabbi Here, and also some other members of the Wiesenthal Center. </sentence><sentence id="4345">And the second surprise was that I was willing to make a talk -- give a talk, and so I did. </sentence><sentence id="4346">And I brought greetings from the president. </sentence><sentence id="4347">And I was wise enough to at least notify the president that I was going to be there. </sentence><sentence id="4348">Well, the media was there in force, and they really expected me to take off and either blast the president or make some comment. </sentence><sentence id="4349">And -- and I didn't, all -- the only thing I said was I think President Reagan should be here instead of in Bittburg, because this where he could have devil -- deliver a really significant message. </sentence><sentence id="4350">But he's not, and I'm here to represent him, and I bring you greetings and then I'm -- went into my spiel about how grateful we are those who sacrificed and we'll never forget them -- made the regular speech for the occasion, and everybody was happy, except the media, cause I really let them down, I didn't -- I didn't stick my neck out and jeopardize my job. </sentence><sentence id="4351">But I was jeopardizing it because if Reagan had taken offense, or somebody else had wanted to take issue -- but Schulz was very understanding, and he complimented me. </sentence><sentence id="4352">And Weinberger complimented me and they all said fine, everything is great. </sentence><sentence id="4353">And then Reagan's own speech -- that afternoon, we went -- Winnie and I went to Bittburg and -- and heard his speech and -- and I've quoted his speech many times, and -- we can't undo what's been done, we can't bring back to life those who have died, but the one lessons we've been taught by World War II is that good much triumph over evil -- I'm quoting roughly, good must triumph over evil and freedom must triumph over totalitarianism. </sentence><sentence id="4354">And a -- we should never forget the lessons learned because that"! </sentence><sentence id="4355">help us make a better future than -- the gist of his [indecipherable] which he would build his speech. </sentence><sentence id="4356">So everybody was okay, except the media, and the thi -- and people who got the idea from some media presentations, with which I disagree, that he was perfectly willing to go to that cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="4357">Actually, at that point -- President Reagan was the kind of president who relied pretty much on his lieutenants. </sentence><sentence id="4358">He -- he delegated, and he was a eight to five man, and some of that is good and some of it is bad. </sentence><sentence id="4359">But he didn't get involved in details, he never did. </sentence><sentence id="4360">Some presidents get too involved in details and that's wrong, too. </sentence><sentence id="4361">And you do have a staff, you do have people around you and a cabinet, so take what you will of that. </sentence><sentence id="4362">But -- but Reagan really didn't know -- I don't think ever -- anybody ever told him that there were Waffen SS buried there. </sentence><sentence id="4363">And if they had, I don't think he'd have known the difference, unless somebody told him. </sentence><sentence id="4364">I mean, how many people know the difference between the SS of the concentration camp type and the Waffen SS? </sentence><sentence id="4365">There is a difference. </sentence><sentence id="4366">And the Waffen SS, unfortunately, was sort of an elite military unit, and sort of like our Green Berets and -- but toward the end, the Waffen SS ended up with a lot of regular SS men in it, and they began to do a lot of the things that the -- the occupying forces, the atrocities against the civilian population, and of course the concentration camp, the thing [indecipherable] so there was a -- a definite mix, but the president wouldn't have known that. </sentence><sentence id="4367">In fact, I don't think anybody in his staff would have particularly known this, unless somebody told them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
