<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Tell us about the family which you grew up in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Our family was a normal, or what you might call a "normal family." </sentence><sentence id="20">My father was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="21">They were originally from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="22">My parents were -- came to Austria right after the first World War, married in Austria, and there were three children in the family. </sentence><sentence id="23">There would have been a fourth, but that child, a boy, died six weeks after birth. </sentence><sentence id="24">I was the oldest. </sentence><sentence id="25">My sister was a year and a half younger, and the other one, born in 1928, was seven years younger. </sentence><sentence id="26">A normal family, as I said, with schools and activities, fun -- although some of that was disrupted by the death of my father in 1930. </sentence><sentence id="27">I was nine years old, the oldest at the time of the three children. </sentence><sentence id="28">And, my mother, a young widow at 35, never remarried. </sentence><sentence id="29">My father was 39. </sentence><sentence id="30">And it sort of made me a father image, young as I was, to my children -- to my sisters -- because my mother had to go to work and support the young family. </sentence><sentence id="31">But that was all bearable and we coped as best we could. </sentence><sentence id="32">We do not want to forget that in those years it was still, if not depression, but very close to just, just post-depression. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: And these were hard times. </sentence><sentence id="50">Just as here in America in the middle "30s, latter "30s, we had to make with -- make ends meet with what was available to us. </sentence><sentence id="51">And income -- my mother was a, as I said, a widow who had to come up with, with the support of the family, and there were Jewish organizations who helped out in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="52">And the real, the real tragedy began then in 1938 with the annexation of Austria. </sentence><sentence id="53">Where that family structure, that family entity as in so many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases, that family entity overnight was destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: Tell us about -- before you begin with 1938, tell me about a Jewish child growing up in Vienna as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="60">Were you aware of being a Jew, and what did that mean as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Vienna and Austria had a history of antisemitic activities and antisemitic attitudes. </sentence><sentence id="64">When we grew up in Austria, as Jews, we were always aware of the fact that we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="65">It so  happens that I lived in a district in Vienna where there were more Jews than in other districts. </sentence><sentence id="66">It was the 20th district, and the second district had more Jews than the 20th, and a few other districts had -- but the majority of the areas were non-Jewish or very few Jews and antisemitism was almost a part of daily life. </sentence><sentence id="67">It's not that we thought a lot about it, because it just became part of life. </sentence><sentence id="68">If you, if you, if you live with something everyday, then it becomes part of you and you cope with it, if it didn't become too violent. </sentence><sentence id="69">But from time to time, there were denigrations. </sentence><sentence id="70">Sometime we were spit at. </sentence><sentence id="71">Sometime we were singled out for a particular rough treatments in schools, the Easter and Christmas seasons particularly. </sentence><sentence id="72">When I think back to those days, to me they represent a certain trauma because we, we were set apart. </sentence><sentence id="73">There was Easter dealing with a religious connotation of Christ and the resurrection which automatically brings back the killing of Christ, and that was the Jewish misdeed. </sentence><sentence id="74">And at Christmas time it was -- again we, we couldn't, we couldn't be part of a, of a festive mood even if we wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="75">Oh, there were many times when we did participate with neighbors in trimming a tree or sharing in, in the Christmas cookies and that sort of thing, but that was all surface. </sentence><sentence id="76">As children, we did things like this because we were part of a, of a, of a greater community where there were non-Jewish children and we, we related to them. </sentence><sentence id="77">But the excesses took place at certain times for certain reasons and especially during the depression years. </sentence><sentence id="78">I was then in my early young years, but I do remember that often could we hear that all these economic problems -- and even the first World War -- it was all the fault of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="79">So we were being maligned and singled out and we didn't like it, but nevertheless we asserted ourselves in some way because when, when we went on outings with the Hebrew schools, we, we sometime carried the Jewish blue and white flag and we were taunted for that by people who were looking at us. </sentence><sentence id="80">But it was a segment in history that does not reflect too well on, on the Austrian attitude towards Jews, and when we go later into "38, it is very easily perceptible. </sentence><sentence id="81">You can touch it. </sentence><sentence id="82">You can feel it. </sentence><sentence id="83">You could see it, that as soon as the Austrian Anschluss" took place, Austria in the next five, six weeks, or perhaps several months, the Jews in Austria underwent much more hardship in those few weeks or months than the Jews of Germany did in the previous five years from "33 to "38. </sentence><sentence id="84">It lent itself -- the climate in Austria lent itself more to antisemitic excesses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Give us examples. </sentence><sentence id="108">It's 1938, you have described a really dramatic change in your feelings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="111">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="112">What happened to Leo Bretholz? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Seeing that some of my uncles had been arrested and many of our friends and neighbors had been arrested, my mother actually urged me to think of leaving as soon as I possibly could -- " Term used to described the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich on March 11, 1938. </sentence><sentence id="114"> leaving Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="115">I had already left school. </sentence><sentence id="116">And an aunt of mine had left for Luxembourg right after the Anschluss, and we planned for me to join that aunt and her husband, my uncle, in Luxembourg as soon as I would be able to -- as soon as arrangements could be made. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was my mother who prevailed upon me to leave because she said that for boys and for men, it will be very bad, as we can see. </sentence><sentence id="118">People were arrested every day and within days or the most a few weeks, ashes were sent back of these people to their, to their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="119">Now whether they were these peoples ashes or not, nobody could ever find out. </sentence><sentence id="120">But they received a container with ashes, describing them as the ashes of the deceased who was caught trying to escape and shot because shooting was a justification for, for catching someone who tried to escape, killing someone, or that he had contracted a disease, a pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="121">But there were these, these explanations given which no one hardly even believed because some of the people who were freed from camps periodically brought back other horror stories, so we know that. </sentence><sentence id="122">My mother was very much bent on sending me away, and frankly, it is constantly a source of guilt for me, to know that she had sent me away and they couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="123">But then when I consulted with psychiatrist, because I didn't want to have to live with feelings such as these, he confirmed to me that, "Would your mother be able to speak today, she would still say...she was glad she did it." </sentence><sentence id="124">So, to begin with, she was actually instrumental in getting me out and saving my life. </sentence><sentence id="125">She was a good woman. </sentence><sentence id="126">My mother was what you might call in, in Hebrew, it's described as "Eshet Khayil,"" -- woman of valor. </sentence><sentence id="127">She did the best she could under the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="128">I am breaking down because...she never had a chance in life... She and my sisters and 55 others of my family never had a chance in life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: What did she do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: She was a widow and had to struggle to support the family and always helped poor people, people that were less well-off than we or less fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="148">Always helped somebody. </sentence><sentence id="149">There was this poor painter around the corner from us. </sentence><sentence id="150">When the apartment needed painting, she called him. </sentence><sentence id="151">He didn't even do a good job, but he needs the job. </sentence><sentence id="152">And when it was finished, the painting wasn't -- the painted room was sort of streaky, but she had given Mr. Fried a job because he needed it for his family, you see. </sentence><sentence id="153">But, I got to get myself together to make this thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Let's pull it back. </sentence><sentence id="162">Pull it back. </sentence><sentence id="163">Your mother... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: I took a train from Vienna, Frankfurt, Koblenz, to the west of Germany and Trier, the ancient town of Trier. </sentence><sentence id="172">By arrangement with a committee in Luxembourg; it was called the Ezra &gt; Woman of valor (Hebrew). </sentence><sentence id="173"> Committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Who were the Ezra Committee? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: The Ezra was an aid committee, almost like a HIAS," perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="180">Aid to refugees that came from Germany and Austria to Luxembourg, provide some shelter, provide food, kitchen, and help these people who could not stay in Luxembourg unless they had regularized, temporary documents. </sentence><sentence id="181">Somebody came with a passport and a, and a, and a visa could do that. </sentence><sentence id="182">Others that fled and came illegally, could not. </sentence><sentence id="183">And the Ezra committee was such a committee. </sentence><sentence id="184">And a Mr. Becker who was the smuggler that smuggled me across from Trier into Luxembourg, was in the employ of Ezra. </sentence><sentence id="185">In a way because later when I went to Belgium, he was also the one that smuggled us into Belgium, but I am jumping ahead here. </sentence><sentence id="186">But we were -- I went to the border town of Trier, and on the 31st of October, Mr. Becker picked me up in Trier and smuggled me across the border. </sentence><sentence id="187">Actually he took me to the river, the Sauer River and asked me cross and then meet him at the other side of the Sauer. </sentence><sentence id="188">And during the night from October 31st to November the first, after it had been raining for four or five days in western Germany -- these are the rainy periods there -- I crossed into Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="189">He had asked me to put a pair of dry socks into my coat pocket so that when I came across and once I had crossed, I would put these dry socks on, which at the point was not even possible because I didn't have dry socks in my pocket after I had crossed the river. </sentence><sentence id="190">When he told me I was to cross that river, I asked him would I -- no, he asked me do I know how to swim. </sentence><sentence id="191">I said, "Yes, I know how to swim." </sentence><sentence id="192">I said, "Would it be necessary, you think?" </sentence><sentence id="193">because he told me I would wade across. </sentence><sentence id="194">But no way could I wade across that river after four days of rain because that river carried a lot of torrential waters with debris, branches, mud, all kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="195">That river springs in the Ardenne Mountains and comes down. </sentence><sentence id="196">It's a, it's really a tributary of the Moselle, a small river which under normal circumstances is a creek, a small stream. </sentence><sentence id="197">I went there later in years with, with my family to get to that same area, and people were just waiting there ankle deep, knee deep in that particular... But I crossed, and the first step I took into the river, I was up to my knees and the second step up to my chest, and then here go the dry socks in my pocket, and it wasn't a concern of mine. </sentence><sentence id="198">My concern was to get across. </sentence><sentence id="199">And I did! </sentence><sentence id="200">And on the other side, Mr. Becker was waiting to take me into Luxembourg, and my aunt was waiting there, and I had crossed into safety. </sentence><sentence id="201">Or at the moment, relative safety, because three days later, I was arrested in Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="202">The police came into this cafe where I was sitting and having breakfast just a couple of days after I had crossed. </sentence><sentence id="203">Actually, my coat was still wet and not even dried yet, and they asked for my papers and I didn't have them, so they arrested me and took me to jail, and I spent the night in jail in the Luxembourg jail -- by the way, a very clean facility. </sentence><sentence id="204">And the next morning, they interrogated me. </sentence><sentence id="205">How did I come over? </sentence><sentence id="206">I said, "I crossed the river. </sentence><sentence id="207">The river Sauer." " </sentence><sentence id="208">Who brought you over?" </sentence><sentence id="209">I said, "I just crossed." " </sentence><sentence id="210">And how did you get into Luxembourg." " </sentence><sentence id="211">I just walked into Luxembourg." </sentence><sentence id="212">I * Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. </sentence><sentence id="213"> wasn't going to say, "Mr. Becker brought me over." </sentence><sentence id="214">And, well, it is my choice. </sentence><sentence id="215">I have two choices. </sentence><sentence id="216">I can pick a place where I want to be taken to out of Luxembourg, either Belgium or France or back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="217">So the choice was very simple. </sentence><sentence id="218">I said, "Well, I have an aunt in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="219">Maybe I can make my way to Paris." </sentence><sentence id="220">So they decided, yes, take me to the border, to this Luxembourg-French border. </sentence><sentence id="221">There is a little town called Thionville-les-Bains. </sentence><sentence id="222">It is like a thermal spa. </sentence><sentence id="223">And they took me there and they -- the next morning -- and they -- commuter train that went to the border, just about a half an hour or 40 minute ride. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I crossed into France. </sentence><sentence id="225">But earlier before we went -- before we took that train, at the railroad station, when they went to the ticket to, to, to show that to the ticket window that day, were transporting me, whatever, they needed to have transportation. </sentence><sentence id="226">My uncle had found out that next day I will be taken to the border, appeared at the railroad station and he wore a cap. </sentence><sentence id="227">And he was standing on the side, and I noticed him and he noticed me, and he did this to his cap, the visor of the cap: he turned it around. </sentence><sentence id="228">There is an expression in Yiddish which translates "Turn the visor around," which to me meant, "If you can come back, come back." </sentence><sentence id="229">And when they had taken me to the border and I crossed, they indicated to me that the other end of the border, just a few hundred yards inside France, there is a Jewish camp, they said. </sentence><sentence id="230">That's all they told me. </sentence><sentence id="231">And they will probably be able help me. </sentence><sentence id="232">But when I told them earlier, "How do you want me to manage going into France by myself? </sentence><sentence id="233">Can you --" They said, "Well, you just told us that you managed to swim a river and come into Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="234">Now if you could make it across a river, you will make it across dry land, we know." </sentence><sentence id="235">They were sort of patronizing me but also very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="236">They were not in any way vicious. </sentence><sentence id="237">They were just doing their job to get me out of there. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I was glad they didn't -- that I wasn't sent back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="239">As I crossed into France, I went to that camp and it was a preparatory camp, hakh'sharah,* where, where Jewish young people were preparing for aleeyah" to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="240">I got into this area and somebody at the gate actually stopped me, wanted to know who | am, and I said, "I am a Jewish fellow, just escaped from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="241">The Luxembourg people told me -- Luxembourg authorities told me that you might be able to help me...." "Well, they do that periodically just to make you feel that when you get across the border, you will be all right." " </sentence><sentence id="242">There will be no problem so that they should be off the hook. </sentence><sentence id="243">But actually as many as we get here periodically, we do get some. </sentence><sentence id="244">We always have to tell them that the French authorities tolerate us here. </sentence><sentence id="245">We have only temporary permits to live in France, and if we are being in any way compromised to give you shelter, to help you further your, your travel in France, they will dissolve this camp, so we can't do it." </sentence><sentence id="246">Being that far away from Paris and not having money on me, I thought of my uncle's turning the visor around and waited until 4 Special training for youth preparing to settle in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="247">5 Immigration to Israel (Hebrew). </sentence><sentence id="248"> nightfall to cross back into Luxembourg and made my way back to Luxembourg city during the night. </sentence><sentence id="249">The last leg of that trip was in early morning catching a farmer with bales of hay or whatever he was carrying on his wagon to get me to the city line of Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="250">And from there I found my way to the address of my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="251">An hour later I showed -- a couple of hours later I showed up at the apartment where she lived. </sentence><sentence id="252">I rapped on the door and my uncle stood there and my aunt was sick in bed from, from aggravation that she had brought me there and now I was arrested again. </sentence><sentence id="253">I was a kid of 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="254">She -- that aunt lives today in Baltimore. </sentence><sentence id="255">She is in her 80s. </sentence><sentence id="256">She is my father's, my father's youngest sister. </sentence><sentence id="257">And as soon as I opened the door, my uncle said, turning to her, "I told you he'll be back." </sentence><sentence id="258">So, then they prevailed through the Ezra Committee to have me stay with a family in Luxembourg where about a half or dozen or more people were also staying waiting for further disposition of their situation. </sentence><sentence id="259">And I stayed there from the night of the second, third of November to the ninth -- six days. </sentence><sentence id="260">And the night of the ninth to the 10th of November, exactly Kristallnacht night, Mr.Becker took six or seven of us into Belgium, smuggled us into Belgium, into Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="261">And it was during that night that we saw the strange phenomenum looking to the east as we traveled in the car of skies that had changed their color. </sentence><sentence id="262">It was the night sky, but we could see reflections almost some eerie looking reflections of reddish-purplish coloration and it was only the next morning in Brussels that we found out that Kristallnacht had happened in Germany where hundreds of synagogues and businesses and homes had been set afire and, of course, Luxembourg being in this tristate area, Belgium/Luxembourg/France, we were very close to the border. </sentence><sentence id="263">And chances are the flames that we saw reflecting were those that happened in Trier or Koblenz or other border, border, localities that were evidently destroyed in that night of horror which many considered the beginning of the end of the European Jews -- Judaism, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: What happened? </sentence><sentence id="351">You are now in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="352">What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

the duress of the war -- fled into France and there at Saint-Cyprien at the time, was nothing but beach. </sentence><sentence id="524">So these refuges from Spain had come there, and established a camp facility. </sentence><sentence id="525">First they had tents, then they built barracks with undulated metal roofs and later more barracks were built, but the floors in the barracks were not floors. </sentence><sentence id="526">They were sand. </sentence><sentence id="527">It was just the uprights were there and the roof. </sentence><sentence id="528">But in the barracks, it was just the sand of the, of the beach. </sentence><sentence id="529">And there, straw was put on there and we were lying on that sand on that straw in that barrack -- shelter. </sentence><sentence id="530">As we walked through the sand, to go to the latrine, or to go to the kitchen to pick up the rations, we walked sometime on bones. </sentence><sentence id="531">A jaw bone here, a tail bone there, a skull here there of domestic animals, donkeys and horses and goats and dogs. </sentence><sentence id="532">The Spaniards had brought these animals with them. </sentence><sentence id="533">They were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="534">They were people who had a little livestock. </sentence><sentence id="535">They brought them with them, and in the process they died or they killed them even for food. </sentence><sentence id="536">And this, this was the scene there. </sentence><sentence id="537">The ocean periodically -- the tide carried the waters up to the barracks and sometimes right into the barracks, the ones that were closest to the shore. </sentence><sentence id="538">A beautiful sight it was scenically because there was the Mediterranean and there in the not too distant future were the Pyrenees Mountains jutting right into the Mediterranean, so scenically this was a beautiful place. </sentence><sentence id="539">And if any of us had thought to escape, that wasn't possible because at the end of the beach where the beach meets the ocean, you had barbed wires. </sentence><sentence id="540">And patrol boats were cruising so if somebody would go through the barbed wire and try to swim, they would be detected. </sentence><sentence id="541">The better way to escape would have been trying to escape from the camp, and then by foot make it into Spain. </sentence><sentence id="542">Be this as it may, we got there in May of 1940.Sometime in July or early August, and I couldn't pinpoint that, dysentery developed in -- broke out in that camp, and typhoid fever. </sentence><sentence id="543">There were a handful of latrines. </sentence><sentence id="544">There was a male section camp and a female section camp. </sentence><sentence id="545">There was a handful of latrines, and with the condition under which we labored, it was a constant line to these latrines. </sentence><sentence id="546">And they were elevated on stilts because the ocean would come in -- the seat of the latrine would be covered, so it was on stilts. </sentence><sentence id="547">So you walked up those stilts and there was that one door, that swinging door like, and you would go up there and relieve yourself and as soon as you were sitting down somebody rapped on the door, so you had to get out and get in line again. </sentence><sentence id="548">And there was no paper. </sentence><sentence id="549">There was no tissue paper. </sentence><sentence id="550">There was not even a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="551">So what we used was straw. </sentence><sentence id="552">It's awful to bring back these things, but these are all segments of dehumanization that people go through and you somehow cope with it because you live and you hope you will survive. </sentence><sentence id="553">What happened later, of course, these situations were almost bearable, sometimes even comical. </sentence><sentence id="554">And I escaped from that camp with another fellow. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1486">How is outside? </sentence><sentence id="1487">What did you, what do you think? </sentence><sentence id="1488">What news do you have?" </sentence><sentence id="1489">Everybody gathering about a new group of arrivals because they may, they may have something to convey and we went through a barrack process of checking in which would also mean taking your watch away, your rings, certain belongings, money. </sentence><sentence id="1490">And another psychological ploy: giving you a receipt for the things that they took from you, with the admonition, "Don't lose that!" </sentence><sentence id="1491">because you will never get them back. </sentence><sentence id="1492">That is your receipt that has a number on it. </sentence><sentence id="1493">It had a number on it. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Just imagine that! </sentence><sentence id="1495">And people there tried to sort of whisper to us that this isn't good here. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And we knew, as we came in, the mood immediately, it wasn't Rivesaltes any longer. </sentence><sentence id="1497">It was not Rivesaltes by any stretch of the imagination. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Drancy was a complex that was built to be a military barracks facility. </sentence><sentence id="1499">It was a multi-story complex almost like a stadium because it was round. </sentence><sentence id="1500">But due to the war, beginning of the  3 war, that building, that structure, was never finished. </sentence><sentence id="1501">So the places, the rooms that they put us in were wide open, concrete floor with piping laying around and half-installed electrical wires, half-installed plumbing, makeshift, and it was concrete. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Windows -- no, no windows, There were no panes in the windows. </sentence><sentence id="1503">It was just the opening where the windows were supposed to go in the frames later. </sentence><sentence id="1504">That wasn't done so it was all open, breezy. </sentence><sentence id="1505">And on this concrete, straw. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Men, women, children together. </sentence><sentence id="1507">Minimal facilities to wash. </sentence><sentence id="1508">Community, one trough like, where you, where the water ran down from in trickle. </sentence><sentence id="1509">Minimum toilet facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1510">Watchtowers. </sentence><sentence id="1511">Barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="1512">Suburb of Paris close to quote "civilization." </sentence><sentence id="1513">Minimal food distribution. </sentence><sentence id="1514">That's where we were issued the Jewish star. </sentence><sentence id="1515">This is where we had to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="1516">The population in northern France and the occupied zone had to wear that already in the towns, streets, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1517">But we having just arrived in Drancy had to put that on because this was the administration of the German authorities. " </sentence><sentence id="1518">Juif" --- French for "Jew." </sentence><sentence id="1519">In Holland, it was "Jood;" in Germany, "Jude." </sentence><sentence id="1520">I cannot fail to mention that, because I always mention that. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And it has to be mentioned over and over and over again, that the German propaganda told you that a Jew, you can smell them a mile away. </sentence><sentence id="1522">A Jew, you know when you see a Jew, from a distance, you can smell him, you see his actions, you see, there's no way where you can mistake a Jew for what he is. </sentence><sentence id="1523">So the obvious thing, question is, it's a rhetorical question and even young children to whom I speak periodically in a museum or in school when I ask that and I say, so what is your next question then. </sentence><sentence id="1524">And they would say, "So why did you need that star?" </sentence><sentence id="1525">And some young people, eight, nine year old, says, "I know why." </sentence><sentence id="1526">I said, "Tell me." </sentence><sentence id="1527">He says, "To humiliate you." </sentence><sentence id="1528">And for a child that's a big statement. </sentence><sentence id="1529">He understands that. </sentence><sentence id="1530">So we had this star and we were easily recognizable, yet we had to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="1531">So that destroys their whole thesis, their whole propaganda, and their propaganda can be destroyed in thousands of ways because nothing ever made sense. </sentence><sentence id="1532">It only dwelt on the, on the, on the emotions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2095">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2097">A: First, I would like for people to understand that if the hero that they, somebody whom they  8 call hero -- whether they look at a person tells about it, or a monument that that, of some hero of years gone by --only that person knew really how scared he really was, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2098">You make a hero of somebody, but that person knew deep down that there was a lot of fear. </sentence><sentence id="2099">Heroism isn't something that comes sort of at the spur of the moment. </sentence><sentence id="2100">How did we do it?There was only one way of doing it. </sentence><sentence id="2101">Other than having tools to cut out the bottom of the train or cut out the ceiling, there was only one way -- the obvious way -- a window. </sentence><sentence id="2102">And these windows were squares. </sentence><sentence id="2103">Perhaps 24 by 18, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="2104">But you see, in cattle cars they are normally called "huit, quarante"" -- eight horses, or 40 men, in military terms. </sentence><sentence id="2105">Both windows had bars, straight bars. </sentence><sentence id="2106">Two bars: the one on the one side facing the other track that runs parallel had barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="2107">That would not have prevented us from using that window, because a barbed wire that's rusty can easily be bent back and forth and can be eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="2108">A barbed wire can be cut by bending back and forth a few times, and then you have just the bars to contend with. </sentence><sentence id="2109">But that window was not in our plan, because that was the window that was next to the other track and you don't want to jump when you jump onto a track. </sentence><sentence id="2110">Especially from a moving train, because you can't really take that big chance. </sentence><sentence id="2111">I mean, you want to succeed. </sentence><sentence id="2112">The left side -- the north side, as it were, because we were traveling east -- was the one that faced the ravine, the bushes that are alongside and the telephone post, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2113">That's the window we chose through which we will make our getaway, we hoped to make our getaway. </sentence><sentence id="2114">And as soon as the train, we had all night to think about that. </sentence><sentence id="2115">We were walking in, in, around in miserable conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2116">I mean, we were sliding back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="2117">So the only way we tried in the morning to move these bars, but it wasn't possible. </sentence><sentence id="2118">We decided the only way that we could possibly do that is by trying to twist them or to bend them forcefully or forcibly. </sentence><sentence id="2119">And we dunked, we took our sweaters and we dunked them in human wastes, made them wet, to create a tensile cloth. </sentence><sentence id="2120">Dry cloth you cannot wring too well. </sentence><sentence id="2121">A towel, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="2122">But a wet cloth can be wrung and wrung and wrung, and it twists and twists until the moisture has dripped out entirely until it's dry. </sentence><sentence id="2123">That sort of principle is applied in a tourniquet style when you use it on an arm. </sentence><sentence id="2124">We used that as a tourniquet. </sentence><sentence id="2125">So if you figure that two bars, you twist that sweater around the bars and then you go twisting, twisting, twisting until you can, We helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="2126">We tried that several times. </sentence><sentence id="2127">It was no give yet. </sentence><sentence id="2128">There was no give yet. </sentence><sentence id="2129">But we hoped that something will happen. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And then we moved in the side and see maybe it gets loose a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2131">But after a while, when we twisted again, again, we gave up for five minutes to catch our breath and we were perspiring. </sentence><sentence id="2132">We were working under pressure. </sentence><sentence id="2133">This was our getaway. </sentence><sentence id="2134">This was life. </sentence><sentence id="2135">There the countryside flew by us, that bucolic countryside -- France, the fields. </sentence><sentence id="2136">And this was -- we were approaching champagne country, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2137">The area of lusciousness. </sentence><sentence id="2138">But here we were going to certain death, which now we know. </sentence><sentence id="2139">At that 5 Eight, forty (French). </sentence><sentence id="2140"> 9 time, we only speculated. </sentence><sentence id="2141">But I am glad we did speculate. </sentence><sentence id="2142">It didn't let us fall into some sort of lethargy, like a lot of people were. </sentence><sentence id="2143">And we twisted and twisted, and then finally we saw that glimmer of hope where the bars in the frame started to move ever so slightly, ever so slightly. </sentence><sentence id="2144">And rust came out falling from that fitting that it was in, the hole that it is set in. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Rust came out. </sentence><sentence id="2146">Now, we never hoped to get the bar out of there; because they are set in like an inch or so, half an inch. </sentence><sentence id="2147">But we hoped to, them to be bending. </sentence><sentence id="2148">We worked for a while, and we saw them ever so slightly bend inward. </sentence><sentence id="2149">Then we used our hands to move them apart again, so that they should start loosening. </sentence><sentence id="2150">And it did that! </sentence><sentence id="2151">We moved them back into the proper position. </sentence><sentence id="2152">We went back and twisted again and this time, the bending inward was ever so slightly more of a bend. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And we put that again, did that. </sentence><sentence id="2154">We worked all day, being mindful of the fact that if the train would have to come to a stop, these things would have to be put into proper position. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Because then the guards would walk out of the first and the last car. </sentence><sentence id="2156">They were in the first car--that was a passenger car--and the last. </sentence><sentence id="2157">These were Gestapo, and these were the German guards. </sentence><sentence id="2158">And, of course, French police. </sentence><sentence id="2159">The French police, French collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="2160">That's a chapter by itself. </sentence><sentence id="2161">Towards the late afternoon, those bars had moved apart, through our efforts, enough where we could see our way squeezing through it. </sentence><sentence id="2162">And we put them back into the original position, just again in case the train would come to a stop and the guards would come up and inspect. </sentence><sentence id="2163">One time the train stopped at a station, and the people there seeing it wanted to reach me. </sentence><sentence id="2164">We shouted "Water!" </sentence><sentence id="2165">The -- they didn't let them get close because these people were aware of three transports going by there every week. </sentence><sentence id="2166">Some of the people were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply because some of us. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends. </sentence><sentence id="2168">But some of them, husbands or wives or children, whoever had left families behind in Drancy or hiding out somewhere, they would drop envelopes, and the people would pick them up and would put stamps on them and mail them. </sentence><sentence id="2169">Or just notes: "We are going away. </sentence><sentence id="2170">We are going away. </sentence><sentence id="2171">Don't forget us." </sentence><sentence id="2172">Cryptic notes like this, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2173">But they didn't let them approach. </sentence><sentence id="2174">We only made one stop. </sentence><sentence id="2175">In hindsight, I see exactly the time when the train -- because it's in the book - - when the train would arrive at the German border, and the German guards would take over everything by schedule. </sentence><sentence id="2176">But we did, Finally, under the cover of the darkness -- it could have been begin around seven o'clock, and it was dark at that time already. </sentence><sentence id="2177">We did climb out of that cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="2178">My cousin Tony, distant cousin Tony Gutefreund handed me my rucksack through. </sentence><sentence id="2179">I was the first one to step out. </sentence><sentence id="2180">I dropped down, held onto that bar, and then reached my way to the back of that cattle car to the coupling. </sentence><sentence id="2181">Reaching for the coupling with my foot, and standing and holding on to this, and then holding to that metal iron -- wrought iron -- stepladder that leads up to the roof, holding on to this, and stepping on those. </sentence><sentence id="2182">I was already half free. </sentence><sentence id="2183">I was standing there reaching my rucksack around, putting it only with one strap on my shoulder, and my friend came next. </sentence><sentence id="2184">He did the same procedure. </sentence><sentence id="2185">In fact, I told him already, "Now reach for the coupling -- la coupler. </sentence><sentence id="2186">""deg I stepped over to the next one, and he *6 Coupling (French). </sentence><sentence id="2187"> 0 used this one. </sentence><sentence id="2188">Our third friend that was going to go with us either never had the, the, got up the nerve to do it, or perhaps he was noticed by someone that he was reaching out, because at that very moment or just seconds later, the car, the train went into a slight curve on the north side. </sentence><sentence id="2189">That's the side we intended to jump. </sentence><sentence id="2190">And the curve is like a concave curve, which serves the guards as a means to inspect the whole length of the car, the train. </sentence><sentence id="2191">They are shining their flashlights up and down from the back and the front, and they cross somewhere in the middle, sort of a floodlight effect, to see that everything on the outside of that car is -- or those cattle trains, cattle cars, is still under control. </sentence><sentence id="2192">It is possible that they noticed that, because at that moment when the car, the train had come into that curve and somewhat slowed down--let's say, from 75 to 60 miles an hour or whatever, my friend standing on this coupling was the first to jump. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And I jumped right after him. </sentence><sentence id="2194">But at that very moment, we heard whistles and shots fired. </sentence><sentence id="2195">Up to this day, I think that one or two things happened to our friend. </sentence><sentence id="2196">He was caught in the crossfire of these beams and just didn't get out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="2197">He was attempting to, maybe he was a little heavier than us. </sentence><sentence id="2198">Whatever the case. </sentence><sentence id="2199">Or they may have caught him. </sentence><sentence id="2200">Those shots, however, were fired before the train came to a halt, because a few seconds later, the train came to a screeching halt and we heard more shots fired -- probably in the air. </sentence><sentence id="2201">Warning shots. </sentence><sentence id="2202">I don't think it was at our friend because I don't think he really ever made it out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="2203">But that's conjecture. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And voices: "Let's look for...Let's search...Run up and down." </sentence><sentence id="2205">We were lying there in that ravine and that wet, tall grass, holding our breath together in a moment that seemed like hours. </sentence><sentence id="2206">But it was just a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="2207">And it wasn't until we heard no longer any voices and we heard the train being set into motion again that we let our breath out. </sentence><sentence id="2208">For the first time in so many weeks, we were what you might call "free;" but at least -- if not entirely free, at least away from the train that was taking us to certain death. </sentence><sentence id="2209">Because only 72 hours earlier, 48 hours earlier, we were there in utter despair, put into a train. </sentence><sentence id="2210">This was a total metamorphosis in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="2211">We tried to make our way, and did make our way, into a village nearby. </sentence><sentence id="2212">By that time, everything was closed. </sentence><sentence id="2213">And because of blackout -- war time -- the windows were blue and blackened out. </sentence><sentence id="2214">And we went to this big shop, rapped on the door, and an apprentice, a young man, came to the door and told us that there was no

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3703">A: Because, sometime in April or early May, we had already had in the underground, through the Radio London, messages that indicated that sometime in June, in the first couple of weeks of June, there will be major events happening, which at this time could only mean a debarkation. </sentence><sentence id="3704">Where it would happen, we did not know. </sentence><sentence id="3705">But we knew it was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="3706">I did not feel that I would like to be confined when that happens, because there'll be a lot of turmoil out there. </sentence><sentence id="3707">There'll be a lot to do, a lot to see, a lot to be part of; and that was always my urge, to be part of something. </sentence><sentence id="3708">So that between that time and the actual landing, there was very little time to do whatever we had to do. </sentence><sentence id="3709">However, how did we feel, coming to your question about transporting. </sentence><sentence id="3710">First of all, we had to produce the cards. </sentence><sentence id="3711">We made them with false stamps and seals. </sentence><sentence id="3712">And we, we were counterfeiters, you see! </sentence><sentence id="3713">That's what we were -- just like when I escaped from that train. </sentence><sentence id="3714">The emergency was there, but I did it almost like a natural thing; because the urge was to be free. </sentence><sentence id="3715">So I did it, naturally, with all the trepidations involved. </sentence><sentence id="3716">But there were also trepidations in transporting papers or doing communication. </sentence><sentence id="3717">But at the time when we did it, the danger was not that apparent to us. </sentence><sentence id="3718">It's in hindsight, as you look: "What did we do? </sentence><sentence id="3719">My God, we were really young and...and dumb!" </sentence><sentence id="3720">That sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3721">But when we did it, while we did it, it did not occur to us that it was in any way endangering us. </sentence><sentence id="3722">Yes, anybody was endangered who did not have proper papers. </sentence><sentence id="3723">You could go into a restaurant as a French citizen. </sentence><sentence id="3724">You could go into a restaurant to have a meal and the Milice(tm) would come in and, like random, make, make inspections or certain searches. </sentence><sentence id="3725">Well, if you were a Frenchman and you didn't have your IDs on you on that day and you were not involved in Resistance and you were not Jewish, you were a French farmer come to town, but you didn't have your -- any kind of ID on you; you forgot it; you neglected to take it along. </sentence><sentence id="3726">Even that would endanger you, because everybody had to have an ID. </sentence><sentence id="3727">So we were just part of a whole system of, of, of hazards and pitfalls and problems. </sentence><sentence id="3728">But we did not consider our activity as something that would be any more dangerous than anybody else living under that regime. </sentence><sentence id="3729">Although we were exposed a little more. </sentence><sentence id="3730">We would have been exposed a little more to the punishment, if they had found us with the cards on us, because that could mean instant death, which happened to my friend, Eugene Bass, on the 10th of June 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3803">A: He didn't come home that night. </sentence><sentence id="3804">He did not come home that night. </sentence><sentence id="3805">So a few days later we contacted, a friend and I, his mother. </sentence><sentence id="3806">And she had found out from someone, some witness, that he had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="3807">And it was through the mother that we found out that Eugene had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="3808">And it would have happened to me, perhaps, and others in the train that we were in on that same day, on the 10th of June, 1944, going towards Oradour-sur-Glane from Limoges, when we saw the German column, Das Reich -- or one part of the, part of the rear unit. </sentence><sentence id="3809">Because the advance unit had already been into Saint-Junien. </sentence><sentence id="3810">And when we saw parallel to the railroad track the country road where the German motorized the motorcycles and the half-tracks were heading into the direction that we were heading, rolling up all that dust, so some of us decided, "If the Germans are going into this direction, we certainly do not want to go into the same direction." </sentence><sentence id="3811">So before we got into Oradour, there was another halt, another station. </sentence><sentence id="3812">There was an electric commuter train between Saint-Junien and Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="3813">So the station before -- there were a couple of halts, stops, before we got off the train. </sentence><sentence id="3814">But the report on Oradour that I have on that particular sheet, the write up, says that anyone with a ticket to Oradour that got off that railroad station that particular morning was taken off and immediately machine-gunned -- just like the other 900 some citizens of Oradour. </sentence><sentence id="3815">The men. </sentence><sentence id="3816">The women and the children were taken to the church. </sentence><sentence id="3817">They were told they were being photographed. </sentence><sentence id="3818">They put bales of hay and straw around the church and put gasoline over it and destroyed the church, burned it down with the women and children in it. </sentence><sentence id="3819">The moans and the cries filled the air. </sentence><sentence id="3820">A couple of weeks later, we went back to Oradour to view the scene. </sentence><sentence id="3821">And we stood there crying, with the tears. </sentence><sentence id="3822">Tables had been set up with the remains of mementos: baby carriages, buckles, shoes, baby dolls, toys that the kids had taken with them. </sentence><sentence id="3823">Oradour has been built up later -- about a quarter of a mile, a half a mile further away, a new little town. </sentence><sentence id="3824">But the original area of Oradour is today still a shrine to be visited, to reminisce and to cry. </sentence><sentence id="3825">Because it was really a stroke of luck that we even noticed that column. </sentence><sentence id="3826">We would have gone in there. </sentence><sentence id="3827">The mayor of Oradour at that time, on this particular moment, was arrested, put on a table and in front of his two sons, his two legs were sawed off. </sentence><sentence id="3828">Reported right in the, in the, in the sheet that I have here. </sentence><sentence id="3829">The sons, before that happened to their father said, "Please, take us! </sentence><sentence id="3830">Do to us what you want to do, but not to our father!" </sentence><sentence id="3831">They cut off his legs, and they shot the sons, too. </sentence><sentence id="3832">There was just a handful of people surviving in Oradour out of 900-some people. </sentence><sentence id="3833">There could have been many more, because those who were hiding out  7 without papers, that will never be known. </sentence><sentence id="3834">There were people hiding out. </sentence><sentence id="3835">A lot of Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="3836">And this is exactly the place where we took some of those cards to. </sentence><sentence id="3837">So that they should not be in hiding continually, and also be able to move a little freer, travel here or there. </sentence><sentence id="3838">But at that particular time, all that was already moot because the landing had taken place, a lot of what you might call, in the Genesis terms, "tohoo va-vohoo"(r)(r) happened -- a lot of tumult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3875">Q: Let's back up. </sentence><sentence id="3876">I don't want to get to the tumult just yet. </sentence><sentence id="3877">I would like to stay with Oradour for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="3878">Did you meet any of the survivors? </sentence><sentence id="3879">You had come so close, you were two stations away. </sentence><sentence id="3880">You came after it had been burned. </sentence><sentence id="3881">Did you meet anyone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3889">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3890">I had a call here when I wrote about this. </sentence><sentence id="3891">I wrote a piece to the Sun paper, recalling the event of Oradour. </sentence><sentence id="3892">It was in 1984, 40 years after the event, and I had a lady call me at home who told me that at one time she and her family had lived in Oradour. </sentence><sentence id="3893">And when she read this she had to get in touch with me. </sentence><sentence id="3894">But they had left Oradour before the town had been devastated. </sentence><sentence id="3895">In fact, it was devastated in error. </sentence><sentence id="3896">In the same area, there are two little towns Oradour. </sentence><sentence id="3897">One is called Oradour-sur-Glane, on the River Glane, near Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="3898">Another one, several miles away, not that great a distance, perhaps 15 kilometers or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="3899">I don't quite have the distance in proportion. </sentence><sentence id="3900">That was called Oradour-sur-Vayres. </sentence><sentence id="3901">Oradour- sur-Vayres had a group of Resistance fighters. </sentence><sentence id="3902">Oradour-sur-Glane had no Resistance fighters. </sentence><sentence id="3903">They had people in hiding, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3904">They had no arms caches. </sentence><sentence id="3905">Oradour-sur-Vayres did. </sentence><sentence id="3906">The German high command, going towards the front lines, coming from Toulouse, the Division Das Reich -- and by the way, they did a lot of damage in the town called Brive-la- Gaillarde, where they hung 90-some men from butcher hooks because of resistance activities. </sentence><sentence id="3907">And their families had to walk, walk by to view that. </sentence><sentence id="3908">That is in the Department of Correze. </sentence><sentence id="3909">Limoges was, and, and Oradour was, in the Department of Haute-Vienne. </sentence><sentence id="3910">The German Division Das Reich had been informed, by the Milice or by some of their collaborators, that Oradour-sur-Vayres had a Resistance group, an arms cache there, and that they might hinder their progress towards the front lines. </sentence><sentence id="3911">The advance column of Das Reich went there to clean out that nest of resistors, so that the main columns would then have easy travel. </sentence><sentence id="3912">But all they knew was Oradour. </sentence><sentence id="3913">They looked at the map, and they saw "Oradour" on the main road between Limoges and Angouleme or wherever, and picked Oradour-sur- Glane. </sentence><sentence id="3914">And the Mayor said, "We have no resistance here. </sentence><sentence id="3915">You can search the village. </sentence><sentence id="3916">You can search everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="3917">I give you my personal guarantee with my life." </sentence><sentence id="3918">And it was by mistake that Oradour-sur-Glane became the victim. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3949">Q: I want to take it back to events in which you were involved, okay, in which you know personally. </sentence><sentence id="3950">Let's go back to D-Day, June 6, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3951">Where were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3955"> *&gt; Chaos, disorder (Hebrew). </sentence><sentence id="3956"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3957">A: I was in Limoges, doing my daily whatever it is, communication or whatever work I did. </sentence><sentence id="3958">And it was a day of euphoria. </sentence><sentence id="3959">The papers reported it, and people were standing in front of the newspaper buildings to read the bulletins. </sentence><sentence id="3960">And the Germans were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. </sentence><sentence id="3961">Chalus had already been liberated by the Resistance; Limoges not yet, because Limoges had a main Gestapo headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="3962">Chalus was a little town. </sentence><sentence id="3963">I also have a little sheet here that shows the liberation of Chalus, and the appeal that was made by the, by the Resistance forces to keep calm and to go on about your daily lives as usual. </sentence><sentence id="3964">You see, there were two types of Resistance forces in France. </sentence><sentence id="3965">One was the FTPF.This was called Franc-Tireurs Partisans Francaises.*deg That was like a guerilla movement. </sentence><sentence id="3966">And the other was called FFI, Force Francais de I'Interieur -- French Forces of the Interior. </sentence><sentence id="3967">They were under the command of the exiled French government -- De Gaulle, in London. </sentence><sentence id="3968">And there was conflict between the two groups. </sentence><sentence id="3969">The ones that listened to De Gaulle were the ones that went by the rules, when De Gaulle and the French exiled government would give instructions: "Do not attack such and such a building..." Because that building happened to be English property. </sentence><sentence id="3970">So the FTPF would say: "Who cares? </sentence><sentence id="3971">But in that building there is armament produced that goes to the Germans." </sentence><sentence id="3972">So there was this conflict. </sentence><sentence id="3973">The FTPF was also a more radical-type movement than the FFI. </sentence><sentence id="3974">The FTPF, for instance, had some of the Spanish Civil War refugees. </sentence><sentence id="3975">They had a communist-leaning group. </sentence><sentence id="3976">They had more of the political activistic -- activist-type people who were fighting fascism wherever they can fight fascism, wherever they can find it. </sentence><sentence id="3977">The FFI was picking their targets and was going by the -- what might be called "the rules." </sentence><sentence id="3978">But in a unruly times, rules sometimes don't achieve anything, you see. </sentence><sentence id="3979">So this was the thing. </sentence><sentence id="3980">But we were in the streets, hoping that soon we will have liberation established in Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="3981">And it happened not too long afterwards, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4008">Q: Which of the two partisan groups were you allied with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4010">A: The A.J. was independent, actually. </sentence><sentence id="4011">But we were under the orders of the FTPF. </sentence><sentence id="4012">Yes, we were under the orders of the Franc-Tireurs Partisans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4016">Q: How were relations between the two groups? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4018">A: They were very cordial. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4020">Q: They were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4022">A: It was a common cause. </sentence><sentence id="4023">It is interesting that a common danger, how people's actions congeal, how a common danger becomes also a common denominator and an equalizer. </sentence><sentence id="4024">I mean, you take the London Blitz, just to divert for a minute -- %6 Free-Shooting French Partisans (French). </sentence><sentence id="4025"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4031">Q: Let's not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4033">A: Ok. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4035">Q: I really don't want to get into that. </sentence><sentence id="4036">Can we pull it back? </sentence><sentence id="4037">Was there any feeling of antisemitism? </sentence><sentence id="4038">Did the A.J. feel as if the FTPF looked down on them or treated them less well because it was a Jewish group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4043">A: I would never dismiss that aspect of a, of a, of a situation where Jews are involved, because our history tells us that. </sentence><sentence id="4044">On the surface, it did not happen. </sentence><sentence id="4045">We did not feel it. </sentence><sentence id="4046">We did not see it in so many deeds or words. </sentence><sentence id="4047">But it could very well have been there, because there was one captain of the French army who worked with us. </sentence><sentence id="4048">He was a Viennese, actually of Polish origin, but coming from Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="4049">His name was Prinz. </sentence><sentence id="4050">And he was originally with the French Foreign Legion, then came into France to join the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="4051">And he at one time indicated to me that while our main job was to fight the Nazis, if he survives the war he will have to settle a few accounts with some people, that he knew among his unit, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4052">And after the liberation, when the German soldiers had been arrested and interned and were in internment camps in Limoges, he took me to one of those camps to see because he was in charge of some of their units. </sentence><sentence id="4053">And he took me in one of those camps and he -- I got great satisfaction to see this little fellow by the name of Prinz -- he was about 5 foot 4 -- had these tall German prisoner soldiers stand at attention and act like really like scared children once they were in custody. </sentence><sentence id="4054">Just weeks before, days before, they were the strong, the strong masters, especially women and children. </sentence><sentence id="4055">And then when the day of reckoning came, they became whimpering children themselves. </sentence><sentence id="4056">But, no. </sentence><sentence id="4057">We, during our work with the Resistance, did not see it openly, feel it openly. </sentence><sentence id="4058">And frankly, for that nonsense, during this particular period there was no time for that. </sentence><sentence id="4059">We had an enemy to fight, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4077">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4078">The landing, June sixth, and the aftermath. </sentence><sentence id="4079">What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="4080">How did you help, if you did help, the invading American forces? </sentence><sentence id="4081">Was your group involved? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4087">A: We were involved in -- our group was involved a little later. </sentence><sentence id="4088">A little later, with grave research and registration; because there had been -- for instance, we received parachuted provisions that came into the area of Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="4089">Certain nights when, when the message, the message, the coded message would tell us to be at a certain place at a certain time, and then there would be... We were told to send a flare at a certain time, up in the air, and then few minutes later we would have a drop off of clothing or food items. </sentence><sentence id="4090">The parachutes themselves would be gathered up, and the ladies would make shirts out of them. </sentence><sentence id="4091">They were in khaki or white or pink. </sentence><sentence id="4092">And in the process, in that execution of that particular parachuting help to the Resistance, some were shot down, some had to bail out for one reason or another, some were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="4093">And then later on, in the area a little north of Limoges, there was, of course, there was the region of Cognac, and towards the coast there were evidently fatalities. </sentence><sentence id="4094">After the landing in later weeks, some of our groups and us, we were involved in researching --  0 traveling and researching with farmers and with the countryside people who might have found soldiers, American, Canadian or British soldiers, also some of the Polish-exile forces. </sentence><sentence id="4095">We helped in grave research. </sentence><sentence id="4096">It was grave registration. </sentence><sentence id="4097">That's what we did, we helped. </sentence><sentence id="4098">Later, there were some USO" halls were established, which we helped out with. </sentence><sentence id="4099">But right after the landing and when Limoges was liberated, a committee was formed in Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="4100">It was called COJDASOR -- Comite Juif d'Assistance Social et Reconstruction -- the Jewish Committee for Social Assistance and Reconstruction.** </sentence><sentence id="4101">This was mainly geared to help refugees -- people who had lived in the area and hidden out, and could not do any kind of work during that period and really were penniless, to, to put them on their feet again. </sentence><sentence id="4102">OSE was one of the organizations connected with this. </sentence><sentence id="4103">The Organization for Secours aux Enfants." </sentence><sentence id="4104">A children's organization, OSE. </sentence><sentence id="4105">You are familiar with that, and some of those Zionist organizations were involved, like WIZO" and Hadassah. </sentence><sentence id="4106">And this whole program, that whole committee was supported by the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="4107">So we had an office in Limoges at 15 Avenue du Midi, and some of us, from our group working previously with the underground with the false ID papers, became employed by that office. </sentence><sentence id="4108">And as later, after liberation of Paris, which was in August of "44, and later the victory when people came back from the camps, again this Committee did a good job of, number one, helping them to get over the first hump, and later to establish themselves with a residence. </sentence><sentence id="4109">Even helped them find relatives, because the Committee was in touch with the Red Cross and other organizations and institutions that were, after the war, spring up here and there to just see who had survived and who can be reached. </sentence><sentence id="4110">And all these communication means were used to, whether it was by telegraph or radio or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4111">But the COJDASOR was that committee that was established afterwards, and I worked for that. </sentence><sentence id="4112">But between the landing and actually the liberation, there was just a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="4113">Because, because France fell pretty fast to the forces of Resistance, and then the Germans were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="4114">And the rest took place in the north of France, of course, where the advancing Allied troops just entered Paris in August of "44. </sentence><sentence id="4115">And had one major scare in the winter of "44, when after the Battle of the Bulge the Germans actually advanced far enough to pose a renewed threat to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="4116">But that -- again, time took care of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4147">Q: But you were in Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="4148">Can you describe the day of liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4158">Q: Not D-Day, June sixth, but the liberation itself. </sentence><sentence id="4159">When Limoges was freed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4162">A: Oh, the liberation, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4163">Limoges was freed, was just another normal day, except seeing Germans patrolling the streets and Gestapo patrolling the streets and being in charge here and being in charge there, you saw columns of Gestapo and Germans being led down the street by Resistance fighters. </sentence><sentence id="4164">The great victorious German army led down the street by young people in rag tag outfits. </sentence><sentence id="4165">That was the...that was the impact. </sentence><sentence id="4166">Just a few weeks earlier, I was in a railroad station and saw a column...a unit of German soldiers, waiting for a train that they were taking to some direction. </sentence><sentence id="4167">They were sitting on the platform, on their tucksacks, on their equipment, with their guns standing up, leaning against each other, bayonets drawn, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4168">They have this triangular thing, arrangement there. </sentence><sentence id="4169">One of the soldiers was opening up -- cutting open a can of sardines with his bayonet. </sentence><sentence id="4170">Trying to open it up; and then he ate the sardines out of his -- out of the can, swallowing them all in all. </sentence><sentence id="4171">And in his language, I recognized he must have been either an Austrian or a Bavarian, because having been born in Vienna, I knew what the Austrian accent was. </sentence><sentence id="4172">And he said, in German -- which I will not tell you in German, but I will tell you that in the English translation, "The people that are walking by here," he says, "those French people here. </sentence><sentence id="4173">They will look at us and will say to themselves, "Schen schaut Sie aus, diese Reichsdeutsche Armee!""*"--"She sure looks good, that victorious German army!" </sentence><sentence id="4174">Ina facetious way. </sentence><sentence id="4175">And when we saw those German prisoners walking down the main street of -- with their arms raised on top of their heads, disarmed...that came to my mind. " </sentence><sentence id="4176">You look good, you victorious German Army! </sentence><sentence id="4177">Now that you are guarded by a rag tag outfit, you act like you are the victims." </sentence><sentence id="4178">Or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="4179">That was the main impact. </sentence><sentence id="4180">And that picture, that -- imagine that scene repeated itself over and over in France in all the little villages and towns that became liberated, one by one by one. </sentence><sentence id="4181">The collaborators were arrested, too. </sentence><sentence id="4182">Unfortunately, there was also during that period a lot of spur of the moment, perhaps hasty, emotional reaction to those that we, the underground had perceived as being collaborators, like selling, dealing black market, or cohorting or fraternizing with some of the German officers -- including some of the people that we had known, our own people. </sentence><sentence id="4183">And it was not uncommon for someone whom we knew who did black market, even if they were Jewish, to be executed actually without trial, without jury, without due process. </sentence><sentence id="4184">But the emotions were so high that these things happened in I wouldn't just say a few cases. </sentence><sentence id="4185">There were quite -- there were many. </sentence></p></dialogue>
