</sentence><sentence id="33">Did | cry for joy? </sentence><sentence id="34">But | came to a conclusion that | cried because | felt sorry for myself. </sentence><sentence id="35">| thought where am | going? </sentence><sentence id="36">There's no telephone to pick up and tell I'm coming home. </sentence><sentence id="37">There's no home, no family and sincerely, many kind people say, "Nesse, you talk about the Holocaust and we don't see tears from you." </sentence><sentence id="38">| really cried that time the last time. </sentence><sentence id="39">So once in a while, | have a little tear in my eye. </sentence><sentence id="40">| learned to laugh and to love. </sentence><sentence id="41">But | never cry. </sentence><sentence id="42">So that was this night, the day of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="43">The following day, when the Russians came, they explained to us that the village does not have a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="44">They have a little hotel. </sentence><sentence id="45">They are going to convert this little, it's a inn, not even a hotel. </sentence><sentence id="46">They are going to convert it into a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="47">They are going to try to take the little healthier women and bring them to the village, put "em in the little homes. </sentence><sentence id="48">Some homes were already empty. </sentence><sentence id="49">The Germans had run away being afraid for the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="50">Some, in some homes there were still some Germans that stayed. </sentence><sentence id="51">| know they spoke German, it was a German area. </sentence><sentence id="52">Pomerania, mostly, Polish German, border but this little village was mostly German. </sentence><sentence id="53">They, so the Russians the next day came with little carts, whatever they could take from the villagers, a horse and buggy. </sentence><sentence id="54">|  Nesse Godin 5 December 14, 1995 Page 5 personally was carried by a Russian soldier, on his arms, and he carried me to the village. </sentence><sentence id="55">| was nothing but skin and bones. </sentence><sentence id="56">And he brought me to the village, he put me in the kitchen of that little room, on a straw sack and he said that eventually somebody will come and help me and give me food. </sentence><sentence id="57">A little bit later, they brought another woman that they put next to me on the straw sack. </sentence><sentence id="58">This woman, I'm really sorry that | cannot remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="59">She was a teacher in one of the religious Yovna (ph) schools and | knew her from before the war because | had friends that went to that school. </sentence><sentence id="60">And when | saw her | was so glad that she was there next to me on that straw sack. </sentence><sentence id="61">At least | felt | had someone from home. </sentence><sentence id="62">And the Russian soldiers every day came for a few days, they delivered a little bit food for us. </sentence><sentence id="63">Also, some Jewish women that were a little bit stronger started to cook a little bit, get from the villagers some food or just take it from them and started to cook a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="64">After | was there one day or two days, | really don't remember, one day, one of the women that were a little stronger walked in and just said to me, "What are you doing here with a dead person?" </sentence><sentence id="65">| didn't realize that the woman next to me was dead. </sentence><sentence id="66">They carried her out and | wanted to really go out and go out like, see where they're burying her or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="67">But | couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="68">So | thought let me look out and see how the free world looks. </sentence><sentence id="69">Cause | hadn't seen the free world. </sentence><sentence id="70">Could hardly get up. </sentence><sentence id="71">And there was a windowpane, it was already towards evening. </sentence><sentence id="72">And | looked through  Nesse Godin 6 December 14, 1995 Page 6 that windowpane to see how is freedom? </sentence><sentence id="73">What's outside? </sentence><sentence id="74">And what | saw was a monster. </sentence><sentence id="75">A reflection of a monster in that windowpane. </sentence><sentence id="76">A person, eyes sunken in, really a skeleton covered with skin. </sentence><sentence id="77">That's what | saw. </sentence><sentence id="78">Like you see children for Halloween how they have these masks and | turned around to see who was behind me and there was no one there. </sentence><sentence id="79">And this is when | realized how | looked. </sentence><sentence id="80">How | looked. </sentence><sentence id="81">| did not really imagine that | looked that way. </sentence><sentence id="82">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="83">After a few days being in that house, one, a truck or a car, a truck, | believe it was a truck that came and picked us up and took us to that makeshift hospital. </sentence><sentence id="84">What | remember of that coming to the hospital, | remember them shaving my head, shaving my private parts wherever hair is, washing me with some kind of a disinfectant because | remember a burn of a, where they shaved. </sentence><sentence id="85">And then | didn't remember anything else. </sentence><sentence id="86">Not a thing. </sentence><sentence id="87">Next thing | remember, opening my eyes and seeing a man with a white coat on and talking to me in Russian, explaining to me that he is a doctor, that | shouldn't worry, I'm in a hospital and he would love to know my name. </sentence><sentence id="88">Because they did not have time to register me when | became unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="89">According to what they told me | was three days unconscious with high fever of typhus and typhoid, those two different diseases. </sentence><sentence id="90">And him telling me that the most thing that he's worried about is that my toes were frozen and he just hopes that they wouldn't have to be amputated. </sentence><sentence id="91">And as | started to tell him my age, people from down the row, it was   Nesse Godin 7 December 14, 1995 Page 7 like a big ward with many beds, somebody else tells "Oh, Nesa that's you! </sentence><sentence id="92">We didn't know who this was. </sentence><sentence id="93">Everybody asked do you know this person?" </sentence><sentence id="94">And there were a few people from my hometown that | knew and | really felt already more comfortable about it. </sentence><sentence id="95">So | was gettin" a little better. </sentence><sentence id="96">People started to leave from the hospital and then | was transferred to another smaller room. </sentence><sentence id="97">The main thing, the treatment was on my legs. </sentence><sentence id="98">And | don't even remember if | ever said that, if | gave this testimony or not but | really feel | should tell it now. </sentence><sentence id="99">| decided that | don't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="100">After all this that | went through, the stupidity of me, not wanting to live was, now when | think back of it, it was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="101">| heard and saw some people were united with the, right there in that hospital there was a mother and a daughter and here | was all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="102">| thought what do you need to live for? </sentence><sentence id="103">So | decided to do a hunger strike and every time they brought a little food, | just threw it out or gave it to the lady next to me. </sentence><sentence id="104">And she was, | thought of that, I'm terrible but now | think of her as wonderful, she told on me. </sentence><sentence id="105">So they wouldn't walk out from the room until | finished the food. </sentence><sentence id="106">And | really recovered pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="107">My, what was at that point, | still had, you see at the very end on the death march | was beaten up severely. </sentence><sentence id="108">And | still had my face swollen. </sentence><sentence id="109">My toes had kind of, the, the, a big layer that was frozen of the skin just peeled off, like, like you see a snake change his skin? </sentence><sentence id="110">That's how this came off. </sentence><sentence id="111">And my temperature   Nesse Godin 8 December 14, 1995 Page 8 went down and | gained a little bit weight so, they kept me there because | was alone for a while. </sentence><sentence id="112">And then one day they told me | have to go down to the office. </sentence><sentence id="113">The office was like a little room. </sentence><sentence id="114">And when | came down there, they said to me, "We are going to close this hospital and you can go now. </sentence><sentence id="115">We feel you're in good shape. </sentence><sentence id="116">You can go." </sentence><sentence id="117">And | said to them, "Where should | go?" </sentence><sentence id="118">They said, "Well, you want to go up, where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="119">| said, "I'm from Lithuania but | don't have a home.| don't have a family, | don't have anybody. </sentence><sentence id="120">| don't know where | should go. </sentence><sentence id="121">I'm 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="122">| don't know what to do." </sentence><sentence id="123">So they asked the lady that was next to me where she was from and she happened to be from Lithuania and because | was just 17, | was a minor. </sentence><sentence id="124">| was assigned to her. </sentence><sentence id="125">| became her ward. </sentence><sentence id="126">We had one document that stated her name and my name, my last name and saying that she's in charge because I'm a minor. </sentence><sentence id="127">And that's how we left Freenuv (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Do you have her name? </sentence><sentence id="266">Do you remember her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: | don't, | remember her first name, Hannah, but | don't think | ever knew her last name. </sentence><sentence id="270">| don't think | ever knew it. </sentence><sentence id="271">She was very kind. </sentence><sentence id="272">She was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="273">She was more like a sister to me than a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="274">So we left, with the idea to go to Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="275">She had left a child for safe, safekeeping with a Lithuanian family. </sentence><sentence id="276">She was from Kaunas and she really thought that maybe her child is alive. </sentence><sentence id="277">She wants to go back. </sentence><sentence id="278">Now | wanted to go to Lithuania because the last thing that we said to each other   Nesse Godin 9 December 14, 1995 Page 9 when we came to the concentration camp, that is my brother and my mom before we were separated, if we survive this hell, we have to make a meeting point, back home in Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="279">So okay. </sentence><sentence id="280">So this | had back in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="281">And | thought after all, we had a home, we had a business, we left belongings with non-Jewish people for safekeeping. </sentence><sentence id="282">Maybe I'll find it. </sentence><sentence id="283">So that was my plan. </sentence><sentence id="284">So there we go. </sentence><sentence id="285">You couldn't go to the railroad station, say | want to buy a ticket to go to Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="286">Didn't work that way. </sentence><sentence id="287">See you are very young, | don't know if you understand that. </sentence><sentence id="288">That first it, it wasn't even, the war hadn't even ended yet, so a military trucks were going east and they were going west and they were going south. </sentence><sentence id="289">Trains were going back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="290">The Russians were looting Germany and taking machinery back to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="291">So you hitchhiked. </sentence><sentence id="292">You hitchhiked on a train, on a freight train. </sentence><sentence id="293">You stood there, you told them you want to go little bit east, they took you. </sentence><sentence id="294">They said, "You want to go up to this and this little town, we'll take you." </sentence><sentence id="295">Then you have to wait for a next train and it took weeks until you got at least somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="296">And this is the way we arrived in the city of Lodz, Poland. </sentence><sentence id="297">When we arrived in Lodz, Poland, like through the grapevine while we were traveling people were telling us that in Lodz, Poland, there is already shelters. </sentence><sentence id="298">Christian relief, Red Cross, Jewish relief, Hiyas (ph), the Join (ph), some kind of Jewish agencies helping out refugees. </sentence><sentence id="299">All of a sudden we were called refugees. </sentence><sentence id="300">So, we were very glad to arrive in Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="301">When we came Nesse Godin 10 December 14, 1995 Page 10 there, there was a big shelter on 66. </sentence><sentence id="302">| remember that address and we, when we came in there was a very big room, we signed in, we were assigned where to go to sleep and in that room on the walls, there were big billboards. </sentence><sentence id="303">Posters like, and it was divided by country and divided each country more or less by city. </sentence><sentence id="304">And you, if let's say if you were from Kaunas, Kaunas and surrounding and surround Siauliai, that's in Lithuania was called and surrounding. </sentence><sentence id="305">So | saw quite a few names there and | wrote down my name. </sentence><sentence id="306">That was in case somebody of your family comes. </sentence><sentence id="307">That's how you got connected. </sentence><sentence id="308">You see when | tell it to people, they cannot understand why would you want to write your name on a posterboard but this was the way you found each other. </sentence><sentence id="309">Your name and where you are staying, whether you are continuing, whether you are in Lodz, wherever. </sentence><sentence id="310">And that particular, that shelter was, there was a big courtyard with many houses on, see in Europe, some people don't understand that especially in the large cities, they used to have a whole courtyard maybe six, seven buildings. </sentence><sentence id="311">And you had to go in through a gate and it was closed for the night. </sentence><sentence id="312">And so we were assigned in that same courtyard, a place. </sentence><sentence id="313">Now all that night | thought to myself, why didn't | write down my name within eyesight. </sentence><sentence id="314">| wrote it down kind of low in the poster, nobody's going to bend down and look for my name. </sentence><sentence id="315">| was 17, | wasn't too bright. </sentence><sentence id="316">And | could hardly wait for the next day to go back and put my name with eye level on that thing. </sentence><sentence id="317">| said, "I'll put it  Nesse Godin 11 December 14, 1995 Page 11 on again, that's alright, nobody's going to say why do you have it twice." </sentence><sentence id="318">And, as | was writing my name, Nesa Galperin, that was my name N,E,S,A G,A,L,P,E,R,I,N. Galperin. </sentence><sentence id="319">And a woman said to me, "What Galperin, are you from Siauliai?" </sentence><sentence id="320">She was standing right next to me. </sentence><sentence id="321">And why did she ask that way? </sentence><sentence id="322">Just if you come of European background, you can understand, they usually said, "Il am Galperin, the, the doctor Galperin, the lawyer Galperin, the shoemaker." </sentence><sentence id="323">My parents had a dairy business, | said, "| am Galperin from the dairy business from the , from the dairy business." </sentence><sentence id="324">And the woman looked at me and she said, "No, Nesa, that's you, you look so terrible, | would never recognize you." </sentence><sentence id="325">And, and she said that. </sentence><sentence id="326">| thought to myself, isn't she crazy? </sentence><sentence id="327">Everybody looks terrible. </sentence><sentence id="328">And when | looked at her, | recognized the lady. </sentence><sentence id="329">She was a very nice lady. </sentence><sentence id="330">But before the war, everybody called her the, the , the person that is not all there. </sentence><sentence id="331">She had some mental problems. </sentence><sentence id="332">And next thing out of that woman's mouth was, "Oh, | was with your mother in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="333">She's in this and this shelter in this and this village." </sentence><sentence id="334">And | said, "You were with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="335">My mother was taken to Galepf (ph) in Shtoodruff (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="336">She said, "Yes but then there was another selection and they took the people in the sixties away to the left," and asked, she was maybe in her thirties and my mother was in the forty, she said, "They took us again and send us to labor." </sentence><sentence id="337">Now as young as | was, | thought can | believe a crazy woman? </sentence><sentence id="338"> Nesse Godin 12 December 14, 1995 Page 12 Always people said the crazy so and so. </sentence><sentence id="339">So | didn't know but | thought, | said, "Well, maybe | should check it out." </sentence><sentence id="340">So | go up to the lady, to this Hannah, who is my, whose ward | am and | said to her, "We have to go back to the German border." </sentence><sentence id="341">She looked at me, she says, "Child you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="342">Nobody goes back, everybody goes forward." </sentence><sentence id="343">| said, "But somebody told me that my mother is there, near the German border." </sentence><sentence id="344">She said, "I love you but how can | go with you to your mother? </sentence><sentence id="345">| want to go to my own child." </sentence><sentence id="346">| said, "But you have to go with me, you have the document." </sentence><sentence id="347">So she took the piece of paper, she tore it to pieces, she said to me, "Go over to the desk, tell them you're 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="348">And you'll have your own document." </sentence><sentence id="349">So | went over to the desk. </sentence><sentence id="350">| told them I'm 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="351">| need a, a document. </sentence><sentence id="352">They gave me the document. </sentence><sentence id="353">Now everybody's traveling one way, I'm traveling the other. </sentence><sentence id="354">Everybody's going east, I'm going west. </sentence><sentence id="355">Some Russian soldier felt sorry for me, gave me his coat. </sentence><sentence id="356">And it was May already. </sentence><sentence id="357">| remember being on one of the trains and hearing a lot of shooting and thinking that we are being bombed but that was the celebration of VE Day and | arrived at that village. </sentence><sentence id="358">Got to the village, found the shelter, walk in there and | see women from my hometown and | recognize them, some woman that had bakery, another one that had a dry goods store, another one that had, that sold buttons and thread and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="359">And | look at with my eyes and they say, "Who are you?" </sentence><sentence id="360">And | say again,   Nesse Godin 13 December 14, 1995 Page 13 "I'm Galperin from the dairy business." " </sentence><sentence id="361">Oh, Nesa, your mom heard that you were alive and she heard that you were in Lodz and she went there to look for you." </sentence><sentence id="362">So you can see, this isn't just my story, how we survivors went looking for families back and forth, back and forth, hearing rumors, trying to find each other. </sentence><sentence id="363">It took me about maybe another two weeks or three weeks to get back to Lodz. </sentence></p></dialogue>

have been intelligent." </sentence><sentence id="589">Now how intelligent was it? </sentence><sentence id="590">| was just a kid. </sentence><sentence id="591">It, | survived maybe by the grace of

</sentence><sentence id="595">| really don't know what made my mother survive. </sentence><sentence id="596">My mother always, when she died 27 years ago here in the United States, she alway, at that

</sentence><sentence id="600">At one point she said to me, "They told another woman to take off the shoes and give it to her and the woman went there and she, she, she was still alive." </sentence><sentence id="601">So we don't know how but when we were reunited, we became really like one person. </sentence><sentence id="602">We, | didn't even want my mother to leave that room. </sentence><sentence id="603">She used to have to go down to bring up some food or get in that shelter some food or, or food stamps or whatever we, like little nut foods, there was a little ticket to go to get the food. </sentence><sentence id="604">| was always afraid that if she leaves me that | won't see her again. </sentence><sentence id="605">And from the day of liberation, no from the day of

which | do very often. </sentence><sentence id="615">| go constantly for my father. </sentence><sentence id="616">| don't even know where his ashes are. </sentence><sentence id="617">So you ask me that question. </sentence><sentence id="618">We were inseparable and | was lucky that my husband Jack just adored my mother. </sentence><sentence id="619">He really was, he lost his whole family. </sentence><sentence id="620">He cannot even listen to me speak about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="621">And he was very kind and glad to have her and we cherished her. </sentence><sentence id="622">Anyway, to continue what happened afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="623">So one day, my mother comes upstairs after going to look get some food or some clothing, | don't remember and she tells me that she ran into a gentleman that was with the Soviet Army by the name of Tabreeshock (ph). </sentence><sentence id="624">My father's younger sister, her   Nesse Godin 18 December 14, 1995 Page 18 married name was Tabreeshock (ph). </sentence><sentence id="625">This gentleman told my mother that he stationed in Lodz and his cousin who was my uncle by marriage and my aunt, my father's sister succeeded to escape from Vilna, just as the, before the Germans marched in to the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="626">That they have returned back to Vilna and they hope as Polish

</sentence><sentence id="627">And most people did not want to stay in the Soviet Union cause it was Communism and most Jewish people had the dream at that time to, to go to Israel or to come to America. </sentence><sentence id="628">So he told us that he knows that in a very short time, he doesn't know it'll take a week or two weeks or three weeks that his cousin and, and, he's, my aunt who's, he's cousin to by marriage are going to try to come to Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="629">We shouldn't go nowhere, we'll be reunited. </sentence><sentence id="630">So we were anticipating every day are they coming, are they coming? </sentence><sentence id="631">My mother went always to check if their name is on the board and finally they arrive. </sentence><sentence id="632">They arrive in Lodz, my uncle, my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="633">They had a boy that was twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="634">My uncle's best friend, he's my, his best friend's brother and the brother's best friend, so there are three single men with my uncle and my aunt and that little boy. </sentence><sentence id="635">So we are already a family unit. </sentence><sentence id="636">Here we are surrounded with my aunt and my uncle and, and a few guys that are there and we are all looking, where should we Nesse Godin 19 December 14, 1995 Page 19 go? </sentence><sentence id="637">Where should we go. </sentence><sentence id="638">We get already messages that the men were liberated from Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="639">We hear already that the men that were taken to Shtoodruff (ph) that came with us from Siauliai were taken to Dachau and the camps of Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="640">So we are waiting to hear maybe someone of the men survived. </sentence><sentence id="641">Eventually come a few gentlemen that were liberated from Dachau that are from my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="642">What they did, they decided to send out a few people to come to Poland, see if, and tell the women don't go back to the Soviet Union, don't go to Communism. </sentence><sentence id="643">Try to come to the American Zone. </sentence><sentence id="644">So and so they came with list telling who survived. </sentence><sentence id="645">On that list was my brother's name. </sentence><sentence id="646">And we knew this, one of this gentleman and he said you, to my mother, "Your son said if | find you, try every which way to come to the American Zone." </sentence><sentence id="647">Why was the aim to go to the American Zone? </sentence><sentence id="648">My mother had a sister that lived in Washington, D.C. And if we would be in the American Zone, we would be able to come to America. </sentence><sentence id="649">So here we are, all this group of people, not knowing what to do. </sentence><sentence id="650">So one day, my mother says to me, "You know, Nesa, we two women alone, we couldn't do all this traveling." </sentence><sentence id="651">We couldn't, you still had to go a little bit across the border, there was no really regulations about the border. </sentence><sentence id="652">But still you have to take a chance, you had to take a truck, you had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="653">She says, "We two women alone couldn't really manage all of this. </sentence><sentence id="654">One of us have to get married." </sentence><sentence id="655">And | looked at my mother and | thought she has me. </sentence><sentence id="656">Why  Nesse Godin 20 December 14, 1995 Page 20 does she want to get married? </sentence><sentence id="657">But the next thing out of my mother's mouth was, "My child, | had a wonderful husband. </sentence><sentence id="658">He was killed in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="659">But you, it's true you're very young. </sentence><sentence id="660">Maybe you should get married." </sentence><sentence id="661">So | looked at her, | said, "Where do | get a husband?" </sentence><sentence id="662">And she said, "Look at those guys, three guys, single guys. </sentence><sentence id="663">The friend of the uncle's, his brother and his friend." </sentence><sentence id="664">Well | looked at the three guys and | said, "Well this one is too old. </sentence><sentence id="665">This one is too short and maybe this one." </sentence><sentence id="666">So my mother said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="667">Now | don't know how Jack and | got married, | really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="668">We, we just talked that it would be a good idea and | never kissed him before or anything and we went and we did a document that I'm his wife. </sentence><sentence id="669">And so, we were already like a, a threesome, a family. </sentence><sentence id="670">But | really didn't, legally, | was his wife but for all practical services we were not husband and wife until later on we had the religious wedding. </sentence><sentence id="671">So here we are, trying to find out how can we get to the American Zone. </sentence><sentence id="672">So everybody says not a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="673">There is a, the Jewish agent, he's helping out people to go across the border. </sentence><sentence id="674">Once you get into Berlin, Berlin had four zones: The Russian Zone, the French Zone, the English Zone, the American Zone. </sentence><sentence id="675">So to go to the Russian Zone was no problem because we were in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="676">And we didn't have any luggage, we didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="677">So we took a walk and we were in the American Zone. </sentence><sentence id="678">And when we registered there in the camp and eventually through the Jewish Agency, people came and helped you  Nesse Godin 21 December 14, 1995 Page 21 to go to wherever you had family. </sentence><sentence id="679">And my brother was already at that point in a displaced person camp called Feldafing. </sentence><sentence id="680">And in October of 1945, we arrived in the displaced person camp. </sentence><sentence id="681">At that point, we had separated from the rest of the people because we were privileged to go to Feldafing because my brother was there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
