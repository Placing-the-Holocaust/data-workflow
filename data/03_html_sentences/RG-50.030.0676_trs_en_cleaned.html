<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Tell me about how and when you left Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Well, in 1939 or in 1938 -- I'm sorry -- all immigrant Jews were asked to leave Italy. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">This is when Mussolini and Hitler became close. </sentence><sentence id="217">And we didn't know, of course, where to go. </sentence><sentence id="218">And we didn't want to return to Germany, and we could not obtain affidavits to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="219">My parents had cousins and distant relatives, but they were bringing their own families over, so they couldn't do anything for us. </sentence><sentence id="220">So my father, who had business acquaintances in Holland still dating back to when he was working in Germany, called them, and he procured a position in a shoe factory. </sentence><sentence id="221">So we gave away -- we gave up all of what we had because we had to leave our possessions, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="222">And we took the train to Lugano. </sentence><sentence id="223">And there a gentleman accompanied us across the border into Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="224">And in Zurich we took a plane to Amsterdam via Paris. </sentence><sentence id="225">We arrived in Amsterdam and we were denied entry because we had German passports which had a big Jon them. </sentence><sentence id="226">And they wanted to send us back to Germany, but of course we did not think that was a very good idea, so my father did a little persuading. </sentence><sentence id="227">And they agreed to let us stay overnight at the airport and we would leave the next day. </sentence><sentence id="228">And from Milan we went to Paris, but there is a story in between. </sentence><sentence id="229">We were waiting for the plane to leave, and I had never seen a plane take off. </sentence><sentence id="230">This was in Holland, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="231">And my father lifted me onto a heat register and didn't realize how hot it was. </sentence><sentence id="232">He sat me on it and burned my derriere. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="233">And I was very badly burned. </sentence><sentence id="234">But we got on the plane. </sentence><sentence id="235">And the doctor -- a gentleman noticed that I was very uncomfortable sitting, so he approached my parents. </sentence><sentence id="236">And he happened to be a doctor from Vienn </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: And he and my parents began a conversation. </sentence><sentence id="238">And he apparently told them to go -- the best thing was to go to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="239">He advised my father that the situation for the immigrant Jews in Milan was bad, not to go back there, and to stay in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="240">And he even suggested a hotel there where we might stay. </sentence><sentence id="241">And we were there for about three weeks and then obtained permission to go to Caen, C-A-E-N, for the next six months. </sentence><sentence id="242">And now we go to the year of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="243">My father joined the French Army, and my mother and I stayed in Caen at a hotel where she was a waitress. </sentence><sentence id="244">And very soon thereafter the Germans occupied the city and took over the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="245">So my mother was supposed to be a Swiss citizen because she couldn't speak French by that time and could only speak German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Was she posing as a Swiss citizen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: She was posing as a Swiss citizen. </sentence><sentence id="258">And she took me aside and told me -- warned me that if any of the German soldiers approached me and spoke to me, to pretend I didn't understand them, to answer them in French or Italian. </sentence><sentence id="259">So lo and behold, a German soldier did approach me and asked "Wie heifen Sie?" </sentence><sentence id="260">What is your name, in German. </sentence><sentence id="261">And I answered, "Je ne comprends pas ce." </sentence><sentence id="262">I don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="263">And he persisted, and another German soldier joined him. </sentence><sentence id="264">And they were talking between them about the little girl who they left in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="265">And so after a while they let me go. </sentence><sentence id="266">And I was scared to death. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Was this in the hotel in Caen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Inthe hotel, yes. </sentence><sentence id="281">They were going -- I remember being at the bottom of the stairs, and the restroom was on the side and they were going to go into the restroom and they happened to see me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: And how old were you at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: Iwas six. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: So were you already enrolled in school or not yet? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: No, I was not. </sentence><sentence id="291">I was not because soon thereafter it was time to flee again. </sentence><sentence id="292">And this time we went to Le Mans, France. </sentence><sentence id="293">That's capital L-E and then capital M-A-N-S. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: And what caused you to flee? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Well, the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="301">We were running away from them. </sentence><sentence id="302">And we stayed in Le Mans until 1940, until the Germans approached and began bombing the city. </sentence><sentence id="303">So I guess my father came -- was on furlough from the Army, I don't remember which, but talked to a French citizen who accompanied us across the boarder to what we thought was the unoccupied zone. </sentence><sentence id="304">That was southern -- southwestern France, to the village of Castelmoron-sur-Lot. </sentence><sentence id="305">Did you want me to spell all these words, these names? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Ifyou can. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: It's C-A-S-T-E-L-M-O-R-O-N, and then next word is S-U-R, and the third name -- word is Lot, capital L-O-T. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: And can you tell me, how did you get from one place to another at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: Walking. </sentence><sentence id="319">And all of us were walking very leisurely. </sentence><sentence id="320">And all of a sudden my mother asked me to go down and make pee pee. </sentence><sentence id="321">And I responded that I didn't have to. </sentence><sentence id="322">And she said again, "Sit down and make pee pee." </sentence><sentence id="323">And I said, "I don't have to." </sentence><sentence id="324">And finally she slapped me and pushed me down. </sentence><sentence id="325">And of course, I started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="326">I was hurt. </sentence><sentence id="327">I was -- And then later she explained to me that the Germans from the occupied zone of France were watching us with their binoculars and we were supposed to make it look like a promenade, a leisurely walk, and not an escape. </sentence><sentence id="328">And then the gentleman who was with us led us to the nearest farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="329">And I remember hiding in the shed where tobacco was hanging, hung drying. </sentence><sentence id="330">And the next two days we slept in stalls and different barns. </sentence><sentence id="331">And I remember noises at night. </sentence><sentence id="332">There were rats and mice. </sentence><sentence id="333">We had no green card, so we were at the mercy of the farmers who did give us food and shelter. </sentence><sentence id="334">And we trusted them that they wouldn't turn us in to the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Can you tell me for a moment what you mean by "green card"? </sentence><sentence id="353">Do you mean a special transit card? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: I'm using that as an example. </sentence><sentence id="357">As we have green cards here, it was -- I can't think -- an identification card. </sentence><sentence id="358">Being noncitizens, we had to have identification. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: So you were walking from one town to the next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: We were walking. </sentence><sentence id="365">And we continued to make our way then to the town of Castelmoron. </sentence><sentence id="366">And of course, we had to find a place to live. </sentence><sentence id="367">And my parents did. </sentence><sentence id="368">It was very, very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="369">The entry was just dirt and had wood to burn in the fireplace, and living quarters were upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="370">And there was just one bedroom and a very primitive kitchen with a wood-burning stove and a fireplace. </sentence><sentence id="371">No bathroom, indoor or outdoor. </sentence><sentence id="372">We just used a bucket, which had to be emptied every day. </sentence><sentence id="373">And my parents got jobs. </sentence><sentence id="374">They acquired jobs in a belt factory, doing assembly work. </sentence><sentence id="375">And then I started school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: When you started school, did you have to pose as a non-Jewish child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: You know, I don't -- we were the only Jews in that little village. </sentence><sentence id="391">The children probably didn't know, but I'm sure their parents knew. </sentence><sentence id="392">People were very, very good to us there. </sentence><sentence id="393">There was never anything that I remember said from any of the children, anything derogatory. </sentence><sentence id="394">And then in 1940 of course the Vichy government came into power, whose leader was Marshal Philippe Petain. </sentence><sentence id="395">Capital P-E-T-A-I-N. And of course, he -- his bosses were the Germans, were the SS, the Nazis, even though he had fought against Germany in World War I. He just turned around completely. </sentence><sentence id="396">And from that time I guess until the end of the war, we were hunted. </sentence><sentence id="397">We lived underground most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="398">Our neighbors knew we were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="399">And then the next thing I remember was that my parents told me that they have to leave or they were warned beforehand by a sympathetic official from the police that there would be a house-to-house search and that they had better flee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: And this was still in Castelmoron? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="413">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="414">And they left me in the care of the French family who owned the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="415">And of course, they didn't say where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="416">I had no idea where they were or when and if I would see them again. </sentence><sentence id="417">So I was sent to Catholic church on Sundays and catechism after school. </sentence><sentence id="418">They told my parents, "Well, if she can't practice her religion, she should have something. </sentence><sentence id="419">So send her to church and to catechism." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="420">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the family who you were hidden with? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: Well, they also owned the factory. </sentence><sentence id="422">And of course, they gave my parents a job. </sentence><sentence id="423">So my parents felt that they should listen to them and send me to church. </sentence><sentence id="424">And they were very, very sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="425">Very nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: And how were you hidden? </sentence><sentence id="432">Were you taken in as part of the family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="435">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="436">I was like part of the family. </sentence><sentence id="437">I had no problems, except I was very homesick. </sentence><sentence id="438">I didn't know when and if my parents would return or when and if I would even see them again. </sentence><sentence id="439">It was months before we were reunited. </sentence><sentence id="440">And I guess my parents had gone to a different town where they knew a German-Jewish family who owned a farm. </sentence><sentence id="441">And this family had two daughters a little bit older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="442">As a matter of fact, they had their daughters converted to Catholicism so that their lives would be saved. </sentence><sentence id="443">They were -- Both girls were baptized. </sentence><sentence id="444">So they went into hiding there and I stayed with a French family. </sentence><sentence id="445">And when I started going to church, my father even bought me the New Testment, prayer book, and a rosary. </sentence><sentence id="446">He was not an Orthodox Jew, but he was fairly traditional, so that was an unusual thing for him to do, but then our lives were in question. </sentence><sentence id="447">So I continued attending church and catechism. </sentence><sentence id="448">And then one day the priest approached me about baptizing me, and he mentioned that I needed to have a religion. </sentence><sentence id="449">And I responded, I said, "I do have one. </sentence><sentence id="450">I'm Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="451">And he said, "Well, that's really not a religion, but I have to talk to your father, and he's going to have to convert first." </sentence><sentence id="452">So he did. </sentence><sentence id="453">He spoke to my dad. </sentence><sentence id="454">And my dad told him, "Father, I'm very sorry," he said, "I'm not a very good Jew. </sentence><sentence id="455">I'd make an even worse Catholic." </sentence><sentence id="456">So that was the end of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: How did the priest know where your father was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
