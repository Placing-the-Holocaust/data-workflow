<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: I'm using that as an example. </sentence><sentence id="381">As we have green cards here, it was -- I can't think -- an identification card. </sentence><sentence id="382">Being noncitizens, we had to have identification. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: So you were walking from one town to the next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: We were walking. </sentence><sentence id="389">And we continued to make our way then to the town of Castelmoron. </sentence><sentence id="390">And of course, we had to find a place to live. </sentence><sentence id="391">And my parents did. </sentence><sentence id="392">It was very, very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="393">The entry was just dirt and had wood to burn in the fireplace, and living quarters were upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="394">And there was just one bedroom and a very primitive kitchen with a wood-burning stove and a fireplace. </sentence><sentence id="395">No bathroom, indoor or outdoor. </sentence><sentence id="396">We just used a bucket, which had to be emptied every day. </sentence><sentence id="397">And my parents got jobs. </sentence><sentence id="398">They acquired jobs in a belt factory, doing assembly work. </sentence><sentence id="399">And then I started school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: When you started school, did you have to pose as a non-Jewish child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: You know, I don't -- we were the only Jews in that little village. </sentence><sentence id="415">The children probably didn't know, but I'm sure their parents knew. </sentence><sentence id="416">People were very, very good to us there. </sentence><sentence id="417">There was never anything that I remember said from any of the children, anything derogatory. </sentence><sentence id="418">And then in 1940 of course the Vichy government came into power, whose leader was Marshal Philippe Petain. </sentence><sentence id="419">Capital P-E-T-A-I-N. And of course, he -- his bosses were the Germans, were the SS, the Nazis, even though he had fought against Germany in World War I. He just turned around completely. </sentence><sentence id="420">And from that time I guess until the end of the war, we were hunted. </sentence><sentence id="421">We lived underground most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="422">Our neighbors knew we were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="423">And then the next thing I remember was that my parents told me that they have to leave or they were warned beforehand by a sympathetic official from the police that there would be a house-to-house search and that they had better flee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="434">Q: And this was still in Castelmoron? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="436">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="437">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="438">And they left me in the care of the French family who owned the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="439">And of course, they didn't say where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="440">I had no idea where they were or when and if I would see them again. </sentence><sentence id="441">So I was sent to Catholic church on Sundays and catechism after school. </sentence><sentence id="442">They told my parents, "Well, if she can't practice her religion, she should have something. </sentence><sentence id="443">So send her to church and to catechism." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="444">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the family who you were hidden with? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: Well, they also owned the factory. </sentence><sentence id="446">And of course, they gave my parents a job. </sentence><sentence id="447">So my parents felt that they should listen to them and send me to church. </sentence><sentence id="448">And they were very, very sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="449">Very nice. </sentence><sentence id="450">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="451">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="452"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
