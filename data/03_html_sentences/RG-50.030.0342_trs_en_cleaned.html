<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Good afternoon, Flory. </sentence><sentence id="4">Can you please tell me your full name and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: My name is Flory Jagoda, and I was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia. </sentence><sentence id="8">You want to know when? </sentence><sentence id="9">I don't think I should tell you -- December 21st, 1923. </sentence><sentence id="10">A lot of years. </sentence><sentence id="11">Actually, most of the survivors are this age, maybe a little younger, a little older. </sentence><sentence id="12">But this is more or less around 70s and so. </sentence><sentence id="13">And they have one thing in common -- silence. </sentence><sentence id="14">They sort of don't like to talk. </sentence><sentence id="15">We don't like to -- it is almost like a wound that, you know, you heal. </sentence><sentence id="16">And you don't want to scratch it. </sentence><sentence id="17">It bleeds. </sentence><sentence id="18">And also, a lot of them do not want to burden their families, especially their children, with sadness. </sentence><sentence id="19">They want to forget. </sentence><sentence id="20">And it works for a while. </sentence><sentence id="21">You have children, and you have weddings, and grandchildren, and music lessons, and piano lessons. </sentence><sentence id="22">And I was teaching music myself for 25 years. </sentence><sentence id="23">So I was quite a busy lady. </sentence><sentence id="24">Then all of a sudden, children leave, and marry, and get a little older. </sentence><sentence id="25">And you know, you don't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="26">You sort of start dreaming, and seeing some images and faces of your family -- and, uh, you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless. </sentence><sentence id="27">And, uh, then you read these horrible stories -- there was no holocaust -- never happened -- and you know what that means to a survivor -- no holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="28">Your whole inner starts screaming. </sentence><sentence id="29">I think the age -- and I also think the story of the holocaust never happened -- is -- I think it broke the silence of a lot of holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="30">Age definitely had something to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="31">So here Iam. </sentence><sentence id="32">I'm going to take you to a small little town in Bosnia, and share with you my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="33">Actually, I'm not going to start in Sarajevo. </sentence><sentence id="34">We will go about 98 kilometers up northeast Bosnia, a small town called Vlasenica, very picturesque. </sentence><sentence id="35">It's know for its pine trees. </sentence><sentence id="36">My whole family lived there. </sentence><sentence id="37">Their name was Altarac, the Altarac family. </sentence><sentence id="38">And they were very proud of their name. </sentence><sentence id="39">It meant , the high place -- very proud of that. </sentence><sentence id="40">And, you know, all these towns that you read today unfortunately, from Srebenica to Rogatica to, which is close to Gorazde, to Travnik, to Zvornik -- all these little, tiny towns had -- besides Moslems and Serbs, they also had a Bosnian Sephardi Jewish communities. </sentence><sentence id="41">A lot of people don't know that -- Bosnian Jews -- Los Judeos Bosnia, they would say in Ladino. </sentence><sentence id="42">And they came from Sarajevo. </sentence><sentence id="43">Actually, they were descendants of the Spanish refugees that were expelled from Spain in 1492 -- the inquisition -- Spain and Portugal. </sentence><sentence id="44">The word Sepharad means Iberian peninsula in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="45">Actually, they had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="46">I mean, they had to leave, or convert to Catholicism, or leave home. </sentence><sentence id="47">They were given three months. </sentence><sentence id="48">A lot of them converted. </sentence><sentence id="49">A lot of them remained. </sentence><sentence id="50">They couldn't leave the country they really loved. </sentence><sentence id="51">My ancestors went towards Turkey. </sentence><sentence id="52">There sultan Bayazid II gave orders to -- throughout his Ottoman Empire -- to let the refugees in, give them freedom, to worship, to build synagogues, and, most of all, freedom to travel through his Ottoman Empire. </sentence><sentence id="53">So there were big communities in Salonika, Greece, Bulgaria -- Sarajevo definitely became a thriving Sephardi community. </sentence><sentence id="54">They called it a Yirushaliam, the small Jerusalem, with their religious schools and -- so, from Sarajevo, looking for new opportunities, they went to these small towns and villages that you read about today. </sentence><sentence id="55">Now the life in Vlasenica -- it was a very simple life. </sentence><sentence id="56">The family was very close nit, about 15 families, 15, 16, families -- most of them, Altarac families. </sentence><sentence id="57">And in my family, definitely, the leader was my nona (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="58">my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="59">My nona was a kind of a grandmother that a child dreams of having, not because only -- I mean, her voice was something that was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="60">She sang beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="61">But she was a midwife, a well known midwife, in all the neighboring villages, she knew herbs. </sentence><sentence id="62">Her house was always full of women with babies and children -- "What do I give to this one?" -- " </sentence><sentence id="63">What do I" -- "What herb do I use?". </sentence><sentence id="64">She was the one to put the first pair of earrings through the babies" ears. </sentence><sentence id="65">And naturally, she was the leader of her own band, as we say in America -- leader of the band. </sentence><sentence id="66">She had her own singing family, which was well known as the Altarac family, the singing Altarac family, five daughters and three sons. </sentence><sentence id="67">She was the teacher of religion in the house. </sentence><sentence id="68">Women did not go to the synagogue as much as we see here. </sentence><sentence id="69">The men usually went to synagogue, took their sons, taught them Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="70">And the woman stayed at home, and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition, religion, heritage. </sentence><sentence id="71">All that she learned from her nona, and her bis- nona, the great grandmother, just went on from generation to generation. </sentence><sentence id="72">They lived there for about four centuries, and the old peacefully died, and the young were born and married, and there was harmony in Vlasenica -- the Moslems and Serbs and Jews lived in harmony there. </sentence><sentence id="73">I never remember hate or quarrels. </sentence><sentence id="74">The women visited and the children went to school together. </sentence><sentence id="75">I would never, never, never, believe that the madness of the Second World War would bring something. </sentence><sentence id="76">So, uh, the life didn't have too much change. </sentence><sentence id="77">And more or less, everybody was quite satisfied, went along with the life as it was. </sentence><sentence id="78">But my nona's family -- there was one daughter -- she just couldn't take it -- that was my mother, Rosa (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="79">And she was actually considered as a rebel. </sentence><sentence id="80">I mean, she always dreamt of far-away places, she read books that she was not supposed to read. </sentence><sentence id="81">If there was something in the family -- or the girls wanted to try something new, let Rosa do it first -- to eat something -- let Rosa taste it first. </sentence><sentence id="82">She was just very, very different. </sentence><sentence id="83">So finally, she talked her family to send her to Sarajevo, which was a thriving -- I mean, big city at that time, huh? </sentence><sentence id="84">And she went to stay with my tia esperansa (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="85">Tia is aunt. </sentence><sentence id="86">And I will be adding some of these Ladino words, because they just fit in with the words that I'm saying. </sentence><sentence id="87">It's, as we call it, Lingua De la Madri (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="88">the language of the mother. </sentence><sentence id="89">This was the language in the home. </sentence><sentence id="90">You passed the door, and you did not hear Serb or Croatian words. </sentence><sentence id="91">It was only in Ladino, as we call it, Judeo-Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="92">Sometimes, we would come home and -- with non-Jewish friends -- and I would sort of be a little embarrassed, I would say nona-- can't you speak so -- they'll think maybe we're talking something, you know, behind their back. </sentence><sentence id="93">She would look at me very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="94">She'd say . </sentence><sentence id="95">And she'd say, "You know, you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="96">You have to speak Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="97">This is her Jewish language. </sentence><sentence id="98">She considered that as her religious, Jewish language. </sentence><sentence id="99">It was written in Hebrew letters, Rashi. </sentence><sentence id="100">And all her prayers were written in that language. </sentence><sentence id="101">So she considered that her religion. </sentence><sentence id="102">She was very religious, and she raised a very, very religious    family. </sentence><sentence id="103">Anyway, going back to my mother, Rosa -- she finally managed to go to Sarajevo. </sentence><sentence id="104">And she falls in love. </sentence><sentence id="105">She falls in love with a musician. </sentence><sentence id="106">And what did he play? </sentence><sentence id="107">Accordion and guitar. </sentence><sentence id="108">And he had a gorgeous voice. </sentence><sentence id="109">The moment the family heard a musician -- I mean, it was something you should never even consider. </sentence><sentence id="110">A nice Jewish family -- I mean, a girl, a Sephardic girl, to marry a musician who plays for money? </sentence><sentence id="111">I mean, you are blessed with a voice. </sentence><sentence id="112">That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other people -- not to take the money. </sentence><sentence id="113">But you know, nothing would help. </sentence><sentence id="114">And as much as they really respected the father -- you never questioned grandfather -- whatever he said, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="115">She decided to marry -- Samuel Poppel (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="116">was his name -- very handsome Samuel Poppel. </sentence><sentence id="117">And she found out very, very early that it was no big deal, because Samuel Poppel played all night and slept all day -- and at night, he was out singing , which is a Bosnian folk song. </sentence><sentence id="118">And after she had the baby -- she right away had the baby, little Floritza, which is me, she wrote a letter to her father -- "I want to come home." </sentence><sentence id="119">And the father came to Sarajevo, he arranged a real Jewish divorce, and took his daughter and little Floritza back to his house. </sentence><sentence id="120">And she brought shame to the family. </sentence><sentence id="121">A divorced daughter in the family? </sentence><sentence id="122">Never heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="123">Never was a divorce in Vlasenica. </sentence><sentence id="124">So here she was with a child. </sentence><sentence id="125">She couldn't meet with a man because -- the single people -- single men are not going to look -- a divorced girl with a baby. </sentence><sentence id="126">So, she was very lonely. </sentence><sentence id="127">Her life was spent with her family. </sentence><sentence id="128">They sang a lot. </sentence><sentence id="129">They have, every Sunday, a picnic in different gardens. </sentence><sentence id="130">And there was a lamb on a spit, and a lot of singing. </sentence><sentence id="131">So that was, really, her life. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I, actually, was never supposed to ask about Samuel Poppel. </sentence><sentence id="133">It was something you never asked, you never talked about. </sentence><sentence id="134">I never saw him. </sentence><sentence id="135">I don't even know what he looks like. </sentence><sentence id="136">But my grandfather went right away to work to find a husband for Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="137">The marriages were, really, arranged. </sentence><sentence id="138">The father, the grandfather, would call you, you would kiss his hand, and he would say, "I have a husband for you." </sentence><sentence id="139">You would kiss his hand again, and you were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="140">In one way, it was just -- it was very simple. </sentence><sentence id="141">You didn't have to worry about the singles, or "Where am I going to meet a man?". </sentence><sentence id="142">And usually, the father knew what the -- you know, what kind of man their daughter needs. </sentence><sentence id="143">So every little town from the Srebenica to Travnik as I told you before -- the families kept in touch, they visited each other, and they knew exactly who had daughters, who had sons, their ages. </sentence><sentence id="144">And in between the cities, there were such people as Casmententeros, the matchmakers. </sentence><sentence id="145">They usually -- it was a side job, besides what they were doing -- and they would get 20 percent here, and 20 percent on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="146">They would match, give parties. </sentence><sentence id="147">So they found a match. </sentence><sentence id="148">And it was a salesman who was traveling from city to city. </sentence><sentence id="149">They only spoke in Judeo, in Ladino. </sentence><sentence id="150">The salesman too. </sentence><sentence id="151">Everything was done in this Ladino language in between them. </sentence><sentence id="152">So his name was Mikaiel (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="153">Poppel -- no -- sorry -- Mikaiel Cabeelio (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="154">Poppel was my father who I never met. </sentence><sentence id="155">And Mikaiel Cabeelio comes to Vlasenica, and meets Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="156">And by golly, she liked him. </sentence><sentence id="157">She was very picky, you know? </sentence><sentence id="158">She was a very pretty, pretty girl, pretty woman. </sentence><sentence id="159">I'll show you a picture later -- very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="160">And they arranged a wedding. </sentence><sentence id="161">Naturally, I was not at the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="162">I was sent to play with the cousins. </sentence><sentence id="163">It was something that was not part of me, which -- it hurt, you know, later on -- when you get older, you think back, "Well, how could they do that to me?". </sentence><sentence id="164">You know. </sentence><sentence id="165">Anyway, she gets married, and they go to the city of Zagreb, a big city. </sentence><sentence id="166">This is what she wanted to do, to go live in a big city. </sentence><sentence id="167">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="168">To my happiness, because I was going to stay with nona. </sentence><sentence id="169">And I adored that woman -- just adored. </sentence><sentence id="170">I think all the feeling that I have for this Sephardic culture, for stories, for songs -- it's all really a gift from her to me that I will have for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="171">It was -- I considered her as my mother. </sentence><sentence id="172">I didn't miss Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="173">It's sad. </sentence><sentence id="174">But that's just the way it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: How old were you when they got married and left for Zagreb? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: Well, before nine. </sentence><sentence id="353">I was about seven, or maybe even younger, because I -- no -- seven, because I stayed with nona two years, until they got settled. </sentence><sentence id="354">And then, one day, my grandfather comes in with a hat on, a real hat. </sentence><sentence id="355">You know, I was used to seeing my grandfather dressed with a . </sentence><sentence id="356">All the Jews in Vlasencia and all these little towns -- they were dressed the same as the Moslems. </sentence><sentence id="357">You wouldn't know which one's which. </sentence><sentence id="358">They all had , and shuck sheers (ph.) -- </sentence><sentence id="359">that's pantaloon pants. </sentence><sentence id="360">And he put a hat on because, I guess, he wanted to look a little more modern. </sentence><sentence id="361">He was going to a big city. </sentence><sentence id="362">And, oh, it was tough on me. </sentence><sentence id="363">I hated that day. </sentence><sentence id="364">I'll never forget it as long as I live. </sentence><sentence id="365">My nona gives me an orange bag with the pictures of my family, all my aunts. </sentence><sentence id="366">And she said , don't ever forget your Mishpachah (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="367">which is, really, a Hebrew word. </sentence><sentence id="368">But it's family. </sentence><sentence id="369">And she gave me a little gold locket, which I still carry with me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="370">And she said, "Anywhere you go, carry that with you. </sentence><sentence id="371">So those were the two very precious things that I had all my life with me, even today. </sentence><sentence id="372">I'll show it to you later. </sentence><sentence id="373"> Coming to Zagreb is like day and night, a difference of life and people and -- my mother -- I mean, I couldn't recognize my mother before anything else. </sentence><sentence id="374">She was very dressed up in very beautiful clothes. </sentence><sentence id="375">And my stepfather, my new father, who adopted me -- and I became Floritza Cabeelio -- he started a necktie business, and she was in business with him, very active, very -- this is what she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="376">This is the kind of life she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="377">She could not take that small, village existence. </sentence><sentence id="378">And she mingled with -- socially, with the Ashkenazi Jews, who are a little different than the Sephardim in that part of the world. </sentence><sentence id="379">They were modern. </sentence><sentence id="380">They were from Austrian background and they spoke German at home. </sentence><sentence id="381">And socially, this is where she felt more important. </sentence><sentence id="382">The kosher that was completely gone. </sentence><sentence id="383">I don't remember anything that was connected to Vlasencica that I could see in her. </sentence><sentence id="384">We did not speak Ladino. </sentence><sentence id="385">It was all SerbaCroation. </sentence><sentence id="386">And not only that. </sentence><sentence id="387">She had so many things prepared for me -- I think all the things she wanted for herself that she could never get -- had music lessons, piano lessons, ballet, and drawing, and went to Maccabi (ph.) -- </sentence><sentence id="388">that's like, a health club -- three times a week -- had tickets for the operetta on Sunday afternoon -- Lahar, I knew all the Lahar pieces by heart at the time. </sentence><sentence id="389">It was too much to take actually. </sentence><sentence id="390">She had a maid who spoke to me only in German because that was the language, you know, a fine language. </sentence><sentence id="391">I couldn't -- I -- the only thing I would like to do is go back to nona and her Sephardi cooking, and her , and , and , all that Sephardi cooking. </sentence><sentence id="392">It was so good. </sentence><sentence id="393">And to hear their language -- I miss that the most, that Lingua De la Madri. </sentence><sentence id="394">And besides, I wasn't too crazy about Mikaiel Cabeelio. </sentence><sentence id="395">I always felt maybe he'll take a knife -- and come in my room -- I mean, I had that fright, until one day I come out of school, and there is Mikaiel Cabeelio waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="396">He said, "Floritza (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="397">we are going to buy a harmonica today." </sentence><sentence id="398">A harmonica we called an accordion. </sentence><sentence id="399">And it was my dream to have an accordion. </sentence><sentence id="400">If you have a harmonica, you are usually very popular. </sentence><sentence id="401">Everybody wants to be with you. </sentence><sentence id="402">You can start a party -- but just the dream that I would never believe it would happen to me -- and we go to this -- the store in Zagreb, right near the park, called -- I'll show you that picture too -- and, uh, we went to the music store, and he said, "Floritza, pick any one you like." </sentence><sentence id="403">Well, I saw that little white Honer, 24 base (ph.).And I said, "That's the one I would like to have."

I'm still doing the same thing, I'm walking around, playing, playing mostly to nursing homes, and playing the songs of our people, from their country. </sentence><sentence id="2149">And I would usually ask them always, "What country do you come from?". </sentence><sentence id="2150">And if it's an Italian lady, I would play some Italian music. </sentence><sentence id="2151">For a Polish lady, I would do a polka. </sentence><sentence id="2152">So she is still with me. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And I love her. </sentence><sentence id="2154">This is Corsila, a beautiful, beautiful island. </sentence><sentence id="2155">As you see, the piece of blue water in front, that's where the ships would dock daily. </sentence><sentence id="2156">And we would all stand there and wait to get any kind of news, anything; that is, what's going around the world. </sentence><sentence id="2157">Also from there, we took that tugboat at night and -- when we ran away toward Italy. </sentence><sentence id="2158">Also, the children -- if you see that whole island -- we'd swim around it all day, every day. </sentence><sentence id="2159">And it's a beautiful place to go, even for a vacation, today. </sentence><sentence id="2160">It brings bad memories to me. </sentence><sentence id="2161">But it's a beautiful place. </sentence><sentence id="2162">Well, believe it or not, the one in the middle is me, the teacher, the music teacher. </sentence><sentence id="2163">All of my students were a little older. </sentence><sentence id="2164">But this was the butcher's daughter and the baker's daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2165">And that's where my meat and bread and olive oil came from. </sentence><sentence id="2166">So they were really very important people in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And this harmonica, actually, is not mine, because my father went to the City of Split to change for a bigger one. </sentence><sentence id="2168">So this one is borrowed. </sentence><sentence id="2169">But these are my students on the isle of Corsila. </sentence><sentence id="2170">Well, this was June 24th, 1945, the wedding day. </sentence><sentence id="2171">Take a look at that Sergeant Jagoda. </sentence><sentence id="2172">Isn't he a handsome man? </sentence><sentence id="2173">The wedding was really first class America from the cake to the hamburgers to my dress made out of parachute. </sentence><sentence id="2174">I mean, everything was just first class. </sentence><sentence id="2175">And I love this picture. </sentence><sentence id="2176">Well, this is the farmer who started talking to us and telling us the story of the stormy night. </sentence><sentence id="2177">And we are standing, actually, on the spot where he was telling us that that is where my family is, both of these places. </sentence><sentence id="2178">And this is where we were standing, just frozen. </sentence><sentence id="2179">This is really when I heard the whole story about the Altarac family. </sentence><sentence id="2180">And the little tree -- that's where they are. </sentence><sentence id="2181">One day, I hope to be able to go back and put something there, a stone, a music lesson, anything that is sort of connected with this Altarac family who gave me so much and left so much behind. </sentence><sentence id="2182">This is the badge that I talked about before. </sentence><sentence id="2183">It brings a lot of memories, a lot of pain, actually. </sentence><sentence id="2184">This was issued to every Jewish person in Zagreb -- and I'm sure in many other cities -- and you would not ever leave the house without the badge. </sentence><sentence id="2185">Because, God forbid, if they catch you without it, you are really in jail. </sentence><sentence id="2186">So miraculously, it just traveled with me. </sentence><sentence id="2187">I would make sure that this goes with me, plus my nona's bag with family pictures, and the little gold piece that you will see very soon. </sentence><sentence id="2188">There it is. </sentence><sentence id="2189">This is the locket that she gave me after I left Vlasenica -- and "Keep it with you anywhere you go" -- and I sure did. </sentence><sentence id="2190">It's very old. </sentence><sentence id="2191">It's broken up. </sentence><sentence id="2192">But it's very, very dear to me. , </sentence><sentence id="2193">keys from Spain. </sentence><sentence id="2194">Most of the Sephardic communities know the legend of the key. </sentence><sentence id="2195">When our ancestors left Spain, they took their -- the keys of their homes with him hoping that, one day, they will return. </sentence><sentence id="2196">I have written this song maybe 10, 15, years ago -- and it's on my first album, or second album -- where I'm asking where is the key that used to be in the drawer that our ancestors brought from Spain. </sentence><sentence id="2197">My cousin, Berta, when she left Vlasenica ___ that this Bosnian war -- she called me and I tried very hard to bring her to this country, which I did, thank God. </sentence><sentence id="2198">And she said to me on the phone, "I left everything. </sentence><sentence id="2199">But I have the key." </sentence><sentence id="2200">   This is my Uncle Layzo's watch. </sentence><sentence id="2201">Actually, my grandfather gave it to him for his good grades in school, when Vlasenica had all that trouble and all the Jews were taken to that forest mountain. </sentence><sentence id="2202">After that -- the reason, I guess, that the City was such in silence -- everybody had something -- because all of a sudden, 15 families -- all their houses were empty. </sentence><sentence id="2203">Somebody had to have all these things that were in their houses. </sentence><sentence id="2204">My Uncle Layzo, after coming to Vlasenica, looked, searched, all over the place for something to remember his family. </sentence><sentence id="2205">He found nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2206">Finally, he went to Sarajevo. </sentence><sentence id="2207">In one of the pawn shops, he bought this watch. </sentence><sentence id="2208">And this watch -- his father gave to him. </sentence><sentence id="2209">And in fact, when you open it, you can see his handwriting, "To my son, Layzo, for the good grades in school." </sentence><sentence id="2210">Education was always very important. </sentence><sentence id="2211">Again, a story of -- this, Berta gave me the first time I went to visit. </sentence><sentence id="2212">One of the neighbors was dying. </sentence><sentence id="2213">And she called Berta and she wanted to give her something. </sentence><sentence id="2214">It was on her conscience. </sentence><sentence id="2215">And she gave her this buckle that belonged to the Altarac family. </sentence><sentence id="2216">As you see in the middle, it's a Magen David, and it was worn by one of my uncles, or -- I don't know whom -- but it belonged to the Altarac family. </sentence><sentence id="2217">It bothered the lady a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2218">So she gave it to Berta. </sentence><sentence id="2219">You know, a very talented musician of Sephardic music -- the group is called the Voice of Sepharad in Saint Paul, Minnesota -- David Harris (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="2220">is his name. </sentence><sentence id="2221">He called one day. </sentence><sentence id="2222">He said, "Flory, I would like to commission you to write a song for my group." </sentence><sentence id="2223">And he gave me two words, "You return what you find." </sentence><sentence id="2224">Well, what did I think of about? </sentence><sentence id="2225">I thought about going back to Vlasenica, , and "What am I looking for, the houses?". </sentence><sentence id="2226">And this is what the -- this song is all about. </sentence><sentence id="2227">I will sort of speak it as you are listening to it. </sentence><sentence id="2228">I start with thinking with the guitar. </sentence><sentence id="2229">That's what the guitar is coming out and doing. </sentence><sentence id="2230">And as I'm thinking, the scenes come out of the family houses. </sentence><sentence id="2231">I look at the windows, I look for roses. </sentence><sentence id="2232">And this is what you will hear now. " </sentence><sentence id="2233">The streets are empty. </sentence><sentence id="2234">The houses are without happiness, and the windows are without roses, and the carnations, and the beautiful roses that these people love so much in their windows, and the gardens, the gardens without the lovers, and the worst of all, there is no nonas wearing the little head covering, and the mothers with cradles that used to sing to the children -- where have they gone? </sentence><sentence id="2235">Where have they gone? </sentence><sentence id="2236">Where have they gone?Everybody -- everybody is gone. </sentence><sentence id="2237">Everybody, everyone -- everybody is gone" -- the guitar is always your thinking and your searching -- "And the Rabbis that used to pray, the prayers that used to give us so much peace, and the weddings, the weddings of the young ones that used to sing and dance with the tambourines back to the mothers with their cradles that used to sing to their children -- where have they gone? </sentence><sentence id="2238">Where have they gone? </sentence><sentence id="2239">Where have they gone? </sentence><sentence id="2240">Everybody -- everybody is gone. </sentence><sentence id="2241">Everybody -- everybody is gone." </sentence></p></dialogue>
