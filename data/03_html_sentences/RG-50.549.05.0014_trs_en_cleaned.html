<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: ...Something like that. </sentence><sentence id="202">Nilosh is basically somebody who shoots arrows. </sentence><sentence id="203">And you started wearing then already yellow stars and all that. </sentence><sentence id="204">At the time you just had to wear, you didn't have to, it wasn't until the Germans came in that they moved us into ghettos. </sentence><sentence id="205">But by then you already had to sew on the yellow stars and all that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="206">And the Christian friends all of a sudden disappeared [laughing]. </sentence><sentence id="207">They didn't know you anymore. </sentence><sentence id="208">Even if they wanted to probably their parents told them, you know, "Stay away from them, don't play with them," and such and such. </sentence><sentence id="209">So, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="210">It started actually in "43, but it really didn't get serious until "44, then when the Germans... and that I remember vividly, because it was Passover. </sentence><sentence id="211">We went down to my mother's parents. </sentence><sentence id="212">We were going to spend Passover with them. </sentence><sentence id="213">And so we all traveled down there. </sentence><sentence id="214">I remember it was Passover night or the night thereafter, I'm not sure which, but the policeman from the village came in from Almozd. </sentence><sentence id="215">He came in and said that all Jews must go back to where they lived. " </sentence><sentence id="216">So, your daughter," he told my grandfather, "your daughter and her children must return immediately to Debrecen." </sentence><sentence id="217">And so in the middle of the night we had to get a buggy and horses and go back to the train station and catch a train back to Debrecen. </sentence><sentence id="218">From there they told us that we have to move into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="219">And so they set aside a square, I don't know, about two or three square blocks, which they put wooden gates up on each end of the 5   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 6 street, blocked it off. </sentence><sentence id="220">And then windows that were looking outside from the ghetto, they bricked them in, so basically you had an enclosed area of so many houses. </sentence><sentence id="221">A couple of streets, basically is what it amounted to. </sentence><sentence id="222">And they herded everybody in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Do you remember being herded in there? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Did you stay home with your mother during the day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: During the time that... no, I went to the first grade, but after when we moved into the ghetto, nobody, I mean there was no work in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="303">Basically the Jewish Community was divvying up food, whatever... I really don't know where the food was coming from. </sentence><sentence id="304">How the allocation went and all that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="305">But we had food to eat, I mean, during that time anyway, we didn't, I don't remember being hungry or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="306">So I guess there was sufficient amount of food available, you know, when in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Do you remember anything you ate? </sentence><sentence id="313">Any of the food? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1305">Q: What made you agree to talk to me and to talk to the Jewish Community Center? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: Well, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1308">I just, I think probably the main thing that motivated me on that is I read in places where, especially where they had the trial in Britain about people saying it never happened and all that stuff, it's somebody's fantasies. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And I'm here to tell you that it did happen. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And I guess that's probably the main reason that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you know, people are trying to change history. </sentence><sentence id="1311">And if you don't learn nothing, you don't learn no lesson from what happened, it can happen again. </sentence><sentence id="1312">That was my biggest motivation of joining the US Army, is I felt that the Russians weren't that much better than the Nazis were. </sentence><sentence id="1313">They had the gulags, they had the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1314">May not have been prosecuting Jews per se, but they were prosecuting human beings. </sentence><sentence id="1315">That's basically what decided, probably the only force in the world 17  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 18 during this period of time that could prevent something like that happening is the U.S. Armed Forces. </sentence><sentence id="1316">And so that was my main reasoning for joining the Service. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I served in the Israeli Army. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I fought in the Sinai Desert in "56. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And so I've been through the wringer. </sentence><sentence id="1320">But that wouldn't affect Israel, doesn't affect the world. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And probably the only force in the world at this time of human history who can make a difference is the United States and the U.S. Armed Forces. </sentence><sentence id="1322">So, that was my main motivation of joining the Service. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1341">Q: Another question, looking back on those days just after the war when you were a young boy in Sweden, did you, I'm trying to think of how to form the question. </sentence><sentence id="1342">But I'm wondering about whether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and others had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution. </sentence><sentence id="1343">Did you have any understanding of what...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1347">A: Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that's the only thing that... you know. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And then as I got older and I read. </sentence><sentence id="1349">I'm not educated very well. </sentence><sentence id="1350">I finished high school GED and I got some college behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours. </sentence><sentence id="1351">But basically I read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long time and is basically... I don't blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in churches and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what Jews can do. </sentence><sentence id="1352">They always kept them outside of the mainstream society. </sentence><sentence id="1353">And they were prohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things. </sentence><sentence id="1354">So they were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to call them. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And then the church teaching basically demonized them. </sentence><sentence id="1356">So, I don't think it was too hard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people didn't, didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Because it's supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly supposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they're teaching. </sentence><sentence id="1358">But I guess that wasn't what, what actually happened. </sentence><sentence id="1359">I've seen them take a little baby and smash him against, his head against the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1361">And what human being would do something like that? </sentence><sentence id="1362">And then they go to church to pray? </sentence><sentence id="1363">I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this world today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion. </sentence><sentence id="1364">Take a look right now. </sentence><sentence id="1365">Sudan, got a Muslim against the Christians. </sentence><sentence id="1366">Northern Ireland, Catholics against the Protestants. </sentence><sentence id="1367">You go to India, you got the... Sri Lanka, you got one sect fighting another and again it's religion. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Iraq, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims. </sentence><sentence id="1369">So every place you look at, to me anyway, from what I read and seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion. </sentence><sentence id="1370">That's my view. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1395">Q: How does that, how does that translate to your feelings about Israel and protecting Israel? </sentence><sentence id="1396">You fought and risked your life fighting for Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1399">A: Well, that's something different, because if there was an Israel before the Second World War, before... this probably, I mean the Holocaust probably never would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="1400">Because I'm not looking at it as religion, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1401">I look at it as a homeland for a people. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Because you can take the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And I'm Jewish and the Bible, the Old Testament to me is the history of my people, and as such every people need a homeland. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And that's what motivated me. </sentence><sentence id="1405">But I always consider myself American, which is really funny, that even before the war, my dad always told me that he was American, so I considered myself American. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And he was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1906.18   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 19 And he always told me that he is American and one of these days we're going to go back to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1407">So, it was very natural for me, once I found him and once he got to the United States himself and everything, that in "59 I came and joined him in the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1419">Q: Had his parents been American or Hungarian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1421">A: From what I understand and I'm really not positive, but it seems to me, what happened was that his parents or his grandfather, it was him and his father, immigrated to the United States back in the 1800s or somewhere, you know, late 1800s. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And they lived here, matter of fact, I got an aunt, who was born here and never left here. </sentence><sentence id="1423">She's passed away now in Houston. </sentence><sentence id="1424">But her whole life, she was born in the United States, lived in the United States and passed away in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1425">So, they lived here, I guess in New York and either during the Depression, or early, they decided that they would be better off and went back. </sentence><sentence id="1426">That's my understanding as to what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And then my father was still, wasn't... his sister was old enough that she said no, she's not going back with them, she's staying. </sentence><sentence id="1428">My father probably wasn't old enough, you know, to be on his own, so his father took him back with him to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1429">That's my understanding, you know, is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1430">But I'm not exactly sure as to what year, you know, they came and what year they went back and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1431">But that basically what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1432">Like I say, probably if not for that, that he was born here, I probably wouldn't be sitting here talking to you, because I would have wound up in Auschwitz in the gas chamber. </sentence></p></dialogue>
