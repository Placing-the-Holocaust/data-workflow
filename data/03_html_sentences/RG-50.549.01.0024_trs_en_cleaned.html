<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="976">A: In the Jewish press, there's a Jewish press, very . </sentence><sentence id="977">So my friend found his sister's daughter in Poland, he had come from Poland as a young boy and he went, this guy could move mountains, and he went to Poland and found this girl, brought her back to Holland in 1946 and she had no place to live, he had a house, she moved in with him. </sentence><sentence id="978">She was 18, 16, 18, 18 by now. </sentence><sentence id="979">And they fell in love and he want to marry her, except in Holland you can't do that, that's against the law. </sentence><sentence id="980">And so he made a request to Queen Wilhemina, is the only one who can do this, only the Queen and she can give you permission, whatever that's, that's called. </sentence><sentence id="981">And she wrote him back there's no way | can do that, we don't do this and denied. </sentence><sentence id="982">So he, when he came back from the camps, he came back on a stretcher and on that hospital where he was brought in over the border, the Princess Julianna(ph), she visits hospitals, like to visit hospitals , wonderful family. </sentence><sentence id="983">And she visit that hospital and he was laying in the bed, he had come back out of Auschwitz and they took a picture of her standing at his bed. </sentence><sentence id="984">And she said to him, "If there's ever anything | can do for you, feel free, you can call me." </sentence><sentence id="985">Which is, which is like giving you a check you can cash when you need it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="986">So he, so he wrote a letter after the Queen turned him down, to the Princess, said, "| want you to talk to your mother, | want to marry my niece." </sentence><sentence id="987">And the Princess wrote him a letter back, these are all true stories. " </sentence><sentence id="988">I can't give you permission, my mother doesn't waive, no she said so as you well know, but if someday in the future, it will all, things work out normal, | will be Queen, I'm in succession and then you try again." </sentence><sentence id="989">1948, two years later, Wilhemina abdicated her throne to her daughter, he didn't wait three weeks, he writes a letter to

or government to issue all new ones, because the Germans had falsified so many. </sentence><sentence id="997">They had emptied all the safe deposit box, deposit boxes of the Jews and others. </sentence><sentence id="998">So no one knew who was what and who owned what. </sentence><sentence id="999">So Dutch made a cutoff day in "45, that no one was worth more than 10 dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1000">The phony money, the money, you went to the banks, later on, every week you could get, release some of it because they couldn't give it to you , they had to print it and finally everybody got dollar for dollar and the Dutch, whatever they did economically. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So he now, so now it's 1948, about that time and he ran into a guy who says, "You know, | found in the backyard of my uncle, a whole box full of these bonds, they're worthless." </sentence><sentence id="1002">So my friend is smart, he says, "Well," he says, "maybe | can do something with that." </sentence><sentence id="1003">So he gave the guy, he says, "I'll give you 5,000 dollars for it, as a friend,", this man say, "but you have to deliver it in New York."

next to them, right on the table, | said, "Are    you following me?" </sentence><sentence id="1020">There was a younger man and an older man, they said, "No, I'm not." </sentence><sentence id="1021">| said, "Well, you are. </sentence><sentence id="1022">Last week was somebody else, but there was two people following me." </sentence><sentence id="1023">So | figured | got to have an emotional

gangster, I'm a survivor the camps, I'm not a thief, | haven't done anything wrong." </sentence><sentence id="1025">And this man says to me, "You did something wrong, you're peddling illegal documents, | mean stocks, bonds and that's not done in this country," he says. " </sentence><sentence id="1026">And we're going to put you in jail because you're trying to sell that." </sentence><sentence id="1027">And you, and we, and | didn't know if it was that, which, that's what he told me, but I'd also been buying up gold and | was smuggling it out of Switzerland to Holland, gold coins. </sentence><sentence id="1028">But you, and in Holland | could, could make a huge profit every time | and | used packs of cigarettes, you know and things like that to smuggle them over the border. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And maybe and | thought that could be also it. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So he says, "Know what you're doing, you're selling things." </sentence><sentence id="1031">So he says, | said, "How can I, how can | stop this?" </sentence><sentence id="1032">Says, "I'll tell you what we'll do," He was an older man and he became very sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="1033">He says, "See my car there?" " </sentence><sentence id="1034">Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="1035">| was in Zurich. </sentence><sentence id="1036">He said, "We are going to the airport right now and I'm going to drop you off there and you get out of this country and never come back." </sentence><sentence id="1037">| says, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="1038">What was | going to do? </sentence><sentence id="1039">All my suits were in the hotel room, all my clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Never went back to the hotel, he wouldn't let me and to the airport. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Put me on a plane. </sentence><sentence id="1042">| walk in my bosses office in Amsterdam and | say, "I quit." </sentence><sentence id="1043">He said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="1044">I say, "I hate you." </sentence><sentence id="1045">| couldn't tell him why | was quit, | was doing on his time, all this black market business. </sentence><sentence id="1046">So | never went back to Switzerland for a long time, until maybe 1980, the middle 80's with my family. </sentence><sentence id="1047">Because now | had an American passport you see, they couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1048">But that's, that's my friend, . </sentence><sentence id="1049">| mean, great stories, as far as I'm concerned, so. </sentence><sentence id="1050">| still have a suit somewhere's in a hotel room in Zurich. </sentence></p></dialogue>
