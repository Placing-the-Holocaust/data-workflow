<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A:Well, my life was revolving around uh the school and HaShomer HaTzair and uh as 1940 came to pass, uh there were restrictions where you could go for instance. </sentence><sentence id="146">There were certain places where we could not go hiking anymore. </sentence><sentence id="147">Uh, you couldn't go to movies. </sentence><sentence id="148">By 1940 the radios were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="149">Um... by 1941 you couldn't have a telephone. </sentence><sentence id="150">Uh by uh early 1941 the Jewish school had to collapse itself, all of its grades, into a small classroom. </sentence><sentence id="151">I mean there was continual, almost monthly, new regulation and proscriptions and prescriptions of what you could or couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="152">Uh by 1941 you had to wear a yellow star, and that meant that when you walked down the street uh when the local ruffians wanted to beat you up, uh they just beat you up. </sentence><sentence id="153">Of course that led to the fact that we always went together as crowd. </sentence><sentence id="154">I mean there were no rough tactics like using knives or anything like that...it was just uh sticks and fists. </sentence><sentence id="155">So, you know, 1940, 1941 uh was conversion of HaShomer HaTzair into sort of a youth gang. </sentence><sentence id="156">Uh from a childhood This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="157">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="158"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection standpoint actually, uh it was a wonderful experience. </sentence><sentence id="159">It sort of made things very intense and very important, and suddenly things became just very very ... things which you would not have believed were important became very important. </sentence><sentence id="160">For instance uh most of the Jews had to get rid of their books. </sentence><sentence id="161">You were not allowed to have books. </sentence><sentence id="162">I mean there's lots of things...you couldn't have this, this and that, so the notion that you could read a book, or that somebody owned a book, was a matter of great importance because if you could borrow a book uh and you had a book or you had access to somebody who borrowed your book, that was subject of very very much conversation--who reads what. </sentence><sentence id="163">It became a very intense kind of a life..-uh life became very precious. </sentence><sentence id="164">Uh so so I'm not looking at that period in fact uh with with dismay. </sentence><sentence id="165">It became a very very intensive life where every moment mattered and everything mattered, and you became very cautious and very very forward looking, very calculating, and very well organized, so.... Of course by the end of 1940 or early in 1941, the Jewish school was dissolved. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh, it just happened that my father arranged for some people, and and there were some refugees, to to start tutoring me at home; so starting in 1941, I had private tutors including some very distinguished uh people who otherwise would have, I would never have met in terms of education. </sentence><sentence id="167">Uh I started studying English in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="168">I had an excellent uh English teacher from Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="169">| didn't have a piano. </sentence><sentence id="170">We were not allowed to have a piano, but uh the local music teacher who was the wife of a local judge let me practice on her piano. </sentence><sentence id="171">It it's that sort of experiences ... they are they are sort of savoring life and savoring experiences. </sentence><sentence id="172">Uh, you know, sure I got beaten up, but we also beat up some of them too, I mean, so uh we learned how to do dirty fighting and kicking. </sentence><sentence id="173">Uh we did not always run. </sentence><sentence id="174">Most of the time we did. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh and the relationship between the the the young people, I mean the people with whom I was in those days uh...I mean and and one of them is in Sweden, one of them is in Israel, one of them is in Prague, and they're all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="176">I can pick up the phone and talk to them like I can talk to nobody. </sentence><sentence id="177">Uh, a few months ago one of these boys who was with me uh wrote me a letter and in the letter he just mentioned that he has This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="178">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="179"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection tremendous headaches and uh that uh the doctors in Slovakia can't find out what's wrong with him, so I get the letter uh in the morning, I call up uh the other boy who was part of the group in Goteborg, Sweden, and I said, uh, Sano has headaches. </sentence><sentence id="180">If I send him by airplane tomorrow morning to Goteborg can you take care...can you take him to a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="181">He said of course. </sentence><sentence id="182">You know, it's like, you know, you know, like like continuing the same conversation of fifty years ago. </sentence><sentence id="183">I pick up the phone. </sentence><sentence id="184">I call Sano in Europe, I said there is a ticket waiting for you. </sentence><sentence id="185">Uh you just walk down the street and the travel agency and hop on the plane and Francl will pick you up at the airport. </sentence><sentence id="186">Now he hasn't seen Francl in fifty years, but, you know, it was just...it's that kind of a relationship. </sentence><sentence id="187">I, I don't have with nobody...I, I wouldn't pick up a phone like that with anybody else except my nearest family or my children, so you know, coming back to the forties and you want to get the spirit...it's, it's life of great intensity. </sentence><sentence id="188">It's life of great, uh, changing of outlook. </sentence><sentence id="189">Things become very precious, very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q:And uh the noose then begins to tighten. </sentence><sentence id="240">What happens.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A:And as the noose becomes tightened, of course, then uh, you know, when the deportations start and this this is very ugly, uh but it's very bureaucratized. </sentence><sentence id="244">You know, the lists are made up, and, and, and in fact the the Jewish council administers the list, so the the Gestapo has just a few people. </sentence><sentence id="245">Then they have the Hlinka Guards, the quislings, and then you have the local gendarmes, and the whole thing is organized as a machine, and the machine uh because of its bureaucratic approach, becomes predictable which means that if you're skillful and if you have pull, uh you can anticipate the motions and then you can almost figure out the odds of survival and so life becomes on the part of my father very much preoccupied with understanding which way the laws are going and what do you give up in order to protect, so in 1942 when the uh deportations begin, my father is uh advised that, "Yes, we can protect you but if you would get baptized uh it would look This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="246">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="247"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection better because it would allow us to reclassify you from column 4BC to column 4DA which is a different priority." </sentence><sentence id="248">See, by that time uh the whole question of destruction becomes an arithmetic calculation. </sentence><sentence id="249">Who owes what favor to whom, what can you do to protect. </sentence><sentence id="250">And by the way, that is the sort of mentality that continues afterwards under the communist regime. </sentence><sentence id="251">It it is not just a Holocaust experience. </sentence><sentence id="252">It is a totalitarian experience. </sentence><sentence id="253">It's a Kafka's, Kafka-like experience, except it's accentuated because now the game becomes deadly, so my father said fine. </sentence><sentence id="254">OK. </sentence><sentence id="255">You know, you want to reclassify. </sentence><sentence id="256">Fine. </sentence><sentence id="257">We get baptized. </sentence><sentence id="258">I just got bar mitzvah in January "42, so then Father comes back and said you know, and we have to get baptized. </sentence><sentence id="259">Fine Dad. </sentence><sentence id="260">You know, how do we do that?Well, you know, uh we have to sort of get the thing organized and you have to qualify. </sentence><sentence id="261">We cannot get you into the Catholic Church because it takes too long and it requires Archbishop dispensation and it would take a couple of years, but uh you can get baptized in the Evangelic Church, which was a Protestant church. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh and the Protestants are more flexible because of the heritage and we can do the whole thing in eight months and you have to go to school and learn the catechism and so forth, so part of the experience is one of how to survive in a totalitarian environment, how to adapt, how to change your skins, your habits, your behavior, because that is what the rules require. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q:How did you go about it? </sentence><sentence id="287">How did this process of becoming educated to become  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A:Oh, I, I, I'm, I'm a I'ma very skillful, highly disciplined young man who can concentrate, and if you have to learn the catechism and you have to learn the New Testament, uh, you know, it's it's a drill like learning anything else, so you know, if you have to learn things in order to get...you have to learn the tfillin to get bar bar mitzvah and read the Tanach to be bar mitzvah, well fine. </sentence><sentence id="291">They want me to do something else, I can do that too. </sentence><sentence id="292">It's, it's, uh, it's an adaptability, so if they want, you know...now they want me to jump through this loop, I'll go through this loop. </sentence><sentence id="293">If they want me to jump through this hoop, it that, it the price of survival and you know the calculation of this thing...you know classifica...reclassification from 4AB to 4DE means that you have another year to go. </sentence><sentence id="294">OK. </sentence><sentence id="295">And if that's what it takes, that's what you do. </sentence><sentence id="296">So it is the mental process that I'm trying to convey to you is that the genocide is a bureaucratic process with stipulated rules which all have escape clauses and that is not just genocide although it's, again let me emphasize, genocide is deadly. </sentence><sentence id="297">But it is a process which is almost banal in its bureaucratic predictability and manipulability and those who survive are the individuals who either have the power or the money and the know-how, but you have to have all three in order to be able to deal with that system. </sentence><sentence id="298">Now uh there are places where there is no escape clauses. </sentence><sentence id="299">When you're dealing with the Gestapo there is no escape clauses. </sentence><sentence id="300">Although even there there are escape clauses of sorts. </sentence><sentence id="301">Uh of course they are at a completely different level, but under the Slovak Republic which basically was a corrupt republic, um and uh a republic that always wanted to have an alibi for certain people...you know, there was...you always built an alibi for the next thing and if somebody's powerful and is protected by Branecky, well he must be important. </sentence><sentence id="302">If you want to preserve your options in the Slovak Republic you can navigate through that uh that uh environment and and if you know how to do it, you can survive a little longer than somebody else who does not know. </sentence><sentence id="303">The Jews who are deported in "42 are the powerless, the uh...they are the true victims. </sentence><sentence id="304">They are the ones who are not going to fit into the society very well. </sentence><sentence id="305">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="306">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="307"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>

the idea now is to make a deal with the communists, who also have an army running under the Soviet command from the east, and say we are going to make this join and in order to cooperate with the with the uh Soviets we are going to put the communists in charge and so late in May a meeting is held where the communists are going to go Kiev where the headquarters of the uh Russian army is headed by a man by the name of Krushchev, Nikita Krushchev [NB: at this time, acting as Commissar of the Soviet partisans], and the timing of the Russian attacking is the mountain pass and the communist leadership now of the Slovak underground will be coordinated so we don't have a situation like in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="879">Turns out the communists don't keep their part of the deal. </sentence><sentence id="880">They actually never communicate with the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="881">The communists were totally  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 different scenario and in fact they want to repeat the same thing that happened in Poland, and so the communists rather than wait for a coordinated army and underground and communists and Russian attack across the mountains, jump in guerrilla saboteurs early in August in large quantity into Slovakia and these saboteurs without any coordination with anybody, stopped the night train that goes from Berlin to Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="882">Just happens on that train are twenty-eight German generals. </sentence><sentence id="883">Line them up on the railroad station in Ru_omberok and shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="884">The following day uh my father says "OK. </sentence><sentence id="885">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="886">We are going to go into our escape plan. </sentence><sentence id="887">We are going to execute our escape plan. </sentence><sentence id="888">We are going to disperse," and so that morning which is the 28th of uh 27th of August, 1944, uh we go and we get dropped off in the various villages and we stay there. </sentence><sentence id="889">Well it turns out that the Germans are a little slow to react. </sentence><sentence id="890">They take some retaliatory action which is local but there is no Sonderkommando, not anything. </sentence><sentence id="891">And also the uh the base which is the business, it still has to be run and so after two days in our locations, uh my uh my father is told uh look, you better come back. </sentence><sentence id="892">This is...you jumped the gun a little. </sentence><sentence id="893">You...it's premature. </sentence><sentence id="894">So the whole family retrieves from the pre-staged hiding places and we go back where we were. </sentence><sentence id="895">OK. </sentence><sentence id="896">Now this is a fatal mistake. </sentence><sentence id="897">But it leads...it's it's part of really not understanding what was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="898">Uh and because of course the Russians are not crossing the Carpathians. </sentence><sentence id="899">The Russians have no intentions of crossing. </sentence><sentence id="900">They just start a new offensive in Poland, so Slovakia is not even on the map of of being crossed. </sentence><sentence id="901">What the Germans meanwhile do is they just land Sonderkommandos for the sole purpose of disarming the Slovak army, the various Slovak, uh, uh, Slovak, uh, garrisons. </sentence><sentence id="902">They successfully disarmed the eastern division, which was the highly armed, which was the spear-head of this whole plot. </sentence><sentence id="903">They totally disarmed them and they shoot the, uh, the, uh, the key generals who staged

between the the, uh, Slovak soldiers of the western division and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="909">Uh, on the night of the 29th of August, uh, for reasons which I still don't understand, my father decided, "Why don't you sleep home tonight and just why, why don't you go and sleep somewhere else so that the whole family's not together," although we are still in Tren_in. </sentence><sentence id="910">And I go to sleep at a house of a friend, uh, who was half-Jewish and they were workers and, and, and somehow...nobody every paid attention to them. </sentence><sentence id="911">I just slept there. </sentence><sentence id="912">Early in the morning I get the message during the night the Gestapo came and took twelve hostages, and my father was one of the hostages. </sentence><sentence id="913">They were...he was not taken as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="914">He was taken as the head operator. </sentence><sentence id="915">Subsequently in "45, I find out that

the mountains being staged for the for the uh for the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="916">So in the morning uh my father gets taken away. </sentence><sentence id="917">They were looking for me. </sentence><sentence id="918">All the males were going to be taken. </sentence><sentence id="919">I wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="920">They just came in...they came in during the night.

was a time to be warned. </sentence><sentence id="923">The Germans...there was no warning. </sentence><sentence id="924">They just took, uh, uh, some some people who are involved, uh, in in the

id="941">So I go over to the house of this this fallback, second position uh backup. </sentence><sentence id="942">And I'm there one night. </sentence><sentence id="943">In the morning the wife of this employee comes in all panicky. </sentence><sentence id="944">This employee had a young wife, recently married. </sentence><sentence id="945">He was a much older man. </sentence><sentence

says, "Look...the Germans are doing house to house search," and by that time the Germans announced that "If we find any uh partisans, soldiers or Jews uh we are going to shoot them and also shoot every inhabitant in the house." </sentence><sentence id="949">So the wife gets very alarmed and this newly married older guy goes to me and says, "Look, why don't you just go away for the day out to the to the to the river where there are thrushes and bushes...you know, it's it's fairly wooded and near the river." </sentence><sentence id="950">Throughout the valley flows a river by the name of Vah and there are all kinds of hiding places. " </sentence><sentence id="951">Why don't you stay there? </sentence><sentence id="952">And uh then come back in the evening and we'll see how things go." </sentence><sentence id="953">Now remember...I'm fifteen years old, so L..and oh...and I get a sandwich. </sentence><sentence id="954">OK. </sentence><sentence id="955">I go in my sandals, in my short shoes, a shirt a belt and a sandwich, for the day at the river. </sentence><sentence id="956">Now you also must understand that through all of this time I know the area extremely well, and I'ma fabulous swimmer because we swim quite a bit in the river. </sentence><sentence id="957">It's a wild river. </sentence><sentence id="958">It has it has it has uh rapids too, and we swim through the rapids and so forth, but you know...and it's it's part of the training and oh...we swim through the river because we couldn't go to the only swimming pool there was in Tren_in. </sentence><sentence id="959">Since 1940 Jews are not allowed to go to the swimming pool so you learn how to swim through the river, which is dangerous and full of rapids, but it's fun. </sentence><sentence id="960">I told you, you know, hardship creates fun too. </sentence><sentence id="961">So I go to the river and I sit there and during the day I see on the bridge the German tanks coming in and motorcycles and the Germans are really moving in. </sentence><sentence id="962">Now the Germans are coming in full force. </sentence><sentence id="963">The army has basically abandoned the garrison. </sentence><sentence id="964">There is a huge

three o'clock in the afternoon I hear lots of shooting out in the mountains, which is in the direction which I knew very well which we...because we hiked there. </sentence><sentence id="973">And by four o'clock in the afternoon I decided I'm not going to go back to the house of this employee where his wife is not sure that really she she likes me and and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="974">It it's purely an instinct. </sentence><sentence id="975">It's it's...1 don't know...you you learn it as an animal. </sentence><sentence id="976">There are certain survival uh instincts that

under the bridges where the Nazis go up and down, and I swim for about five kilometers, totally out of range of the town, get out, know the area extremely well...we hiked there. </sentence><sentence id="980">It's a very picturesque area. </sentence><sentence id="981">It's it's it's a it's a valley surrounded by mountains on both sides, highly wooded, and I start marching late in the evening

know...we are put you in and uh then let's hop in the hop in the truck. </sentence><sentence id="1037">We mount the machine gun on top of the truck in case we run into Germans or Gardists...these were called like guardists, like they were called "Garda." </sentence><sentence id="1038">We go in into a village where apparently there is a base being made and there is...it's full of soldiers and there's arms all over the place and there's dynamite all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="1039">I mean there was just just all the arms you wanted to see because the soldiers...this was...they vacated the garrisons, took all the arms and they all and all all the ammo with them and I say well could I at least have a rifle, so we go this through this long negotiation. </sentence><sentence id="1040">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1041">You can have arifle. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And uh I sleep, get fed pork. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I really feel fantastic.

afternoon somebody says well, do you know how to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1047">I say I don't even know how to load the thing, so they take me out and they say this is what you do and they show me how to how to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1048">In the morning uh this, this, this Russian comes. </sentence><sentence id="1049">His name is "Batko" ...everybody's only known by their first name...comes and say, "Well, we're going to go for a raid. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Uh we really have to find a rail line that is close to the forest so we can really get ourselves lined up in here. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Uh we're taking you with us kid." </sentence><sentence id="1052">So I go...but no rifle...peasant clothing, just the hand grenade in your pocket, so I go on the first raid. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Now turns out that this was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me, because the army that fled and the communist government that got created, created actually an area, a liberated area. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They declared it a Czechoslovak-liberated state. </sentence><sentence id="1055">It was a hundred by two hundred kilometers.

</sentence><sentence id="1066">They joined the established environment. </sentence><sentence id="1067">Many of the Jews who had fled to that area, and of course when the Germans cleaned it up by October 28th, everybody got annihilated and there are these hugh tank ditches that people dug which are full of bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1068">You know, about eighty-five thousand people got killed in that that process. </sentence><sentence id="1069">So we go on the first raid I think on the 4th of September, and uh I like it. </sentence><sentence id="1070">I mean it is just great. </sentence><sentence id="1071">You know, here are the guys. </sentence><sentence id="1072">You know, there's eight of us, a machine gun, uh lots of ammo. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Uh there are guys who are carrying the TNT...that's what we used, uh TNT. </sentence><sentence id="1074">It's it's it's more powerful than than than dynamite but it's not like plastique, and these are little uh metal boxes about this big, this wide and uh it's a real charming group. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Uh a commando squad is a very unusual dynamics. </sentence><sentence id="1076">In other words, in no time everybody knows he is dependent on everybody, so I mean nobody says "I'm a Jew," or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1077">I mean it's just, you know, "Hey, kid. </sentence><sentence id="1078">You know, you going to walk ahead of us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1079">We we really need you." </sentence><sentence id="1080">And so I lead them through the mountains and uh we go further north of Tren_in. </sentence><sentence id="1081">See, below Tren_in the valley widens and the railroad track hugs the river so it's about two, three kilometers away from the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Once you go north of Tren_in, you are in a narrow valley and the railroad tracks sort of snakes in and out and there are dozens of places where you can come fairly close to the railroad without being seen. </sentence><sentence id="1083">So I take them there. </sentence><sentence id="1084">They are very pleased uh with with that, and uh so we march during the day, ducking the villages. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Of course the peasants see us, but everybody turns around. </sentence><sentence id="1086">You know, they don't want to see us and uh we go...starts raining. </sentence><sentence id="1087">We come to the edge, edge of the forest early in the evening and we are just going to sit there and wait. </sentence><sentence id="1088">I I'm not sure I know what's going on, but "Batko" obviously knows. </sentence><sentence id="1089">He must have done it dozens and dozens of times. </sentence><sentence id="1090">He sets up the machine gun so that if if uh the troops would come against us...the idea is to have a high ground. </sentence><sentence id="1091">The railroad is down, and we find, as I will show you later on a photograph, it's an embankment. </sentence><sentence id="1092">We sit at the edge of the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1093">There is an embankment below us where we sit will sit up the machine gun and This is a

gets dark uh "Batko" uh says "OK, let's go to the track. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And why don't you come with us." </sentence><sentence id="1098">So three of us go down to the track.

going down so that the piece of steel always presses against the lip of the rail and the trick then is to blow up the heaviest part of the train, which is the tender. </sentence><sentence id="1110">In other words, the steam...these are steam locomotives by the ways...the heaviest part of the train is where you have the water and the coal, which is usually about fifteen meters behind the front of the train. </sentence><sentence id="1111">I mean, these are standard-sized locomotives and the way "Batko" explains it all you have to do is knock out the rail under the tender, the heavy part, and derail the tender. </sentence><sentence id="1112">The tender will tip over and pull the rest of the train down from the embankment. </sentence><sentence id="1113">So you know, this is an art form. </sentence><sentence id="1114">So far as "Batko" is concerned, derailing trains is an art form. </sentence><sentence id="1115">The...and then he, of course, he is full of stories. </sentence><sentence id="1116">You know, as we sit there he tells me stories. </sentence><sentence id="1117">He is a very lively kind of a guy. </sentence><sentence id="1118">Uh again, the squad is eight people, three Russians and five Slovaks of whom four are communists (including one of them who fought in the Spanish civil war), so that's that's the squad and the guy who fought in the Spanish Civil War, it's it's a father and a son so there's father and son in the squad. </sentence><sentence id="1119">That's that's the makeup of the squad. </sentence><sentence id="1120">Get along very well. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And uh the idea then is to lay the TNT under the rail, connect a fuse so that when the first wheel of the steam engine comes and crushes the fuse it will ignite the This

then will ignite a cord and the cord goes at the rate of one second every twenty centimeters, so that the speed of the train is about forty miles an hour, thirty miles an hour, you need a cord approximately four feet long so that when the first wheel detonates the thing, the train will have passed approximately fifteen meters and it will blow right under the wheel of the tender. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Again this is this is...now we're doing with professionals. </sentence><sentence id="1127">The problem with most of the partisans that existed and the stories that you hear about partisans...these were all amateurs. </sentence><sentence id="1128">This is this is this is killer stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Highly specialized. </sentence><sentence id="1130">So uh we lay the TNT. </sentence><sentence id="1131">We lay the fuse, but we don't put the fuse on top of the rail, because we are going to do it only when we get a freight train. </sentence><sentence id="1132">We don't want to blow up a passenger train. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Uh and so that's how we do it for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Uh we know by sound how this thing works. </sentence><sentence id="1135">Uh we can tell a freight train. " </sentence><sentence id="1136">Batko" knows how to tell a freight train. </sentence><sentence id="1137">We go back to the embankment about midnight, maybe eleven o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1138">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1139">By that time it rains. </sentence><sentence id="1140">The field that is between the embankment...you know, it's only about two hundred meters but it's a it's a soggy field and uh between the field there is a path which is beaten but everything else has been plowed. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I mean this is September. </sentence><sentence id="1142">This is a wheat field. </sentence><sentence id="1143">It has been plowed, and "Batko" says, "You just make sure that you're in there where the path is." </sentence><sentence id="1144">So we go back up. </sentence><sentence id="1145">When the uh when when "Batko" says, "I've seen we've got a freight train," and we go back up on the embankment and we crouch against the embankment and we wait until we see the lights of the freight train. </sentence><sentence id="1146">You have to see the lights of the freight train because if the Germans have what's called a draisienne [NB: a handcar], which is a little platform or a a little armored car ahead of it...they usually used to push a flat car...later by the way they had hostages on the on the flat car with them from the local villages but this time they didn't...you want to make sure they don't blow up the uh flat car. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And of course this was still early, and I don't think on the first train the Germans expected anything. </sentence><sentence id="1148">You know, they used a rail car. </sentence><sentence id="1149">This is the main rail line between Danube

lines that were going north-south were critical to the ability of the Germans to shift troops back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1153">They were running out of troops, out of out of troops and out of uh the ability to defend, so those three lines were very dependent. </sentence><sentence id="1154">The Ukrainian command had four squads who had nothing else to do except keep those lines, lines harassed. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And by the way, when you blow up that line, usually it gets cleared up in about a half'a day. </sentence><sentence id="1156">The the objective...Yah, I mean you cannot disable the line unless you blow up a bri...a major bridge which you couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I mean the bridges were extremely well defended. </sentence><sentence id="1158">That's the first thing the Germans took care of. </sentence><sentence id="1159">All you can do is make it difficult for the Germans, make them go slow, uh divert arms, go into com... and and deploy troops to keep the lines clear so you you really...it's a harassing act. </sentence><sentence id="1160">It's it's it's it's it's a bee bite. </sentence><sentence id="1161">It's not deadly stuff, but that's what guerrilla warfare is all about. </sentence><sentence id="1162">So so uh we have to wait until we see the lights of the of the uh of the of the train, and as we go back to arm this thing, uh "Batko," who is going to do that, hands over to me the detonators. </sentence><sentence id="1163">It's a box. </sentence><sentence id="1164">The the the detonators are ina box. </sentence><sentence id="1165">It's it's a sort of leather pouch. </sentence><sentence id="1166">These are little cartridges about this big. </sentence><sentence id="1167">It has uh fulminate of mercury. </sentence><sentence id="1168">If you hit it, it explodes. </sentence><sentence id="1169">It's...these are the igniters that you have in all ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And while he's fitting the fuse he holds, asks me to hold uh that leather box which is lined with cotton and has these detonators. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Now what I didn't know was that we had more TNT than we had detonators. </sentence><sentence id="1172">We were short in detonators. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And so this train keeps coming. </sentence><sentence id="1174">You see the lights and there is "Batko," you know, uh mounting this detonator on that fuse and I'm pretty cool and uh as I hand it to him I spill all the detonators right on the uh embankment, which is made out of gravel and "Batko" says, "You better get those." </sentence><sentence id="1175">I mean...and and this this is serious stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1176">So...and he starts running off the

id="1182">And uh I miss it, so I hit the plowed wet field, which is really a potfull of mud and I just uh go, you know, maybe uh twenty feet or something and then I see the train sort of chugging and I look over my shoulder and I say, "Well, this is just about when it's going to blow." </sentence><sentence id="1183">I hit the ground and the train blows. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And you could

id="1186">It just blows and then slowly starts going off the embankment and then pulls the front cars. </sentence><sentence id="1187">The front cars had some tanks on it. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I mean it was a troop train, and in the middle was...the Germans had uh uh you know machine gun nests and you hear, pop...it's there what you call flares, and the way a flare works, a flare gun...it's a big barrel gun. </sentence><sentence id="1189">It's a rocket. </sentence><sentence id="1190">You hear the pop. </sentence><sentence id="1191">It's like on Fourth of July. </sentence><sentence id="1192">You always hear the ignition and the take-off and it only ignites when it gets up on the top. </sentence><sentence id="1193">So I stay on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1194">You know, I I hear, I feel the hot stuff uh from the from the steam escaping from the from the train and the iron's flying around but didn't hit me, and there I see a white light coming down. </sentence><sentence id="1195">They've shot it over very far, and of course "Batko" by that time was scrambling up the embankment and so they started shooting at him. </sentence><sentence id="1196">Didn't hit him. </sentence><sentence id="1197">So as soon as the flare dies out, I start running down the field. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Now maybe the Germans had only one flare gun, or maybe the guy who's shooting the flare gun was very slow, but the the uh you know there were intervals, enough intervals between the uh flare guns that I could always...when I hear a pop I hit the ground and waited, and of course they were raking with machine gun fire with tracers over the field. </sentence><sentence id="1199">They didn't know what they were shooting at. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Uh they didn't see that there was an embankment actually going up. </sentence><sentence id="1201">They were just sort of raking at eye level. </sentence><sentence

shooting willy nilly and then the Germans would have shooted willy nilly, and but these were really professionals, particularly the guy from the Spanish civil war. </sentence><sentence id="1211">This was a cool cucumber. </sentence><sentence id="1212">I mean this guy was an absolute professional killer. </sentence><sentence id="1213">Uh by the way, this guy after the war became the uh head of a trial. </sentence><sentence id="1214">He was the head judge that hanged Tiso. </sentence><sentence id="1215">He was the...he became a judge. </sentence><sentence id="1216">This this one judge you wouldn't want to come in front of. </sentence><sentence id="1217">At any rate, a great guy. </sentence><sentence id="1218">So I get up the embankment and they were lying down there. </sentence><sentence id="1219">They were waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="1220">One one of the things in a commando squad is, in a professional commando squad, you don't let your guys hang around. </sentence><sentence id="1221">Now if they get wounded, you shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="1222">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Because you don't want them to fall into enemy hands, but but there's a funny ethic in a in that kind of attack, that that you really protect your people. </sentence><sentence id="1224">You don't have that many and so they said OK, you made it. </sentence><sentence id="1225">Did OK. </sentence><sentence id="1226">So then we go up in the mountain and and uh we uh we stop and uh at a little clearing and of course we hear the crackle from there and the Germans are firing firing wildly but it's dark, it's raining, so you know, the the bullets are not even coming close to us. </sentence><sentence id="1227">And uh "Batko" says "OK, now let's regroup." </sentence><sentence id="1228">He pulls out his pistol and points it at me..."You lost our caps. </sentence><sentence id="1229">We cannot go on another raid. </sentence><sentence

" </sentence><sentence id="1246">Batko" says, "I'm not going to slug through the mountains," because we used to go off the paths and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1247">This was al... already in October. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Things were getting pretty tough and the German patrols were all over the place, and he said, "We are we are just going to go on the road," and we said, you know, "You can't do that." " </sentence><sentence id="1249">Oh, we're going to go down the road." </sentence><sentence id="1250">So we say, "Well, we're going going to walk in the ditch," because I mean to walk in the middle of

"Batko" stood in the middle of the road with his uh PTS, which is this this Russian uh automatic with the seventeen...it looks like gangster...it's a knock-off of a Al Capone gun. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1261">Uh, I, I don't know why, but, but, but just the luck ran out of it and then, uh, on November 2nd, uh, we had the misfortune to get mixed up in a fight that we really didn't belong to. </sentence><sentence id="1262">Uh, the Germans always tried to move the partisans that were remaining. </sentence><sentence id="1263">By, you know, by the 28th they cleaned up the

field the job of holding the line for retreating soldiers ... against advancing German tanks. </sentence><sentence id="1265">I mean total slaughter, and then the Germans had Ukrainians

think that the the two Russians sort of wanted to to to sort of keep with others because of food or whatever and so in November we got uh we joined a bigger group because we were going to move our

were wounded, you were...you might as well shoot yourself and so uh they were shooting at us all day and then during the night they went after us, which was very unusual, and the way they went after us, they pretended that they were Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1276">These were Vlasov ...these were the Vlasov guys, and so I got separated in November from the, from the squad.

March we also picked up five Americans fliers who were wandering through the mountains who uh who had been shot down and who who just stayed with the partisans, although they refused...this was a very peculiar thing...they refused to carry arms because they were protected by the Geneva Convention if they didn't carry arms and you know, we told them..."Look, you guys,...[ mean I mean, you're not
