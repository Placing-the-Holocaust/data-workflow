<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: A loom? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: A loom, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="96">They did that at home. </sentence><sentence id="97">The textile industry was very prominent in Lodz and that spilled over to our little town because we were about only 14 kilometers from Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="98">Almost like a suburb. </sentence><sentence id="99">I used to go and visit her and watch her, after school she was doing all this and I thought it was fascinating. </sentence><sentence id="100">In the same street there was a factory, textile factory, the owner was Jewish and she said, "Oh he takes apprentice girls if you want to learn this trade." </sentence><sentence id="101">So, I don't know how I persuaded my father to let me do it, because he didn't think something like that I should go work in a factory, after all, but I said," Iam not going to go there." </sentence><sentence id="102">Here if he takes me in, even at the age of 13, there were no labor laws over there, so you could earn money if you wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, these couple months until the war came out I learned and I worked there for a while. </sentence><sentence id="104">I was happy because I got paid for it and I felt very important. </sentence><sentence id="105">Also, because I didn't continue school, we did sort of at home learn some mote. </sentence><sentence id="106">I don't know what kind of education my father had, but he was so wise and he knew so many things that I really don't know where he learned all this. </sentence><sentence id="107">So, we just kept on learning from them. </sentence><sentence id="108">We also had a habit of reading a lot. </sentence><sentence id="109">Then my father was busy working and had no time to read the newspapers, my mother would sit next to him and read him aloud the newspapers and I remember her chuckling about when the world news in this paper about certain things that happened in America. </sentence><sentence id="110">And that's what we would call the United States, and she shook her and used to say, "Only in America things like that can happen." </sentence><sentence id="111">It was something unbelievable whatever it was I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="112">Anyway, she was marveling at the things that were happening here, even at that time. </sentence><sentence id="113">So, like I said, I was sheltered. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was happy. </sentence><sentence id="115">Until this fatal day when Germany marched into Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Just let me ask you one question. </sentence><sentence id="138">When you were reading in the newspapers were you reading about Germany and Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Yes, we did. </sentence><sentence id="142">My mother used to read and she used to be very stressed about it. </sentence><sentence id="143">Refugees, people from Germany, Jewish people, came through the town, and I remember that she was collecting, going around and collecting clothes for them and other things. </sentence><sentence id="144">We donated a lot of things to them. </sentence><sentence id="145">My mother could not get over it because when she was a girl going to school, quite young, the part where we lived was once Russian and once Austrian or Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="146">I guess she was in grade school or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="147">Anyway, then she lived downstairs with my grandparents of course. </sentence><sentence id="148">After she came home from school she used to hang around the store and the Germans that came into the store, they were so polite, and she says, "I was a little girl and they came in they greeted me, and kissed my hand, and called me Fraulein Marta." </sentence><sentence id="149">That was her name, and she said, "I can't understand that those should be the same people, and that they would get so insane and follow a man, an evil man like him." </sentence><sentence id="150">It was unbelievable, and what we counted on is for the world to stop him. </sentence><sentence id="151">But it didn't happen, we know that. </sentence><sentence id="152">Just it seems like to her unbelievable that nobody stood up against him and let  him get away with whatever he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: So, you were starting to tell me how things changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Well, there was a battle a little whiles away from our city. </sentence><sentence id="168">The city was called Kutno (ph).Soldiers, German soldiers were marching through there. </sentence><sentence id="169">And while they were marching through the city, they used to stop and do some looting and rounding also. </sentence><sentence id="170">Because it was so close and shrapnels were falling in the city, we all took shelter in the courtyard in the back. </sentence><sentence id="171">There was a building which was a theater before the war, a movie house, so all the neighbors gathered and we slept in that building. </sentence><sentence id="172">We made sort of an improvised bedding, the stove was there. </sentence><sentence id="173">We brought our food and we slept there, but when the soldiers were matching through and trying to loot the homes, some of the Polish people pointed out where we were and made us go out there and they just took whatever they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="174">To the end, there was nothing left to take, so the last soldiers that came up in the house and went all over the place and couldn't find anything, you know what they took? </sentence><sentence id="175">My father had all these accessories for fixing watches and people broke the glass on top. </sentence><sentence id="176">He fixed, he put all different kinds of shapes of glass for all different watches. </sentence><sentence id="177">They picked up handfuls and put in their pockets. </sentence><sentence id="178">Just the glass, would you believe that? </sentence><sentence id="179">We just shook our heads and didn't know what are they going to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="180">The battle lasted there for a few days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: This was when? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: 1939. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: September? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="203">They entered our city to stay -- I think what -- I don't remember the day, but according to the paper I got from my home town, it was supposed to have been September 5. </sentence><sentence id="204">I know they came in real early. </sentence><sentence id="205">The first day, 25 Jews were shot right there, on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="206">I don't know how they could know these people were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="207">I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="208">I wasn't on the street. </sentence><sentence id="209">I just know that would happen. </sentence><sentence id="210">So, you see, there was panic. </sentence><sentence id="211">Everybody run, hiding in their homes. </sentence><sentence id="212">We just sit there not knowing what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="213">And then again, they came into your homes and then they took household goods. </sentence><sentence id="214">Pillows, pictures if you had anything of value, whatever they thought they wanted, they took. </sentence><sentence id="215">Businesses were taken over, Jewish businesses, of course. </sentence><sentence id="216">On our street, there were quiet a few enterprises, there were stores, you know. </sentence><sentence id="217">On the left side we had a family that run a store where you bought material and made clothes, coats and clothes. </sentence><sentence id="218">Then the lady that took over my grandmother's store, she had a little grocery store. </sentence><sentence id="219">Next to it was a tinsmith, like he was fixing pots and pans and all that. </sentence><sentence id="220">Then was another large family that was selling pots, and pans, and sweaters, all kinds of glassware. </sentence><sentence id="221">Like in New York they have the Pottery Barn, and it was something like that, on a small scale. </sentence><sentence id="222">Farther down you had other stores. </sentence><sentence id="223">Across the street there were shoe stores. </sentence><sentence id="224">There were all kinds of little enterprises and everybody made a living because it was a industrial town. </sentence><sentence id="225">There was a couple textile factories and the rest of the population made a nice living, so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="226">But all of this had stopped. </sentence><sentence id="227">They took over city halls naturally, the  Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="228">And from then on the orders came. </sentence><sentence id="229">Right away, the first days Jews were beaten on the streets, wherever you showed up. </sentence><sentence id="230">Our two synagogues were burned down. </sentence><sentence id="231">The rest of the walls that remained standing the Jewish people were forced to dismantle. </sentence><sentence id="232">That's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="233">There's not a sign left in the city of the synagogues. </sentence><sentence id="234">Nothing to remind you if you didn't know they were there. </sentence><sentence id="235">So, you see life was hard. </sentence><sentence id="236">Then all the rules came out. </sentence><sentence id="237">We could not enter any stores. </sentence><sentence id="238">We still lived where we did originally when the war started, but we could not enter any stores to buy any provisions. </sentence><sentence id="239">We were not allowed to walk on the sidewalks, only on the middle of the road. </sentence><sentence id="240">Later on, the arm bands came with the yellow stars. </sentence><sentence id="241">We had to form, like in every city a Jewish administration. </sentence><sentence id="242">And they had to follow orders. </sentence><sentence id="243">The orders came to them, they had to carry them out. </sentence><sentence id="244">Otherwise they come in and did twice as much damage as originally they wanted, whatever they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="245">So, it was hard. </sentence><sentence id="246">Right away they demanded so many young men, single men, supposedly for labor into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="247">But we knew later on that it wasn't so. </sentence><sentence id="248">These people send us one time a post card that they were well and we should send them food. </sentence><sentence id="249">People did, but you know they never received and these people never survived the first couple days, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="250">I think they did exterminate them right away, these first transports. </sentence><sentence id="251">That's what we were told. </sentence><sentence id="252">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="253">Some of them probably went into camps. </sentence><sentence id="254">Like my husband, when he was grabbed on the streets of Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="255">He said, "I built some of the camps." </sentence><sentence id="256">He said, "I helped them put the walls up," so you see, some of them probably went that way and didn't survive or whatever happened. </sentence><sentence id="257">Anyway life was hard, we did not have enough access to medication, to real food that we needed. </sentence><sentence id="258">So, you see older people, babies, sick people died, lack of medication, lack of facilities too or lack of food. </sentence><sentence id="259">The first victims tight away, and quite a few every day, quite a few. </sentence><sentence id="260">It was hard. </sentence><sentence id="261">Then if you walked down the streets, they grabbed you off the street and made you clean the roads or whatever, beating the people, making fun of them. </sentence><sentence id="262">Some of the religious people, the Hasidic people they caught. </sentence><sentence id="263">Like in every city they made them wear the prayer shawls, and run back and forth, and cut their beards off. </sentence><sentence id="264">It was their favorite pasttime in every city. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Did this happen to your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: No, it did not happen to my father. </sentence><sentence id="331">My father, actually had a small beard, very neat trimmed, you know. </sentence><sentence id="332">But we -- my father ended up to be almost the only one in his trade in the city, and so from the beginning on we were forced to work for them. </sentence><sentence id="333">The local people pointed out that he was the craftsman. </sentence><sentence id="334">They came in and brought all their watches to repair and of coutse the gold they robbed from whoever they found. </sentence><sentence id="335">My father had to fashion other jewelry for them which they sent home. </sentence><sentence id="336">Some of them not even said thank you but some of them surprisingly brought some provisions, some food, which we appreciated very much but you couldn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="337">You were afraid to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="338">You were grateful for whatever you got, no matter which source it came. </sentence><sentence id="339">It was hard to live and we were growing children and denied everything right away. </sentence><sentence id="340">It just didn't do good for our health and for our morals, because of this and trying to figure out what was going on, it was confusing. </sentence><sentence id="341">We just lived from day to day, not knowing what the next day will bring. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Was there any sense of normalcy? </sentence><sentence id="355">Did you have friends, did you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: I had friends as long as we could, we did communicate with one another. </sentence><sentence id="357">But it was more dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="358">You were afraid to go out on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="359">Sometimes they just picked you off the streets and you disappeared not knowing where you went. </sentence><sentence id="360">So, it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="361">Most people stayed close to home. </sentence><sentence id="362">They also liquidated the library. </sentence><sentence id="363">There were a lot of Jewish books in the library, so at the time of liquidation whoever was close grabbed a few books and they just made a circle around the people. </sentence><sentence id="364">I remember quite a few of them finding their way into our home. </sentence><sentence id="365">We used to read them in the evenings where we had to cover the windows that the light shouldn't be visible outside. </sentence><sentence id="366">We used to sit -- that was the only thing you could do is talk and read. </sentence><sentence id="367">You could not observe any holidays any more. </sentence><sentence id="368">In your own home if possibly, you could get away with it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="369">My father still prayed every morning and he went into the bedroom and closed the door real early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="370">We were hoping nobody would come to see that, but he observed as long as he could possibly the circumstances let him do that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Were you ever subject to any punishment or did you see any beatings or hangings or any sort of that brutal treatment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Well, I was grabbed once from the street and made to scrub school halls and they really were not dirty, it was just mean. </sentence><sentence id="374">A whole day long from morning till night. </sentence><sentence id="375">Somehow, by some miracle they let me go. </sentence><sentence id="376">When I came home, my parents were really upset and they thought they would never see me again. </sentence><sentence id="377">What happened was, yes, I saw hangings. </sentence><sentence id="378">One day we were marched into the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="379">All of us, we had to be there. </sentence><sentence id="380">Sick people, even a woman that just had a child had to come with the baby there. </sentence><sentence id="381">All lined up, they marched in ten young Jewish men and the girls were errect and they were going to be hanged there. </sentence><sentence id="382">We all had to be witness, we all had to watch this. </sentence><sentence id="383">They claim they committed a crime against Germany by violating the curfew, supposedly stealing something, any kind of excuse to do this. </sentence><sentence id="384">The last minute before hanging they announced that they would let one of these men go free if the Jewish people could collect enough money to ransom him out. </sentence><sentence id="385">Of course we wanted to save this person. </sentence><sentence id="386">People gave money. </sentence><sentence id="387">They let one man go but this is what I always tell everybody how cruel that was because all these 10 people standing there each one of them praying and hoping he would be the one picked and be saved. </sentence><sentence id="388">That's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="389">Can you imagine that?So, life was hard, like I say. </sentence><sentence id="390">People were dying every day. </sentence><sentence id="391">We just tried to survive from one day to the next, but we know that Hitler's goal was to erase the Jewish people from Europe and if possibly he would go farther, it would be more. </sentence><sentence id="392">That was his goal. </sentence><sentence id="393">So, people were not dying fast enough even matter what they starved us and beat us, they thought the process is too slow, and to get a hold of us much faster, they wanted us in one place, so the cities, the small little places, hamlets and little cities were concentrated and each district in one large ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="394">We lived in our Ghetto until 1942 under these circumstances. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Now, did they move you, how did all of this take place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: They told us to line up. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="421">Q: When was this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="422">A: I have to go back because I forgot an important thing. </sentence><sentence id="423">Is that all right? </sentence><sentence id="424">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="425">Before we were sent to the ghetto in our home town, they still wanted to reduce the population in half in our home town before they separated us in the outskirts of the city. </sentence><sentence id="426">We were first of all we were two years in a ghetto in Ozerkoff. </sentence><sentence id="427">So, they wanted less people, so one day we wete assembled in the school auditorium, men, women, and children. </sentence><sentence id="428">There were Nazis in front of us and we were told to strip naked and parade in front of them. </sentence><sentence id="429">They looked us over like a bunch of cattle and we were stamped like a bunch of cattle with a letter A or B. We were told to get dressed, go home, and wait for further orders. </sentence><sentence id="430">In a couple weeks or in a week, I can't remember the length of time, then we were told again to assemble in the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="431">There we were surrounded by trucks, machine guns and all these Nazis and told that the people with the letter A go to one side and the people with the letter B go to the next side. </sentence><sentence id="432">The people with the letter B they herded on those trucks and drove them away. </sentence><sentence id="433">This is where my grandmother went. </sentence><sentence id="434">My eighty-some-year-old grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="435">I was told after the war that those were the first experimental gassings with the exhaust pipe in those trucks. </sentence><sentence id="436">So, this is how she died. </sentence><sentence id="437">If this is really the way it happened, it was a horrible death. </sentence><sentence id="438">After that we were herded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: Before we stopped the tape, you were talking about this selection. </sentence><sentence id="457">They took away half of the population which was marked B, what did that mean? </sentence><sentence id="458">Who was taken away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="462">A: Sick people, children, older people, mothers of children, those people they got rid of because they thought women with children, their children would be a hindrance. </sentence><sentence id="463">They couldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="464">The younger people they left using them for work. </sentence><sentence id="465">Those are the people that went away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="470">Q: Now, just tell me when you were standing naked in front of all of these Nazis having to parade around, that must have been a very unusual experience. </sentence><sentence id="471">I'm wondering if it was more difficult for the girls? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: I think I was shocked because I had never seen a naked male, not even my own brothers. </sentence><sentence id="475">It was shocking. </sentence><sentence id="476">I just looked around myself and saw everybody walking ahead so I figured this is what I have to do, trying to shield yourself, you know parts of your body because it was so embarrassing. </sentence><sentence id="477">But they just -- they were so impersonal, just picking up that stamp going like this, you know, like canceling things out. </sentence><sentence id="478">This is the way it looked to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: What was the stamp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: It was like you stamp a paper, the same kind of ink. </sentence><sentence id="487">They told us to be very careful to see that it doesn't erase. </sentence><sentence id="488">That they would be able if they wanted to check this, if it's the truth which side we ate going so they would be able to check this out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="492">Q: Where did they stamp your </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="493">A: On out bare body, up here, so we sort of walked around and slept on one side trying to see-- because ink does erase, this type of an ink, especially on your body. </sentence><sentence id="494">That is what we had to do. </sentence><sentence id="495">Now after these people were taken away, they created in our home town a ghetto in the outskirts of the city. </sentence><sentence id="496">We were surrounded by guards, like three, four families in one toom. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="519">A: No, my sister is alive. </sentence><sentence id="520">But from the ghetto every morning we had to gather in front of the gates. </sentence><sentence id="521">They marched us out into the city to a certain destination where were worked for their industry. </sentence><sentence id="522">Almost all the population worked one place or another making warm shoes or we made little fur jackets from rabbit fur for the Russian front for the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="523">There were different phases of doing this. </sentence><sentence id="524">One was the cutter, one was the pattern maker, and then the putting it together, the inspection and finally putting it in the boxes and so much had to be put out every day. </sentence><sentence id="525">When the day was over, we were marched back into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="526">Naturally, we tried to make something to eat, and rest up, and somehow to communicate with your neighbors and whatever you could, if you still had the strength when it was warm outside just to walk outside and just walk a little bit, feeling a little more free than being so confined in one place. </sentence><sentence id="527">Of course we were not free, we were isolated, but it felt much better and this is the way we sort of communicated or associated in this little ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="528">But that was not -- they used to come into the ghetto and line us up and pick out people out of this line for deportation. </sentence><sentence id="529">Whenever they had a whim they would just come in and get people. </sentence><sentence id="530">I remember one time standing in this line. </sentence><sentence id="531">My youngest brother was behind me in between and he was so small and we found a box. </sentence><sentence id="532">We put him on top of the box and sort of hid this box between our legs. </sentence><sentence id="533">But there, I was again sick. </sentence><sentence id="534">I had a bad infection, I remember, on this side of my face. </sentence><sentence id="535">My whole side of the face was covered up with a scarf, with a white scarf and this black salve put on it. </sentence><sentence id="536">You could see it through and this S.S. man was walking back and forth picking out people, looking this way and that way. </sentence><sentence id="537">The third person from me was a brother of my friend. </sentence><sentence id="538">He had a big birth mark, a red one on his face and he looked at him and he said, "Out." </sentence><sentence id="539">And I can't understand how he walked by that many times in front of me and did not take me out of this line. </sentence><sentence id="540">This is something that I will never understand the rest of my life, but it happened that way. </sentence><sentence id="541">When I tell people, they say, "It wasn't your time to die." </sentence><sentence id="542">That's all I can figure out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="618">Q: How much did you take with you to Lodz in terms of personal -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="620"> Pats Just personal belongings that's all you could take, but sometimes people took on themselves, on their person, jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="621">You know no matter how much they searched, some people smuggled it through. </sentence><sentence id="622">They risked their life, but people did that. </sentence><sentence id="623">So, then, we were marched into the ghetto assigned to a place to live, also with several people. </sentence><sentence id="624">The first we lived on a street called Linarskenein (ph), but that was just like a weigh-station because we had no place to go and we sort of slept on the floor there even. </sentence><sentence id="625">There wasn't even a bunk bed or anything. </sentence><sentence id="626">Later on, this other room, these two rooms got vacant and me and another family were assigned to this street. </sentence><sentence id="627">It was called Berkayoselovicha (ph) and we lived on that street. </sentence><sentence id="628">Each one of us has to be assigned to a work place, and there what would you call the work places were called in Lodz, "resorts." </sentence><sentence id="629">This is what they called them. </sentence><sentence id="630">I don't know for what reason. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="642">Q: Who assigned your </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: I don't know, I think the Jewish Admin -- or wherever. </sentence><sentence id="645">They wanted us to work. </sentence><sentence id="646">This is where they send. </sentence><sentence id="647">Each one of us got a Russian card and the provisions were -- the only time you could get your provisions was after a whole day's work. </sentence><sentence id="648">Then you stood in line, I don't  know how long just to get even your loaf of bread or the other provisions. </sentence><sentence id="649">Sometimes people fainted dead away, in these lines, but we had no choice, you see Ghetto Lodz had thousands of people, not only from Poland, but they had people from all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="650">It was confusing. </sentence><sentence id="651">At the same time they were shipping us in from all over, they were deporting people from Lodz Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="652">It was like coming and going, coming and going every single day. </sentence><sentence id="653">It wasn't safe on the street. </sentence><sentence id="654">You never knew if you went to the destination of your work if you'd return because they could grab you on the street and just cart you away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="666">Q: That was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="668">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="669">Of course the leader of the Lodz Ghetto was Haim Rumkosky (ph). </sentence><sentence id="670">He was the king. </sentence><sentence id="671">Everyone knows that. </sentence><sentence id="672">He even had money printed and I think his picture was on it. </sentence><sentence id="673">That much I don't -- but I know it would have to be that way. </sentence><sentence id="674">He taught -- this ghetto would be forever because we did such important work for the German government. </sentence><sentence id="675">Military orders and whatnot all, so for the time being he thought we were safe. </sentence><sentence id="676">What was safe there? </sentence><sentence id="677">I wasn't safe. </sentence><sentence id="678">First of all we were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="679">What they gave us wasn't enough to live on. </sentence><sentence id="680">People were dying, hundreds every day. </sentence><sentence id="681">Some managed to bury the people on their own, but some of them couldn't so they were buried -- they came down and picked up the dead bodies in a bag and buried them in one grave. </sentence><sentence id="682">It was hard walking down the street. </sentence><sentence id="683">There were some children that by miracle survived, and still were in the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="684">And you saw them standing on the streets, raggedy, swollen, hungry, asking for food. </sentence><sentence id="685">Who had anything to give them?We were starving ourselves, but it was something hard to take, even when you were hungry because you felt I can't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="686">You felt helpless. </sentence><sentence id="687">And we lived there for two years, but in between there, like I said, there were called deportations, different phases. </sentence><sentence id="688">It was called lists, so they send lists, they send the order to the administration. </sentence><sentence id="689">They wanted that many young people, let's say single people, the oldest from the family, supposedly for labor. </sentence><sentence id="690">So the administration had to make a list who should be going to these deportations. </sentence><sentence id="691">That was called the "Time of the Lists." </sentence><sentence id="692">Then there was the time of the shpera (ph). </sentence><sentence id="693">They sealed off the streets and they came in with the trucks and just grabbed people out from the homes and took them away. </sentence><sentence id="694">They also, I think, came several times to the hospitals and took people out. </sentence><sentence id="695">But despite of all this, there was -- people were determined to normalize this life. </sentence><sentence id="696">I know for a fact that there were several organizations, several culture places. </sentence><sentence id="697">Of course I never went because my patents were too protective. </sentence><sentence id="698">After I came home from work, they were so afraid that something would happen to us if we go out, that they just did not permit us to join any of these things. </sentence><sentence id="699">But I know that there were cultural events held and people even went like to schools. </sentence><sentence id="700">It was forbidden of course. </sentence><sentence id="701">It was like in hiding, but it was done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: Who was organizing all these activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: I think there were teachers there and other people that were capable to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: Was there an actual underground or resistance organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: Lodz -- I don't know if there was much underground. </sentence><sentence id="744">You see Lodz Ghetto was a little  0 different than let's say for instance Warsaw Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="745">It was sealed much tighter and it was hard to get out. </sentence><sentence id="746">We had little communication with the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="747">That's why it was harder to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="748">Even less heroic what Warsaw Ghetto did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="755">Q: Did people have radios? </sentence><sentence id="756">Did you have any idea what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="759">A: We knew. </sentence><sentence id="760">We didn't have a radio, but someone must have because news came filtering through to us. </sentence><sentence id="761">We knew what was going on on the fronts. </sentence><sentence id="762">You see, we heard that the Russians were advancing and the Allies were bombing, but because we were in such terrible situation, and because my father always said that this war was going to be a lightning war. </sentence><sentence id="763">He used to say in German, a blitzkrieg, because of all the technology and the air warfare, this war was going to end fast, but it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="764">You see, it dragged on and that's why when all these news kept on infiltrating into the ghetto, we listened to it, hoping but somehow it sounded unbelievable that Hitler is being defeated or he is losing a battle because he is so almighty and look what he was doing to us. </sentence><sentence id="765">We were helpless and we could not defend ourselves, so it was do we believe or do we not believe what we are hearing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: You talk about the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="774">Let's take the first period, that "Time of the Lists." </sentence><sentence id="775">Was there any logic to who was getting deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: Of course, people you mean from Lodz, the original people who lived in Lodz or what do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: Well, what segments of the population? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="784">They took, let's say, my sister had a friend who's parents were taken away at home. </sentence><sentence id="785">She was alone. </sentence><sentence id="786">She was single. </sentence><sentence id="787">There was no family there so they used to take single people first like that. </sentence><sentence id="788">Then young able bodied people because they told them these people are going for labor into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="789">But you see, those people really disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="790">There's not a trace of these people left that went with the lists. </sentence><sentence id="791">They were all exterminated, and we know that for a fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="801">Q: What about -- the lists, I assume, were made up by Rumkosky and his -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: What about old people, sick people, children -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: Oh, these were naturally deported. </sentence><sentence id="808">These were deported. </sentence><sentence id="809">Sick people and old people had not place in Hitler's programs. </sentence><sentence id="810">They were not useful at all. </sentence><sentence id="811">They go first because they can't even work. </sentence><sentence id="812">He worked us to death. </sentence><sentence id="813">That's what he wanted anyway, but in the meanwhile, we were young, and we were healthy and we were useful. </sentence><sentence id="814">So, we survived as long as they felt that they can work us to death. </sentence><sentence id="815">At least they have something out of us. </sentence><sentence id="816">But older people, sick people, were of no use to them, so naturally those people were exterminated right away. </sentence><sentence id="817"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="829">Q: Were there regular selections on the streets that you saw or you were a patt of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="831">A: Not in Lodz, I have not seen that. </sentence><sentence id="832">I just know of -- yes, because my sister's friend went, you know, with those lists, she went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="835">Q: Did you ever see or hear Rumkosky? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="837"> Pats He drove by once in this horse and buggy carriage. </sentence><sentence id="838">This was the only transportation, sitting like a king there. </sentence><sentence id="839">He was grey and old at that time already and thinking God knows who he is. </sentence><sentence id="840">You know, it was like a man of life and death almost. </sentence><sentence id="841">Some people say -- after the war we had one time a discussion in Milwaukee after we saw the film about Lodz Ghetto, we had a discussion about Rumkosky and some people said that he was forced to do what he was doing, but I don't see it that way. </sentence><sentence id="842">Me, personally, I don't see it that way. </sentence><sentence id="843">Because if he would have been forced to do it, he would have a different attitude than what he had. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="844"> Os What was his attitude? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="845">A: Like he was the king and he was going to last forever and rule this kingdom here because he's so safe and secure because we ate doing such a job for Germany that they can't do without us. </sentence><sentence id="846">That was his main idea, that that's why we ate safe, but no Jew was safe in Nazi occupation. </sentence><sentence id="847">We know that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="851">Q: Tell me about the work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: Well, there were different places of work. </sentence><sentence id="854">My father was assigned to a shop called the machine shop, repaired their sewing machines and all other instruments which were shipped to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="855">My brother, my older brother worked in a steel shop. </sentence><sentence id="856">My sister worked in a place called Marishean (ph), and that they were making straw shoes. </sentence><sentence id="857">The method of making is really interesting. </sentence><sentence id="858">They bought all these stacks of straw. </sentence><sentence id="859">They lined them up on the ground next to their feet, put water on it, and they had to stamp on the straw to make it softer. </sentence><sentence id="860">Then they used to braid the straw with their hands and shape them into shoes for the soldiers on the front. </sentence><sentence id="861">And she always used to come home with bleeding hands from this job. </sentence><sentence id="862">My little brother, I exactly don't remember whete he worked, would you believe it. </sentence><sentence id="863">I know that he went to work every day and I worked in a place where they were embroidering emblems for the uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="864">My mother had brought-home work. </sentence><sentence id="865">There was such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="866">It was called in Polish halumintzfau (ph). </sentence><sentence id="867">She could bring the work home. </sentence><sentence id="868">She was tearing all kinds of rags apart, making strips, braiding the strips and fashioning rugs. </sentence><sentence id="869">What they needed that for, I have no idea, but that's what she was doing and every day she had to make a certain amount and deliver it the same day. </sentence><sentence id="870">So that was the work we were doing there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="889">Q: Did you have any sense that women were treated differently than men in terms of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="899">Q: But you didn't feel different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="901">A: No, no I did not. </sentence><sentence id="902">As far as deportations and treatment like that, we were all treated equal. </sentence><sentence id="903">That's the way I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="907">Q: In the factories or the "resorts," were you ever aware of efforts to kind of sabotage the production of hunger strikes or anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="919">Q: Do you remember what you talked about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="921">A: Always trying -- first of all we were trying to put food on the table. </sentence><sentence id="922">Then you tried to keep clean, which was a hard thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="923">Washing clothes was a task within itself, because we had no water. </sentence><sentence id="924">You had to walk like almost a half a mile with a pail to get water. </sentence><sentence id="925">Then you had this board that you rubbed on and you boiled the clothes on top of the stove if you possibly could. </sentence><sentence id="926">That was another chore which required a lot of time. </sentence><sentence id="927">But sometimes before the curfew set in, we had some neighbors that were from our home town that used to come over and just sort of talk things over. </sentence><sentence id="928">My father was always the one very optimistic, thinking that this will end soon and that he hoped to be alive when this happened. </sentence><sentence id="929">But it didn't happen that way. </sentence><sentence id="930">He didn't live to see that. </sentence><sentence id="931">Slowly though, he did repair work at home. </sentence><sentence id="932">Somehow he got some instruments. </sentence><sentence id="933">He was repairing watches in the house. </sentence><sentence id="934">People in the ghetto, believe it not, some of them could afford to do that. </sentence><sentence id="935">Sometimes they paid and money was helpful because every place no matter how much you starve there is always a little market where you could buy for higher prices something to help yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: Even in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="953">A: Even in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="954">One day one of the Jewish policemen, the ghetto policemen and said to my father he's being summoned to Gestapo headquarters on Bolitzkerenik (ph), and we thought what did my father do? </sentence><sentence id="955">He will never come back alive, you know. </sentence><sentence id="956">But you see, before they took all the -- took us out of Ozerkoff Ghetto, we all had to register that you were a tradesman or whatever, they looked through this list and summoned my father to do some work for them. </sentence><sentence id="957">When he came back it was like a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="958">He came back with work, watches to repair and all that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="959">And they walked him back, the Jewish police, back there  3 when he was done with his work to return the work. </sentence><sentence id="960">And would you believe that now and then some of them would give him some food for the work, even those Gestapo people? </sentence><sentence id="961">It was amazing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="971">Q: What kind of food did they give you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="973">A: Bread. </sentence><sentence id="974">Bread was the staple. </sentence><sentence id="975">Bread was something we craved. </sentence><sentence id="976">Bread was something that I dreamed of. </sentence><sentence id="977">We always said someday -- in the camps where I was, we always used to say we didn't dream about eating cake or meat or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="978">We used to say if ever the time comes all I want is a loaf of bread and eat enough that I feel my stomach is full. </sentence><sentence id="979">This is what we want, just a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="980">So, bread was very important, to the point we were starving so much that sometimes when a person died in a family in the ghetto, they did not report him for a couple days so that they could pick up the bread ration and help themselves for a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="981">So, you can imagine how desperate you were and how hungry you were to go to such measures to get some food. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="982"> Os Was that it? </sentence><sentence id="983">Did you eat anything else? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="984">A: They gave us potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="985">Certain other stuff, whatever was available. </sentence><sentence id="986">Sometimes they gave us canned food, canned meat, but that was called, you had to be at work every day. </sentence><sentence id="987">They made a day when if you were at work that day, they picked at random a day and if you were there, it was called in German the schteichtag (ph). </sentence><sentence id="988">If you happened to be working that day, you could get a portion of that conserved meat, and it was mostly horse meat anyway. </sentence><sentence id="989">That was the treat of a lifetime, I'm telling you. </sentence><sentence id="990">They gave us vegetables, a lot of carrots. </sentence><sentence id="991">And those white carrots, you know, those long big, I don't know what they were called here, but we called them white carrots. </sentence><sentence id="992">They had the shape of a carrot and we ate a lot of that. </sentence><sentence id="993">So, all different kind of staples that they felt weren't really -- beyond their dignity to eat, you know, they just brought into the ghetto and we got a certain amount of everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1304">This is what is going to be left of you." </sentence><sentence id="1305">So you can imagine how we felt, but still somehow, it didn't penetrate. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We didn't really and truly realize in what kind of a situation we were. </sentence><sentence id="1307">We were numb. </sentence><sentence id="1308">Dehumanized there already at this point. </sentence><sentence id="1309">So, we just sat there. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Somehow it didn't happen that way. </sentence><sentence id="1311">In the morning, they lined us up and marched into a barrack. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1439">Q: All from Lodz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1441">A: Yes, from the ghetto, we were all women out of the Lodz Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Naturally some of them were not natives of Lodz City, like I, from all different little places, and even some of them from different parts, from different countries, that happened to be deported into the Lodz Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1443">We had one woman we called "the Francisca." </sentence><sentence id="1444">She was originally French and was deported there and she used to swear in French something terrible, and she was mad after a while, but the others were mainly from Poland and the same place. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So many women assigned to one bunk, just plain, bare bunks and another one of those prisoners ruling the barrack, and she was -- her title was the Blockova (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1446">A barrack was called a block and she was the Blockova. </sentence><sentence id="1447">She ruled this place like a queen. </sentence><sentence id="1448">You had to do everything according to what she told you. </sentence><sentence id="1449">You could not on your own go and relieve yourself if you had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Only when she told you it was time. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Some people could not control themselves, and she used to beat with that cane people half dead almost. </sentence><sentence id="1452">With the rest of the barracks, every morning when it was still dark out there, we were lined up and counted. </sentence><sentence id="1453">The German tzail-a-pelle (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1454">You could stand there for hours if they thought the count wasn't right. </sentence><sentence id="1455">It could rain, it could storm, and we had to stand there and be counted and be sure we were all there. </sentence><sentence id="1456">At noon, we were lined up again, always lined up. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Five women were handed a bowl, some soup in that bowl. </sentence><sentence id="1458">We did not get any spoons so we had to count swallows and be sure we didn't take too many swallows to it would be enough for all the five of us. </sentence><sentence id="1459">That was the thing. </sentence><sentence id="1460">We were there for several days, I really don't know exactly how many, but let me tell you, every day was like eternity, it was never thinking that we would ever get out of there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1481">Q: You didn't work there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1483"> Ag No. </sentence><sentence id="1484">I don't know if it's true, but after the war, the assumption was that the end of 1944 they were bringing in people for extermination at such rate that the gas chambers could not accommodate them. </sentence><sentence id="1485">You see, we were marked strictly for extermination because we did not get any tattoos anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1486">That was the thing. </sentence><sentence id="1487">So, people were just sitting piled up waiting their turn and this is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1488">We were just sitting in these barracks like waiting out turn to be exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="1489">And somehow one morning at the tzail-a-pelle they took this whole group of 500 women from this block, drove us into a shower, gave us some mote clothes, some wooden shoes, underwear different dress, a little portion of bread and again into a cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="1490">There were less of us in each train, we had more room, a pail for our needs. </sentence><sentence id="1491">The train started moving again. </sentence><sentence id="1492">A couple stations I remember they stopped opened up this door and the S.S. man that guarded us told us we could empty that pail, so we figured that's better treatment than what we had before. </sentence><sentence id="1493">We traveled several hours and final destination we ended up in the city of Hamburg, but our camp where we dwelled was outside of the city in a place called Tzazel (ph) and the station where we traveled into the city for work was called  0 Popinville (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1494">The camp was Tzazel. </sentence><sentence id="1495">It was a sub camp of Noyagomen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1496">There we were assigned to barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1497">The barracks were much smaller and every morning of course we lined up again for tzail-a-pelle. </sentence><sentence id="1498">After that, we were released back and took turns going to pick up the ration of bread for the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="1499">I remember we were in a teal -- I and my sister found ourselves in a real small barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1500">There were about 15 women only there, which was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1501">It was unusual, so we took turns. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Every day another woman went out and brought the bread which we divided by some miracle we found a string. </sentence><sentence id="1503">We had to see that it was the same so we made a measure out of that string and cut the bread accordingly so each one had the same amount. </sentence><sentence id="1504">Coffee, they gave us something warm to drink, the so-called coffee. </sentence><sentence id="1505">It was slop, but we didn't have any other utensil except the pail that we used during the night for our needs because there was a curfew after a certain time in the camp and we could not even go to the latrine. </sentence><sentence id="1506">So, whoever's turn it was to go get the provision, emptied the pail, swished it out with cold water and this is where we brought the coffee. </sentence><sentence id="1507">And this is what we did drink from. </sentence><sentence id="1508">You can imagine how dehumanized we were. </sentence><sentence id="1509">It didn't matter where this stuff came from, as long as you could keep warm, as long as you could fill your stomach. </sentence><sentence id="1510">That's what it mattered. </sentence><sentence id="1511">The conditions were a little better in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1512">On the weekend, on Sundays we could wash our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1513">Naturally we had nothing else, so we walked around in our coats, the so-called coats they gave us, our underwear and dress were washed and hung out of in winter by that little stove that we

trying to hide before this disaster. </sentence><sentence id="1525">We looked at one another and we were laughing because this did not represent this big superman race. </sentence><sentence
