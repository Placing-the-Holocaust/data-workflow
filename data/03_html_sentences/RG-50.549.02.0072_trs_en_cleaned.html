<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="13">This is tape number one, side A. I'd -- in order to begin, I'd like to ask you if -- if you, in the last 14 years since the interview that I saw took place, is there anything about your experience during the war that you've learned since then, that you'd like to go back and talk about it? </sentence><sentence id="14">Know -- how much you remember, exactly, about your interview, but I'm assuming that you -- it was clear to me that you've been doing research, and finding out more and more about what happened to you, since you were so young. </sentence><sentence id="15">Is there anything that you might want to add to what you already did? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: Let me get to that in one moment, but let me also make a -- not a disclaimer, but a commercial statement in a sense -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Okay. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="18"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 ; </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: -- in that I just want to acknowledge the importance, and I want to say thank you to the museum for doing this, because I have believed for some time that the archiving of this information is extremely important. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I've said publicly, privately, that even though every interviewee's information, including mine, may not be earth-shaking, or startling, the fact that it's archived, and the technology is available to do it, is terribly important. </sentence><sentence id="21">How interesting it would be if I go to the -- whatever museum, take out a tape of a Civil War soldier, talking from the Civil War, not a mere reenactment, and we could learn so much. </sentence><sentence id="22">So I just want to acknowledge, and extend my appreciation for whoever sponsors this, and for the museum for doing it. </sentence><sentence id="23">I do understand now this has been now going on for maybe 10 years, these second interviews. </sentence><sentence id="24">I really thought it was a brand new idea. </sentence><sentence id="25">But I'm delighted to do it. </sentence><sentence id="26">Let me get to the question that you asked. </sentence><sentence id="27">I don't know if P've learned anything specific. </sentence><sentence id="28">Much of what I know about the Holocaust, I know from -- from memory, and I've said before now, and I'll repeat -- Ill try not to repeat myself too frequently, to say that I was old enough to remember, because my memory apparently works well, and much too young to understand. </sentence><sentence id="29">Which makes yo -- me a survivor whose emotional scars are quite different than people my age, and two, three, four years older, who in fact understood. </sentence><sentence id="30">I thought I was being a little pint sized hero for wearing a yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="31">I didn't think it was a stigma. </sentence><sentence id="32">I couldn't understand the concept of stigma. </sentence><sentence id="33">I mean, I too have, like an adult, that's a good thing. </sentence><sentence id="34">All six year olds want to be like big people. </sentence><sentence id="35">So it isn't so much that I've learned a lot, although I'm sure I've learned certain things about myself, my father, my mother, and others, what I've done the last 14 years different   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 4 than before, and it's not because of the interview, was I be -- have become very much more involved in Holocaust kinds of things, in order to make use of the survivors, because we are a dying population, and I can identify for you -- and again, I don't think I did before, that the night that Steven Spielberg -- that's a matter of just a coincidence, received the Academy Award for Schindler, he said that there are, at that time, as I think he said, 350,000 survivors, I guess, in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="36">And I was flabbergasted because in relative terms, it's a very small number. </sentence><sentence id="37">I mean, 350,000 people, and that's a dozen years ago, whenever that was. </sentence><sentence id="38">So there are less today. </sentence><sentence id="39">And I said maybe I need to, in some way be involved, because I'm one of the younger survivors you'll meet -- I'm only 67 years old, do something to archive, to use, to teach, because if we don't, this is an -- this is an irreplaceable commodity. </sentence><sentence id="40">If we don't do what we need to do, after we're gone, it can be done, but differently. </sentence><sentence id="41">A second generation experience is different than the initial experience that those of us who were there, in all the places, can tell. </sentence><sentence id="42">So I've become involved in a number of things, but I think that's the major change, since that time. </sentence><sentence id="43">Not so much what I've learned, but what I've done with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="71">Do you want to talk about some of things you've done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Well, I have probably spoken in a -- in a gazillion places. </sentence><sentence id="75">I've been involved locally with the Jewish [indecipherable] Council, which sponsors an annual Yom HaShoah commemoration that's six, seven, 800 people, attendance thing, and all the largest synagogues in the community, I've chaired it for the last five years. </sentence><sentence id="76">And I did -- I've been a member of that commission for 15 or 18 years, but I thought maybe I'd like to    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 deg become more involved. </sentence><sentence id="77">And that involves with some other elements of the Holocaust thing. </sentence><sentence id="78">Serve the museum, museum visits, museum volunteering, some other things. </sentence><sentence id="79">I have some connection with the legislature, as a consequence I've tried to help the council, and the museum be involved with legislators to come to the museum, or to meet them there, or to speak with them there. </sentence><sentence id="80">These are things I've done, I've -- anecdotally, one of the things I've done is our organizations that have silent auctions, I've been a silent auction museum tour giver in any number of organizations. </sentence><sentence id="81">If you bid on my particular offer, and it's a winning offer, whatever the organization decides, I will in fact take a half a day, and take you and four other people to the museum, and the most interesting group I had once, was a -- a woman, I forget what her organization was, she called, and we arranged, and there were four women, and I, all veterinarians. </sentence><sentence id="82">I don't think they were Jewish, but they were involved in some organization, and they wanted to see the museum, and I was there with four veterinarians. </sentence><sentence id="83">I had never been with that many veterinarians in my life, women or otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="84">Just an interesting combination of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: [ve done that, I have probably been involved in the -- in a -- to a greater degree in the three organizations that are Holocaust organizations in the community. </sentence><sentence id="100">There is the Washington fre -- th-the survivors and friends organization, with which you may be familiar. </sentence><sentence id="101">There is a child survivors organization, which covers more Baltimore/ Washington, and there's a second generation. </sentence><sentence id="102">And now there is a third generation USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 deg organization, and I have gotten to know some of the people, I've been involved in some of the meetings, some of the planning, some of the conferences. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="109">That's quite a lot, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="110">And do you talk with the schoolchildren? </sentence><sentence id="111">Have you done any of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Well, for example, recently there was a cooperative program within the council and Comcast, and the [indecipherable] Olney theater, here in Olney. </sentence><sentence id="117">And several high school classes were brought -- several high schools, and they [indecipherable] 11" grade class, were brought together for a -- an orientation, a talk, a -- a video, and after that they even did projects expressing the Holocaust in art, music and design. </sentence><sentence id="118">And we spoke to those four schools. </sentence><sentence id="119">The next year, there were four other schools. </sentence><sentence id="120">These have been things that I've done. </sentence><sentence id="121">There was a training program, for example, for the Jewish Social Service Agency, JESSA, and five years ago, I think it was, when we spent four days, one day a week in four weeks, in a very comprehensive training program for their staff, including a visit to the museum, which I, as a volunteer put together for them, with a director of the agency, and it was a pretty successful thing involving all of their people, on the assumption that if they deal with Holocaust survivors, they ou-ought to know something about the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: Is it possible for you to summarize what -- how people react to your presentations when you meet with them? </sentence><sentence id="129">People who may not know a lot about the Holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="130">I'm talking about groups aside from survivor groups. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: React in what way? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="135"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 y </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: How do they react? </sentence><sentence id="137">I mean, what do they want to know, what -- what do they not know? </sentence><sentence id="138">What does it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Well -- there are probably at least two major kinds of presentation, and I do one because I'm unable, or whatever to do the other. </sentence><sentence id="140">The -- those presentations which are based in the emotional experience, but as I said to you, my emotional experience at the time was very limited, I didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="141">So what I do is I do a much more -- not objective, but I guess it's an objective approach to describing what happened, from the eyes of a six, seven, eight, nine, 10 year old kid. </sentence><sentence id="142">The reaction to that often is amazement, to the point, and this is again anecdotal, but I spoke to whatever, the fifth grade Hebrew school class of my synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="143">And the fifth grade Hebrew school class, one of them, included my grandson at the time. </sentence><sentence id="144">And he asked a question at the end. </sentence><sentence id="145">And he became so kind of involved in the description, he said, "Did you survive?" </sentence><sentence id="146">I'm his grandfather, I mean, he was like trying to ask, how did people survive, so he said to me, "Did you survive?" </sentence><sentence id="147">He's forgotten, I mean, this could have been a movie that I was describing. </sentence><sentence id="148">So the reaction tends to be less visceral in some sense, and more factual, because I tend to present factually, rather than emotionally, for many reasons, including the kind of person I am, and the nature of my experience, of people that I know in the community who are one, two, three, four, five years older than I, whose experience was different as a consequence, they present differently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="160">That's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="161">Let's g -- let's go back to your chronology, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="162">It was 1949 when you came to this country with your mother and father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="167"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 5 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Mm, well, my father came in 1948. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Oh, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: My father -- we were all in, at that time, Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="173">Israel happened a few months after my father left. </sentence><sentence id="174">My father came to this country for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="175">One stated, and one kind of unstated. </sentence><sentence id="176">The stated reason was, of the seven children, six siblings and my father, two had died in 1930 of causes other than Holocaust, two women, one married, one unmarried. </sentence><sentence id="177">Two brothers were killed during the war. </sentence><sentence id="178">One brother was in Israel, my father, and the seventh child, the oldest, was in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="179">My aunt had come here in 1914, in some ways to be with some cousins, to reduce the burden, which was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="180">My grandparents -- my grandfather, I am told -- I never met him, he died before I was born, again for non-Holocaust related reasons, he died 1930. </sentence><sentence id="181">He was not a successful businessman, and they had some very difficult times. </sentence><sentence id="182">He became a -- kind of a county clerk of some sort, because he could read and write, and he knew Hungarian well, besides Yiddish and Jewish things, and it was difficult to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="183">So my aunt came out here. </sentence><sentence id="184">My father wanted to see his surviving sister, whom he had not seen since 1914 when he was eight -- no, he was 10, and she was 14 or 15, or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="185">The other reason was that my father, being a professional cantor all his life, trained as a cantor, not just something he did part time, found that it was very difficult to make a living, because that's one of the things Israel did not need too many of at the time. </sentence><sentence id="186">And he chose to -- he found a way to legally stay, he did, and then in 49, my mother and I came. </sentence><sentence id="187">Now we're in New York. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="188"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 . </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="190">What do you remember getting off -- you were at Idlewild Airport. </sentence><sentence id="191">What do you remember when you came in, and what were your expectations of the U.S.? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: [had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="193">I honestly had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="194">Remember that being of that age, and at that time, the number of movies that people saw -- I mean, movies were a -- a treat number one, and they were infrequent. </sentence><sentence id="195">And when I lived in Israel, went to the movie, and I can tell you the names of the movie theaters. </sentence><sentence id="196">But they were movies from various places, and I didn't -- I didn't have an understanding of what the size of this country, the dimensions of this country, the opportunities of this country were, and I'm not sure that's something that a ni -- nine year old would -- well, by that time I'm 13, but even a 13 year old wouldn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="197">My orientation was much more in terms of European recollections of things, and certainly this country did not appear to be the same way. </sentence><sentence id="198">I was fascinating by -- first I came by plane. </sentence><sentence id="199">Now, I got on the plane in a -- what had been a military airport outside of Haifa, two engine plane, flew to -- for refueling in Egypt, for refueling in Tunis, from Tunis to Nice, from Nice to Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="200">Spent overnight in Brussels, and from Brussels took the big bird to Shannon, to Gander, in Newfoundland, and then to New York. </sentence><sentence id="201">That was the typical way, but it was by plane. </sentence><sentence id="202">My father had come the year before, it took him three weeks, I think, by boat. </sentence><sentence id="203">But it was just a question of how people traveled. </sentence><sentence id="204">So you arrive at this place, and I remember waking up in the morning after an overnight flight, and my first inclination was, as I looked out the window, was to get out and walk, because the clouds looked like sheep. </sentence><sentence id="205">They looked s -- as solid as rocks. </sentence><sentence id="206">Now I knew that that's not a good idea, and I didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="207">But it was uneventful flight of -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 "0 probably the hop from Shannon to Gander must have been 10 hours. </sentence><sentence id="208">And then from Gander down, another six. </sentence><sentence id="209">We traveled probably 30 hours all together. </sentence><sentence id="210">But we arrived in New York. </sentence><sentence id="211">Now, you have to remember that Idlewild, which we now know as JFK didn't look the same. </sentence><sentence id="212">It was kind of a little airport, because international flights had not been too common, one because the war had just ended, and two, that was not the kind of aircraft, the jets hadn't come in, not for another 10 years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: And the prop-driven four engine planes had to make hop, to hop, to hop, to hop. </sentence><sentence id="238">It was still quicker than ship, but -- so we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="239">Now, at the airport, my father and my aunt, his sister, were waiting for us, and in a matter of minutes, it seemed, we were kind of hustled by taxi -- that was not unusual, taxis I knew, to Pennsylvania station, in the city, on a train, to Philadelphia, where we spent some time kind of getting acquainted. </sentence><sentence id="240">And I remember seeing a sign on the bridge between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, in Trenton, which I couldn't read then, but I had taken that train ride subsequently many, many times, and it says Trenton makes, the world takes. </sentence><sentence id="241">Took me years to figure out what that meant. </sentence><sentence id="242">But it was one of the initial things. </sentence><sentence id="243">In those days when you went by train, or you went by subway, you had these various dispensing machines, much less sophisticated than what we have now. </sentence><sentence id="244">I was absolutely fascinated by the gum machine, where you could put ina nickel or whatever, couple pennies, and get Chiclets. </sentence><sentence id="245">And I wanted to kind of do it all the time. </sentence><sentence id="246">I was fascinated by Venetian blinds. </sentence><sentence id="247">I was fascinated -- certainly by television set, which my aunt had, as I remember, but we didn't for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="248">Now, radios were not  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 u unusual, radios were common. </sentence><sentence id="249">Cars were not unusual, although the number were common. </sentence><sentence id="250">So that the impressions you had -- what I had is twofold, what I'll leave you with. </sentence><sentence id="251">One, the impressions of a 13 year old in a new place. </sentence><sentence id="252">And the impressions of a 13 year old in a new place called the United States. </sentence><sentence id="253">I knew very little about the States yet, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="254">I didn't begin to know about until we moved back to New York, after about two weeks of staying here, and my parents took a sublet apartment, and I began to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="255">And I's -- we spent a year and a half in New York, I was in school for about a year. </sentence><sentence id="256">I came here in what would be equivalent to seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="257">So I finished seven B in New York, in those days with A's and B's. </sentence><sentence id="258">Did eight A in New York, same school. </sentence><sentence id="259">I can tell you about that, too, because it had impact, a significant impact. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then we moved to Philadelphia where my father lived the rest of his life. </sentence><sentence id="261">My mother died in Philadelphia, and I was in Philadelphia until 1961, till I finished graduate school, and then my wife and I, and daughter at the time, left town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Tell me about going to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Well, the point of school was that -- people think this is just words, but schools are the Mixmasters of society, particularly in a place like New York. </sentence><sentence id="292">Now, my father found a sublet apartment in the village. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Manhattan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="298">Remember, my father's congregation was on the east side of Rivington Street, had to be walking distance. </sentence><sentence id="299">Even though he performed in that congregation only once a month, it's that kind of job. </sentence><sentence id="300">Still had to be walking distance. </sentence><sentence id="301">During -- on other Sabbaths,  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 0% we went to some local synagogue, a small one, whatever, in the neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="302">But we are on -- on the village in the west side. </sentence><sentence id="303">We are in the heart of the famous part of the village, Bleeker Street, McDougall Street, and we were on Barrow Street, 72 Barrow. </sentence><sentence id="304">An apartment building where people were away, and we sublet their apartment. </sentence><sentence id="305">School became an important thing, obviously, and my father made some inquiries, I suppose, he was not familiar, for me to go to one of the Jewish-type day schools. </sentence><sentence id="306">And there were many of them in the general community, subway rides. </sentence><sentence id="307">And I remember going to them, and I remember that one of them, I forget the name, insignificant, said, "We will be glad to have the young man," -- I mean, I was fluent in Hebrew -- "we'll put him in third grade." " </sentence><sentence id="308">Why?" " </sentence><sentence id="309">Well, he doesn't speak English." </sentence><sentence id="310">Which is true. </sentence><sentence id="311">I had some knowledge of English, but very spotty, and very unreliable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: And either of your parents speak English? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Well, my father had been here for a year, and he spoke some. </sentence><sentence id="332">Again, street English, learned. </sentence><sentence id="333">My mother didn't, she knew less that I did. </sentence><sentence id="334">My mother, by that time, spoke Hungarian, Serb, passable German. </sentence><sentence id="335">Not passable, but somewhat street French from school. </sentence><sentence id="336">But she had studied knowing that sh -- English was not taught in Europe when they were in school. </sentence><sentence id="337">I knew very little. </sentence><sentence id="338">1 mean, Trenton makes, the world takes, I could not read, then. </sentence><sentence id="339">I was 13, I was not, you know, an infant. </sentence><sentence id="340">But there was something about the notion of third grade that didn't make any sense for many reasons, not only the fact that I'd lose four years, I could probably make them up, but a 13 year old is not going to have anything in common with a nine year old, or a 10 year old. </sentence><sentence id="341">There's a difference, I  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 8 mean, raging puberty was probably taking place, and all those other things that happen in early teens were taking place, and that did not put me into any kind of a connection with the younger kids. </sentence><sentence id="342">So my parents, somehow, and I don't recall -- I don't -- I can't remember how they discovered that the public school happened to be exactly a block from the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="343">P.S. number three, on Hudson Street. </sentence><sentence id="344">The principal was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="345">I'm not sure that's terribly significant, but there may have been some -- I had with me a letter from Haifa, saying that I had completed so much of seventh grade, but the curriculums are different. </sentence><sentence id="346">The principal said the following, he said, "We'll put him in seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="347">We'll give him an allowance, he will not have to take classes in Spanish." </sentence><sentence id="348">Which was already being taught. " </sentence><sentence id="349">If he makes it, he'1l go to eighth grade, and if he doesn't, he" ll repeat seventh grade, it's pretty simple." </sentence><sentence id="350">Which made an awful lot of sense. </sentence><sentence id="351">And obviously I was able to pick up enough to begin to go on, and kids, first of all, are spongelike, and you pick up. </sentence><sentence id="352">And one of the differences between me and people who are three or four years older, who came here maybe after high school, or at the end of high school, you have different language pattern, you have a different knowledge of English, and people after 50 years, still speak like they got off the boat. </sentence><sentence id="353">I never did a thing in my life to try to deal with the way I spoke, but I tried to learn the language as well as I could, so I have command of it. </sentence><sentence id="354">In P.S. number three, I could do that. </sentence><sentence id="355">And that had significant impact in that I continued, at least age appropriately, as opposed to continuing in a way that was, you know, kind of as a sore thumb sticking out, a kid two feet taller than everybody else in the class, cause I was 13. </sentence><sentence id="356">So that had very significant impact. </sentence><sentence id="357">Then I   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 "4 continued through public school in Philadelphia, and that's -- we'll get to that at some point if you wish, but that had an important element. </sentence><sentence id="358">My father then decided that although he could have stayed at that congregation in New York, I guess indefinitely -- well not indefinitely, but certainly for awhile, cause community had begun to change in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="359">He thought that he would like to live in a community, so his wife and son could have a life in a community, and New York is not a community in that sense, not when you're there once a month, and you have nothing else to do. </sentence><sentence id="360">We moved to Philadelphia in 1950, and I spent the next 11 years in Philadelphia with my parents, and well, eventually with my wife. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: What was it like for you to be in school there, not speaking English at first, and -- did you feel like an outsider, did they -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="394">A: No, because the kid next to me was from China, and the kid next to him was from Italy, and the kid next to him was from some Spanish speaking -- and I remember vaguely these two kids, the Italian and the -- I don't even know if it was a Chinese youngster, but he's certainly an Oriental kid, he could have been Korean, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="396">But he came -- he wasn't in school one day. </sentence><sentence id="397">Next day he comes in, and I say to him, "Where were you yesterday?" </sentence><sentence id="398">He says, "I played hooky."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="667">Q: How so? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: Because it had been there for 50 years, and it had a tradition that people came back to it even after they moved away. </sentence><sentence id="670">It was not one of the most prestigious, or one of the wealthiest synagogues, cause it was not in the wealthy part of town. </sentence><sentence id="671">Interestingly, it did not choose to rebuild in the suburbs. </sentence><sentence id="672">When it came time for the synagogue to essentially die, it was sold, and it's holdings were transferred to another synagogue, so there was no </sentence></p><p><sentence id="673">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 -4 second generation of that synagogue anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="674">It was built in "24, I think, 1924. </sentence><sentence id="675">And in 1970-something, 50 years later, it just out -- ran out of it's usefulness in that community, and it's holdings were transferred to another synagogue in the city, not in the suburbs, actually. </sentence><sentence id="676">Philadelphia's a very large, physical, geographic place. </sentence><sentence id="677">But it ceased to exist as a synagogue, but for the years my father was there, 35 years, it was. </sentence><sentence id="678">So that was very much so -- one of my limitations was that being from a observant family, there were many things I didn't do. </sentence><sentence id="679">I didn't go to the restaurants -- as little as people did, but I didn't go to the hotdog stands, and I didn't do this, and I didn't do that, and I wasn't available Friday night, and Saturday morning | didn't go to the ballgame. </sentence><sentence id="680">There were things that I did not do, because they did, and I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="681">Eventually that changed to some degree, but there was always a little bit of an overtone, not a stigma -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="682">Q: Did you chafe against that in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: Chafe, no, resent to some small degree, or found some restriction, yes. </sentence><sentence id="684">But then again, one of my f -- good friends lived across the street, was six foot three at the time. </sentence><sentence id="685">He chafed against being so tall, because that was unusual. </sentence><sentence id="686">The center of the basketball team was six the -- three, and today six foot three is a midget. </sentence><sentence id="687">So the question is how one chafes against things. </sentence><sentence id="688">I wouldn't say I chafed against it, I think that I recognize it, and most of my buddies recognize it as well, and say, "Well, where are you going to be Friday? </sentence><sentence id="689">Oh, I -- I know you, Friday you have to be in synagogue, right?"
