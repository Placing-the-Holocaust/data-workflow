<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would it be Polish literature or other literature in translation or Jewish books in translation or what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Well, you could get everything you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="6">I read mostly Polish translations of French, German, Russian and American literature, as well as some Polish and Yiddish works in the original. </sentence><sentence id="7">In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, my older brother, Moshe, was mobilized. </sentence><sentence id="8">Since he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939, he was subject to the general mobilization. </sentence><sentence id="9">He reported to his regiment and was lucky that he didn't become a POW. </sentence><sentence id="10">He was able to escape capture as a POW and return home six weeks after he left. </sentence><sentence id="11">Of course, we didn't know what had happened to him throughout this period. </sentence><sentence id="12">Subsequently, he had become a very active member in the underground Hashomer Hatzair movement in Radom, and our home became the contact place for couriers from Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="13">Polish ladies, as well as members of the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in Warsaw, came. </sentence><sentence id="14">Mordecai Anielewicz, the leader of the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto, who perished in 1943, was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="15">He stayed in a furnished room establishment in our courtyard during a mission to Radom, having traveled on Polish papers from Warsaw via Lodz and Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="16">He didn't look Jewish and had no trouble traveling on Polish papers. </sentence><sentence id="17">While in Auschwitz, I didn't know who was in the leadership of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. </sentence><sentence id="18">Even those rounded up from the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, who came to Auschwitz-Birkenau via Majdanek in the early summer of 1943, had no idea of who was in the leadership. </sentence><sentence id="19">It was only after the war when I came across a monograph about the uprising, and recognized Anielewicz from the picture on the front page, that I found out about his role. </sentence><sentence id="20">There were other people from Warsaw who came to our house who were involved in the first armed action in the Warsaw Ghetto in January 1943, Josef Kaplan among them. </sentence><sentence id="21">My brother, Moshe was taken in the early morning hours of the 28" of April 1942 and executed. </sentence><sentence id="22">I was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="23">My entire family was put under house arrest and I had to surrender. </sentence><sentence id="24">By the delayed action of this process, I escaped a bullet in the neck. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was taken to headquarters of the security service and put into a large shed that was full of Jews from our ghetto who had been there since the early morning hours. </sentence><sentence id="26">We were shipped out the next morning, April 29, 1942, and arrived in Auschwitz past midnight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: What went on between "39 and "42? </sentence><sentence id="50">What were you doing? </sentence><sentence id="51">Were you still working or ---? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="56">I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="57">Every able-bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to 60, had to work at least one day on assigned places of work that the Jewish community, and later on the ghetto community government, administered. </sentence><sentence id="58">They had to send out forced laborers so to speak, to various posts that the Germans had designated; military posts, and a variety of other assignments,, doing all sorts of 3  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection work -- unloading, loading, digging ditches, you name it. </sentence><sentence id="59">There was hardly any kind of work that we weren't assigned to do. </sentence><sentence id="60">Being the youngest, I took the place of my father as well as of my older brother, so I would end up working almost two or three days a week. </sentence><sentence id="61">I didn't mind, I'd rather do it than have my father, who was in his mid-to-late fifties and ill, do hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="62">My oldest brother had to help my father so I took his place as well. </sentence><sentence id="63">In 1940, that is August of 1940, almost all able-bodied young Jewish males received orders to report for shipment to forced labor camps on the German-Soviet border in the district of Lublin to dig anti-tank fortifications. </sentence><sentence id="64">I was the only one in the family who was caught in the net. </sentence><sentence id="65">It turned out that if you didn't report, you simply didn't go; they didn't come after you. </sentence><sentence id="66">But if you did report, you were trapped. </sentence><sentence id="67">Several hundred of us left Radom, perhaps four or five hundred men. </sentence><sentence id="68">Altogether there were thousands of young Jewish men from various parts of the country congregated in several forced labor camps stretched along a section of frontier land that ran between two rivers, the Bug and the San. </sentence><sentence id="69">Our camp was in Cieszanow, where we dug anti-tank fortifications along a given section of frontier. </sentence><sentence id="70">That was my introduction to forced labor under SS rule. </sentence><sentence id="71">We left dead inmates at the work site every day. </sentence><sentence id="72">They were simply shot at random and buried in the woods and covered up with moss, so that one couldn't even find their graves, for there were no markers left. </sentence><sentence id="73">This went on until about the end of October when suddenly we were marched out of Cieszanow and taken to Belzec, from where, by rail, we were transported to Krasnik, in the District of Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="74">We spent the whole night in a courtyard where the Jewish community's council was located. </sentence><sentence id="75">I will never forget the kindness of the town's Jewish people who practically showered us with food and drink. </sentence><sentence id="76">In the afternoon we were marched out, under guard, to the town of Annapol and handed over to a German private firm to build highways. </sentence><sentence id="77">We were not under any military supervision, but just worked as civilians. </sentence><sentence id="78">We discovered soon that if you go away and don't come back, you're not missed, Several of us decided to start on our way home the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="79">We sold whatever clothes we could spare in order to get a few zlotys for food and passage money for the trip. </sentence><sentence id="80">We marched 16 kilometers that morning and crossed a guarded bridge that spanned the Vistula River, and within two hours were in the next town. </sentence><sentence id="81">We spent the rest of that day going from small town to town, riding in horse-drawn carts belonging to Jews engaged in either transporting people or goods. </sentence><sentence id="82">After darkness, we found ourselves as "passengers" on such a cart, sharing the space with a load of grain that the owner smuggled into the city of Radom, traveling through forests all night. </sentence><sentence id="83">Not only were we in violation of the after-darkness curfew, but also sitting on "contraband". </sentence><sentence id="84">Had we been stopped, it would have meant the end of us all. </sentence><sentence id="85">We arrived in Radom the next morning after an absence of two and a half months. </sentence><sentence id="86">That was my introduction to camp life, and in a way it helped me later on. </sentence><sentence id="87">When I arrived at Auschwitz, unlike many others, I was not totally surprised by what awaited us, even although the level of raw brutality in Auschwitz-Birkenau was uniquely evil. </sentence><sentence id="88">In retrospect, from what I have learned in the past century, I can state without hesitation, that in the entire universe of evil that was Nazi-occupied Europe, there was no place that could match the hell of Birkenau in it's first year of existence. </sentence><sentence id="89">We walked the three kilometers from Auschwitz to Birkenau on 4  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection May 1, 1942, and there were one thousand young and middle- aged men in our transport. </sentence><sentence id="90">Within one month most of them were dead. </sentence><sentence id="91">By the end of about two months, most of those still alive were the ones who survived the camp -- there were fifteen of us. </sentence><sentence id="92">Allow me to track back a bit in time -- I have a reason for doing so. </sentence><sentence id="93">In early 1942 I came down with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="94">There were many typhus cases in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="95">Normally typhus is survivable by young, healthy people, even without any medical help as long as there is water to drink, because one can't eat anyway in a state of very high fever. </sentence><sentence id="96">I had developed some complications and hemorrhaged all night. </sentence><sentence id="97">We lived in the ghetto under strict curfew conditions and had no access to doctors or drugstores. </sentence><sentence id="98">My brother risked his life to go outside the ghetto to an apothecary in order to get some medication, which turned out to be the wrong one, and it nearly poisoned me. </sentence><sentence id="99">The doctor who attended me was sick and he didn't know the seriousness of the problem. </sentence><sentence id="100">My brother, together with one of our neighbors, searched for a doctor half the night until they found one. </sentence><sentence id="101">He realized that I was in a bad way for it was the third or fourth case in town that winter of typhus with such complications, and no one survived the hemorrhaging. </sentence><sentence id="102">He plainly said, "There's nothing I can do, if you have some cognac, give it to him." </sentence><sentence id="103">He thought I was out of it, but I was still conscious and I remember the stupidity of his suggestion. </sentence><sentence id="104">This was a ghetto in Poland in 1942 and he expected us to have, or be able to get, cognac in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="105">In the morning my doctor came and ordered a transfusion but there was no way to find a donor who had my blood type. </sentence><sentence id="106">I was supposed to be taken to the hospital for the procedure, but luckily someone decided that I couldn't possibly survive the trip, since it was a very cold winter day, and my blood pressure was extremely low. </sentence><sentence id="107">Instead, the ghetto hospital sent a surgeon, accompanied by a laboratory technician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several volunteers, including my brother Moshe. </sentence><sentence id="108">I remember the technician telling the surgeon that none of the blood tested matched mine. </sentence><sentence id="109">Nevertheless the surgeon decided to use my brother's blood for there was no time to lose and he told my parents that the risk must be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="110">Transfusions were given directly from donor to recipient via some tube contraption connecting their veins. </sentence><sentence id="111">My parents were standing over my bed knowing very well that any moment now, should my body reject the donor's blood, their youngest son will be dead within minutes. </sentence><sentence id="112">The doctor kept asking me, how I felt and I said, I feel warm. </sentence><sentence id="113">That's a good sign, he responded. </sentence><sentence id="114">He finished the transfusion and I was saved. </sentence><sentence id="115">He came back eight days later to take out the stitches and he couldn't believe his own eyes that I was alive. </sentence><sentence id="116">I still have the marks of those stitches on the inside of my right arm. </sentence><sentence id="117">He suggested that I come to the hospital after I get well to be examined thoroughly t find out how I managed to survive that ordeal. </sentence><sentence id="118">It was the same brother whose blood saved me, who was shot dead two months later, when I was taken to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="119">As it turned out, had I not had typhus at home and developed immunity, there would have been no chance in the world for me to have survived Birkenau in 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Can we ask a question, Susan did ----. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="190">5  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="191"> (S.B.) Did you ever consider escaping rather than returning to the ghetto, after you had been in the labor camp? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: When we were in the labor camp, i.e., in the fall of 1940, there were no ghettos yet in most of the General Government of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="193">The ghettos there were formed in the spring of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="194">Except, of course, for the city of Lodz, where the ghetto was formed in early 1940, because Lodz was incorporated into the Reich, (i.e. the city of Lodz and the entire province) and the city of Warsaw, where the ghetto was formed in October or November of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="195">Yes, it was a good question. </sentence><sentence id="196">Some people escaped, it was not too difficult to escape across the border which consisted of a simple barbed wire which wasn't electrified. </sentence><sentence id="197">Of course, if an inmate was caught before he reached the no-man's land he would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="198">On the way to work, at some points, we almost brushed against the barbed wire fences. </sentence><sentence id="199">We saw the Soviet guards patrolling. </sentence><sentence id="200">Some officers came close to the fence and talked to us. </sentence><sentence id="201">I remember there was one officer who spoke Yiddish to us He was a Soviet Jewish captain. </sentence><sentence id="202">I wanted to escape, some of my friends did. </sentence><sentence id="203">They were all caught by the Soviet guards, every single one of them. </sentence><sentence id="204">Once you escaped across the fence, you had to cross a stretch of no-man's land of perhaps 50 feet of terrain to reach the Soviet fence. </sentence><sentence id="205">In most instances, the German guards couldn't see, when one forced the fence, either by crawling under it, or by spreading the strands of wire and going through it. </sentence><sentence id="206">The guards were too thinly spread out. </sentence><sentence id="207">However, the escapees were spotted while walking or running through the neutral no-man's land. </sentence><sentence id="208">Since the guards couldn't shoot at them, they fired rounds in the air, thereby alerting the Soviet border guards who apprehended them. </sentence><sentence id="209">Even though, the Soviets knew that the escapees were Jewish inmates of forced labor camps, running for their lives from the Nazis, they were treated as if they were spies. </sentence><sentence id="210">Every single one of them was interrogated in the nearest town of Rava Ruska, imprisoned and eventually sent to the northern gulags. </sentence><sentence id="211">Ironically, through this act of callous and unconscionable mistreatment at the hands of the Soviet police apparatus, most of the escapees were saved; for had they been left in the Soviet- occupied Polish territories, they would have been killed a year later when the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union and occupied those territories. </sentence><sentence id="212">I wanted to escape from the labor camp to join my brother Jechiel, who at the time lived in Lvov, no more than about 100 km south from our camp. </sentence><sentence id="213">I had no notion under what ghastly conditions he lived in Lvov as a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="214">However, I received a postcard from home in which my brother Moshe informed me that Jechiel sent a postcard home from some rail station on the old Polish-Soviet border. </sentence><sentence id="215">In the card he told us that he is in transport, forcibly evacuated from Lvov, and going either to the Far East or to the Caucasus. </sentence><sentence id="216">Well, he wound up in the far North, hundreds of kilometers north of Archangelsk. </sentence><sentence id="217">That postcard was dated July 1940. </sentence><sentence id="218">In the summer of 1940, the Soviet authorities rounded up all Polish-Jewish refugees under their jurisdiction who did not apply for Soviet citizenship, and shipped them to the northern gulags. </sentence><sentence id="219">That covered the vast majority of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="220">Once I found out that my brother was no longer in Lvov, I had no great desire to risk an escape attempt to face an unknown fate alone. </sentence><sentence id="221">I was too young then. </sentence><sentence id="222">Whether I would have been better off or not is hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="223">The chances are that I had as 6  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection good a chance to survive as to perish there. </sentence><sentence id="224">About half the people perished in the Soviet camps. </sentence><sentence id="225">However, I didn't escape and returned home to face the real test of fending for myself only one and a half years later, when I wound up in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="226">The last time I saw my parents and my family was on April 28, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="227">The liquidation of the ghettos in Poland an the annihilation of the Jewish population there began in the summer of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="228">In some areas, it started earlier. </sentence><sentence id="229">So about three or four months after I was shipped to Auschwitz and my brother executed, my family, that is my father, my mother, my sister and the entire extended family were shipped to and annihilated at Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="230">Treblinka became the killing field of the Jews from the ghettos of the towns and cities in the districts of Warsaw and Radom. </sentence><sentence id="231">In addition, of course, to devouring transports of Jews from all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="232">My personal saga began with my arrival at Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="233">My experience at the main camp in Auschwitz lasted only about thirty-six hours, enough time for the conversion of civilians into prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="234">But Birkenau was hell. </sentence><sentence id="235">Time was not conceived in terms of months or years but in terms of days. </sentence><sentence id="236">If one survived the day, one achieved the unlikely. </sentence><sentence id="237">If one survived a month, one achieved the impossible. </sentence><sentence id="238">When new prisoners arrived in the fall of 1942, and I told them that I had been there six months, they found it unbelievable, because most new arrivals, by the time they got oriented and realized where they were, which usually took a day or two, became aware of the fact that they won't survive too long. </sentence><sentence id="239">Later on, it became a little easier but in 1942 was an indescribable hell. </sentence><sentence id="240">We didn't even know upon arrival that Birkenau had just started to become the crown jewel of the Nazi killing machine of European Jewry. </sentence><sentence id="241">It took us several months to find out exactly what was going on right there. </sentence><sentence id="242">QO: Did you know that they were killing people in those places? </sentence><sentence id="243"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection The trucks were loaded at the Auschwitz railroad camp and traveled the two miles to the gas chamber, passing the road that surrounded the Birkenau camp complex. </sentence><sentence id="244">We sometimes saw the trucks from inside the camp, and occasionally passed them by on the road on our way to work. </sentence><sentence id="245">Most of my work, and the work of people around me, was involved in enlarging the camp. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was an enormous universe of camps which could, by the middle of 1944, accommodate close to a quarter of a million prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="247">My job throughout the spring and early summer of 1942 was digging the foundations for crematorium one. </sentence><sentence id="248">By mid-summer of 1942, they had some crazy idea of separating a group of about 800 young Jewish prisoners, from 16 to 25 years of age, and forming a masonry school to teach us how to become bricklayers. </sentence><sentence id="249">I don't know what they had in mind for the plan turned into a fiasco. </sentence><sentence id="250">Not one of us eventually worked as a bricklayer. </sentence><sentence id="251">Many of the 800 did of typhus during the summer anyway, i.e., they were selected to go to the gas chamber after contracting typhus, but the few who survived were helped by the fact that they didn't have to work outside in the heat of summer. </sentence><sentence id="252">With the rations that we received, compounded by the lack of water, hard labor, sleepless nights and beatings, one did not last long. </sentence><sentence id="253">We were lucky that during a crucial period in the summer, we were indoors in barracks receiving instruction on how to lay bricks. </sentence><sentence id="254">But it didn't prevent the SS from performing selections among us. </sentence><sentence id="255">They took place every week. </sentence><sentence id="256">Those who looked weak or showed signs of illness or had abscesses or scars were selected to go to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="257">By the fall, the masonry school (Maurerschule) ceased to exist. </sentence><sentence id="258">Some of the remaining youngsters were sent to Auschwitz to work, and I was among those assigned to a work commando in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="259">The same kapo for whom I worked earlier returned from the Auschwitz sick bay, where he was confined with typhus, and was given a new work crew to dig foundations and help in the construction of crematoria three and four. </sentence><sentence id="260">He recognized me and several others, and we became part of a group of 100 workers who worked for him until the spring of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="261">Only a handful among the original one hundred survived the winter. </sentence><sentence id="262">Our last job under his command was to dig the foundations for the sauna. </sentence><sentence id="263">One day in late April, I had near fatal accident. </sentence><sentence id="264">I was hit by an empty truck. </sentence><sentence id="265">At the time, German tractor cabs are usually pulled two or three trailers. </sentence><sentence id="266">After the bricks were unloaded, I closed the side lid of the first trailer but the German truck driver did not see me and he started the engine. </sentence><sentence id="267">I was caught between the first and second trailers and thrown into the ditch. </sentence><sentence id="268">Had I fallen under the wheels, I would have been dead or completely maimed. </sentence><sentence id="269">I was so stunned that I couldn't get up after regaining consciousness. </sentence><sentence id="270">They improvised a kind of stretcher from some boards and carried me back to camp. </sentence><sentence id="271">Now carrying back dead or near-dead bodies from work sites to the camp was a common sight. </sentence><sentence id="272">Each work detail that returned from work to cam invariably carried one or more dead bodies but they were stretched out. </sentence><sentence id="273">Here I wasn't dead or near dead. </sentence><sentence id="274">I simply couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="275">I was sitting up on this makeshift stretcher and looked like a Roman proconsul being carried by four people on their shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="276">There was only one witness who remembered that very unusual sight; he died in Canada a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="277">I was lowered down in front of my barrack where the whole contingent was assembled for roll call, and permitted by the barrack elder to sit on the ground while the counting took place. </sentence><sentence id="278">8  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Afterwards, I was picked up by a strong Belgian fellow who carried me to my third tier bunk. </sentence><sentence id="279">The next morning, with the support of two men, I made it to the doctor to be examined. </sentence><sentence id="280">If one didn't go out to work, or report sick, one's life was in mortal danger. </sentence><sentence id="281">There was no third choice -- it was either work or death. </sentence><sentence id="282">The kapo came with me, because it happened on his watch so he was sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="283">By that time he had known me for about a year and in some way acted as my protector. </sentence><sentence id="284">He helped me to the sick bay and we met the chief camp doctor who was a Polish prisoner and former colonel of the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="285">He should have been tried and convicted after the war as a war criminal. </sentence><sentence id="286">I thought that he was dead but discovered only a couple of years ago that he was tried in Poland sometime after the war and was let go for lack of evidence, He would simply assault patients who came to him to be examined and he also conducted selections on his own, sending Jewish prisoners to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="287">His name was Zenkteler. </sentence><sentence id="288">He treated me more or less, correctly. </sentence><sentence id="289">He examined me and said there's nothing he can do and that there is nothing wrong with me. </sentence><sentence id="290">But since I came and he knew that I didn't try to shirk work because the kapo was with me, he gave me a couple of days of what was referred to in German as schonung, meaning rest, at the sick bay, which was barrack no. </sentence><sentence id="291">7. </sentence><sentence id="292">That barrack was an assembly point for Jewish prisoners who reported sick throughout the entire week. </sentence><sentence id="293">On Tuesdays, the trucks would come and take most of them to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="294">From the very beginning, barrack no. </sentence><sentence id="295">7 served that function, i.e., as a way station from camp to the gas cambers. </sentence><sentence id="296">The moment I crossed the camp road (I remembered it as a road, but when I visited there this past September, I realized that it was more like a wide path than a road) and passed one of the little earth and brick bridges that connected the main camp road to the respective sides of the camp which were separated from the road by ditches; something happened to me: I suddenly became able to stand on my own feet and asked my two companion, who helped me, to let me walk to no. </sentence><sentence id="297">7 by myself. </sentence><sentence id="298">In retrospect, it is obvious to me that my inability to walk was a psychosomatic phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="299">It was a result of the shock received during the accident. </sentence><sentence id="300">My sudden ability to stand on my own feet must have resulted from the realization that I had better not walk in sick to barrack no. </sentence><sentence id="301">7. </sentence><sentence id="302">I met people there whom I had known since the beginning, a couple of them came with me in 1942, and they worked there as orderlies. </sentence><sentence id="303">The next morning, I was discharged, and a few days later was transferred to barrack no. </sentence><sentence id="304">16 and thereby gained the assignment to work in the "Canada" work detail. </sentence><sentence id="305">Luckily my work was inside the barracks sorting goods and I didn't have to go to the rail siding to meet arriving transports. </sentence><sentence id="306">That work ended after four weeks when I developed an infection on my face and was admitted to the sick bay in barrack no. </sentence><sentence id="307">8. </sentence><sentence id="308">The fact that I was

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="493">A: No! </sentence><sentence id="494">To my knowledge there were no Greek Jews among them, or at most, very few. </sentence><sentence id="495">The old guard, i.e., the cadres consisted mainly of Polish Jews, plus some French Jews and others. </sentence><sentence id="496">During the late spring of 1944, newly arrived Hungarian Jews were conscripted to work in the Sonderkomando because the size of the crematoria work details almost tripled at that time. </sentence><sentence id="497">From its very inception in the spring of 1942, the Birkenau Sonderkomando crews were subject to periodic liquidations. </sentence><sentence id="498">The first total liquidation took place in December 1942, when the approximately 500 strong crew was murdered. </sentence><sentence id="499">The first job of the new crew, selected the evening before when the Birkenau camp was subject to a strict curfew, was to dispose of the bodies of their predecessors. </sentence><sentence id="500">The next sizeable liquidation took place in November 1943 when a part of the Sonderkomando was transported to Majdanek, allegedly for work in the crematorium there, but once in Majdanek, they were put to death. </sentence><sentence id="501">The events leading to their death in the Majdanek gas chamber were confirmed by members of the Majdanek crematorium crew when they arrived in Birkenau in July 1944, after Majdanek was evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="502">By early fall of 1944, when Birkenau no longer functioned as a mass killing machine, the SS began the process of thinning out the ranks of the Sonderkomando. </sentence><sentence id="503">The first victims were several hundred men from the crew of crematorium no. </sentence><sentence id="504">3. </sentence><sentence id="505">They were brought to the sauna for disinfection and that was the first time that I came face to face with, and talked to, members of the Sonderkomando.

believing the deception. </sentence><sentence id="508">They weren't deceived, and were aware of their situation. </sentence><sentence id="509">From the sauna they were taken to Auschwitz where they were put to death in the old gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="510">When, on October 6, the order to assemble came for the rest of the crematorium no, 3 crew, they refused and barricaded themselves inside the crematorium living quarters. </sentence><sentence id="511">They put their straw mattresses to the torch and exchanged fire with the SS guards outside, using the few small weapons

detail in late November -- early December, 1944, to break up the concrete floor of the crematorium 3 gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="531">We used hammers and pickaxes for the job. </sentence><sentence id="532">During our work, we found many pliers that were used by the crematoria crews to pull out gold teeth from the mouths of the gassed victims. </sentence><sentence id="533">The unbelievable circumstances of this assignment did not escape me at the time for I was the only one among the prisoners in that work detail who worked at digging the foundation and at the construction of the very same crematorium two years before, and lived long enough to be present at, and participate in, it's demolition. </sentence><sentence id="534">I recall one incident during the uprising which in retrospect fills me with terror. </sentence><sentence id="535">While the road outside the sauna building was teeming with SS guards and officers running on foot and on any conveyance they could find including bicycles, in the direction of crematorium | where the breakout took place, we in the sauna received the dreaded order, "Alle Juden eintreten",, i.e., all Jews fall-in. </sentence><sentence id="536">We assembled in the courtyard, separated from the non-Jewish members of the work crew, and watched with horror, and envy, the satisfaction on the faces of the latter that they are lucky enough not to be Jews and not to have to share our foreboding of doom, and doom was exactly what we expected at the time. </sentence><sentence id="537">We never found out the reason for our being ordered to assemble, but were greatly relieved when we were dismissed later on. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was the last time in my incarceration that I was subject to that

trip by a friend from Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="545">It was during the late morning, on a Saturday, and the two of us were the only ones there. </sentence><sentence id="546">In that huge complex of former camp there wasn't another human being in sight. </sentence><sentence id="547">There was an eeriness in the absolute silence that pervaded this greatest of killing fields of all time. </sentence><sentence id="548">The eeriness became more intense for me when I juxtaposed this silence of the grave against my recollections of the teeming scores of thousands of prisoners, who at any time between 1942 and 1945, occupied these grounds, not to mention the millions who never set foot inside the barbed wire confines but walked, or were trucked, on the nearby road from the railroad ramp to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="549">On the way back to Cracow we stopped at the Auschwitz camp which is about two miles from Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="550">The parking lot was full; there were bus loads with visitors, and the cafeteria was busy. </sentence><sentence id="551">The place projected an aura of a busy shrine, while Birkenau has been allowed to go to seed and its physical plant is so disintegrated that it is beyond repair, and certainly beyond recognition. </sentence><sentence id="552">There is no comparison between the two camps in the way they are kept and maintained as Polish national museums. </sentence><sentence id="553">In that connection, it is apropos to reflect on the difference between the two places when they functioned as Nazi concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="554">Auschwitz was not unlike many Nazi camps within Germany. </sentence><sentence id="555">The difference was only in degree, i.e., more cruelty, more harshness, more of everything evil, but in its basic essentials it resembled concentration camps like Dachau, Buchenwald, etc. </sentence><sentence id="556">However, Birkenau belonged to a different universe of evil. </sentence><sentence id="557">It its operating mode, and in its basic objectives that unique hell could be justly described as having been a slaughterhouse rather than a

id="633">The combination of exposure; sleeplessness; total fatigue from hard work, long marches, and endless hours of standing at the morning and evening roll-calls; very little food and water; lack of medical care; non-existing sanitation; and the ever present beatings, which frequently concluded with the victim being strangled, contributed to a very short life span for the vast majority of Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="634">Our daily food rations were minimal but were made much smaller by the barrack elder and his helpers who appropriated one-fifth of the bread by dividing a loaf into five portions instead of the required four portions. </sentence><sentence id="635">Of the margarine and occasional liverwurst or smelly cheese, we received the tiniest of fractions allotted to us, while the rest was brazenly stolen by the barrack elder and either sold for other products, or distributed to his cronies and proteges. </sentence><sentence id="636">The soup was distributed at the worksite at noon and was one of our supplies of drinking water. </sentence><sentence id="637">The fact that we did not have spoons did not, in most instances, make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="638">The soup consisted of water, some thickener, a few bits of floating potatoes or beets and, very rarely, a morsel of meat, The presence of meat in the soup meant little to us, for we never saw it in our bowls. </sentence><sentence id="639">The kapo usually allowed the meat to sink to the bottom of the soup container and did not stir the contents before serving. </sentence><sentence id="640">The booty belonged to him and his helpers. </sentence><sentence id="641">At every worksite throughout the camp, when it came time to line up for the soup, there was jockeying for position and ensuing pandemonium, for no one wanted to be the first in line to be served from the top of the container. </sentence><sentence id="642">Occasionally, the strategy of those who managed to line up at the end of the line was rewarded with failure when the kapo decided to stir the soup at the beginning of the line, or when he decided to serve from the top of the second container, instead of emptying the first. </sentence><sentence id="643">The bread ration was distributed in the evening, after roll call and it was usually eaten at once. </sentence><sentence id="644">That meant waiting 24 hours for the next piece of solid food, for in the morning we only received some cold, vile-tasting ersatz tea, made from some kind of leaves. </sentence><sentence

that they were going to blow up a production facility (I often wondered whether we'll be on the outside or immolated within the tunnel when it occurs), or deny the Allied forces an autobahn shortcut

satellite camp and not that far away from Kaufering, yet it took us three days by train to get there. </sentence><sentence id="804">It was to be our last camp, however, not our last transport. </sentence><sentence id="805">In Muhldord, I met many former inmates from Birkenau, those who left during the mass evacuation in October 1944, as well as those from a transport of non- Polish Jewish inmates who were shipped from Birkenau to Warsaw in the summer of 1943 to clear the ruins of the destroyed ghetto in that city. </sentence><sentence id="806">They were evacuated from Warsaw at the beginning of the polish uprising there in August of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="807">This was the first place in my three months of wandering where I encountered some friendship and encouragement,

located in a converted or abandoned monastery. </sentence><sentence id="809">We loaded a truck full of machine tools and grinding stones. </sentence><sentence id="810">Some of it loose and some of it in heavy metal crates. </sentence><sentence id="811">The conveyance consisted of a trailer cab that pulled two open trailers. </sentence><sentence id="812">The first trailer carried the uncrated stuff plus several prisoners sent along to do the unloading. </sentence><sentence id="813">I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="814">The second trailer held the crated material, two German civilians, and two armed guards. </sentence><sentence id="815">We had no idea of the destination of this shipment. </sentence><sentence id="816">The driver turned off the main road and took us down a very steep road leading towards a river, at which point, I suppose he was going to make a turn and proceed on the road alongside the river. </sentence><sentence id="817">Well, luckily for us as it turned out, he never made it to the river, for he soon realized that he did not have enough braking power to prevent the cab and the trailers from jackknifing into the river as 19  https://collections.ushmm.org

trailer. </sentence><sentence id="820">Isaac jumped in time, but the two of us didn't make it and we were caught in an overturned trailer with heavy debris flying all over, including the stuff from the second trailer which toppled. </sentence><sentence id="821">I lost consciousness for a moment and when I came to, I saw myself covered with debris, and people clearing it away and carrying me away from the road towards the woods. </sentence><sentence id="822">I was bleeding from a cut above the eye and from a cut in the back of my head. </sentence><sentence id="823">It was as great a miracle as any that happened to me during the war. </sentence><sentence id="824">There were heavy objects flying all around me, some weighing hundreds of kilograms and all I suffered, were two cuts. </sentence><sentence id="825">Of course, no one knew whether I sustained some internal injuries or some brain injuries. </sentence><sentence id="826">The German driver was very upset, for he felt guilty about the accident; he tried to get some assistance but all that he managed to do was to bring a band-aid for me and a promise that someone will come to take me to the camp's sick bay. </sentence><sentence id="827">In the meantime, hell broke loose with the sound of exploding bombs and flak that came from a nearby town under air attack by U.S. warplanes. </sentence><sentence id="828">I remember someone saying that it is the Allies gift to Hitler on his birthday, and that is how I know it happened on April 20. </sentence><sentence id="829">Because of this air attack, we had to wait for hours until we were transported back to camp, and when I presented myself at the sick bay, the floor was littered with people injured during the bombing of some facilities nearby. </sentence><sentence id="830">Among them was a fellow from Radom who took a shrapnel in his thigh. </sentence><sentence id="831">His survival is a saga, for he was operated on in a German military

from the people in the sick bay; they had more serious injuries to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="834">I was merely assigned to a rest barrack, where after several days we received orders to assemble for transport. </sentence><sentence id="835">The Muhldorf camp was being evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="836">That was to be our last transport but we didn't know it, of course. </sentence><sentence id="837">As we assembled, I overheard one of the SS guards tell someone not to worry, "You are being taken to Switzerland". </sentence><sentence id="838">That really gave me cause to be worried for if they felt compelled to lie about our destination, that meant we were in real trouble. </sentence><sentence id="839">Our destination was not Switzerland but straight south towards the Bavarian Alps and Austria. </sentence><sentence id="840">The rails of that part of Bavaria were clogged with trains full of prisoners being dragged towards the Reich's last redoubt. </sentence><sentence id="841">What they had in store for us there, or how they were going to resolve the dilemma of either killing the remaining scores of thousands of Jewish concentration camp prisoners, or letting them be liberated by the Allied armies can only be conjectured. </sentence><sentence id="842">We traveled for several days and covered little distance, spending more time on sidings, allowing other trains to pass through. </sentence><sentence id="843">Our transport was not immune to air attacks by U.S. warplanes, as any moving objects would be in those days.

</sentence><sentence id="846">Luckily, there were no bombs thrown, however, we were machine-gunned and there were casualties. </sentence><sentence id="847">On the second or third day of our journey, we found ourselves sidetracked at a small railroad station in Upper Bavaria called Poeing. </sentence><sentence id="848">There were rumors that the transport commander, a German army officer, ordered that the locomotive, plus one empty car, be detached from the train and return to Dachau in order to obtain provisions for the prisoners in his charge. </sentence><sentence id="849">There were several thousand of us and hardly any food left. </sentence><sentence id="850">If that story had any truth to it, it would only reflect the naivete of the officer who was not attuned to the ways the SS camp administration operated. </sentence><sentence id="851">Once a transport left the camp, no one assumed the responsibility for provisioning the prisoners of that transport, except perhaps for providing the initial rations. </sentence><sentence id="852">I'm sure that he couldn't obtain a single loaf if bread in Dachau for the camp was already at the point of disintegration at that time, or about to be overrun by the U.S. Army. </sentence><sentence id="853">I don't remember how long we had not eaten at that point, but I do recall that I was very hungry and decided to eat a raw potato that I had somehow acquired. </sentence><sentence id="854">I was aware of the risk, and it would have been the first time for me to ignore the possible consequences. </sentence><sentence id="855">No sooner had I cut, or peeled the potato when we became aware of a very loud conversation outside. </sentence><sentence id="856">Someone opened the door of the car (these were closed cattle cars, not open ones) and we were treated to a most grotesque spectacle on the platform, where many prisoners were jumping and shouting, "the war is over", and in their excitement embraced some guards. </sentence><sentence id="857">The guard unit of our transport consisted of a motley crew of SS, Wehrmacht soldiers, and black uniformed Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="858">The platform was littered with abandoned knapsacks belonging to the Ukrainians for they were the first to abandon the ship, either out of fear of retribution or using the opportunity to desert. </sentence><sentence id="859">The source of the story about the war's end was no other than the commanding officer of the transport. </sentence><sentence id="860">He went into the stationmaster's office to use the telephone and heard a radio announcement to that effect. </sentence><sentence id="861">He came out and said. </sentence><sentence id="862">"The war is over, you are free to go". </sentence><sentence id="863">Of course, it was a false alarm. </sentence><sentence id="864">What happened was on that day, or the night before, there was an uprising in Munich, involving some Wehrmacht units and civilian sympathizers. </sentence><sentence id="865">It really took place. </sentence><sentence id="866">They declared Munich an open city and wanted it surrendered to the Americans, rather than have it destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="867">However, the coup was suppressed by an SS division, and so came to a quick end, the only open insubordination of the German military in the Second World War.

</sentence><sentence id="871">I never did eat that raw potato and, instead, said to my friend, Isaac, if the war is really over, it's over right here as well as in the nearest village, and there is no need to run into the unknown. </sentence><sentence id="872">First things first, I said, let's go and find the car that holds the provisions. </sentence><sentence id="873">We located it, but it was difficult for me to climb up onto a railcar from the ground. </sentence><sentence id="874">I managed to hoist myself onto it and emerged with a loaf of bread and some margarine. </sentence><sentence

running for their lives back to the train. </sentence><sentence id="877">We learned from them that as soon as they approached the village nearby, they were rounded up by Volksturm troops (Home Army) who shot at them and drove them back to the train. </sentence><sentence id="878">There were casualties. </sentence><sentence id="879">It turned out that some paid with their lives when they were almost at the threshold of freedom. </sentence><sentence id="880">The news from Munich about the end of the war turned out to be premature. </sentence><sentence id="881">The transport reassembled and got on its way again. </sentence><sentence id="882">A while later our train stopped alongside another train with French speaking civilian workers inside. </sentence><sentence id="883">I understood a little French. </sentence><sentence id="884">I didn't speak it but I used the few words that I knew and asked them whether the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="885">They said they weren't aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="886">The next day we stopped at many places and German women came out and brought food and drink but only a few managed to get it. </sentence><sentence id="887">We noticed that the guards didn't interfere and we felt that the end was near at hand. </sentence><sentence id="888">The same night we stopped at a rail siding near the Alpine village of Tutzing. </sentence><sentence id="889">We were asleep on the floor of the car when in the middle of the night we were awakened by sounds on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="890">There were some people out there, whether military or civilian, I didn't know for I was too tired to notice. </sentence><sentence id="891">They said that they were from the International Red Cross and that for all purposes, we are free men, and that U.S.troops should be in the vicinity pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="892">I fell asleep again, and what was said outside didn't really punctuate my consciousness. </sentence><sentence id="893">I just didn't believe it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="894">I got up in the morning and looked outside, and what I saw was a dream come true. </sentence><sentence id="895">The SS guards were gone, disappeared through the night, the few Wehrmacht soldiers, without weapons, were mingling with our people and down the road, at the foot of the embankment, we spotted motorized columns of troops that didn't look German. </sentence><sentence id="896">They were units of the U.S. Third Army, 100" Division, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="897">It was April 30, 1945, exactly three years to the day of my arrival at Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="898">The U.S. troops were merely passing by that road, going somewhere, and encountered masses of emaciated

</sentence><sentence id="911">In the meantime, the immediate problems of survival had to be given some attention. </sentence><sentence id="912">A lieutenant of the U.S. Army's 100" Division, named Smith, appeared on the scene. </sentence><sentence id="913">He apparently was placed in charge to organize the setting up of a Displaced Persons" Center in Feldafing, a few kilometers from the village of Tutzing, where our train was still used as our home. </sentence><sentence id="914">We spent two days and two nights on that train, having the satisfaction of seeing German POW army officers and
