<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="559">A: No, when the war started, you had to wait till you see what is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="560">You cannot make plans under these conditions. </sentence><sentence id="561">So my brothers went away. </sentence><sentence id="562">My parents, we tried to survive. </sentence><sentence id="563">My oldest brother came back from on permission on furlough in wintertime before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="564">And he made us start a business there, my older sister and I. And we know was beyond Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="565">We started a business to make some kind of -- we had to live. </sentence><sentence id="566">We didn't want to be on welfare. </sentence><sentence id="567">That's something we -- so started a business, and it was , you know. </sentence><sentence id="568">And we had to start in women's clothing, but that was a little latter. </sentence><sentence id="569">That's after the Jabotinsky came in. </sentence><sentence id="570">But we did that to start something, to be okay and to be able to feed us. </sentence><sentence id="571">We were quite young. </sentence><sentence id="572">And on top of it, we had Germany -- and also Germany, that was a lot of difference, too. </sentence><sentence id="573">You know, also people when they came we had to be -- so everybody came, came to our house in Budapest; it was an open house. </sentence><sentence id="574">So we were -- and then the war started, and the Germans first were -- and there were refugees in the station all along the station. </sentence><sentence id="575">Thousands and thousands and thousands were killed. </sentence><sentence id="576">There was not a place, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="577">And they were just flying over us and just throwing bombs. </sentence><sentence id="578">And before we started the business and then after, too, we helped the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="579">My sister and I went -- my sister, Steph -- I call her Steph. </sentence><sentence id="580">But Stephanie and I, we went down always to the station and helped the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="581">And so we helped a lot of young people. </sentence><sentence id="582">And there I have a story, when the Bishop came to see us, the Bishop of Pratique. </sentence><sentence id="583">And he give me his ring to kiss, and I said, "Sir, I don't kiss it. </sentence><sentence id="584">I'm Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="585">And he said,"____----.-~You should kiss my ring anyway." </sentence><sentence id="586">And I said I would never do it. </sentence><sentence id="587">And he    was very upset, but I didn't kiss it. </sentence><sentence id="588">So, these are the kind of things for children. </sentence><sentence id="589">You know, I would go to church and my parents didn't mind at all that I go to church. </sentence><sentence id="590">But I would never -- but we had a church across the street, and when it was started, they had a huge ,itwaslikea__to me. </sentence><sentence id="591">It was a bigger -- you know, it was really extremely colorful and beautiful music and all that. </sentence><sentence id="592">I loved to go and see that, but I never thought -- that never influenced my thinking. </sentence><sentence id="593">But it isn't -- and I took, when my children were bigger, I took them to church. </sentence><sentence id="594">It's an experience for them also as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="595">I never -- you know, I never closed my mind to that, even after the war. </sentence><sentence id="596">After all what happened, I cannot be closed-minded. </sentence><sentence id="597">Do not be only -- have one view of things. </sentence><sentence id="598">There is not just one view of things, it's a human wisdom, that's how I feel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="640">Q: So what was this in... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="642">A: That was when the Germans started to the war, but before the Germans entered, several days before -- I cannot tell you how many. </sentence><sentence id="643">Several days before the Italian came on the absolutely defenseless city and killed thousands and thousands of people. </sentence><sentence id="644">And there we had something very strange happened. </sentence><sentence id="645">I had just called -- because at that time we were living in that house on a hill above the station, much above the station. </sentence><sentence id="646">They were not hurt because the station was in a valley, and there was a hill on that side and then there is a hill on that side. </sentence><sentence id="647">It's very hilly. </sentence><sentence id="648">And I had just crossed the bridge, the bridge for people. </sentence><sentence id="649">You know, from -- I have to think -- for people to walk, not for cars, but had just crossed it, and I was on the other side of the station when the bombardment took place. </sentence><sentence id="650">I was not at that time taking care of the refugees that day. </sentence><sentence id="651">I was going to the store after lunch. </sentence><sentence id="652">And when that happened, I only thought about -- when the bombardment was over, I only thought about one thing, to run home and tell my mother I was alive. </sentence><sentence id="653">Which she didn't know where it was, but she knew that there was a bombardment. </sentence><sentence id="654">So I crossed that bridge back, I was the only one crossing it. </sentence><sentence id="655">And I didn't think about it, and there were trains of munitions and there were people from the railroad, walkers, who were making signs, "Don't cross. </sentence><sentence id="656">Don't cross." </sentence><sentence id="657">But I was just coming. </sentence><sentence id="658">I wanted to tell my mother I was okay. </sentence><sentence id="659">That's all I thought, I didn't realize that I -- or I don't think I realized it. </sentence><sentence id="660">So I went home and I told my mother, but during that time my sister was looking for me because she had been somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="661">And she was -- she went to all the hospitals to see if I had been hurt, because she didn't find me. </sentence><sentence id="662">And I was home, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="685">Q: This must have been fairly frightening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="687">A: Oh, I was terribly frightened of the bombardment. </sentence><sentence id="688">Once they were bombarding, I was -- I never had lived through one before. </sentence><sentence id="689">I was extremely terrified. </sentence><sentence id="690">I wanted to be a smaller thing. </sentence><sentence id="691">I'm not very large, but as small as I could. </sentence><sentence id="692">There were old people running to houses, and I just wished the whole town -- you know, to hold me in their arms. </sentence><sentence id="693">That house wasn't destroyed, but it could happen. </sentence><sentence id="694">It was very close, but just at the beginning of the street. </sentence><sentence id="695">I don't remember what street, where it was. </sentence><sentence id="696">And then there was a second bombardment, just that I don't remember when. </sentence><sentence id="697">But I know there was a second bombardment, and then that was the end of that and Germany came in. </sentence><sentence id="698">But the Italians they were absolutely, you could see the pilots so low they were flying. </sentence><sentence id="699">Of course, they had not very sophisticated planes at that time, and you could see the bombs just coming out. </sentence><sentence id="700">That was my first experience with war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="715">Q: Did you expect this at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="718">I was so indignant because I felt that they were so cowards to bombard the city without defense. </sentence><sentence id="719">When there were military people, ammunition in the station, you know, going through, but there was nothing to defend the city. </sentence><sentence id="720">And they knew that, they wanted us to be just so petrified that we accept the Germany Army when they come in. </sentence><sentence id="721">It was a psychological warfare. </sentence><sentence id="722">There was no reason, no tactical reason to do that. </sentence><sentence id="723">There was not industry; there was nothing there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="731">Q: Do you remember the date? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="733">A: It was several days before the Germans entered. </sentence><sentence id="734">I cannot tell you exactly when. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: Was if it was like in May 1940? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: May -- yeah, May or June -- I cannot remember. </sentence><sentence id="740">Do you know I cannot remember if it was May or June? </sentence><sentence id="741">But it took about until June until the Germans came as far as Bastille, because they went to Elgin. </sentence><sentence id="742">It went fast, but still. </sentence><sentence id="743">Once they went -- they never hit the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="744">They were grounded. </sentence><sentence id="745">Then they came down south where there was no defense. </sentence><sentence id="746">And the French Army and the English Army were unable to fight them, first because the government was unbelievably bad. </sentence><sentence id="747">It was a very,    very cowardly government. </sentence><sentence id="748">And then the second reason was that our army was not trained for that. </sentence><sentence id="749">They were thinking that it was a war like in 1914, "18 and not for 1940. </sentence><sentence id="750">And De Gaulle had told them what they should do, but they never listened to anything -- they know this. </sentence><sentence id="751">Do you know his book was read by Hitler, and he used it? </sentence><sentence id="752">But see, the French didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="753">They were never very good -- how do you call that? </sentence><sentence id="754">In your own country, you are recognized for what you are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="772">Q: So describe to me when the Germans came in, what that was like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="774">A: I was walking the streets with my older sister, Sissie, and we sort of felt Germans, what do you say, we just felt them coming. </sentence><sentence id="775">And I told my sister, "I wish I could kill them." </sentence><sentence id="776">And at that time -- at that moment in time, they didn't get killed but they fell, and I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="777">I said, "Did I do it?" </sentence><sentence id="778">I didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="779">It just happened, a coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="780">But that was my first German I saw. </sentence><sentence id="781">In the beginning it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="782">You know, I have to experience something. </sentence><sentence id="783">You know, before the war I was very idealistic. </sentence><sentence id="784">I was an absolute pacifist. </sentence><sentence id="785">I only think war cannot do anything for us. </sentence><sentence id="786">War cannot help anybody, what I thought at that time. </sentence><sentence id="787">But when I saw the Germans" picture in the Champs Elysees in Paris, you know, parading, that is when it just took a hold at last. </sentence><sentence id="788">And from that day on, I think we have to get out. </sentence><sentence id="789">But in the beginning I couldn't do anything much. </sentence><sentence id="790">But in the very beginning when the Germans, they were very polite. </sentence><sentence id="791">They were extremely -- in France. </sentence><sentence id="792">They did not behave that way in Poland or Russia or wherever or Czechoslovakia, but in France they had orders and they were extremely polite. </sentence><sentence id="793">And they were even courteous, and they had rules. </sentence><sentence id="794">So they did not bother us the first few months, but we didn't press them. </sentence><sentence id="795">We knew that they could not stay like that forever. </sentence><sentence id="796">But we didn't know what would happen, we were just waiting. </sentence><sentence id="797">And then my brother who was in Majdanek, he was in prison. </sentence><sentence id="798">He was a prisoner of the Germans in Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="799">And his cousin, too, from . </sentence><sentence id="800">He was able to escape from there, and he walked through Alsace, it was wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="801">And he was made prisoner in June or May -- I don't remember, but he was a prisoner until about December. </sentence><sentence id="802">And then in December he was able to escape, and he crossed over there by foot because he had no way of going. </sentence><sentence id="803">He had civilian clothes, but he had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="804">All his military papers would show that he was a POW. </sentence><sentence id="805">And then he arrived finally in Alsace, where he had a business -- he had a very good business there. </sentence><sentence id="806">So he told all his clients, he called them and told them he was there and he sold everything. </sentence><sentence id="807">He had a men's fashion store. </sentence><sentence id="808">You know, they had all custom-made costumes. </sentence><sentence id="809">They made suits and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="810">So he sold everything he had in his store -- so we got some money, we lived on that. </sentence><sentence id="811">He is the one who really helped to hold together and he came to Pratique finally. </sentence><sentence id="812">After Helsinger, he was able to take a train and he came to Pratique, and he stayed a month in Pratique with us and he met my sister-in-law who was my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="813">And they got in love, first time. </sentence><sentence id="814">First night. </sentence><sentence id="815">And we knew that could be very serious. </sentence><sentence id="816">Then he tried to escape with a cousin who was German, who was living with us, too. </sentence><sentence id="817">They were caught by a German patrol when they tried to cross into French Vichy. </sentence><sentence id="818">Because my brother's plan was to go to Vichy, France. </sentence><sentence id="819">Go to Spain and go to . </sentence><sentence id="820">But he was caught then and he was in prison for months. </sentence><sentence id="821">But the Germans were -- that was still at the time when the Germans were not nasty yet. </sentence><sentence id="822">They did not -- they looked at these people, but did not see that he was a prisoner of war. </sentence><sentence id="823">Because if he was not a prisoner of war, he'd be dead. </sentence><sentence id="824">But there was no people's organization, so they should have understood. </sentence><sentence id="825">Luckily for him, they did not see, they never noticed that Oscar was a German citizen. </sentence><sentence id="826">So they both were months in prison and then they came out. </sentence><sentence id="827">Then they went back again. </sentence><sentence id="828">They escaped again. </sentence><sentence id="829">And the way they escaped is how the same place where they escaped at a later time. </sentence><sentence id="830">But they escaped, then my sister-in-law must know. </sentence><sentence id="831">My sister- in-law, she went with her friends to join him, and she told him that she had to or we get married; that's it. </sentence><sentence id="832">So they got married. </sentence><sentence id="833">They never went to Luck. </sentence><sentence id="834">But they stopped at the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="897">Q: We'll talk about that later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="899">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="900">But I come back to Batik, so my oldest brother was going to Vichy, France, and we stayed in Batik. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="903">Q: Let me ask you a question first. </sentence><sentence id="904">How quickly was the country divided between Vichy and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="907">A: Immediately, immediately. </sentence><sentence id="908">As soon as the government of France signed whatever. </sentence><sentence id="909">Do you know -- I don't know if you call that an armistice or a peace, but at that time it was immediately. </sentence><sentence id="910">And we were just a few kilometers from the line which divided French, occupied in French -- Batik. </sentence><sentence id="911">And then my second brother, Arnold, went to Tunisia, he went south, and immediately and he joined my brother in . </sentence><sentence id="912">My brother by then was married to my sister-in-law, and when we    stayed , our store with clothes that the Germans came in "41, beginning "41. </sentence><sentence id="913">I cannot remember the time. </sentence><sentence id="914">And so we had nothing, nothing -- no income anymore. </sentence><sentence id="915">But my brother was helping us. </sentence><sentence id="916">He gave us all the money we needed to live on. </sentence><sentence id="917">And I started to work in the city hall, in a French office of dealing with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="918">You know, they gave us all the requisitions, what they want from us and we had to deliver. </sentence><sentence id="919">And I was one in that department, that French office which dealt with the Germans constantly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="934">Q: You spoke German? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: Oh, I speak fluently. </sentence><sentence id="937">In Metz, we always spoke German and French. </sentence><sentence id="938">My parents until 1918, people had no right to speak French. </sentence><sentence id="939">My father was arrested by the Germans in 1917 or "18 and put in prison for a few days because they said, "Your neighbor said that you have spoken French." </sentence><sentence id="940">The poor man didn't even know what was French. </sentence><sentence id="941">So he was in prison but he was released because they understood that he didn't speak any French, so he couldn't have done it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="948">Q: Now, when you were working in this office, did they know you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="951">The Germans? </sentence><sentence id="952">No, they didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="953">They never asked. </sentence><sentence id="954">That was before they were all -- you know, the yellow star and all that, that was before. </sentence><sentence id="955">I worked there several months and it was friendly because the Germans were telling me that I was a real German, and I was from Metz and I had the German name. </sentence><sentence id="956">And I was very blonde with light eyes and light skin, so they think I'm areal German. </sentence><sentence id="957">And they felt that I should come to Germany, so they offered me jobs, you know, in government in Germany if I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="958">And I said no, and I told some of them that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="959">And two or three of them, when I told them I am Jewish, they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="960">But only two of them, and then I lost my job. </sentence><sentence id="961">You know, because the government did not accept any more -- the Germans did not accept any more of the Jews at work. </sentence><sentence id="962">But we still didn't wear the yellow star, but much earlier -- I don't remember when either, but much earlier -- they had an edict that all Jewish fathers had to come and declare the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="963">If not, we would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="964">So my father like all fathers went to declare his own family. </sentence><sentence id="965">It was pretentious not to for him, and we never discussed it even. </sentence><sentence id="966">He just went because he felt he had to do it, and who was to think that we would be killed? </sentence><sentence id="967">So that's how it seems, so we were declared but we had no star yet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="986">Q: So what sort of restrictions were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="988">A: Oh, the restrictions on Jews started after the war started with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="989">Then is when it really started. </sentence><sentence id="990">You know, say where the restrictions -- I cannot remember, but real restrictions, the yellow star and all that, really started after the war started with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="991">Because when I was working at that French office at the city hall, I know I was not wearing the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="992">And I know that, you know, that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="993">All that happened after, so I know that these things occurred. </sentence><sentence id="994">And the Russian -- the war with the Russians started at that time, when I was in that office. </sentence><sentence id="995">So I know that everything started with that. </sentence><sentence id="996">That much, I am sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1012">Q: So up until this time there was no restriction on your movements or anything you wanted to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1014">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1015">That started once we had the yellow star and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1016">But they had closed our store like they did before. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Because I went to the -- that they had closed the store already. </sentence><sentence id="1018">Because we had to declare what was a Jewish store. </sentence><sentence id="1019">That they had done already because if not, I would not have been working in the office. </sentence><sentence id="1020">So I know that that had already occurred. </sentence><sentence id="1021">But even then we were helped by so many people who came to us and said, "You can hide your stuff in our homes." </sentence><sentence id="1022">And they gave it back, they gave it back after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And the girls transported some suitcases with what we had in the store, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Because it took many -- and the funny thing was one of the Germans helped us carry the suitcases. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Because they felt, "Oh, Madchen, you can't carry that suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="1026">It's too heavy for you." </sentence><sentence id="1027">So they helped us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1042">Q: When you talk about the restrictions after the war started with Russia, other than the Jewish star, what sorts of things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1044">A: Every day there was a edict read. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Every day an edict on the walls for us and it was always punished by death. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Everything was verboten. </sentence><sentence id="1047">But always punishment was never something else than death. </sentence><sentence id="1048">We had edicts put on the walls; every day there were new edicts. </sentence><sentence id="1049">First, we had no right to go to a store and buy food or anything else until 4 o'clock in afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1050">We had to wear the yellow star so we were recognized immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And if you did not have the yellow star sown on    your clothes, you were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1052">One of my younger sisters was just a little girl was arrested by a German with the SS, and he brought her home. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And he said to my mother, "If I find her once more without the star attached," -- not safety pin, but, you know, how do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="1054">I cannot remember the word in English. </sentence><sentence id="1055">You know, one goes into the other? </sentence><sentence id="1056">Well, do you know you sew one on top and one underneath and you put them... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1127">A: Not the same. </sentence><sentence id="1128">There were restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="1129">For example, there was -- how do you -- oh, I cannot find the word. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Do you know at a certain hour of the night you had to be in. </sentence><sentence id="1131">Strange because I know these words, but I cannot remember it. </sentence><sentence id="1132">But anyway, for us the restrictions were unbelievable, and they changed every day. </sentence><sentence id="1133">They added some every day. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I told you we had no right to go into a store before 4 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1135">4:00 or 4:30, I don't remember exactly, but about that time. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And at that time, there was nothing left because everybody had coupons to buy everything. </sentence><sentence id="1137">You couldn't buy things freely; there was nothing to be had freely, even milk or butter or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1138">Eggs, you had to have coupons for everything. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So -- but we were very lucky because my mother was very liked by all the people where she brought things for the family. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And they told her not to worry, all of them told her not to worry. </sentence><sentence id="1141">That any time she wants something, to let them know and they will have things ready for her, put her away for her for after 4 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So we never missed anything. </sentence><sentence id="1143">We were never -- we always had enough food. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Like also other French; there was not too much, but we had as much as all the other French people. </sentence><sentence id="1145">We had never missed, and then they were also restriction you had no right to have a radio. </sentence><sentence id="1146">You had no right to have a telephone. </sentence><sentence id="1147">You could not use a public telephone. </sentence><sentence id="1148">You couldn't go into any public space like the Post Office. </sentence><sentence id="1149">You had no right -- the wife of the Rabbi Eli Block I mentioned before, she went into the Post Office and make a phone call. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And she was arrested with her little girl and taken to the Gestapo, and the rabbi went and tried to -- he always discussed things with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1151">He was an organizer, and he spoke German very well, too. </sentence><sentence id="1152">So he always talked with the community, but there he talked for his wife and child. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So they arrested him, too. </sentence><sentence id="1154">But that was after we left. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Before we left, he was still around, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And he had organized -- the children were in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1157">There was a camp in Batik, the outskirts of Batik, that the children in the camp can get out and be kept by a family, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1158">So he had a little boy, too: Padova (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1159">I cannot remember his first name, but his last name was Padova. </sentence><sentence id="1160">And his parents were deported, and he stayed with us. </sentence><sentence id="1161">But at night the rabbi had a place where they all -- all these kids were sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="1162">They were in our house in daytime; they came home from school, came to our house. </sentence><sentence id="1163">We fed them and we did their homework with them. </sentence><sentence id="1164">We took care of them like a child of our family, and when Padova, the little boy, he was about 11 -- when he noticed that we were going to leave, when he heard that, he begged us to take him with us. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And we went to the rabbi and told him everything. </sentence><sentence id="1166">What should we do? </sentence><sentence id="1167">And he said, "You cannot take him with you. </sentence><sentence id="1168">If you take Padova, all the children will be arrested." </sentence><sentence id="1169">We still were at that time following the orders because we thought -- we never thought that they were all going to be killed anyway, so what's the difference? </sentence><sentence id="1170">You know, at least you've saved one. </sentence><sentence id="1171">But we didn't understand that, we had no idea what was. </sentence><sentence id="1172">We knew it was bad, but we never imagined how bad it was at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1173">It was impossible to imagine that. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Until the end of the war, we never knew what was going on, even if my own sister was deported. </sentence><sentence id="1175">We never knew. </sentence><sentence id="1176">So that was -- but before Padova, the story of Padova that was just when we left. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Before that my sister was arrested at home at dinnertime because she had done things for the underground, but personally we never belonged to the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1178">We never belonged to Reseau, what we call it, Reseau. </sentence><sentence id="1179">That means a group of underground. </sentence><sentence id="1180">But we did a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="1181">For example, we didn't even know where they came from, but people would ring our bell and say, "We know that you -- we have heard that you can help us cross the water." </sentence><sentence id="1182">So we helped them cross the water by sending them to a farmer where my brother had crossed the second time, my two brothers had crossed and successfully. </sentence><sentence id="1183">That farmer in -- I don't remember the village where he was, but that farmer had a farm which was ascribed both lines. </sentence><sentence id="1184">You know, you could go on his land you went on both sides, so it was a very good way to cross. </sentence><sentence id="1185">I even crossed there in "41, I crossed there to go to see my brother in -- no, not in Arlise. </sentence><sentence id="1186">St. Marie De Mare (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1187">They were just married and my sister-in-law was pregnant, and I went to see them for the summer. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Do you realize that we lived as normally as possible, we did not let these Germans stop us from walking on. </sentence><sentence id="1189">That was after I lost my job. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I think it was after I lost my job in the city hall, and I had not registered. </sentence><sentence id="1191">I had not started nursing school yet. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So that's when that happened, so that was in'41. </sentence><sentence id="1193">And yeah, because my nephew was born in February "42, so -- I've got remember where I was. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1266">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Nothing, they didn't accept any money. </sentence><sentence id="1268">These people did it just to be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And that happened, one of the persons my sister helped, I helped her -- we were both doing it. </sentence><sentence id="1270">But we helped one person cross, and that person had forgotten in our house his tobacco card, which was valuable, very valuable for bartering. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Because if you didn't smoke, then you could barter it for other things. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Food, for other things. </sentence><sentence id="1273">So he wrote to us and asked him to send him the card, and my sister sent him the card through the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="1274">We couldn't communicate with France -- okay, unoccupied France directly, but we sent that to the farmer who sent it on the other side in a mailbox to the south of France. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And that letter was caught, and she did a terrible mistake. </sentence><sentence id="1276">We never understood, she signed her real name which we never did. </sentence><sentence id="1277">We knew as much, that you never signed a letter. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And why did she do it that day? </sentence><sentence id="1279">We don't know, but she signed the letter. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And during the day, the day she was arrested, the farmer's son, one farmer's son came to the house from his farm which was perhaps 12 kilometers from Poitiers, I don't know exactly, by bicycle, to warn us that a German had gotten that letter, had arrested his father and his oldest brother and were questioning them. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And his father didn't know who Stephanie Hoffnung, so we knew that, so we didn't even think that she should escape. </sentence><sentence id="1282">You know, she stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And at night at dinnertime, because every night, that was another restriction -- every night after sundown, the Germans would come and make an appeal to see if we were all present. </sentence><sentence id="1284">To make sure we are there every night, the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And that night an SS we had never seen before, a , which means a noncommissioned officer, a horrible looking guy. </sentence><sentence id="1286">He was very taller than I, horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1287">He came with two other guys, two other SS and they arrested my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1288">We were eating, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1289">And Jackie was at the table. </sentence><sentence id="1290">We were eating cherries, we were at the dessert; we were eating cherries. </sentence><sentence id="1291">And Jackie took out -- he was about four, five at the most, I don't remember what age exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1292">About five at the most, he took out the pits and threw them at the Germans, and I looked at him. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And in front of the Germans, I said to him in French, I said, "Jackie, a Frenchman is always polite. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Never doubt that." </sentence><sentence id="1295">I was afraid they kill that kid. </sentence><sentence id="1296">So he didn't do it anymore, but the Germans didn't do anything against him. </sentence><sentence id="1297">But they arrested my sister, they were satisfied with that. </sentence><sentence id="1298">They took her away, and then about two hours later, they came back and arrested my father. </sentence><sentence id="1299">But they released him several hours later, and my father tried to help my sister but there was nothing he could do. </sentence><sentence id="1300">They wanted her to tell them that she had written to that farmer, because that farmer was helping people cross and she said she doesn't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1301">She cannot tell them, she maintained that. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And they told her that she's fresh, and they told my father that they keep her because he raised her bad and she's fresh. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And that's what killed her, because she would absolutely not say anything against the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="1304">She would have died before she did. </sentence><sentence id="1305">She died because of it. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And the farmer was released because they had no proof. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So she was kept in prison for one month. </sentence><sentence id="1308">She became 21 in prison in Pratique on the 10th of July she became 21. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And then she was deported to -- she was moved to - - no, she was first in a camp in Poitiers, in the outskirts of Poitiers there was a camp. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And she was in that camp, and that's why we escaped because we hoped that she could escape, too. </sentence><sentence id="1311">We had arranged help that she could escape because until then, she had several times the opportunity to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And she wouldn't because she was organizing everything of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1313">In prison, too, she had been a leader. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Prisoners who were not Jewish came to see us after they were released, political prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And they told us what a great leader she is and how she kept morale of everybody up, and that she, you know, organized the prison, how to behave in prison. </sentence><sentence id="1316">How to do everything. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And she did the same, she was the most educated in that camp, as much as I can tell and she took over the whole organization. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And she told us, because we have the guard who we knew very well. </sentence><sentence id="1319">He was one of the kids who had walked with us to the station. </sentence><sentence id="1320">You know, when we helped the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And we were very, very friendly, and he accepted her to make her escape, but she said she couldn't do that because of the people would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="1322">The Germans always told them if they tried to escape, they would kill her. </sentence><sentence id="1323">But the guards were French, the Germans came in only every morning. </sentence><sentence id="1324">But at night there was no guard -- no German, so the French guard wanted to make her escape and he would have escaped with her, not to be arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1325">But she refused them, but later she understood what mistake it was. </sentence><sentence id="1326">But then I had organized everything; she was a medical student. </sentence><sentence id="1327">I was a nurse, a student nurse in that hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1328">My fiance was a medical student, and her boyfriend was a medical student, all in that same university. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And all my classmates were ready to help, everybody helped us there. </sentence><sentence id="1330">First, when I was accepted in that school, nobody -- when I told them, you know, I'm Jewish, they said, "Who cares? </sentence><sentence id="1331">That has no meaning for us." </sentence><sentence id="1332">You know, the French administration, the directors of the school, the picture I showed you earlier of my classmates, the directors of the school and our instructor in that picture, too. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And they said, "We couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="1334">You are French person. </sentence><sentence id="1335">You want to come in nursing school, you come in nursing school." </sentence><sentence id="1336">And they accepted me, and I was protected there. </sentence><sentence id="1337">When Germans came to arrest patients, it was Catholic nuns who directed the transport. </sentence><sentence id="1338">The school was a Red Cross school, which was separate. </sentence><sentence id="1339">But we all, you know, did all our work, practical work in the hospital, and the hospital of the university was by then at that time completely run by the Catholic nuns. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And the Catholic nuns would be warned if the Germans were arriving and they hid me, so that they don't see me. </sentence><sentence id="1341">Because the director of the hospital said to me, "You are not going to wear the yellow star in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I don't want to see it." </sentence><sentence id="1343">And I didn't wear it, but they knew that they would arrest me because I don't wear it. </sentence><sentence id="1344">That was already the best punishment, just for that. </sentence><sentence id="1345">So they hid me every time that the Germans came to arrest people, take them to the stations in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1346">You know, old people, young people, whatever they -- whoever they wanted, not just Jews but whoever they felt they should arrest. </sentence><sentence id="1347">It was enough that somebody tell them it's a Communist, even if it was absolutely not true, then they would arrest. </sentence><sentence id="1348">But my sister then she -- we had arranged, I had seen one of the doctors at the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1349">And we had arranged that she wasn't feeling well, she had a kidney problem, a serious kidney problem and he knew that. </sentence><sentence id="1350">So I had discussed that with him, and he agreed that if she is coming to the hospital the morning we were escaping, then he would treat -- the hospital and then he didn't know anything else, but all my classmates, her boyfriend -- my fiance said -- as soon she arrives in the hospital, they get her out and get her across the border. </sentence><sentence id="1351">But unfortunately, the morning she was supposed to be there, she was supposed to go to the hospital, the little SS came. </sentence><sentence id="1352">And when he -- you Ametz appealed to her to stand there for hours. </sentence><sentence id="1353">He -- seven people were on the side to go to the hospital, and he said to them, "Nobody goes to the hospital." </sentence><sentence id="1354">That was a combination, because after that they knew we had gone, so then she had no more chance. </sentence><sentence id="1355">So that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1356">So from the camp of Poitiers, she was later sent to Drancy, and from Drancy she was sent to Pithiviers, which is between Paris and Orleans. </sentence><sentence id="1357">And from Pithiviers, she was deported on the day of Yom Kippur, 8-42 to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1358">And we know she went to Auschwitz because I have the book saying that her convoy went to Auschwitz in three days. </sentence><sentence id="1359">And we got cards; after the war was finished, her boyfriend had received a card that she had smuggled out on the day of Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="1360">It was a nurse of the camp, and the card said she couldn't write to us. </sentence><sentence id="1361">But she wrote to him, and he was in Poitiers. </sentence><sentence id="1362">And she -- which isn't very far from Pithiviers, and that card -- he gave me that card when he met me after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1363">And in that card, she told that they are leaving, the morale excellent. </sentence><sentence id="1364">They prayed and fasted all day on Yom Kippur; they didn't know how much fasting they would do afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And she was deported that day. </sentence><sentence id="1366">She wrote to us that she would try by all means, we had the code to make little points on those certain letters. </sentence><sentence id="1367">The Germans, if they had found the card with that, would have absolutely known what the code means. </sentence><sentence id="1368">They would have broken the code in no time, but she wrote, "I will sabotage my work as much as I can." </sentence><sentence id="1369">She didn't realize, we didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1370">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1371">But anyway, she was deported, but in between we decided to leave so that she can escape. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And because that things were getting worse and worse, so we knew it was time. </sentence><sentence id="1373">It was right after I was a graduate of the first year of nursing, and all my classmates helped. </sentence><sentence id="1374">Everybody helped. </sentence><sentence id="1375">My fiance helped. </sentence><sentence id="1376">The neighbors helped, they came and took our belongings out of the house with their bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="1377">We got everything back after the war, but one family didn't -- was not honest. </sentence><sentence id="1378">But, otherwise, they all would give us back everything we left. </sentence><sentence id="1379">You know, all that was risking their lives, and the night before we left -- oh, I have first to talk about something else. </sentence><sentence id="1380">Several weeks earlier, a man I had worked with at the city hall, I knew him but not very much. </sentence><sentence id="1381">His name is Albert Charpentier, C-h-a-r-p-e-n-t-i-e-r, and his wife, I have paper here telling me the name of his wife who died, too, now. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And not -- his son, but I can show you the paper later. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And it said Mr. Charpentier came to the house and told me -- because he knew me -- and said, "I know that you need peoples without those damn Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1384">Because on top of it, all of our identity cards had the stamp Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1385">So he said, "I have to" -- "I can give you cards for everybody in your family." </sentence><sentence id="1386">And I asked him how much it would cost, and his response was to say, "How can you ask me how much it can cost? </sentence><sentence id="1387">Such a thing, you don't pay for. </sentence><sentence id="1388">I do it because that's what I believe in." </sentence><sentence id="1389">And he was a poor man, he was not a rich man at all at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And he did it, he gave us cards and that's why we could escape. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Because as long we had the Jew stamped, we could not walk anywhere, couldn't go out of the city. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So he saved the life of my whole family, and for -- he didn't -- but I have to say that. </sentence><sentence id="1393">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="1394">That Mr. Charpentier since he was very young had worked for one of the three or four Jewish families who lived in Poitiers for a long time and had a store. </sentence><sentence id="1395">And he was there, and he loved them because they had always been extremely nice to him. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And he told me how I will never forget what the Forshan (ph), that's the name of the Jewish family, who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1397">They were not deported. </sentence><sentence id="1398">What's -- undoubtedly, he did cards for them, too. </sentence><sentence id="1399">Never asked, but the Forshan, I'll never forget what they did for me and my family and what I can do for Jews, you're all French and I will do that for you peoples. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I want you to be safe. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I cannot accept that that will be. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And that's what we heard. </sentence><sentence id="1403">You know, when we walked in the street when we start to wear the star, old men -- very proper old men, you know, because they used to love the little nobility in Poitiers. </sentence><sentence id="1404">I told you it's a very backwoods country, very right wing. </sentence><sentence id="1405">They would cross the street towards us to come on your side. </sentence><sentence id="1406">They salute us and say, "We do not agree." </sentence><sentence id="1407">Constantly, it was not just an accident;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1753">Q: One other question before you continue: I'm curious what the French attitude was toward the Vichy government? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1755">A: Oh, that's very important. </sentence><sentence id="1756">In the very beginning, very beginning, Vichy -- Petain was considered like a god. </sentence><sentence id="1757">You know, he was a hero of first world war. </sentence><sentence id="1758">I cannot stand him, and I know why he was a hero. </sentence><sentence id="1759">His main reason to be a hero is because there were riots in the trenches and he had the people shot. </sentence><sentence id="1760">You know, the people rioting, the people who were rioting in the trenches for so many years. </sentence><sentence id="1761">And instead of trying to make life easier, he just had shot certain number of them, and that riot was over, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1762">He became a hero due to that; that's not a hero for me as a general. </sentence><sentence id="1763">He was not as specific -- Jaffa and Frisch were not better generals than he was. </sentence><sentence id="1764">But I talk about names that people in America don't know much about. </sentence><sentence id="1765">These were our big generals for World War I, but Petain had a reputation. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And, you know, once people believe in a man, they think he cannot do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1767">So in the beginning, he confused many, many French people who thought that they had to go along with Petain. </sentence><sentence id="1768">But slowly, slowly people start to understand, mostly when the Germans behaved like that in occupied France, how horrible that was. </sentence><sentence id="1769">And in unoccupied France, and then anyway, in "42 I think November if I remember, once were in unoccupied France, once the Americans landed in North Africa, all France was occupied, even the South of France. </sentence><sentence id="1770">Everything was occupied by the Germans, but they never, never were able to make the same orders in the north. </sentence><sentence id="1771">We had identity cards for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1772">I didn't and my family didn't anymore because we had changed our cards. </sentence><sentence id="1773">But I think that that's what is ahead, I cannot even -- I am not even sure that they have to stamp Jew, but I think. </sentence><sentence id="1774">But nobody, nobody ever wore a yellow star in the South of France. </sentence><sentence id="1775">Even after the Germans were there, nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1776">We were not deprived of going in stores. </sentence><sentence id="1777">We had nothing of this type of restrictions, but the Jews were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1778">And some elements in the police helped the Germans because of Vichy, because Vichy gave them the orders and they were the bosses. </sentence><sentence id="1779">And, you know, when you are somebody who's under these type of bosses, many people do what they are told to do even if they don't completely agree. </sentence><sentence id="1780">Now, there were many who did not agree and helped the Jews and the other people. </sentence><sentence id="1781">There were not only Jews that were arrested in the South of France. </sentence><sentence id="1782">The regular citizens were arrested, too. </sentence><sentence id="1783">But anyway, that's another question. </sentence><sentence id="1784">But the country [tape skipped]. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1816">Q: Until? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1818">A: Until they started to believe in the De Gaulle. </sentence><sentence id="1819">You know, De Gaulle saved us. </sentence><sentence id="1820">By going to England and by making that marvelous speech. </sentence><sentence id="1821">By making that marvelous speech, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1822">"France has lost the battle, but has not lost the war," something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1823">I cannot repeat word by word. </sentence><sentence id="1824">Something that is -- and after that, the French started to think. </sentence><sentence id="1825">And then when the Germans were starting to have covered Russia, they became much worse with the whole French population, then a lot of French people started to convert completely and forget about Vichy and not want to have anything to do with the pope. </sentence><sentence id="1826">You know, and help the other side, but it took a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1827">Because it's so difficult when somebody you believe in takes a command and says that's the right thing. </sentence><sentence id="1828">You know, in every country you will have that. </sentence><sentence id="1829">Even now here, if Clinton says something about -- let's see, about a bomb having exploded by terrorists, in the beginning everybody would follow him. </sentence><sentence id="1830">And then slowly some people would criticize him if he goes too far and gives too many plastic orders. </sentence><sentence id="1831">You know, that's what you have to see how things go in context. </sentence><sentence id="1832">It's very complicated. </sentence><sentence id="1833">But, for example, the class I was in called . </sentence><sentence id="1834">AndI told my classmates I don't believe in , but they were horrified. " </sentence><sentence id="1835">How can you not believe in ?" [ </sentence><sentence id="1836">was the only Jewish student there, and they accepted me very well. </sentence><sentence id="1837">But at the same time, they said, "How -- it's so difficult to be a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="1838">To take care of patients. </sentence><sentence id="1839">To be completely at the service of patients. </sentence><sentence id="1840">It's so difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1841">How can somebody who is not Christian," they asked me, "do that?" </sentence><sentence id="1842">And I said, "Don't you realize that Jews have high morals, too?" </sentence><sentence id="1843">And I knew a lot about religion because my grandfather and my brother taught me a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1844">And I said, "The moral questions, we believe in the same things as you do." </sentence><sentence id="1845">And I tell them always, "Don't you realize that Jesus was Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="1846">And, you know, French people didn't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="1847">It wasn't told to French kids at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1848">Even later the Catholic Church 99 percent -- 97 percent of the population is Catholic, and the Catholic Church did not teach that at the time, that Jesus was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1849">It was written in every church, you know, Jesus, the King of Judea, but they didn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1850">Because they put it in Latin so people didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="1851">So it's a very complicated thing, but slowly the French people took hold of them, and they understood how hard it was to accept that the Germans do whatever they want. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And the more the German became, the more the French felt. </sentence><sentence id="1853">When I say "the French," I mean the majority of French. </sentence><sentence id="1854">I don't mean the whole country. </sentence><sentence id="1855">There was always an element who went along with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1856">The Milles, for example. </sentence><sentence id="1857">You know, the Milles was like a militia, but the Milles was an army of French people who were for Petain, and they followed the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1858">They went even to fight with the Germans in Russia, that was a good thing. </sentence><sentence id="1859">Anyway, do you want me to go back to when I left Poitiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1903">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1904">Ihave one other question that may not relevant at this point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1907">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="1908">Go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1911">Q: During this period, you were trying to help people and life wasn't very easy for you either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1913">Did you notice any difference between a man or a woman that was advantageous or was just advantageous for them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1914">A: We always felt at that time that men was much more in danger than we were. </sentence><sentence id="1915">The Jewish men. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And all of the men, we thought so. </sentence><sentence id="1917">But in reality, the Germans arrested the woman and tortured and killed the women the same way -- and children, as men. </sentence><sentence id="1918">So that was, you know, at that time we had still ideas that army, the soldiers are killed. </sentence><sentence id="1919">The men are killed, but women or civilian are not touched. </sentence><sentence id="1920">But that wasn't true at all. </sentence><sentence id="1921">We learned very fast that that didn't apply. </sentence><sentence id="1922">So it was a general condition for everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1932">Q: Being a woman, was it easier to do some of your rescue work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1934">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1935">No, because many men did it, too. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Many men. </sentence><sentence id="1937">And when we left, men helped us. </sentence><sentence id="1938">So I don't think it was easier, and it was -- just happened who was a woman and who    was a man and was in a situation to help. </sentence><sentence id="1939">I don't think there was a question of gender there. </sentence><sentence id="1940">I don't believe that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1949">Q: Tell me about your escape and who all went with you and how you traveled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1951">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1952">When we decided that my sister was going to try to escape the next day from the hospital and we had to leave, so we made plans to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And everything, like I told you before, was taken out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And we were going just to sleep there. </sentence><sentence id="1955">It was a big house in the center of town. </sentence><sentence id="1956">And at that time, that's where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="1957">But it was furnished, we had no furniture. </sentence><sentence id="1958">We had left everything in the east, so we had to rent a house with furniture. </sentence><sentence id="1959">So we had no furniture to move. </sentence><sentence id="1960">We moved only our personal belongings, and then my whole class -- we were 9 or 10 -- 10, I think classmates, they all helped. </sentence><sentence id="1961">They all knew I was going to leave and they all helped. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And one of the classmates, her cousin was a priest with one of the parishes. </sentence><sentence id="1963">So the St. Segondia -- that's spelled S-t. for saint. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And Segondia, S-e-g-o-n-d-i-a. It's a small, I don't know if you call that a village or town, it was either a village or town near the border. </sentence><sentence id="1965">Closer to -- the border was in the village or next to the village, and they told me to go to that priest. </sentence><sentence id="1966">So we all got -- but the night before, one of my classmates, Odile Dae Moril. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Her first name is Odile, O-d-i-l-e.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4164">A: Yes, and I told them, "Don't shoot. </sentence><sentence id="4165">Call your officer," because I knew that they always had an officer. </sentence><sentence id="4166">But I didn't know who they were. </sentence><sentence id="4167">And then they called their office, and I said to him, "Why was I arrested?" </sentence><sentence id="4168">And he said, "Because you walked into here. </sentence><sentence id="4169">What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="4170">And I said, "Okay, I don't what you are, but call Colonel Bouvet immediately in such-and-such unit," and I gave him the phone number," and tell that I'm with you." </sentence><sentence id="4171">And he said, "Colonel Bouvet, how do know him?" </sentence><sentence id="4172">And I said, "But I know him." </sentence><sentence id="4173">And then I looked at him and I said, "Are you from that unit?" </sentence><sentence id="4174">And he said, "Sure." </sentence><sentence id="4175">And I said, "You were the people who were supposed to protect me and you arrest me?" </sentence><sentence id="4176">And he said, "But you were not walking on the right little passageway. </sentence><sentence id="4177">You were walking one below." </sentence><sentence id="4178">You know, they are on the hill, there are several. </sentence><sentence id="4179">And in the night, the guide took me there. </sentence><sentence id="4180">He was an Alsatian from the Barrier, but in the night he made a mistake and put me on the wrong passageway. </sentence><sentence id="4181">So I was arrested and then the Germans saw it because they were just a few paces away, but they didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="4182">They want to see what was going on, and they took me back to the headquarters where I was debriefed and I told them what everything I saw which was very important things I saw. </sentence><sentence id="4183">Where resistance was -- do you know, where the Germans had posts in our area where they were watching us and reporting. </sentence><sentence id="4184">But it was such a big mountain, you can have a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="4185">So I gave all the information, but I was terribly upset that I had been arrested by the French. </sentence><sentence id="4186">And top of it, I could have been shot. </sentence><sentence id="4187">They were absolutely ready to do it if I hadn't defended myself. </sentence><sentence id="4188">But I had been told how to react to people, you know, what to do in case I was in danger. </sentence><sentence id="4189">That was one the premiums you get, how you survive in such cases. </sentence><sentence id="4190">So I came back -- first, I was debriefed by another unit and by intelligence, and then I went back to Colonel Bouvet. </sentence><sentence id="4191">After that they tried 13 times to make me cross, 13 other times. </sentence><sentence id="4192">That was bungled purposely, but the Captain who was the chief of the unit who took me there, he could not accept that his mission was not done right. </sentence><sentence id="4193">So he said that I got confused and went on the wrong passageway. </sentence><sentence id="4194">And I had a terrible fight with him, and I said absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="4195">And the guide said, "Look, that's enough. </sentence><sentence id="4196">No, I made the mistake." </sentence><sentence id="4197">So that was okay, but the Captain and I, we were not on the best terms after that. </sentence><sentence id="4198">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4234">Q: Did you and this officer havea... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4236">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4237">Right. </sentence><sentence id="4238">But after that I tried 13 times to cross, and the second time they let me go ina big field and they were shooting, you know, tracers all over. </sentence><sentence id="4239">And it was night, it was always at night, and that was perhaps a week later or 10 days later. </sentence><sentence id="4240">And then they let me go and they go this way, but they didn't give me any indication, do you know, a real indication what I should do, and then you will find the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4241">And I walked around at night, I walked in circles. </sentence><sentence id="4242">And I heard dogs barking everywhere, but I didn't know where the dogs were, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4243">And I walked in circles, and they didn't tell me there was a canal there. </sentence><sentence id="4244">And I fell in the canal, never even caught a cold, nothing, I walked all the rest of the night in my wet clothes and I never caught a cold. </sentence><sentence id="4245">There was -- you know, you live under such hype that nothing happens to you. </sentence><sentence id="4246">But anyway, I walked all morning -- all night, and couldn't find my way because there was snow, there was a canal. </sentence><sentence id="4247">There was dog barkings and I didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="4248">They had not given me good indications what road to go, how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="4249">And toward the morning when it started to be light, I saw a whole unit of tanks with soldiers coming on the road a little far away. </sentence><sentence id="4250">Quite far away. </sentence><sentence id="4251">And I thought it was the Germans, so I walked toward them. </sentence><sentence id="4252">And when I approached, they were speaking French. </sentence><sentence id="4253">So they were -- so I was -- but these ones did not try to harm me. </sentence><sentence id="4254">Because immediately the officer took me aside and said, "What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="4255">And I explained to him, and he got in touch with my unit and they came and got me. </sentence><sentence id="4256">But 12 more times -- but most of the time it was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="4257">One night they wanted me to cross the River Rhine, swimming in wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="4258">I would have died of hyperthermia before I crossed even half of the river. </sentence><sentence id="4259">It was so stupid, I said, "That is impossible." </sentence><sentence id="4260">Any girl would not survive such a swimming. </sentence><sentence id="4261">That is impossible, I couldn't explain that I'd do that. </sentence><sentence id="4262">No German could believe so much, you know, that the girls would swim in plain winter through Rhine. </sentence><sentence id="4263">So I said that I didn't accept. </sentence><sentence id="4264">And then the 15th time or the 13th time -- I think it's the 15th time, I finally made it. </sentence><sentence id="4265">But that was well organized -- well, I was sent to Germany through Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4266">And it's a Swiss agent who picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="4267">I was taken by my unit to Basel, you know, to Switzerland? </sentence><sentence id="4268">And in Basel, I was met by a Swiss agent who took me to Sachsenhausen which is not very far. </sentence><sentence id="4269">And in Sachsenhausen there is a little enclave, the German road passes near a field which is Swiss, and there is a little -- I remember how it looked and there was a forrest to the left. </sentence><sentence id="4270">The road in front of us and to the right was a little enclave -- is a fence. </sentence><sentence id="4271">And the Swiss spent all day with me there, and he was -- for me, was an old man. </sentence><sentence id="4272">He was God know, he was near his 50s, perhaps late 40s. </sentence><sentence id="4273">For me, he looked very old. </sentence><sentence id="4274">And he said to me, "Listen, you are surely going to die. </sentence><sentence id="4275">Why don't we sleep together? </sentence><sentence id="4276">Why don't we have a good time?" </sentence><sentence id="4277">And I told him, "Why don't you go and jump in the river? </sentence><sentence id="4278">But I'm not going to do such a thing." </sentence><sentence id="4279">I had no intention of dying and no intention of sleeping with him. </sentence><sentence id="4280">And he cried, but -- and then he told me -- but he was very decent in that way. </sentence><sentence id="4281">He did not assault me or anything. </sentence><sentence id="4282">He tried verbally to entice me, and his way of enticing me was not very enticing anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4283">But anyway, towards the evening, towards dusk, I lie down in the field very close to the road. </sentence><sentence id="4284">And I had white knee socks on, and I had the impression that the whole German Army could see my white socks, do you know? </sentence><sentence id="4285">You wouldn't believe in what terror I was. </sentence><sentence id="4286">It was absolute terror, I could not move. </sentence><sentence id="4287">And I think how did I -- what did I get into such a predicament? </sentence><sentence id="4288">How can | do it? </sentence><sentence id="4289">I cannot do it. </sentence><sentence id="4290">And I stayed there quietly, I couldn't bring myself to do it. </sentence><sentence id="4291">And at one point, I said I have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="4292">No way. </sentence><sentence id="4293">And I remembered that that Captain who was Captain Mollet, M-o-1-l-e-t, had said that I had bungled because I had got confused. </sentence><sentence id="4294">And that made me do it, and when I came back, I told him that. </sentence><sentence id="4295">Boy, was he feeling -- was he embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="4296">In front of everybody I told him of the whole, you know, all the officers of the unit. </sentence><sentence id="4297">But anyway, I finally stood up, walked to the road and there were two Germans, sentinels, who were crossing each other. </sentence><sentence id="4298">So I walked to -- but were never -- you know, I waited until I see that, and I walked there and I met him. </sentence><sentence id="4299">I said, "Heil, Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="4300">And he said, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="4301">I said, "To Helsinger," which was a city there, or a little town very close. </sentence><sentence id="4302">I don't remember how big that was, very close to that, walking distance, but at night and I walked there and he didn't bother me. </sentence><sentence id="4303">He didn't ask for papers, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="4304">But I had identify papers of the German , and my name was Marthe Ulrich, U-I-r-i-c-h. Unfortunately, 1 lost all these papers, I don't know where they are. </sentence><sentence id="4305">They must be somewhere, but I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="4306">I looked for them, and I didn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="4307">And I had these papers, and I had coupons for food and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="4308">And I had all places where to go. </sentence><sentence id="4309">The first one was in Sink, that's why I walked to Sink. </sentence><sentence id="4310">And it was a young -- somebody gave me a recommendation for that family, but they never knew who I was and what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="4311">But I knocked at the door, it was quiet, it was 10 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="4312">Knocked at the door, and they opened -- the woman opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="4313">Her husband was in the Army... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4400">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4401">I knocked at the door and she opened the door, and she said, "Who are you?" </sentence><sentence id="4402">And I told her that such-as-such person -- I don't remember who it was -- recommended me, who was a good friend of hers. </sentence><sentence id="4403">That he had told me that I could come to her house and get a room there. </sentence><sentence id="4404">That she would, you know, take me in. </sentence><sentence id="4405">And she did and she was very nice about it. </sentence><sentence id="4406">And the next day, she said to me, "I notice" -- because underneath my socks, my white socks, I had silk socks, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4407">She noticed they were all torn. " </sentence><sentence id="4408">What happened to you?" </sentence><sentence id="4409">And she said to me, "Did you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4420">Q: We need to stop the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4422">A: She had noticed that my silk -- at that time, we had no pantyhose, but silk stockings were completely torn. </sentence><sentence id="4423">So she said to me, "What happened?" </sentence><sentence id="4424">I said, "I fell," because Helsinger was -- and she told me, you know, "We have so many worries about spies coming over from Switzerland, when I saw your torn socks, stockings, I was afraid of something like that." </sentence><sentence id="4425">And I start laughing and said, "Do I look like a spy?" </sentence><sentence id="4426">No, I had to absolutely get out of that. </sentence><sentence id="4427">And she said, "No, really you don't." </sentence><sentence id="4428">And I said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="4429">I'm not one. </sentence><sentence id="4430">I'ma good German." </sentence><sentence id="4431">So that's how I got out of that. </sentence><sentence id="4432">So I stayed with them about two or three days, and then by train, I went to Freiburg which is northwest of Helsinger, and that's not too far from the Rhine, Freiburg. </sentence><sentence id="4433">And that's in Germany, not in Switzerland, but there's a Fribourg in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4434">And I arrived in Freiburg, and there I had an address, too, to go where a young Alsatian doctor who had been in Germany had lived with that family, with a man and woman. </sentence><sentence id="4435">And he -- they were very good friends, and he told me to -- oh, I never met him. </sentence><sentence id="4436">But soon my unit, I knew that he accepted to send me there. </sentence><sentence id="4437">So I said I came from him, and I had papers from him. </sentence><sentence id="4438">I had some proof that he had, you know, that I had a husband. </sentence><sentence id="4439">That he had written me a letter or something. </sentence><sentence id="4440">So they accepted me very well, and they never questioned me. </sentence><sentence id="4441">And -- but I had another address in Freiburg of the doctor who was Alsatian, and his father wasin___and he asked -- he knew that somebody was going to go to Germany on a mission. </sentence><sentence id="4442">And he asked if they would go and see him so that he can help me so he can possibly return to France. </sentence><sentence id="4443">Because he had married a German woman and stayed in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4444">He was Alsatian. </sentence><sentence id="4445">And I went to see him, and that was terrible fiasco. </sentence><sentence id="4446">Because the guy absolutely -- he said, "I am married to German." </sentence><sentence id="4447">I told him, I was told to tell him what I was doing there. </sentence><sentence id="4448">But his father -- I didn't meet his father again, the father gave the instructions that what I should tell him. </sentence><sentence id="4449">And I told him, "I will help you go back to France. </sentence><sentence id="4450">You know, the war will be soon over. </sentence><sentence id="4451">It's just a question of days now, and I can help you go back to France if you help me. </sentence><sentence id="4452">Give me information about what's going on here. </sentence><sentence id="4453">Military information." </sentence><sentence id="4454">And he said to me, "Oh, how can I do that? </sentence><sentence id="4455">I'm married to a German citizen. </sentence><sentence id="4456">I cannot do that, absolutely." </sentence><sentence id="4457">And then he said, "Where are you staying?" </sentence><sentence id="4458">And I said, "I have no address yet. </sentence><sentence id="4459">I have not found yet anywhere to stay. </sentence><sentence id="4460">I am going to probably travel right away." </sentence><sentence id="4461">I was afraid of him, I was terrified. </sentence><sentence id="4462">I wanted to get out of there, so I got out as soon as possible and took all kinds of tours to make sure that I'm not followed. </sentence><sentence id="4463">But I was never followed. </sentence><sentence id="4464">And when the French Army came in Freiburg later, quite later, he looked for me and wanted me to help him go back to France. </sentence><sentence id="4465">But I did not accept to meet him, I refused because he had not helped me. </sentence><sentence id="4466">He was very atrocious, he would have had arrested me, had he known where to find me. </sentence><sentence id="4467">I understood that, and I stayed away from him. </sentence><sentence id="4468">But I found other people who helped and they would give me information. </sentence><sentence id="4469">The girls, Alsatian girls were in the German Army and were dying to go home. </sentence><sentence id="4470">And, you know, I could tell them that I can help them go home, if they help me. </sentence><sentence id="4471">And that was a great help. </sentence><sentence id="4472">It was the last few weeks of the war. </sentence><sentence id="4473">Three weeks, two weeks, I don't remember exactly. </sentence><sentence id="4474">Three weeks about. </sentence><sentence id="4475">When I came to Germany, | think I was there about three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4476">But -- and then in Freiburg, I had another address to go outside of Freiburg to a certain place I cannot remember, which extremely close to the Siegfried line. </sentence><sentence id="4477">And the last village near the Siegfried line. </sentence><sentence id="4478">You could just walk there, 300 yards and you were in the Siegfried line. </sentence><sentence id="4479">And I went to that doctor, there was another doctor who I was told to go to. </sentence><sentence id="4480">But he wasn't home, and his wife, which was probably very good, but the maid, they fed me because I was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="4481">I was walking all the time, and I didn't know where to stop, so I was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="4482">But when she asked me, "Would you like something to eat?" </sentence><sentence id="4483">I said, "Yes," when I told her I want to see her employer. </sentence><sentence id="4484">But walking towards that village, I was with a group of people. </sentence><sentence id="4485">Women and there was one non-commissioned officer, an SS, little guy, too. </sentence><sentence id="4486">Very little guy. </sentence><sentence id="4487">And he was talking about, you know, all the things the SS do. </sentence><sentence id="4488">How much they do and how they hate the Jews and how they hate the Poles and how they hate the Russians and what they do to these people. </sentence><sentence id="4489">He was talking openly about it, and then suddenly he fainted. </sentence><sentence id="4490">He was coming back, he told us that he had been wounded and just came back to Zurich, and he fainted. </sentence><sentence id="4491">And I was a German nurse, so I took care of him. </sentence><sentence id="4492">So when he came back to it, he was very grateful, you know, that I had been so nice to him. </sentence><sentence id="4493">And we became best friends, even if he told me that he could smell a Jew at miles; he had told me. </sentence><sentence id="4494">And he told me any time I want to come to the Siegfried line to visit him, he would be delighted and he would introduce me to all his friends. </sentence><sentence id="4495">And he gave me his address and told me how to get there. </sentence><sentence id="4496">So the day -- I was Freiburg a few days, but then I went back somewhere else, but I cannot remember. </sentence><sentence id="4497">I traveled and I was in a bus one day. </sentence><sentence id="4498">And in that bus -- but that was in the Offenburg. </sentence><sentence id="4499">I think that was near, not too far from Freiburg, but just a distance. </sentence><sentence id="4500">Because I was afraid to take trains, and I went, you know, I went with military transports. </sentence><sentence id="4501">But they took you, as they took the civilians because they knew that it was very little -- there was very little communication. </sentence><sentence id="4502">You couldn't travel very easily. </sentence><sentence id="4503">And the Americans were always bombarding, but I was so lucky before I entered the city, they bombarded the city. </sentence><sentence id="4504">When I left, they started bombarding the city. </sentence><sentence id="4505">But I was there, I was never under bombardment of the Americans, which was good because boy, did they destroy things. </sentence><sentence id="4506">And then I went to that Offenburg, and I was in a bus going somewhere and -- because the transport had told me to say goodbye to the south, to go up the Swiss border where I wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="4507">But they took me to Offenburg to a complete different section. </sentence><sentence id="4508">And we were in the -- I remember now. </sentence><sentence id="4509">We were in the truck all night, and it was freezing. </sentence><sentence id="4510">You know, on the bed of the truck in the back, it was freezing. </sentence><sentence id="4511">We were absolutely frozen. </sentence><sentence id="4512">It was in winter in Germany in the forrest, and we arrived early morning in a place where the convoy stopped. </sentence><sentence id="4513">So we went out of the convoy. </sentence><sentence id="4514">There were seven civilians, and we were lying in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="4515">And then planes came over, American planes, but they didn't bombard. </sentence><sentence id="4516">I was there, so they didn't bombard. </sentence><sentence id="4517">And I fell asleep there, I was so tired that I fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="4518">And suddenly more planes came by, so they shook me up. </sentence><sentence id="4519">You know, the people around me shook me to awake me. </sentence><sentence id="4520">And I was so surprised and I didn't know where I was, and I started to answer in French. </sentence><sentence id="4521">That was quite a thing. </sentence><sentence id="4522">When I realized they were looking at me very strangely, and | said in five minutes I'm arrested. </sentence><sentence id="4523">So I got up and said I needed to go to the bathroom and I run. </sentence><sentence id="4524">And I run to a hole, and I find the milkman who came by with the horse and wagon. </sentence><sentence id="4525">And I stopped him and he took me to the next city. </sentence><sentence id="4526">And that's how I escaped, but I would have been arrested because they looked at me very strangely. </sentence><sentence id="4527">They had to think what they were going to do next. </sentence><sentence id="4528">But that was the only time where I awoke and spoke French, but it's very difficult not to. </sentence><sentence id="4529">And then I took another bus, I don't remember exactly, do you know, the sequence. </sentence><sentence id="4530">But I know I was in another bus, and there was only one non-commissioned officer in that bus. </sentence><sentence id="4531">And all the rest were women, and that commissioned officer started to tell how they treated Russians and Poles in the East. </sentence><sentence id="4532">They were not talking about Jews, that how they treated the Russians and the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="4533">How they assembled the whole people, all the people from one village. </sentence><sentence id="4534">Put them in a square, and start shooting them with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="4535">It's the ach mein, you know, the Germans speak like that. </sentence><sentence id="4536">Ach mein, and slap the side many times and say,"You should have seen running like little mice." </sentence><sentence id="4537">It was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="4538">And I thought that, and everybody -- all the women laughed. </sentence><sentence id="4539">They felt that was very funny. </sentence><sentence id="4540">And I had to laugh with them, I had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="4541">So I didn't laugh too much, but I had to laugh some. </sentence><sentence id="4542">End of Tape 4. </sentence><sentence id="4543">Tape 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4669">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4671">A: One point I wanted to make is that always the German afterwards, after we won the war, always pretended that they did not know, and that's absolutely not true. </sentence><sentence id="4672">They knew it because the soldiers came home and they told the story. </sentence><sentence id="4673">They told about all these barbaric things. </sentence><sentence id="4674">I head it, | was there only three weeks and I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="4675">And how could the people who lived there all the time not hear it? </sentence><sentence id="4676">And I didn't know the people who told me then. </sentence><sentence id="4677">So they boasted about it openly, so that's a big myth that's the Germans did not know. </sentence><sentence id="4678">And I have friends who were in a concentration camp, a young Alsatian, who was later in our unit. </sentence><sentence id="4679">And he said -- he was in Dachau or Buchenwald, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="4680">And he said that when they were taken out on walks to go to the work site every day, there were skeletons, all these people. </sentence><sentence id="4681">And there were barely walking, and people in the town would throw stones at them and beat them. </sentence><sentence id="4682">On top of -- do you know, all the other brutalities? </sentence><sentence id="4683">So these were town people, and they all said, "Oh, we did not know." </sentence><sentence id="4684">You know, one German one day recognized what the Germans did to me, and I shook his hand. </sentence><sentence id="4685">I said, "You are the only honest German I ever met." </sentence><sentence id="4686">It was unbelievable that they absolutely denied the horrible things they all knew they had done. </sentence><sentence id="4687">It was no secret. </sentence><sentence id="4688">It was impossible to have a secret. </sentence><sentence id="4689">So I think that point is very important. </sentence><sentence id="4690">Okay, now I go back to my story. </sentence><sentence id="4691">I don't know where I am. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4717">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4718">Then I came back to Freiburg, and I hope that the French were coming that day. </sentence><sentence id="4719">I knew they were getting close because -- and there Germans with bazooka in corners, you know at every place where they could hide a little bit and waiting for the French. </sentence><sentence id="4720">And I went around, and I was such a good German, and I said, "Oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="4721">I hope nothing will happen to you because you don't know, do you realize I saw them coming from up there? </sentence><sentence id="4722">They have enormous tanks coming." </sentence><sentence id="4723">They have no more tanks, they have nothing, the German tank in Freiburg. </sentence><sentence id="4724">So most of them got down from their post, they got frightened because I told them that. </sentence><sentence id="4725">And then I was in the main street when the first tank came. </sentence><sentence id="4726">French tank -- no, yeah, French. </sentence><sentence id="4727">They were the French. </sentence><sentence id="4728">And I made the V sign like that and stopped it, and I asked that the officer come down. </sentence><sentence id="4729">They had quite a few Germans, prisoners, on the tank all over. </sentence><sentence id="4730">And I told him, "Please come down, I need to talk to you." </sentence><sentence id="4731">And I took him aside and I told him, "I am here. </sentence><sentence id="4732">I am part of the Army. </sentence><sentence id="4733">I'm in the intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="4734">I need to see -- to be taken to the headquarters right now. </sentence><sentence id="4735">I need to go there because I have very important information to give them. </sentence><sentence id="4736">And he took me and I met Commander Petit, Petit, who was the chief -- he was commander or colonel, I don't remember, of the second Division Zaire, that was the regiment. </sentence><sentence id="4737">And that was, too, a regiment from North Africa. </sentence><sentence id="4738">And Colonel Petit first was a little leery about me, you know, when he start to question me. </sentence><sentence id="4739">And he was -- he didn't believe me. </sentence><sentence id="4740">He thought I was making up stories and then he start questioning me. </sentence><sentence id="4741">He had been in intelligence, and I told him what information I had, who to contact, how to contact and then ended story and I was okay. </sentence><sentence id="4742">So I told him the important information I had. </sentence><sentence id="4743">That day, I had gone back to Siegfried line to see my good friend, the little SS, who had invited me to come because I want to see what's going at that Siegfried line. </sentence><sentence id="4744">And when | arrived at the Siegfried line and I inquired about him, they were all leaving. </sentence><sentence id="4745">The Siegfried line was emptying, the French came down, not south but west -- no, east of the Siegfried line. </sentence><sentence id="4746">They did not want to deal with the Siegfried line, but my information was the Siegfried line was empty, not to worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="4747">So that was extremely important military information right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="4748">So Colonel Petit believed me and he sent out, you know, patrols and they found out that the Siegfried line was empty. </sentence><sentence id="4749">So after that, he really believed me. </sentence><sentence id="4750">And I was very well treated, and he said to me, "Do you want me to send you back to your unit?I know where they are located." </sentence><sentence id="4751">He had gotten in touch with them to tell them I was safe, because they didn't know, didn't have any news from me. </sentence><sentence id="4752">And I told him, "No, my mission isn't finished. </sentence><sentence id="4753">I have to go back south." </sentence><sentence id="4754">Because they were coming not south. </sentence><sentence id="4755">The south, nobody was there yet. </sentence><sentence id="4756">So I said, "I go back south tomorrow morning, but I will ask you a favor. </sentence><sentence id="4757">Find me a bicycle because I'm tired of walking." </sentence><sentence id="4758">So he found me a bicycle, and the next morning I left. </sentence><sentence id="4759">And I have papers where he said that for that night, to protect me if somebody attacks me and to go through the French line. </sentence><sentence id="4760">And he said, "Destroy these papers you arrive." </sentence><sentence id="4761">After the French went, I never destroyed it. </sentence><sentence id="4762">I still have them. </sentence><sentence id="4763">You know, saying that I should be protected. </sentence><sentence id="4764">But under the name of Lelotra. </sentence><sentence id="4765">He, too, didn't know my real name, nobody did. </sentence><sentence id="4766">So I left the next morning and went south towards the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="4767">And when I climbed up the mountains in the Black Forest, it was quite high. </sentence><sentence id="4768">And at one point, I was just pushing my bicycle, I couldn't ride it. </sentence><sentence id="4769">It was much too incline, steep. </sentence><sentence id="4770">So a German soldier was walking there. </sentence><sentence id="4771">There were always soldiers all over walking, they didn't know where to go because they didn't know where their units were. </sentence><sentence id="4772">They were completely disorganized by then. </sentence><sentence id="4773">So he said to me, "I push your bike." </sentence><sentence id="4774">So I let him, he pushed my bike up the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="4775">What do I care?Well, I don't need to do that, so I let him. </sentence><sentence id="4776">And we talked and I always talked to them that I was looking for that fiance who was lost, do you know that? </sentence><sentence id="4777">I didn't know where he was. </sentence><sentence id="4778">I always used that, and I told him that I had run away. </sentence><sentence id="4779">And I told that everybody when I got out of Freiburg, when I went south, everybody I met from the Army, I told them what horrible experience that was to see the French Army with black people. </sentence><sentence id="4780">Would you believe that they have black soldiers and a lot of them and they look terrible? </sentence><sentence id="4781">And they're barbaric, I made a big story. </sentence><sentence id="4782">They were all terrified, you know, because they had not more organization. </sentence><sentence id="4783">They were not structured anymore, they had no real defense. </sentence><sentence id="4784">And they were not going to get killed for nothing, so the best thing was to do that and I did a good job at that. </sentence><sentence id="4785">And I told them -- and then I went south toward the border because there I had a family I wanted go to see just near the Swiss border. </sentence><sentence id="4786">But that was the brother-in-law of the daughter, of one of the daughters of that family was in our unit. </sentence><sentence id="4787">And he told me that I can absolutely trust them, not to worry. </sentence><sentence id="4788">They wouldn't even know, they knew already that I was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="4789">So they knew all about me, and they knew that I was from the French Army. </sentence><sentence id="4790">They were very Catholic, Bavaria -- no, Bedouins, you know, from Baden from the territory of Baden and they were very anti-Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="4791">So I went to their house, but before I arrived there, I met a whole group of ambulances who were coming from the north going south, too, and east. </sentence><sentence id="4792">Because once you arrived to south, you have to go east. </sentence><sentence id="4793">You go into [Brest] along the Rhine. </sentence><sentence id="4794">And I asked them what they were doing there, and I told them how terribly unhappy I was that Freiburg was taken by these horrible French and all these blacks and all that I repeated. </sentence><sentence id="4795">They told me, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="4796">It's here, not far." </sentence><sentence id="4797">They told me exactly where, in the forest there is a whole division hidden in the forest and they are going to beat them. </sentence><sentence id="4798">And they told me the names and they told me who they were. </sentence><sentence id="4799">You know, they were so convinced I was such a good German. </sentence><sentence id="4800">And then, I knew that it was imperative to go to that house of the Swiss and to get that information to my partner as fast as possible. </sentence><sentence id="4801">That was vital, and I had no radio. </sentence><sentence id="4802">I had nothing, the only way I was told that I can give important and, you know, rapidly information was to go to the Swiss and tell them that I'm a Swiss agent. </sentence><sentence id="4803">And that's what I intended to do, so I arrived -- I traveled and it was quite a distance. </sentence><sentence id="4804">So at night, very late at night, I arrived in a village, in a square of the village. </sentence><sentence id="4805">And for some reason I never understood, I sat on a bench and I didn't feel like going anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4806">And in a few minutes a man came by and asked me where I was -- what I was doing there. </sentence><sentence id="4807">And I told him that I came from Freiburg, that I escaped the French Army and told him about all that. </sentence><sentence id="4808">And then he said to me, "Don't go this way because you are going to be bothered. </sentence><sentence id="4809">There is a patrol there, and they bother everybody. </sentence><sentence id="4810">They are really a hard group." </sentence><sentence id="4811">Boy, I was very happy to have stopped there. </sentence><sentence id="4812">Do you know, I had always an instinct I cannot go. </sentence><sentence id="4813">And then he told me, "Go to that house near the square. </sentence><sentence id="4814">They are very nice people, and they will give you a bed." </sentence><sentence id="4815">So I went and they really did, they give me a bed. </sentence><sentence id="4816">And I slept there, but very early in the morning I told them I had to be getting up. </sentence><sentence id="4817">And I told them the same story, I always told everybody the same story. </sentence><sentence id="4818">Their husbands were prisoners of war, and they no news. </sentence><sentence id="4819">Or they were killed, they had no news. </sentence><sentence id="4820">But anyway, I left the next morning very early and rode to that Swiss border, to that place where I was going. </sentence><sentence id="4821">And | arrived late in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="4822">It took quite a -- it's quite a distance. </sentence><sentence id="4823">And I had to write that letter for keeping all that information, and I had no time to do it in code. </sentence><sentence id="4824">So I just wrote and the next morning at dawn, the two girls took me to the border which was just a few hundred yards away. </sentence><sentence id="4825">And they were -- you know, between the German and Swiss, and they told me, "Go through the barbed wire." </sentence><sentence id="4826">And they helped me go through. " </sentence><sentence id="4827">Then turn left and you will see a building, that's the Swiss Custom House." </sentence><sentence id="4828">But like many people, left and right, they didn't know the difference. </sentence><sentence id="4829">So I crossed the barbed wire, went up left and then I saw the building and knocked at the door. </sentence><sentence id="4830">It was -- and nobody answered when I looked in, and I saw swastikas; it was a German Custom House. </sentence><sentence id="4831">Luckily they were sleeping, they didn't hear me. </sentence><sentence id="4832">And here my letter in my left pocket with my hand on it, I remember that so well. </sentence><sentence id="4833">And from far away I turned around and said, "Oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="4834">I'm in the German Customs." </sentence><sentence id="4835">And I saw from far away behind a tree a Swiss guy making big swings like that, so I run towards him. </sentence><sentence id="4836">But the Germans never woke, because they could have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="4837">I run towards the Swiss, and he pulled me behind the tree and said, "What are you doing?" </sentence><sentence id="4838">It was a Swiss German, he spoke German only, but I understand him. </sentence><sentence id="4839">You know, he spoke more German than Swiss German to me. </sentence><sentence id="4840">And I said to him, "I'm Swiss intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="4841">I am in the Swiss intelligence, and that letter has to be in Basel at such-and-such office in such-and-such's hands before 11 o'clock this morning." </sentence><sentence id="4842">And he saluted me, he said, "It will be done." </sentence><sentence id="4843">And it was done, and the Swiss took all the information first, they always did. </sentence><sentence id="4844">And then they give it to my unit, and that's one of the things that is written in one of my citations, that I had given that information. </sentence><sentence id="4845">And that was very important information, and it saved many lives. </sentence><sentence id="4846">And then the Swiss said, "What do you want to do?" </sentence><sentence id="4847">And I said, "I return." </sentence><sentence id="4848">He said, "Oh, my, you really want to return there?" </sentence><sentence id="4849">And I said, "I am not finished," so I returned to Germany to that house, but the Germans never saw me. </sentence><sentence id="4850">I don't know how that happened. </sentence><sentence id="4851">What I told you, I'm extremely lucky. </sentence><sentence id="4852">And I went back to the house and I stayed that day, and the next morning, I went -- no, the same afternoon with my bike, I went west -- east. </sentence><sentence id="4853">I went east to see what was going on because I knew they were coming not south, this way, so I went east to see what was going on this way. </sentence><sentence id="4854">And when J arrived at a certain small town, there were a lot of soldiers, of German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="4855">A whole division of them. </sentence><sentence id="4856">And I stopped and talked to them and told them, you know, always my story how I had escaped from Freiburg, from these horrible French. </sentence><sentence id="4857">And I said, "What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="4858">And they said, "Oh, this night we are all going, the whole division is going to go across into Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4859">Because we want to go to Austria, and we would cross Switzerland." </sentence><sentence id="4860">Then I went back along that road, you know, in the south and on the west. </sentence><sentence id="4861">And I met -- | arrived in the village very close to this -- you can go any more west, do you know? </sentence><sentence id="4862">To the end of the road, before you go up north. </sentence><sentence id="4863">So I went out of there with my bike, and when J arrived in the village, there were white flags all over. </sentence><sentence id="4864">And the men said, "Don't go any further. </sentence><sentence id="4865">The French are there in the square." </sentence><sentence id="4866">And I said, "Oh, I am not going to go toward them, no way." </sentence><sentence id="4867">And I run to meet them, and the Germans were horrified when they saw that I was going to them, when I just said, "Oh, don't worry about it." </sentence><sentence id="4868">They were, but they couldn't do anything; they were civilians, they were not Army people. </sentence><sentence id="4869">And the French immediately I went to, to the officer. </sentence><sentence id="4870">He was sitting in a Jeep, and I say, "I want you to take me to your headquarters." </sentence><sentence id="4871">Always the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="4872">And he said to me, "Why would you go to the headquarter?" </sentence><sentence id="4873">I say, "I need to go to the headquarters and talk to your officer." </sentence><sentence id="4874">And then I saw an insignia on his uniform, and I said, "You are a second , aren't you?" </sentence><sentence id="4875">And he said, "Yes," that was the same unit I had met in Freiburg. </sentence><sentence id="4876">I said, "Then take me to Colonel Petit." </sentence><sentence id="4877">And he took me, and Colonel Petit, I don't remember what he was, but Petit was extremely to see me again. </sentence><sentence id="4878">And then I gave him the rest of the information and I told him, "You see, if you go east now, at that village is a whole division, but this night they will go over to Switzerland." </sentence><sentence id="4879">So he sent me immediately with the Jeep to the General, who was a general with one Army, he had one Army and Petit. </sentence><sentence id="4880">And he was called . </sentence><sentence id="4881">That was his -- he always said , which means there are no Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4882">And I was brought to him, and I told him my information. </sentence><sentence id="4883">And he looked at me, he didn't -- nothing was important to him. </sentence><sentence id="4884">He wouldn't believe me or I don't know what. </sentence><sentence id="4885">But anyway, he did not use my information, and he gave orders to attack these Germans, and there were several dead on our side and wounded. </sentence><sentence id="4886">And on their side and it was absolutely a waste of time. </sentence><sentence id="4887">And then the next night -- no, it was that night, they really went into Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4888">But you know what the Swiss did? </sentence><sentence id="4889">The next morning, they gave them all back to as prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="4890">They didn't want them to cross Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4891">We were too close now. </sentence><sentence id="4892">The Swiss have always worked all sides, but at that point, they did not want to do it because we were too close to the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="4893">And we winning, so they had nothing to do with the Germans anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4894">They had helped the Germans very much before, but that's the gist of the story. </sentence><sentence id="4895">Then I met Colonel Petit and I stayed with that unit until the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="4896">Then after that, I rejoined my unit. </sentence><sentence id="4897">So that's how the war -- my mission ended. </sentence></p></dialogue>
