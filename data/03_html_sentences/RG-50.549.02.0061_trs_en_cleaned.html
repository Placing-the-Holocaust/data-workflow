<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Did you ever know why they were questioning you, and what information they wanted to get from you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Yes, it's a big story, I gonna try to -- just to tell you in more details. </sentence><sentence id="142">We had business, all kind of bus -- my parents started actually, with a grocery store, good business. </sentence><sentence id="143">But when my mo -- my oldest brother, Haim, when he was more or less in </sentence></p><p><sentence id="144"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061 6 his 20's, early 20's, and he slowly took over business by our parents, and he always looked at a food store, little grocery store, we could make a living, he made a living, but he couldn't make money all the -- actually for a better life. </sentence><sentence id="145">So he started it, he -- he was a representative -- in our town, small town in Chadbush was four smaller factories. </sentence><sentence id="146">They all produced the same product, more or less, like knives, forks. </sentence><sentence id="147">And the mostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn't the most cheapest actually, tableware, what you can have it. </sentence><sentence id="148">And this used to be shipped to Galeetsia, farther down near the Russian border where we had it. </sentence><sentence id="149">And my brother used to supply raw materials, and apparently, I don't know exactly, but he made always so much percentage on the supplies profit. </sentence><sentence id="150">And this got better and better every time, with more -- and the season mostly in those factories, smaller fat -- f -- smaller factories was about four or five months of the year, where business were real good, and about six, seven months were slack. </sentence><sentence id="151">And they had a rough time to meet payrolls for the workers what they kept on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="152">And my buth -- my brother used to borrow money, actually to those factories, not for a favor, but actually to make some money, too. </sentence><sentence id="153">So they paid so much percentage per month, or whatever, I was not familiar, I was too young to know about business. </sentence><sentence id="154">Then finally he invested in one particular factory, it belongs to a Gentile in out town, his name was Rochinsky. </sentence><sentence id="155">And he had a little bit rough time to repay it, whatever he owed us, so he took -- he proposed my brother to be a partner in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="156">And this went on til war time [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="157">In 1939, when the Germans came in, my brother realized it's another -- a different era already. </sentence><sentence id="158">We -- as being well and everything, but </sentence></p><p><sentence id="159"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061 7 we realized that we shouldn't show that we had any interest in the factory, because we know it, that Jewish property was confiscated right from the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="160">Nobody went down, because before the war, since 1937, my brother send me over to the factory to get the fa-familiar with the procedures, how to deal with the people who worked in the factory, and how to deal with customers who buy -- bought our merchandise; to get familiar with it. </sentence><sentence id="161">But since -- when the Germans came in, this stopped, so my brother said, "Don't mention any more, you stay home like anybody else." </sentence><sentence id="162">And take -- in 19 -- the end of "39, we had to go in to live in a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="163">So we lived in the ghetto, and life got terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations, because rations for Gentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month, but didn't got. </sentence><sentence id="164">So the Black Market was very high. </sentence><sentence id="165">If you want buy a loaf of bread, you have to buy -- you have to pay 10 times the value, and so any other products. </sentence><sentence id="166">Well, life got to get very expensive until 1940. </sentence><sentence id="167">In 1940, they arrested the owner, Rochinsky was arrested for Gestapo, because he was more or less a intelligent person. </sentence><sentence id="168">They had been scared, the Germans didn't trust the more intelligent people. </sentence><sentence id="169">And he was taken in the 40's, to Auschwitz. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="170">After two, three weeks -- we didn't know much about the Auschwitz in 1940, but after two, three weeks, came a telegram that he's not any more alive, and his clothing was sent back to his widow. </sentence><sentence id="171">And my brother said -- we have been three brothers at home, and the oldest brother, he had already like a green band, instead had the white arm band with the Star of David, he used to have a green band with the Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="172">The green band meant actually that you are privileged. </sentence><sentence id="173">A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="174"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061 8 ride the train, or go out after seven o'clock from the ghetto, to be seen on a street. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="175">They had still curfew for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="176">And everywhere, wherever, you couldn't move freely, but if you had a green band, you could ride the train, you had been -- you could move freely, you could go out after seven o'clock actually. </sentence><sentence id="177">And this was a -- of course, the German government required if you would supply some metal products, even scaret of metal. </sentence><sentence id="178">So many pounds, was -- I don't know exactly, they gave you a green band that you are privileged Jew, and you could go more or less freely, wherever you wanted. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">He saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a -- forced to perform some labor for the city, otts -- clean cities, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="180">I was assigned in a quarry, a stone quarry, actually, and was very -- pretty hard work, but it - - in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 hours, I don't know exactly either, how many hours we worked, we could go home and spend with our family at home. </sentence><sentence id="181">This went on, but still my brother said that he going to see a very -- that I get a green band, too, that I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the quarry. </sentence><sentence id="182">True, he had some connections in a larger city with some Jewish, more or less, leaders from the Jewish community, and they had connection, they had been able to bribe Gestapo, and SS. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="183">Bribing, if you gave money or some products what they wanted it, you could get favors from them, and they did it. </sentence><sentence id="184">When my brother arranged the same way, he had to pay money for it, that I will be assigned, to start to be as -- to go every day to labor in the city, that my assignment will be to put in labor in the factory, to work in the factory, to perform labor, whatever it was [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="185">At this time the factory </sentence></p><p><sentence id="186"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061 9 was idle, because Mrs. Rochinsky, she was -- she had three girls, and she was not able to manage a factory, she didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="187">Besides this, when the German came in, they right away, they froze all salaries. </sentence><sentence id="188">Practically anyplace where s -- they had [indecipherable] employees, they couldn't pay any higher wages than -- than pre-war wages. </sentence><sentence id="189">And this was a problem, because whatever they have to buy, food for themselves, even with rations, or you wanted to buy something better, was sayvay four or five times as much as pre-war, [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war. </sentence><sentence id="190">When I -- when I had the permission to go down perform my job in the factory, my brother set me up, that I should get in contact with the employers who used to work before the war, and tell them if they come to work, they will be able to earn three times, or four times as much as they earned b-before the war. </sentence><sentence id="191">And they should be -- come to work to do their job, and we will pay them real good. </sentence><sentence id="192">I started to organize, and this -- people started to come back, until I opened the factory and started to produce. </sentence><sentence id="193">But, it was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="194">You had to have books, because you never know when the German government going to come to check your books. </sentence><sentence id="195">So e -- we have been forced to have double bookkeeping. </sentence><sentence id="196">One set of book was actually what we did pay them. </sentence><sentence id="197">Same way we used to get -- we used write [indecipherable] what we sold to dealers, we sold mostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave them a bill, the price like before the war, and they paid us the same way, two, three times this amount. </sentence><sentence id="198">But the point was we still had to keep double bookkeeping, until one of those days, and this was apparently in deg41, one of the employee, he was not mad at me, he work over there a long time already, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="199"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0061 10 and he knows me, and he saw me before the warm I was in the factory involved. </sentence><sentence id="200">And he got a -- with a disagreement with the owner in -- in the place, and he went to Gestapo, and he told them that the factory actually belongs more to us than it belongs to her, it's a Jewish factory, and he told all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="201">For example, we used to have, when we finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our merchandise, we always had been afraid that someday the Gestapo will come, and they will confiscate everything. </sentence><sentence id="202">And where we used to keep finished merchandise, not far away from the factory in a village, and it used to be hidden aboll where we could always ship this merchandise, because we never know if -- when they will come to confiscate the factory. </sentence><sentence id="203">And he told the Gestapo everything, what is going on, that the merchandise is in a aboll in the next village. </sentence><sentence id="204">And finally, one day, like I said, must have been July or August, a policeman came to our home, and he said that I should come down to this jontamarie, where they had their headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="205">Normally, our town was a small town, we didn't had, actually, Gestapo, SS in our town, only jontamarie we had it. </sentence><sentence id="206">But once in -- every few weeks, two, three weeks, what I don't know exactly, they used to come in a larger town, SS, they -- if they had any complaints to take care cases, this when they come in to take care the -- of those business. </sentence><sentence id="207">And iva the policemens told me I am called to the jontamarie, to come down. </sentence><sentence id="208">And I remember, and I can remember it exactly like today. </sentence><sentence id="209">I looked at my mother, and I saw her face, and it didn't help me that I have to go down, but it help me the suffering in my mother, and so my father, too. </sentence><sentence id="210">I went down in a sleeveless shirt -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="211">  ontectnetonancedjushetnoey for ther biormatberaboutfisotecion
