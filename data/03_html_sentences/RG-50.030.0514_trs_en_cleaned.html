<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="758">Q: Yes, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="760">A: Cause we managed to -- to burn through every -- every -- now, of course they, many of them would have to go back damaged, for when the aircraft and the people wounded and dead over there, it is probably the nearest air -- airfield, so it is -- they would come back, they would put out flares, and we would know whether we were dead or wounded or whether there's a serious mechanical problem. </sentence><sentence id="761">They would land at our airfield because we were the closest. </sentence><sentence id="762">We were not the only ones, all of these close report fighter units were along the front lines in these places, part of which I was to debrief them and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="942">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="944">A: And we -- there -- there were massive records in a place called Offenbach, which was about eight kilometers from -- from the heart of Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="945">My first office in Frankfurt was in the building of the Reichsbank branch, which is like the Federal Reserve bank. </sentence><sentence id="946">In Frankfurt that building is still there, and of course the great luxury that I acquired and from which I didn't want to part was a -- was a rocking chair. </sentence><sentence id="947">After -- after a couple of years of army service in a tent in other places, the rocking chair was something special anyway. </sentence><sentence id="948">But that is what we did for several months, and that was also during the period when the Soviets, as you know, would not let the American forces into Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="949">Although officially, according to the Alta agreement, we were supposed to be in Berlin practically from the beginning, the Soviets needed a couple of months to -- to loot, rape and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="950">And -- and so I wer -- I worked out of Frankfurt until the beginning of January, by which time already the military governor of -- was -- our military governor was -- was already in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="951">His name was General Lucius Clay. </sentence><sentence id="952">And all the other military governors were sitting there, and there was, at that time still that instrument which was supposed to be the coordinating instrument, using the Russian term kommandatura, spelled with </sentence></p><p><sentence id="953"> a K, and that had to be -- that was part of our of-official vocabulary, and -- and I was then directed to move from Frankfurt to Berlin, and I moved there in January of 1946. </sentence><sentence id="954">Berlin was in a shambles, of course. </sentence><sentence id="955">It was a very cold winter. </sentence><sentence id="956">The U.S. army did some lovely things for the civilian population. </sentence><sentence id="957">Had tents on crossings and little islands with army potbelly stoves that were going all the time so people could go in and warm their hands, which I thought was -- was proper humane thing to do and -- and -- and we did it. </sentence><sentence id="958">In any event, I was then assigned to the Intelligence division of the finance department, and my first assignment involved the writing of a report on the largest of the German banks, which was called the Deutsche bank. </sentence><sentence id="959">The Germans had three major banks. </sentence><sentence id="960">They were called the gross bank and the giant banks, that was the official German terminology. </sentence><sentence id="961">And that was the Deutsche bank, the Dresdner bank and the Commerce bank. </sentence><sentence id="962">Deutsche is deutsche in German and Dresdner is based on the city of Dresden, and Commerce is commerce. </sentence><sentence id="963">And they were in -- in that order in the size, and of course once we -- we got into their -- their records and -- and we interrogated a lot of people, and the picture was very clear, they -- they -- the first step was the -- the [indecipherable] of the banking system, ri -- right after January 30, 1933 when Hitler came to power, started the removal of -- of Jews from leading positions in the banking system, both in the -- in the board of directors, which was called the [indecipherable] and the board of management, which is called the Vorstand. </sentence><sentence id="964">In this way, by the way, is -- is with a V, written as a V and pronounced as a V. Vorstand, V-o-r-s-t-a-n-d. They removed the Jews, there were -- there were prominent Jews as bankers, and prominent Jews on -- on the boards of directors and so on. </sentence><sentence id="965">That was the first step of elimination. </sentence><sentence id="966">Then the banks proceeded to Aryanize, to take over control of -- of many of the private banks which were Jewish owned. </sentence><sentence id="967">Germany had a -- a -- a whole series, starting with the Rothschild banks of course, but over the years private banks quite well known, Mendelssohn and -- and Aufweiser and etcetera,    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="968"> etcetera, and Oppenheimer and so on. [ </sentence><sentence id="969">indecipherable] up and down, and with the Aryanization of those banks and became instruments of the Aryanization of Jewish businesses. </sentence><sentence id="970">And that they did very effectively and very e-e-efficiently between then -- "33 and -- and -- and deg38 - deg39. </sentence><sentence id="971">And then as -- as the war broke out, and particular it started first with the anschluss of Austria in March of 1938, the Deutsche bank moved in and took over the largest Austrian bank. </sentence><sentence id="972">The Dresdner bank moved in and took over the second largest Austrian bank, called the Lander bank, the first one was the [indecipherable], I mean, I -- I won't b-bore you with all this, but yeah, this is now what, "46, we did all this. </sentence><sentence id="973">And -- and so -- and so they went when th -- when -- when Sudetenland was taken over and subsequently Czechoslovakia, the Deutsche bank took over the largest -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="974">Q: Largest. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="975">A: -- Czech bank and so on, very systematic, very orderly. </sentence><sentence id="976">And there was even a sort of a -- became almost like a little rhyme, it -- it rhymes in German. </sentence><sentence id="977">Zuerst kommen die tanken, first come the tanks, and then kommen die banken, and then come the banks. </sentence><sentence id="978">That rhymes in German, obviously, the tanken and banken rhyme. </sentence><sentence id="979">But it was like [indecipherable] the same thing applied to western Europe. </sentence><sentence id="980">When they moved into Belgium they took the control of the major banks, they di -- took control in -- in Holland, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="981">And so the first report was the report on the activities of the Deutsche bank, and simultaneously the Dresdner bank w -- very -- it was a -- where they -- a special unit, and I was part of it, and somewhere along the way I -- I was given more responsibility and -- and in some of the subsequent investigations, I was the chief investigator of it and so on, and in any event, the objective of these reports was that th-the -- the military government had to establish a policy on what is -- what kind of a bank is this [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="982">One thing was very clear, that A, we will not allow a -- a intermingling of banking and industrial corporations, because the German system, particular the -- the Nazi period is that the major banks ended up being the -- providing the chairmanships of the main major industrial companies. </sentence><sentence id="983">It was a real intertwining of interlocking directorates, it is called in the decartelization world. </sentence><sentence id="984">And in addition to that, we came with a tradition of decentralized banking in this country. </sentence><sentence id="985">In the state of New York at that time, believe it or not, Chase Manhattan had no right to have a branch in Buffalo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="998">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1000">A: The state of New York was divided into banking districts, and if a bank was in Manhattan and in the Manhattan district of banking, it could not be in Buffalo and it could not be in Syracuse in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So the whole idea of -- of extreme decentralization of banking, very important [indecipherable] anyways, but in this case it was important not to allow the reconstitution of -- of the instruments which were important instruments in the whole Nazi program of -- of -- of -- of control and -- and -- and centralization of economic power. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1004">Q: So the research that you and your colleagues were doing were absolutely essential -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1005">A: Of course. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1006">Q: -- to -- to being able to make a decision like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1104">A: There was no central government in Germany until the fall of 1949. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Between deg45 and 49 there was no central government. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Every military governor was the absolute ruler of his zone of occupation and this sector of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And there were municipal governments, and there eventually were state governments, you know, Bavaria and Hassen and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1108">But there was no central government until four -- for over four years. </sentence><sentence id="1109">And in November of 1947, this law was enacted in the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1110">American zone of Germany to give you an idea in present day -- day Germany was cities like Frankfurt and Munich and Nuremberg and -- and Kassel and Bremen as a port, and Stuttgart and etcetera, I mean it -- it was sort of the center of the -- the British had th-the -- the industrial heart of Germany, the whole -- the Diisseldorf and Cologne and the coal mines and the steel mills and so on, and Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="1111">And the French had the most western part, bordering on Alsace, and -- on Alsatia and Alsace and -- and then -- and on the lake area and so on, and the Black Forest, the Schwarzweld and so on, they had -- they had nice countryside, but that -- they, of course, were the smallest of the -- of the zones. </sentence><sentence id="1112">When that was enacted, General Clay wanted the British and the French, his counterparts to enact a similar law -- laws for their zones so there would be a single property restitution law in West Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1113">The Soviets you could forget about, they were not interested in private property, they were not interested in the whole concept of compensation and restitution and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1114">There was nothing to talk about with them. </sentence><sentence id="1115">The British and the French would not go along. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Th-This was not in their -- the military governors obviously ca -- don't make these decisions, the decisions go back to the governments. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And in the case of the governments, it of course goes to the foreign office in London, and to the [indecipherable] in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1118">The international lawyers over there said, no how. </sentence><sentence id="1119">So General Clay went in and -- and promulgated it in the American zone, and the Jewish organizations established in New York the first si -- Jewish successor organization called the Jewish Restitution Success Organization, or JRSO for short. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1137">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1139">A: That was created almost at the same time when the law was enacted, it was in the last November of "47, but it didn't come into real operation until

much involved in establishing the JRSO, so they sent the general consul to the -- to -- of the JDC to two people, to Ben Ferencz in Nuremberg who had just finished being the prosecutor of the

after June 1941, and every day would telegraph a report, so many Jews and so many Bolsheviks, and of course they did [indecipherable] and a few other nice places like that. </sentence><sentence id="1151">And -- and he just finished his tour of duty -- I mean his -- the -- the -- the Einsatzgruppen trial, and by the way, hi-his was the only trial which sent the largest number of SS officers

and so on that would go into Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1159">And there was -- if you -- if you go into the histories, you can read and find that there was serious discussion in Washington as to whether or not the U.S. and the western powers should pull out of Berlin and give him -- give him -- and give Stalin [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1160">It was Clay who went to Harry

historic context of how some of these things that we are talking about [indecipherable] today were born, have not been properly and in depth researched and put in the proper context. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Simultaneously, in order to begin to rebuild the economy of -- of West Germany, the allied powers [indecipherable] when they talk about the allied powers, you ca -- have to assume the U.S. being in the lead. </sentence><sentence id="1163">The U.S. was in the lead miles ahead of everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1164">We were strongest militarily, economically,

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1221">A: As I see it, and it -- and you can say eventually it is subjective because of -- of my own immersion in this -- in this whole area. </sentence><sentence id="1222">But as I -- as I keep thinking over the years that there is one area which in my judgment is that had been fully and properly researched and -- and examined, and that is what were the particular forces and elements in the -- in the lil -- late 1930's and the early 1940's that -- that made it possible for organized world Jewry, and I use -- I say organized because unless -- unless something is organized, unless there is some sort of an instrumentality, then it is a lot of conversation. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Maybe conversation is important, yo-you -- you may not come to the -- to the action before -- be-before you -- before you -- you -- you contemplate the problem, but nonetheless, for the first time -- and I'm not a professional historian, so I say it with all these caveats and reservations, but I think it's the first time where the organized Jewish community in this global sense has -- has decided, in response to -- to in- incredible tragedy that has befallen the Jewish people, to -- to confront the perpetrators or -- or their successors. </sentence><sentence id="1224">Because if I go back, at least to the extent which -- and I have spent obviously, time going back to -- to periods of -- of disaster and catastrophe in Jewish life, there was an event, or events of -- of persecution and of -- and of physical damaging injury and -- and murder with the survivors ultimately going into some kind of exile or into some -- away from wherever </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1225"> it is, leaving behind all their worldly goods, basically, and building a new life and a new existence and new communities in hope that -- that it will not be destroyed or damaged again. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1226">And you see rip -- that repeatedly but frequently enough, whether you go back to the destructions of the temple, the -- the temples of the -- of the Babylonian period or -- or s -- or subsequently in the -- in the Middle Ages, the pogroms and the Crusaders and the period about -- which Barbara Tuchman described in -- in -- in some of her books and so on, what you saw was, the Jews picked themselves up from the area where the Crusaders and so on persecuted them. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Fortunately the kings of Poland wanted -- needed craftsmen, and that in -- created an open door, and the Jews were moved from the Rhine area into Poland, etcetera and a new chapter in Jewish history opened up [indecipherable] Jewish community in Poland, in eastern Europe and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And -- and -- and then subsequently came all kinds of -- forms of persecution, some of them -- obviously 1492 in Spain, and again the Jews ran and left everything behind and build new lives and -- and those who were caught by the Inquisition of course, perished. </sentence><sentence id="1229">And -- and then came the whole si -- middle -- middle of 17" century with the [indecipherable] pogroms. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Again the same -- the same phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Persecution, murder, exile, escape, flight, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1232">I am obviously not going into the intricacies, but [indecipherable] that -- that's the picture. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And -- and even as late as -- as the beginning of the 20" century, with the pogroms of [indecipherable] and what was the response there? </sentence><sentence id="1234">The massive migration out of Russia to -- to -- to the United States. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1235">The roots of the vast majority of American Jews today are the -- the gr-grand -- the grand or gr -- or great-grandparents of those who ran from the pogroms of -- of -- of Tsarist Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1236">No- Nobody dug in their heels and said, we were -- we were driven out, we were hurt, we were damaged, we were persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="1237">S-S -- this -- this government, or this successor government cannot get away with this. </sentence><sentence id="1238">Now you can say that -- that -- that the [indecipherable] and that </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1239"> Hitler and -- and -- and the Third Reich and the industrialized, massive, incredible industrialized persecution and -- and -- and annihilation of -- of six million people in -- in five years was so earth-shaking and [indecipherable] earth-shaking. </sentence><sentence id="1240">Sometimes I ask myself -- I don't know, is it -- was it for the days of the [indecipherable] pogroms for -- for the Jews at that time as great a horror as -- as -- as Kristallnacht?

</sentence><sentence id="1256">The failings being did the organized Jewish world after 1933 sufficiently analyze where the Third Reich and -- and the Nazis and Hitler were leading? </sentence><sentence id="1257">After all, of the 600,000 German Jews, 300,000 remain in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1258">Now, again, I make a statement like that and it sounds again like an exaggeration an-and unqualified. </sentence><sentence id="1259">I realize that among the 300,000 that stayed may have been tens of thousands who would have been -- who wanted to get out and the world wouldn't take them in, including this country. </sentence><sentence id="1260">But nonetheless, there were large numbers of people, some of whom I've known among -- among German Jewry and subsequently Austrian Jewry and so on, who thought, you know, this is a passing business, and now we're -- and now we're -- good Germans will -- will take care of this upstart over there because in other words, where th -- I f -- I forget about the world, but where -- where did the Jewish leadership?
