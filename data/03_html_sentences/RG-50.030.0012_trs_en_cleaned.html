<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Uh...My name is Fred Bachner. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in Berlin, September 28, 1925, and I lived in Berlin, I grew up in Berlin until the age of...uh...thir, fourteen. </sentence><sentence id="5">I..uh...went to the Jewish...uh...public school because...uh...as a Jew we were not permitted to go into the German schools so it was a completely Jewish...uh...uh...sustained...uh...schools within the school system and...uh...1 grew up and I learned during the growing up in the school...uh...Hebrew and English, which was...uh...uh...taken on an extended program. </sentence><sentence id="6">I went to school from 8 o'clock in the morning til about...uh...3, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, with | hour of break for lunch which we were supplied by the school. </sentence><sentence id="7">And ... uh...we had a very happy environment until the... uh... German laws started to tighten down and...uh...prohibited the Gentile people to associate with us Jews by... uh...starting out...uh...uh...forbidding us to go into certain places such as parks and restaurants and...uh...buses and trains which...uh...was...uh...very well advertised in the anti-Jewish newspaper, the Sturmer, in which always had the big Jewish face with a big hook nose is a picture in front on the first page and...uh. </sentence><sentence id="8">The really...the...the way I started to feel it was when...my friends...we used to live in a...ina apartment house and we got downstairs to play after school...when...uh...my friends came over to me and said...uh...my father said I can't play with you anymore because you are a Jew and I don't supposed to associate with you. </sentence><sentence id="9">That's when I really started to...to feel the...the crunch of it, that all of a sudden the... uh ... wall started to come down and...uh...we sort of got forced into a more Jewish environment because the only way we could associate was...uh...the Jewish people and...uh...1 joined the Maccabee which is the Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="10">We got...uh...meetings every Saturday, get together and camp trips on Sunday, bicycle trips and...uh...I must say that they used to do quite a bit to keep us...the youth happy and...and Jewish oriented and...uh...then it...uh...boiled down that we had a sports arena, outside Berlin, where we had the Maccabee schools competing against each other and organizations and...uh...we started to be dependent upon...among...on...on each other. </sentence><sentence id="11">Then I grew up and years past by and finally I started to get into the age where I had to prepare myself for my Bar Mitzvah which took place at the end of October 1938. </sentence><sentence id="12">and...uh...I had the...uh...I had the Bar Mitzvah teachers...uh...somebody who was very, very knowledgeable in the Jewish Torah and the

(ph) and also the Maftir (ph) and I...uh...felt very, very honored to be able to...to learn it and to perform before my relatives and the congregation and...uh...it took a hard...a long time for me to learn it but I managed it and when I...the day of my Bar Mitzvah, which was before the...uh...Kristallnacht and as it turned out, one of the very few Bar Mitzvahs left to be performed because... uh ...Kristallnacht was in Berlin on November 9th, where all the synagogues and schools were destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="15">Uh...I...1 remember vividly that I woke up and the Kristallnacht was on the ninth of November...uh...and I got up in the morning and it was about 6:30 in the morning because I had to walk to school which was a little bit of a distance from where we used to live and...uh...but the school was situated with the...uh...synagogue in back of the building, a very big synagogue and...uh...I came...I left my house to go to school and...uh...I seen how the SR was...uh...destroying Jewish...uh...stores and Jewish apartments by...uh...breaking the glass and throwing the furniture and...uh...all be...belongings out on the street for destruction, just setting it afire or people just grabbing it and walking away with it. </sentence><sentence id="16">And as I reached the school, well I didn't know what to do there because the curt...window curtains were hanging out and the synagogue in the back was practically destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="17">The...uh...ark was open, the Torah was...uh...taken out, the Hebrew books were put in the middle there and set afire, and I was very distraught and didn't know what to do so my first thought was to run back home and see if my house and my parents are alright. </sentence><sentence id="18">Thank God...uh..nothing has happened to our apartment and...uh...we lived through the...uh...the assault without any damages except that there was a...uh...a...uh...search for people to look...to leave Germany because...uh...the Rabbi in...in our synagogue in his last speech said and I vividly remember it today, he said, "It doesn't become daytime before it really gets night." </sentence><sentence id="19">And what he tried to tell us that it is going to get worse before it's going to get better. </sentence><sentence id="20">And naturally peopled started to take this into consideration and they started to talk about leaving Germany any which way possible and there was an onslaught of the Consulate, appeal by Columbia, Shanghai and...uh...any...any...any nation that...that would accept you to go without waiting for long term visa to come to the United States and...uh...that...that was the start of the exodus...exodus ...from the Jews from Germany although...although this didn't last long because at the end of November, it was the assassination by a...uh...student by the name of Greenblat_* in Paris to a...uh... German diplomat Neurath **...1 vividly remember their names that set off another race or I should say that set off actually the...the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="21">I'm sorry, I'm wrong. </sentence><sentence id="22">But the...uh..timing was that the end of November the...uh...the German police rounded up all Polish citizens and it was very easy to distinguish a...uh..person

their Jewish name or whatever it was, and...uh...then they had...uh...also the religion. </sentence><sentence id="26">So to pick out the Jewish...uh...names from...from the Police precinct was a pretty...uh...easy task. </sentence><sentence id="27">So this how things started to get worse, that all the Polish citizens were...uh...rounded up and my father and my mother were Polish citizens and automatically my brother and I became Polish citizens because according to the German law that you are...you...you become the nationality what your parents are. </sentence><sentence id="28">And...uh...my father and my brother were deported to the Polish border and Poland was not prepared of the onslaught of thousands of people and for security reasons because the border was very close with Germany, they...uh...kept these people in camps at the border until they were screened and got the permission to go into Poland where they were born...to the place where they were born. </sentence><sentence id="29">And so...uh...my father and my brother were picked up and they were on the transport to Poland and they were detained at the...uh...Polish border. </sentence><sentence id="30">They were there for 2 weeks until they got the permission to proceed to the...uh...place where my father was born and where our family lived. </sentence><sentence id="31">And..-uh...my late mother and I...we were not permitted to join them, so all of a sudden things have changed...uh...financially because there was no money coming in anymore. </sentence><sentence id="32">We had the big factory. </sentence><sentence id="33">My father was a well-to-do person in his own way in Germany and...uh...we had to sort of...uh...see how we can sustain ourselves by...uh...by doing some necessary...uh...adjustment. </sentence><sentence id="34">Now...uh...we had a big apartment, five rooms with a service entrance and so on and so forth, so we...we thought that we would rent out a...uh...a..uh... room and...uh...take somebody in to live there, and we rented it out to an elderly couple, and they moved in with us and they paid us rent which helped us to sustain ourselves to the time, you know, that...uh...until we can meet...uh...be together with my father and brother. </sentence><sentence id="35">And...uh...we...uh...my mother did...uh...a few...uh...things. </sentence><sentence id="36">She was a pretty good seamstress in her own way, and I did some odd work, deliver paper or whatever it was and got some income as far as that was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="37">It was only pennies, but...uh...every, every penny helped that time. </sentence><sentence id="38">And...uh...my father, as I mentioned before, after 2 weeks was...uh...capable to join...to go proceed to the place where he was born and to establish himself and wait for our arrival. </sentence><sentence id="39">Now the Polish government issued...uh...a red stamp in your passport that permitted you to return to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="40">On the interim we had some cousins in America and we wrote to them that things are bad, we need visas, which they started to...uh...to..-uh...proceed with and they finally got the visas and they were issued to us about a week before we left Germany and...uh...then we had to...uh...have them transferred from the American Consulate in Berlin to the Consulate in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="41">Now the...uh...Polish quota for...uh...Polish citizens to come to the United States was...there was a 4 to 5 year wait so that picture didn't look very bright, but I must say that the Jewish Agency was working very, very hard to get the kids and the youth out of Berlin, out of the fire, This is a verbatim

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and my grandparents from my mother's side, they left Berlin in 1935 and they settled in Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="44">And...uh...we were in touch with them and...uh...they said we have...you register for...for a transport from Berlin to Amsterdam and then you will be able to proceed from Amsterdam either to London or to Israel". </sentence><sentence id="45">So we packed up a suitcase and put it (chuckle) next to the door and...uh...L...1 made...I was sort of prepared, you know, to leave my mother and...uh...that I might get a telephone call. </sentence><sentence id="46">That's all we would have gotten and be at the...in 5 hours at the train station, and you're gonna go with that transport to...uh...to Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="47">Uh...I also was registered in Berlin to go on a transport direct to Israel" on Aliyah, but unfortunately, as it turned out that phone call never came and the...uh...letter for Israel never came either because in June 1939, we got the call from the Polish government to come and pick up the...the stamp...that we are able to leave Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="48">And...uh...so my late mother and I, we went to the Polish government and got that stamp, you know, and we left the apartment and...uh...on the interim, in the meanwhile it was too hard...these people got sick and anyhow I don't remember exactly what happened to the elderly people that lived with us, but...uh...we...uh...we moved out of the apartment and moved in with another...uh...another couple on the same...same building on the first floor and rented one room. </sentence><sentence id="49">Now we became the...(chuckle)...the...uh...tenants. </sentence><sentence id="50">And...uh...when we left, we left everything there. </sentence><sentence id="51">And uh...we didn't have anything to sell because we sold our furniture and this sustained ourselves to live...uh...to have food come in...in..-uh...and as long as we were by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="52">Now the big moment came and we purchased the tickets and we took the train...uh...to my father's...uh...to my father and my brother to be reunited. </sentence><sentence id="53">And naturally where upon arrival it was a great...uh...great occasion, you know that being separated for almost a year and a half that we...uh...finally got together. </sentence><sentence id="54">So now came the worry for my father...what to do and where...where to establish himself because he...he didn't know by himself what to do in the interim...uh...in Poland, and he...uh...sort of waited for us to wait for a decision what my mother wanted...thought what the family should do. </sentence><sentence id="55">So naturally we took...uh...sort of a vacation and...uh...my father and my mother...we...we went to Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="56">And...uh...we tried to rent an apartment there and to have whatever we had...the few suitcases go and, you know, we used to live with my father's family there, which graciously took us in. </sentence><sentence id="57">I mean, you know...uh...in Europe there was no such thing...there was room in the smallest hut like they used to say, you know, and....uh...and...uh...it came...came the time that we thought that we finally be able to carry on with a normal life because I would have to enroll into school and to learn to...how to speak Polish which is a pretty hard language. </sentence><sentence id="58">And I...uh...then...then all of a sudden on September Ist, there was already a rumor and a feeling that war is imminent "Palestine before 1948.*Palestine before 1948.This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="59">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="60"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and it might start any day because the Polish government started to issue orders that you tape up your windows because from the air raid the windows might crack and they shatter on the street and hurt people and what not, you know. </sentence><sentence id="61">So the feeling was already that there is going to be a war. </sentence><sentence id="62">And sure enough they started...uh...in...in August, they started to dig trenches around the...the city where...uh...the...uh... homefront would defend that city and they were...they were full gung ho that they're going to beat the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="63">But I couldn't see that with the horses what they had...not...not being mobilized at all, that they're going to have any kind ofa success you know. </sentence><sentence id="64">And the geographic situation of the city where my father was, it was not too far away from the German border and it was only 10 kilometers away from Auschwitz, from Oswiecim. </sentence><sentence id="65">And I will come back to that later. </sentence><sentence id="66">And...uh...we....the Declaration of War was on September Ist. </sentence><sentence id="67">Naturally, right away we had air raids, and we had all kinds of...uh...war threats that the Germans beat the Pole...Poles, and the they take already and this town and this town and we should evacuate the town. </sentence><sentence id="68">So the people started to pack up on baby carriages and hand carriages and they started to march out of the town into further away from the...from the border to be in a safe zone. </sentence><sentence id="69">So...uh...we took everything into a suitcase and we grabbed a baby carriage and put it on top of the baby carriage and our family we started to hold ourselves together and started to march to evacuate further in..into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="70">Now I don't remember exactly how many kilometers we marched or so, but it was...uh...I don't know, it was about...we managed in...in 4 days, in 5 days to go about...uh...100 kilometers or maybe 70 kilometers and we walked across the fields you know, because the...uh...corn was already taken in and the hay and the potatoes were...only the potatoes were still out in the field because this is a very big farm country, Poland. </sentence><sentence id="71">So...uh...we started to go further and we...we walked further and who do we meet there? </sentence><sentence id="72">The German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="73">Because they got ahead of us, not...not by...on the...on the road, but they were parachuting in to the...to the advance areas and securing the advance areas and when we came, you know, the...we come there, we see the German soldiers and they said, "Oh, Go back home. </sentence><sentence id="74">Go back home." </sentence><sentence id="75">That's all you...they ever use... "Whatever city you are from, go back home." </sentence><sentence id="76">And right there and then they started a big anti-Semitism by the soldiers to...to see....the Jews...the religious Jewish people used to have beards, and big pais (ph), you know. </sentence><sentence id="77">And...and you...you wouldn't believe it but they started literally to rip out the beard and rip out the thing, and you know...uh...so the Jews, you know, they started to...to take a bandage around the...the...uh...the chin and hide the hair from the beard in there, and when the German came, you know, you had a toothache or headache or, you know, whatever it was to...to save themselves with the beard. </sentence><sentence id="78">And that's...that was actually the beginning of the atrocities that they had. </sentence><sentence id="79">And after...after a couple of days we came back to the village which we left and everything... everything has changed. </sentence><sentence id="80">The German Army occupied the...the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="81">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="82"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection village or I should say maybe the city, whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="83">And the...uh...they started to take every...uh...capable person who could perform any kind of...uh...work, they grabbed you off the street and they took you in one of the trucks and they carried you away to perform some kind of work for the army, whatever it is...clean the barracks or clean the horses, you know, whatever it is to...uh...uh...to make it comfortable for the army. ( </sentence><sentence id="84">Pause, drinking water) So that was the beginning of establishing work camps which was supervised by the German army and it was that if you were a...first of all there was a...a...uh...order out that every humanbeing...every male person at the age of 12 or 13 has to work. </sentence><sentence id="85">Otherwise, you wouldn't get any food stamps. </sentence><sentence id="86">Otherwise you would not get any privileges and if you are caught in the streets and you cannot document that you have a job, they take you and work you away. </sentence><sentence id="87">So that is how my brother got caught and...uh...now he didn't get caught. </sentence><sentence id="88">There was an order out that all the...uh...Jewish males between the age of 14 and 18 have to register at the police department and...uh...that..-uh....that all of was change because they establish a Jewish community center where...like we have here in America, that you have a synagogue, you have a president and a vice president and so on and so forth, and they established that for the community. </sentence><sentence id="89">And they did all the work for the Germans registering. </sentence><sentence id="90">You were registered there and they know everything where you lived and all that. </sentence><sentence id="91">And...uh...that was the legal...uh...that you were legalized and permitted to live there. </sentence><sentence id="92">So you had to register in that...uh...that agency you I will call it, and..uh...you...and they had...uh...and after...after you register...after 3 or 4 days everybody registered, then they sent a policeman to your apartment and they took you down to the police station and they carried you away to a work camp that was in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="93">Now Germany uprooted woods, and you had to take the roots out because that's where they built the autobahns, you see. </sentence><sentence id="94">And at the later date, about a year or 2 later, they built factories there because they suffered heavy losses in the West where the German industry was and they relocated the factories north to Poland and so on and so forth where they could perform...work on...on ammunition and guns and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="95">And that's where the workers...uh...got into the camp and these camps, they were erected overnight and...uh...that's where my brother was taken to a work camp at the 1940. </sentence><sentence id="96">So again, was a disruption in the family life. </sentence><sentence id="97">I had to go and register to work and my father and my mother and so on and so forth, and I...I was...1 would say lucky or not, but I befriended myself with a...a Jewish girl and...uh...she was about 2 years younger than I was, and her father owned a...uh...a..uh...distribution center of sodas and beer. </sentence><sentence id="98">And when all this...these things started to tighten down, I said, "You know, I got to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="99">Can I get a job with your father." </sentence><sentence id="100">She says, "Sure, my father will take you down." </sentence><sentence id="101">Now by the time I...I...I tried to procrastinate it as long as I could, you know, and in the...in the meantime, the father's business was taken over by a Volksdeutsche. </sentence><sentence id="102">That is a person who is Polish but has German ancestry in him, you see. </sentence><sentence id="103">So he just came in your business and he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was the boss and all that. </sentence><sentence id="106">So...so L...so her father spoke to the guy and he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="107">So what...what was the work, and I was...that time I was 14 and a half. </sentence><sentence id="108">Uh...I was permitted...I was not permitted, I was given a team of horses and a wagon which I had to load in the morning with beer barrels and sodas and all that and go around in the...in the village and, you know, deliver it to the...uh...stores, the luncheonettes or the...uh...the bars, you know, wherever they...they sell beers. </sentence><sentence id="109">And...uh...it was a...a very demanding job because I had to get up at...uh...5...uh...o'clock in the morning and go to the stable and clean the horses, water them down, give them hay to eat and...yah...and then go out and load the big carriage up, you know, and take the beer barrels and...and lift them on God knows what you know. </sentence><sentence id="110">So L...I did that and...uh...as a...as a young kid, I was capable of adjusting myself to it, and I took care of it the best possible way and it was pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="111">I mean the guy was tickled pink because I managed how to drive a team of horses and...uh...in winter time we...uh...drove a sled. </sentence><sentence id="112">And...uh...there was no...no cars there. </sentence><sentence id="113">I mean there were very, very few...uh...cars in the village or trucks and...uh...it took a lot of learning to control a team of horses to...uh...get the sled or carriage down the hill that...uh...pushes a load...pull a load, you know, and you go down the steep hill and the horse has to hold it back and, you know, so it's ...uh...it's pretty dangerous, let me tell you. </sentence><sentence id="114">So my brother was in a camp and we got....uh...mail from him at...uh...14 days intervals or later or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="115">My father was working in a factory for the army to make...uh...coats and so was my late mother, but they worked in different shifts. </sentence><sentence id="116">And I was working in the beer brewery and...uh...1 was distributing beer and...uh...soda. </sentence><sentence id="117">Now all of a sudden the...in the surrounding of that city, camps...uh...POW camps started to spruce up, and...uh...they put their orders in for beer to be delivered and...uh...the ...the German boss I had, he said,...uh..."Well, you don't look Jewish, you know, and you have that...uh...uh...piece of silk cloth you wear in order to protect your clothing when you go down to the basement to roll down the...the barrels of beer, and you can haul the...you can hide the Jewish star, you know, so you know if they question you, you can move the thing away and what you're gonna go to these camps and you're gonna deliver the beer." </sentence><sentence id="118">So I did that and...uh...and lo and behold...uh...in my...you know, in my lifetime, I had...as we...as you will hear later, I consider myself a little bit lucky because I had very few...1 had a few occasions which...uh...I will tell you that I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="119">So I go into that particular camp there and deliver the beer and I speak to the commander of the camp and all that, and I looked through the...uh...barbed wire in a...in a camp and...uh...I see my brother there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="120">So I...1 was...1 was perplexed. </sentence><sentence id="121">I thought my brother was in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="122">Now he is in travel distance from...from us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="123">So I spoke to the commander and I said I have to...I have to go...uh... L...1 see somebody I know there. </sentence><sentence id="124">Can I...can I go and see him? </sentence><sentence id="125">You know, and I handed him a pack of cigarettes and he says, "Yeah, Go and see him, and...uh...but...but don't stay too long." </sentence><sentence id="126">So they opened the gate and I walked in and I embraced my brother and as I was there, I also know that there was a school mate or...not a school mate, a classmate of mine in the same camp. </sentence><sentence id="127">So I see my brother and my brother...I said, "How do you get here?" </sentence><sentence id="128">He says, "Well, I was a...uh...a...uh...first aid man for the sick people, and they got This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="129">It is not the primary

me...uh...to take care of the sick people here, you know, to administer first aid, and that's how I got here." </sentence><sentence id="131">I said, "Well, that's great. </sentence><sentence id="132">You know, I come here...[ come here every day." </sentence><sentence id="133">And...uh...all of a sudden I asked...I said to my brother, "You have people die here?" </sentence><sentence id="134">He says, "Sure, we have at least six, seven people a day." </sentence><sentence id="135">I says, "I mean I...I don't know til today how that idea came into my head." </sentence><sentence id="136">I says, "You have any way to bury them?" </sentence><sentence id="137">He says, "Yal, we save them here for...for 3, 4 days and then we carry them out and take them people and carry them out and bury them." </sentence><sentence id="138">I said, "You think if I talk to the commander and I can arrange to carry the people into...to our city which the name is Chrzanow C H R Z AN O W (chuckle) and...uh...uh...you think, he might go." </sentence><sentence id="139">He said, "Look, all you can do is try." </sentence><sentence id="140">So, I said goodbye, you know, and I said I...I'll be back tomorrow for whatever reason. </sentence><sentence id="141">So I talked to the commander and he said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="142">No good." </sentence><sentence id="143">But anyway next load I went out there with beer. </sentence><sentence id="144">I...uh...took some bread along and...uh...I...Uh...took bread along for my brother to distribute it in the camp and to give it to my classmate, you know. </sentence><sentence id="145">You can imagine the...the joy we had and...uh...we established some kind of a contact...my brother established some kind of contact with some of the guards. </sentence><sentence id="146">But anyway he...he suggested that to the camp commander and the camp commander says, "Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="147">Why not, you know." </sentence><sentence id="148">So I said, "You know something, I am going to come back on Sunday with a...with the boxes for dead people you know, and we going to take all the people, you gonna take 10 people with two guards, you gonna go...you gonna march into the village where we are, we gonna bury them with a Jewish burial and all that. </sentence><sentence id="149">And...uh...the camp commander, he must have been a pretty regular guy. </sentence><sentence id="150">He accepted it, and he said, "Yal," you know. </sentence><sentence id="151">So I came out on Sunday and I had the...the box loaded with bread

id="627">And...uh...uh...at that..now I am talking about already the...uh... going into the winter of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="628">And...uh...the snow was pretty deep there. </sentence><sentence id="629">The reason I mention that because we...we wore wooden shoes and the snow sticks to wood, you know. </sentence><sentence id="630">So when you had the wooden...uh...shoes,
