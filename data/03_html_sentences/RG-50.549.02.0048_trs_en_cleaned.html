<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="117">You've been living in a Christian country in the United States, for the last 50 years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Do you feel that there's a danger of something like what happened during World War Two, in Europe -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: -- to the Jews again? </sentence><sentence id="128">Do you feel that anti-Semitism is -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: 1 -- I do not believe that anything like that would be possible again, and I want to emphasize today, in my own mind, a tremendous change in government -- in government forming of -- of laws. </sentence><sentence id="130">Originally, if a government persecuted people, oppressed people, killed people, nobody interfered. </sentence><sentence id="131">At best -- There was an article in the paper, thanks to the courage of our President Clinton, and to NATO, that a change in this attitude finally came about, when we declared war on Milosevitch, who was oppressing his own people, and abusing the other minorities within Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="132">This is a historical event of tremendous impact for the future. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I think we should call this the Clinton Doctrine. </sentence><sentence id="134">I am -- I am highly impressed and very satisfied and happy that this happened, not because -- not because of myself, but in general terms, for the sake of mankind. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: You think this is the -- the first time that something like this has happened on a governmental level? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: I don't think, I know this is the first time, and never anything -- never anything like that happened. </sentence><sentence id="138">Even, you have a case here with Pinochet. </sentence><sentence id="139">There is still a dispute whether he is guilty or not guilty for killing people during the time when he was in power. </sentence><sentence id="140">Now they figured out that he is guilty now only from a certain date in England, when they reversed their thinking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Do you think that -- that Clinton's and NATO's actions in -- in Yugoslavia are -- do you think there's a chance that they had anything to do with -- with Holocaust memory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="147">Like if you're thinking back on what happened during the Holocaust and what -- what </sentence></p><p><sentence id="148"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 a America and the world did not do, there -- there -- perhaps there was pressure on the governments to actually take action now, in a way that they didn't then. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Well, I believe that a few sensitive people might have been influenced by the tremen - - by the terrific injustice which happened during the second World War, toward the Jewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines. </sentence><sentence id="150">But generally speaking, if -- if NATO, under the leadership of Clintons, wouldn't have done what they have done, the thing could have been again forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="151">As a matter of fact, from what I have been listening, to stories about the -- memorials about the Holocaust and so forth, nobody ever touched the church, which is guilty just as much as the Germans themselves, for what has happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Talking about -- about faith, and -- and religion and -- and -- and the influence of religion on prejudice, can you -- can you tell me the role that that's played in your life, and in -- in your own sense about -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religion is concerned, I personally believe that religions were necessary to raise the standards, the moral standards of the population. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="158">Whatever abuses happened later on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and oppress others, this is a different story. </sentence><sentence id="159">Personally, I was raised in a home -- in a Jewish home, by birth, but we were not religious. </sentence><sentence id="160">We kept a kosher house, because of my father's father, who was a widower. </sentence><sentence id="161">When he passed away, in his early 80's, my sister and myself said, "Mom, let's stop that kosher deal, we want to eat everything." </sentence><sentence id="162">And that was the end of the kosher household. </sentence><sentence id="163">Personally, I believe that Moses himself was one of the greatest, if not the greatest statesman, by inventing the 10 commandments and giving USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 8 them to the people as a guide for morality, for life. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I also am convinced that Jesus, another Jew, was another very great man, great statesman, who spread the teachings of Judaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Judaism rather than sticking to the old ways of the Jewish religion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: So do you see them more as politicians in a sense, than spiritual figures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Oh, they were spiritual figures, but with a political result. </sentence><sentence id="176">And the spirituality is terrific, if you can believe in it, and important is that you should then do what they tell you to do, what they wrote down that God said, but not whatever pleases anybody to his own advantage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: You were just mentioning a moment ago, off tape, about yo-you -- before the war, as you said, you were an atheist. </sentence><sentence id="180">What did your experience in the camp, how did that influence your feelings about religion in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Ah the experience in camp only confirmed my conviction that there is no God, that it is people who make their life, for other people, either nice, or miserable. </sentence><sentence id="184">And anything else is just an individual need. </sentence><sentence id="185">Some people need to believe that they will go to heaven after they die. </sentence><sentence id="186">I believe that I will go -- after I die, will be either co -- cremated, and that will be the end of -- because I don't believe in -- either in heaven, nor in a purgatory. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="192">I wanted to -- t-to bring us back to the beginning of your life. </sentence><sentence id="193">You -- You mentioned -- Why don't you just tell me what your -- your name was at birth -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Well -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: And tell me something about your original name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
