people. </sentence><sentence id="1989">And I used to read and cry a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1990">And I used to tear it in little, little pieces, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And I couldn't answer her, I was afraid because they can come at night and take me out, that's all, take away. </sentence><sentence id="1992">You know, before Stalin died, he had a plan to take out all the Jews, to take them to Siberia and to freeze them there. </sentence><sentence id="1993">Not to kill them like the Germans did, but he would freeze them. </sentence><sentence id="1994">Because there it's so cold that you can't go out. </sentence><sentence id="1995">And he would keep us in a place like this where there's no eat, no nothing, and he would kill all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1996">So I was all the time, you know, my daughter was born in 1950 and this was in 1953 before he died. </sentence><sentence id="1997">So he had this plan and they had to start already. </sentence><sentence id="1998">And we didn't know what to do, again. </sentence><sentence id="1999">It was worse, but like this we had a good life, but we had no future and we was afraid for tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2000">So when he died he didn't have too much time because he died in 1953 and there was, then was other people took over and the other people was very good, very good to everybody, and we had a good life. </sentence><sentence id="2001">Till then I start to write letters to my sister, and she start to write to me, to answer me. </sentence><sentence id="2002">But to go out it was out of the question, we couldn't go out never, never in life. </sentence><sentence id="2003">But then when they changed, when came the other people in Stalin's place, so they letted out the Polish people to go to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2004">This way we went to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2005">And from Poland I wrote already my sister, she knew already that I'm there. </sentence><sentence id="2006">I called her, I made a call on her telephone, you know, she should pay. </sentence><sentence id="2007">And then she start to take us from Poland to America, to United States. </sentence><sentence id="2008">But after a little while she find out that she can't take us all, it has to be one person and this is going to take a long, long time until we're going to get the visa. </sentence><sentence id="2009">So I said to her, and that time they said, "whoever wants to go to Israel can go free". </sentence><sentence id="2010">So I said to my husband, "whether it's going plane or it's going a ship, we are going, we are not staying here in Poland with the Polish people". </sentence><sentence id="2011">And this what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2012">So I didn't wait for my sister till she was going to do everything. </sentence><sentence id="2013">We went to Israel, at least I'm safe there, I have got a life. </sentence><sentence id="2014">It was a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="2015">It was after a war, we had seen, it was a war, it was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Everything was like you had to get, like for food, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2017">It was hard to get to work, everything was hard. </sentence><sentence id="2018">Anyway my sister helped me, she send me money, she send me packages, and she helped me a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2019">Till she's this was in "57 when we came to Israel, 1957. </sentence><sentence id="2020">So it was till 1959, till my sister made out the papers for us, for all of us. </sentence><sentence id="2021">In the beginning she could only take one person, me with my daughter or my husband. </sentence><sentence id="2022">I didn't want to leave my husband. </sentence><sentence id="2023">Or he didn't want to leave me. </sentence><sentence id="2024">So I said to her, I was that we're not going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2025">If to go, to come to you, only all of us. </sentence><sentence id="2026">Otherwise we're going to stay in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2027">Now is a bad time but we're going to get through this. </sentence><sentence id="2028">We had hard times a lot in our lives, we get through this too. </sentence><sentence id="2029">But the only thing, that we are free, we are with Jews, I'm not afraid that they're  going to kill me, that I'm a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2030">Everybody's there, the Jews, but the Arabs, nobody was afraid for the Arabs there, that time. </sentence><sentence id="2031">Even now, they're not afraid for them. </sentence><sentence id="2032">Whatever's going to happen's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="2033">But it's our land, it's our place, it's our home. </sentence><sentence id="2034">And the biggest mistake what I did in my life is when I came here to this country. </sentence><sentence id="2035">Maybe God punished me for this. </sentence><sentence id="2036">What I went through here, a lot of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And there maybe I would avoid everything and wouldn't come to me so much trouble as it came here. </sentence><sentence id="2038">I left because I wasn't afraid that it was a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="2039">My husband went to work, and he work, he could work. </sentence><sentence id="2040">He went, he never had this, he never worked on this work what he went on, construction. </sentence><sentence id="2041">Anything. </sentence><sentence id="2042">We went there to the people, they're called Sokinote (ph), where they're giving specialty places, you know, office where they're giving fair to work. </sentence><sentence id="2043">So they said, on person was sitting, like a heavy man, he said, "I have all of this work, I can't give you no other one, I don't have it". </sentence><sentence id="2044">So this is the only thing, my husband took the work and the only thing what I said to him, I said, "how many times we have to get through everything, to start from the beginning". </sentence><sentence id="2045">And that's what start. </sentence><sentence id="2046">We had our home, like they gave us, the government, we had to pay a certain amount money, and they build specially homes for the new come in, and we had already established. </sentence><sentence id="2047">I had two bedrooms, and I was so happy, and I was

already the work. </sentence><sentence id="2049">And the language, it wasn't for me like it was here, I knew a little bit but I forgot, you know, when I was a child I was. </sentence><sentence id="2050">But my daughter went to school and she start to talk right away in Hebrew, in fact she went to the second grade, and they were happy and I was happy with them. </sentence><sentence id="2051">Then all of a sudden came the visa with my sister. </sentence><sentence id="2052">I was so unhappy to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2053">I left only because I had my sister here, otherwise I would never, never in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2054">Here start again, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2055">All those with hard times, with everything. </sentence><sentence
