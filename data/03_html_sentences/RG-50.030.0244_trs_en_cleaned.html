<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: By the way, talking about the farmhouses and the little towns that you came to, what was the reaction of the people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: They were...the farm houses over there...it was...some of the tanks...there was 2 or 3 times that our tank that we had we'd be going down the hill and we make a turn, and we slide into the farm house, and just knock a hole. </sentence><sentence id="234">You see the farm house...the people lived on top of the farmhouse, and the, uh, uh, cows and everything was in the bottom of the farm house. </sentence><sentence id="235">And they were good people there. </sentence><sentence id="236">They were good people and they...the Vermark, I don't believe wanted war. </sentence><sentence id="237">I don't believe they wanted war. </sentence><sentence id="238">I mean 2 or 3 of them surrendered to me, just walked up and surrendered to me. </sentence><sentence id="239">And, uh, uh, I don't believe...now of course the SS they were very staunch and they wanted to do everything what they wanted to do, and they are very cold hearted people I guess you might put it in that they cared about nothing, but only the father land and they believed that that...uh...we would have our hardest battles with the Panzer Division which was right close to the SS and uh, uh, they were hard. </sentence><sentence id="240">They were good fighters. </sentence><sentence id="241">I mean they are not...you could never take that away from them, they were very good fighters, and they fight to the bitter end, "til they died, you see. </sentence><sentence id="242">And, uh, I lost a lot of friends in battle. </sentence><sentence id="243">I seen battle. </sentence><sentence id="244">I was in battle, and one of my dear friends who was one...was a tank driver...his name was Buckles...Captain Brennan told him a thousand times that when you go into battle, you buckle up. </sentence><sentence id="245">Down with the Buckles couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="246">He had to have his head up, and they blew his head off. </sentence><sentence id="247">And I have had a lot of friends of mine that died in... We would stay...I hope this gets to some of the old timers. </sentence><sentence id="248">If we would get into a farm house and it was vacant, and we got to sleep at night we would try to get in where...close up to where they shoot...if they were going to shoot that morning, they would shoot through the windows, and we would be under there avoiding them, you see. </sentence><sentence id="249">Avoiding the bullets, avoiding the bullets because they would shoot in, and they would go to the door on the other end, but we were close over by the war. </sentence><sentence id="250">Let me specify that. </sentence><sentence id="251">And it's a great feeling to get up in the morning, and you don't know if you are going to die or not, that you lived and that you...that you...it's just a great feeling when it was all over with that you can say you lived and we moved out many times early morning to go fight, but not fight at night. </sentence><sentence id="252">Not until that daybreak because you had to see what's going on, and you would...you could...uh...the...we would fight and then if it's too heavy, the big tanks would come in and they would make a diamond. </sentence><sentence id="253">And I seen a lot of American boys...I knew I was in that tank...and I knew there were American infantry men all around me, and they were...the only protection they had was that tank or a tank, and they were outside and I was in. </sentence><sentence id="254">However, if the tank was hit, one of our Lieutenants, Lieutenant Benslak, his tank was hit. </sentence><sentence id="255">He burned up in it. </sentence><sentence id="256">Everybody burns if it is hit properly enough. </sentence><sentence id="257">And see, these memories I have for 40 years.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Yes, we did. </sentence><sentence id="295">But we didn't...we didn't...we knew there were...we were starting to get the stories from other people, but we never witnessed this until we got into this camp itself and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: What were some of the stories? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Well, we sort of figured that the Jews were kept in concentration camp, you know, like Dachau, uh, uh, Auschwitz, and, uh, but these were all hearsay third party, fourth party things, and, uh, uh, we would hear that just like if our...our...uh...when we get mail, and they would. </sentence><sentence id="301">We would get...our mail would come up to us, you know what I mean, and "Did you hear about this? </sentence><sentence id="302">You know there's a concentration camp, you know, maybe up this way or 200 miles or 500 miles or something like that see." </sentence><sentence id="303">But it never phased me. </sentence><sentence id="304">I never...I never bothered about it. </sentence><sentence id="305">I never...I didn't...I was too concerned looking out for my own life, and everybody else was. </sentence><sentence id="306">When you are in war, you don't have to tell a man to clean his gun. </sentence><sentence id="307">He will take care of that. </sentence><sentence id="308">He don't want to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="309">And these are the things of life. </sentence><sentence id="310">And so but anyhow, we.. getting back to my story, we proceeded into Austria in the lower end where all the lakes were and the forests were and we were mostly on a...we were sort of like on a patrol unit, you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="311">Cause you can't fight too well in the forests, in the woods and everything. </sentence><sentence id="312">It's hard to go by, and these are facts. </sentence><sentence id="313">I know. </sentence><sentence id="314">I don't know what any other body said, but I know. </sentence><sentence id="315">So we went into this area, and we got there about 2 o'clock in the morning, and we started hearing moans, but the tanks always moved. </sentence><sentence id="316">You know what I mean, a little bit every bit, but we got into this area about 2 o'clock. </sentence></p></dialogue>
