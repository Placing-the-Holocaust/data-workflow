they have to report, and it said for work only for labor. </sentence><sentence id="430">But my mother got around and they started to get rumors to rumors already that specially girls that they put girls in whore houses, that they used the Jewish girls for the soldiers and that's all she had to hear. </sentence><sentence id="431">So she wasn't going to let us down. </sentence><sentence id="432">We weren't going to go to any forced labor and we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="433">But then one day this lady got the letter. </sentence><sentence id="434">She has to report then and then for labor. </sentence><sentence id="435">It always said for labor. </sentence><sentence id="436">So uh she came, the boy came running to us. </sentence><sentence id="437">Mrs.Blochman, my mother wants go to labor camp and please help us. </sentence><sentence id="438">I don't want to go and so my mother went over there and she said start packing. </sentence><sentence id="439">They lived with a family that had a grocery store downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the country with, to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them. </sentence><sentence id="440">And you and will go away like here is punctual and you can go under  7 the meantime in France had started the deportations already. </sentence><sentence id="441">And the people like my father and, they were in this French camp. </sentence><sentence id="442">had come and the  8 they, but we got through that. </sentence><sentence id="443">So we got the little hotel room and we stayed overnight and then when they, I think next morning, we went for breakfast into like a cafe, you know, this little French town, and we were all sitting around and here comes, in a round, ina round table with the children, and here comes the SS, comes in and looks because we weren't the only ones. </sentence><sentence id="444">I mean that the way to Switzerland and we weren't the only ones going to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="445">And they were trying uh to catch as many as possible but they didn't want to make uh very big thing out of it so they just went, came into the cafe and looked and looked and our hearts stood still. </sentence><sentence id="446">It was like you know, like you're frozen in time. </sentence><sentence id="447">You know, we don't and then he looked at each other and he said no, I don't think there are any here. </sentence><sentence id="448">And they left you know. </sentence><sentence id="449">And you die a little bit at a time. </sentence><sentence id="450">So that was really the closest we came with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="451">And then this young man told us uh we're coming very close to the Swiss border now and they are even more vigilant and more uh you know, so he won't go. </sentence><sentence id="452">He doesn't want to jeopardize the this underground. </sentence><sentence id="453">You know, they don't want him to, and we are on our own now. </sentence><sentence id="454">But we should look in this village there on the French uh Swiss border, we should look around and ask for a guy named Gerard (ph) and Gerard will take us over the border. </sentence><sentence id="455">He knows we are coming and he will take us over. </sentence><sentence id="456">Well, we got off the train didn't go to this village. </sentence><sentence id="457">We got off before and we were afraid to go all on the same bus so we sent this lady with the smaller children on the bus and mother and I were walking. </sentence><sentence id="458">And we were walking on the highway with our little attache case and two women it looked kind of in in city clothes after all, and we looked a little bit conspicuous I guess. </sentence><sentence id="459">So the French gendarme stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="460">And he really questioned us. </sentence><sentence id="461">Questioned our papers and he heard as a Frenchman more than the Germans that our French wasn't up to par and we said well, we are from and we always spoke German but well, it was a long story and but finally my mother said, look, uh you hate the Germans don't you. </sentence><sentence id="462">And he said yes, I hate the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="463">I said more than you hate the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="464">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="465">So, she said, what do you want from us. </sentence><sentence id="466">Let us take our chances. </sentence><sentence id="467">You know, she didn't tell we're Jews, we're not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="468">So he says OK. </sentence><sentence id="469">I'll, he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="470">So we went to this village. </sentence><sentence id="471">We came to this village and we couldn't locate Gerard. </sentence><sentence id="472">And wherever we asked for Gerard they just froze. </sentence><sentence id="473">The people froze up. </sentence><sentence id="474">So we stayed one night and there was a lot of German soldiers in this village and we were very scared. </sentence><sentence id="475">So we said, well, we have to get out of here because here they will catch us. </sentence><sentence id="476">So here we started walking again, and we walked up the highway and we came up to a little country inn. </sentence><sentence id="477">So we got in there and we asked for two rooms for the two families and there we were. </sentence><sentence id="478">And I think that people knew who we were. </sentence><sentence id="479">You know in German we have a saying when you die and you don't leave any money for the funeral, he says we're going to smell him out. </sentence><sentence id="480">You know, it's going to smell. </sentence><sentence id="481">They're going to have to bury us with a . </sentence><sentence id="482">So we're going to sit here until we smell, till  9 They gave us uh old aprons like this farm women are wearing and they hid, they put us on the hay wagon and the, the children, they were hiding in the hay and they gave us milk cans. </sentence><sentence id="483">You know there were milk canson _ like we were farmers" women that were going on the, coming home from uh milking cows or something. </sentence><sentence id="484">And they hiding our little bit of luggage under the hay and they took us back; the highway that was the way was back to the village. </sentence><sentence id="485">Oh, I forgot to tell, I went back one day with this young man, with this with this boy, to the village to ask again for Gerard, and I found out that he had been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="486">That's why everybody was so afraid to even mention his name. </sentence><sentence id="487">So we went back, they had to go back to this village in order to get to the border. </sentence><sentence id="488">And the letter carrier, they went around the dinner hour when the German border patrol was having dinner and they knew exactly by observation what time, but still, to make sure, the letter carrier on his bicycle went right in front of us, ahead of us to make sure that we don't run into any patrols or anything. </sentence><sentence id="489">So he went ahead and we came on that hay wagon and they brought us to the farm right on the border and we got out and we got, each got a glass of milk yet and that was the farm was like a hundred years ago and | can still see it and they said well, that's as far as we can go. </sentence><sentence id="490">You go down here in the back of us is like a ravine and there's a little brook. </sentence><sentence id="491">We go over the brook but there is barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="492">You have to go through this barbed wire or over or under or whatever, and on the other side is Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="493">Good luck. </sentence><sentence id="494">So that little girl had a pacifier and we, we went down this ravine and we went over the brook and we went up the other side and that little girl lost her pacifier and started screaming bloody murder, but we still made it and we came over the border and uh but the Swiss border guard had heard her all the way across and he came and he helped us and you know, and we were kind of happy, but my mother said let's go, let's go little bit further in. </sentence><sentence id="495">They can still send us back, and you know, we'll celebrate later. </sentence><sentence id="496">So we got but he was good. </sentence><sentence id="497">In the meantime in the beginning of the deportations, the Swiss didn't let anybody in. </sentence><sentence id="498">And they turned back a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="499">But in the meantime, we came a little bit later already, the public opinion had forced them to take them in, especially women and children and we had no man with us, so he wasn't going to turn us back anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="500">So he took us, I don't think to another hotel by the way. </sentence><sentence id="501">He took us to a little, to, to a town where there was a bigger uh police headquarters and uh we stayed overnight and we had he stayed with us and he even watched us when we went to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="502">He stood in front of the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="503">I mean he didn't let us get out of sight and uh my mother said by the way, we're not free. </sentence><sentence id="504">They watch us. </sentence><sentence id="505">They treat us nicely but we're not going to stay. </sentence><sentence id="506">So we tried to call our relatives in Zurich but we couldn't uh commu.., there was no communication. </sentence><sentence id="507">I don't remember any more. </sentence><sentence id="508">We couldn't tell them that we were in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="509">So uh we told them of course right way that these papers are false, and we gave them our right papers, our right names. </sentence><sentence id="510">We had no papers to the effect but we gave them our right names and and everything and they were OK. </sentence><sentence id="511">I  0 to the I don't remember anymore but they uh we spoke enough French to know that the prison is a prison is a prison, but it was a different word it was different they said a different word that we didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="512">Well, we understood pretty soon, pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="513">We came to this prison that must have been five hundred years old. </sentence><sentence id="514">The keys were this big. </sentence><sentence id="515">They had you know, thick walls and thick and they, right away they separated this lady from her family. </sentence><sentence id="516">They took the son. </sentence><sentence id="517">He was only ten or twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="518">They took him to stay with other men and she and her daughter went in one room and mother and I were in another in another cell, and uh as a matter of fact the first cell had only one bed and we didn't know how, so we slept like this, like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="519">We had funny things that happening too you know. </sentence><sentence id="520">like I said the key was so big and the key hole was that big too, so I was laying in bed like this and all of a sudden I said mother, somebody is looking at me, somebody is looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="521">She said who's going to look. </sentence><sentence id="522">So anyhow there was a prisoner outside that had it wasn't you know a penitentiary or anything. </sentence><sentence id="523">It was an old jail where people was kept and all of a sudden I see, there comes a knife with a pad of butter through this key hole. </sentence><sentence id="524">And this was apparently in __ or something that could order his own food in there and he had wonderful breakfast and he wanted us to have a pad of butter. </sentence><sentence id="525">Oh, we had all kinds of . . . </sentence><sentence id="526">then we heard singing. . . </sentence><sentence id="527">Hebrew songs, Jewish songs, singing. </sentence><sentence id="528">And there was another group of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="529">They wanted us to know that they are there. </sentence><sentence id="530">You know, they couldn't communicate with us any different way, so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were, they had time out in the morning to make their beds and to empty their sinks (ph) and so you know they kept us in the cells, but when they were, when the regular prisoners were in their cells during the day, then they kept us, we could go out in the hallways. </sentence><sentence id="531">And they were great big hallways with and we met with the other refugees and you know, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="532">And we, we got food and we uh the basement they had bathtubs. </sentence><sentence id="533">We could even take a bath. </sentence><sentence id="534">And not everyday but you know, they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="535">But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know, the regular Jewish mother. </sentence><sentence id="536">So one day she said to this, to the , can't I get anything else for my  1 food until at night and we got the whole meal at night and it was OK. </sentence><sentence id="537">But then mother and I we were the only ones left and it got colder already and we didn't have any clothes so there was one family in had a beautiful department store, wealthy Swiss Jews and they always came visiting and see, to see what they can do for the refugees and uh when you know it got colder then uh mother said to them we really don't have any clothes and you know Switzerland is, gets cold pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="538">Oh, they said, there's no problem. </sentence><sentence id="539">And he asked the prison warden, you know, can these people come to my store and pick out clothes, and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="540">So was a very strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="541">They opened the gates and mother and I we walked out and we went to the store, and the lady invited us up for tea. </sentence><sentence id="542">We had beautiful tea in the salon with cake and you know, like real people and he took us around in the store, and he said pick out what you need you know, was for winter and it became a habit. </sentence><sentence id="543">We went every day we went out walking and five o'clock we went back to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="544">You know, there was no place else to go. </sentence><sentence id="545">Was home. </sentence><sentence id="546">But of course not for very long. </sentence><sentence id="547">Then I got sick and we got to the Salvation Army and we stayed at the Salvation Army a little bit and then in the meantime this Mrs. Matulski and her two children came the same way we came and she was a very nervous person so she took some sleeping pills and she slept through the border. </sentence><sentence id="548">She was, and the boy was already you know children have to grow up pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="549">He gave the policemen the the patrol their papers and she slept. </sentence><sentence id="550">So they thought if this lady sleep so well she can't be very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="551">So they made it too. </sentence><sentence id="552">And they were already in a camp uh like they called lager it was the beginning where people got processed. </sentence><sentence id="553">And she wrote to Mother we are here and it's very nice. </sentence><sentence id="554">We even have curtains on the window. </sentence><sentence id="555">We have and it's not so bad and why don't you try coming here. </sentence><sentence id="556">So while we were at the Salvation Army, we went to this to the police to the you know, and my mother said we have friends at this camp. </sentence><sentence id="557">We wouldn't mind going there. </sentence><sentence id="558">So he said Mrs. Blachman, I don't think  2 an school in France at uh one night they was going to be deported and the policemen came to the director of that____ school and said, send your oldest ones, the ones that you think can make it on their own, out tonight because tomorrow morning the SS is coming to take all the kids. </sentence><sentence id="559">So he was seventeen, eighteen, in the meantime and the director gave them whatever they could and money or whatever little, and he had made it to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="560">Like over five or six weeks he walked, in hotels and he walked at night and slept in daytime and he spoke beautiful French. </sentence><sentence id="561">He was very talented with languages. </sentence><sentence id="562">Spoke a perfect French. </sentence><sentence id="563">He worked for a time in the French youth group and they had trouble with them and I don't know how he made it to Geneva coming from south of France. </sentence><sentence id="564">He made it in to Geneva and in Geneva he got on the train. </sentence><sentence id="565">He was never caught. </sentence><sentence id="566">He was never__ and he traveled to Zurich to his uncle and he presented he had an uncle or a relative in Zurich and he presented himself there. </sentence><sentence id="567">And uh the uncle said I am very happy but you can't stay with me for the rest of... you have to go to the police and present yourself, you know, tell them. </sentence><sentence id="568">So they sent him to a different camp but not back you know. </sentence><sentence id="569">So he wrote to my relatives we had given each other the addresses so in case you know there were, and here he is also in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="570">And uh so the next spring by coincidence he got into what called . </sentence><sentence id="571">That was also nearby but maybe two hours by foot from my camp to his camp. </sentence><sentence id="572">And uh at that time we weren't allowed to go much yet but he sent, some other young man came and told me about him and maybe we could use telephone or something, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="573">But anyhow we got together and that's really when our courtship started and we walked and walked to get to each other you know. </sentence><sentence id="574">It was down to and up through the fields and there were beautiful cherry orchards in the summer and the things were... Each had to walk an hour to meet and then we started walking because there was no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="575">I mean we couldn't you know was a very strange courtship but... Sometimes we met in the little town in the winter and we sat in the tearoom and had uh coffee or tea or called cafe in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="576">Was this  3 stuck it out. </sentence><sentence id="577">He came back one weekend to see me and then finally my papers came through and I came to Bern too and we were together. </sentence><sentence id="578">I mean he stayed, he had to live there under very bad conditions and very dirty conditions. </sentence><sentence id="579">You know, but  4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="755">Q: Yeah, bring us to the close of the war. </sentence><sentence id="756">Tell us what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="759">A: Well, by then the war was almost over. </sentence><sentence id="760">As a matter of fact on the on the, I have a newspaper uh Bern, from Bern, where the headline is Hitler is dead, on the thirtieth, I think it was the thirtieth of April, 1945, and then the, and the civil column was of our marriage announcement. </sentence><sentence id="761">It's in the same paper, and was a big headline you know. </sentence><sentence id="762">And so uh, well sure there was uh the the landing in in France you know, when the Americans landed in France and we were listening to the radio, but we were powerless. </sentence><sentence id="763">We couldn't participate. </sentence><sentence id="764">We could only listen and hope and pray that the war will end. </sentence><sentence id="765">Then slowly came the news out about the concentration camps, but it came only at the very end that we heard about the liberation of the camps and what went on there. </sentence><sentence id="766">We had no, we didn't know anything about that. </sentence><sentence id="767">So we had no more, you know, we didn't hear from my father anymore and as a matter of fact long afterwards somebody told us, I don't know if this is the truth or not, that he was put into one of those famous uh railway cars and that they died in there, that he never made it to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="768">I don't know whether this is reliable truth or not, but that's what we heard from people who said they knew him. </sentence><sentence id="769">And my mother's brother didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="770">He was in Drancy. </sentence><sentence id="771">He was sent back. </sentence><sentence id="772">And my grandparents and my husband's parents and actually only Mother and I made it through you know, through Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="773">So we went, when the Red Cross sent us back to Brussels after a few months, about six or seven months after the end of the war, and my son was born there three years, two years, three years later, and we actually all wanted to go to Ecuador. </sentence><sentence id="774">I have an uncle in, my husband had an uncle in Ecuador and after that didn't materialize it was always a delay and all things so my step-father, my mother had remarried in the meantime, and my, the brother of my step father had a farm in , New Jersey and he said if you'd like to come, you know, and we started working then we had to, started at the blouse factory after I had been working in Switzerland for blouses and I had uh taken some private lessons from the uh lady who did the models and who did the patterns. </sentence><sentence id="775">I went at night to her place and learned that too, because the sewing alone wasn't enough, so I did this and my step father helped cut and my mother started selling and we had a beautiful little business going. </sentence><sentence id="776">But like I said they presented us with the signature then that we were, we had promised to leave and our status was semi-legal. </sentence><sentence id="777">I mean they prolonged, every six months they prolonged our papers you know. </sentence><sentence id="778">But we weren't citizens and then my son was born and he, they made him , not an  5 wonderful wives and children and they are full American and you know, like born here and this was the right decision I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
