<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Tell me about growing up in Breslau. </sentence><sentence id="28">What was it like? </sentence><sentence id="29">What did your parents do? </sentence><sentence id="30">What was it like to be a child in that town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: Well, I was an only child. </sentence><sentence id="36">Had no brothers and sisters and I had my grandparents there. </sentence><sentence id="37">I had my mother's both parents and my father's mother. </sentence><sentence id="38">And we had friends. </sentence><sentence id="39">I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="40">Went to, to four years of uh public school and then uh to up to four years you have to made a, a decision what kind of schooling you want. </sentence><sentence id="41">You have to, you can go either go on to the unit to the public school or you can go to the gymnasium (ph) and there were also two choices. </sentence><sentence id="42">You can go to a humanistic gymnasium where they learn Latin and Greek and little mathematics and little science or you could go to the other school where I went. </sentence><sentence id="43">We had, we started right away with French and the sciences. </sentence><sentence id="44">No Latin or Greek but French, modern languages, French and later English. </sentence><sentence id="45">But you had to go to school very little was exams, even then at ten years of age we had a whole day of exam to be able to get into this gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="46">So I passed that exam and I went to the Catholic school. </sentence><sentence id="47">That was already uh shortly before Hitler came to power so I went to the Catholic school for girls only. </sentence><sentence id="48">And uh, I think right after, I don't know, must have been right afterwards that Hitler came to power and the anti-Semitism started right away and then I had trouble with some children. </sentence><sentence id="49">Some children stayed with me and became very close friends and said don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="50">But others started right away, I don't want to sit next to the Jewish girl. </sentence><sentence id="51">I don't want to the Jews smell and I don't want to sit with her and they had uh religious instructions. </sentence><sentence id="52">You know in the Catholic school especially they had a lot of religion and of course we didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="53">We had still a religious, a Jewish uh teacher come to the school and we had extra, different uh religious instruction. </sentence><sentence id="54">So that set us apart uh right away and uh, but in the beginning it wasn't too bad you know. </sentence><sentence id="55">In in 1933, "34 it wasn't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="56">As a matter of fact I was a pretty good athlete in sports, you know, sports and Hitler put a lot of emphasis on sports so, I think in 1935 or so they uh had like little Olympics for young people and all over Germany they had to come and do a certain program and if you passed that program you got a certificate. </sentence><sentence id="57">So that swimming in  clothes and a uh certain distance and we had to jump from a ten meter board and had to run and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="58">And when you passed it I got a little, I got a certificate signed by Hitler that I passed that thing, so it wasn't you know, and the Catholic school, the the uh principal was a lady and she was very much for us and helped us overcome these things. </sentence><sentence id="59">But after a couple of years or so she called me into the office or called my parents and said they are no longer able to keep us in the Catholic school. </sentence><sentence id="60">I either have to leave the school altogether or go to a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="61">So luckily we had in Breslau a very good Jewish gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="62">We had actually two Jewish schools and this gymnasium was accredited like any other school like here the Jewish Hebrew Academy that is accredited now. </sentence><sentence id="63">And II knew a little bit of Hebrew but I was always very ambitious so I, I had, I took tutoring to get better in Hebrew so I could be up to par with the other kids who had started there. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had a lot of Hebrew, a lot of but all the other subjects I started where my English we had a very good English teacher and he was a stickler for uh grammatic and we learned very well the irregular verbs and all those things so we had a very good schooling there. </sentence><sentence id="65">That was only two years I think you know but it was very intensive and very good. </sentence><sentence id="66">And uh I was a member of the Zionist youth movement there which, I don't know and uh we had meetings and we had outings but I was the private, I was the single daughter so my father was always protective and I couldn't go very much to outings and to things but I went to meetings and uh we talked about youth going to Israel and to , to you know these little cans where we were prepared to live in kibbutz in Israel but uh they wouldn't give me the permit and the permit and so finally I, one day I said I have to go Berlin to the headquarters of the Zionist movement and see what's the trouble. </sentence><sentence id="67">So I went there all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="68">We had family in, in Berlin that I stayed with, and here they told me they can't give me the certificate, can't give me the permission to go because of my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="69">The eyes have to I am very nearsighted and uh they are afraid that if I do agricultural work, if I stoop very much that I'm going to have, my retina is going to uh depart, separate from the eye and they wouldn't give me, they have to have consultations and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="70">So I couldn't, I couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="71">So when I had to leave the school and my parents knew that we're going to have to leave Germany you know pretty soon, in Germany was the custom that almost every, every middle-class family had a maid. </sentence><sentence id="72">So the kids would grow up, we didn't do very much. </sentence><sentence id="73">We didn't know very much of household work and cooking and things like that, so my mother said you have to learn because we're certainly not going to have a maid any longer. </sentence><sentence id="74">So they sent me to Hausen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="75">That was a Jewish household school near Munich and uh, I went there from in April, the German school year goes from April to April, not from September like here. </sentence><sentence id="76">I went in April and I came back for some vacation in the summer . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: What year is this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: This was in 1938, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="123">Yeah, "38. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="127">You are how old? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Fif... I was born in "23 so fifteen, fifteen, sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="129">And us that was clear across Germany near Munich. </sentence><sentence id="130">From Breslau to Munich was quite a ... and uh I went back in September and in early November uh they had this uh in Paris on this on this ambassador </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="134"> so you know what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="135">On the ninth of November we were sitting near the radio and we were listening and we knew something terrible is going to happen but we didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="136">And we were there, all young kids, young girls and uh so sure enough on the tenth of November that year the police came and the SS came to wake us up at six o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="137">Out, out, out of bed. </sentence><sentence id="138">You couldn't take anything only the clothes you know, we were there for a year. </sentence><sentence id="139">We had all our belongings there clothes and books and everything. </sentence><sentence id="140">They said no, no, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="141">Get out, out of the thing. </sentence><sentence id="142">So here we stood outside and uh the uh direct... director and the teachers wanted us to go home but there was no money, so they took us back to Munich and we stayed at the uh at the uh, uh station till they got the money together. </sentence><sentence id="143">We were maybe fifty, sixty girls from that school to send and get the railroad tickets to send everybody home. </sentence><sentence id="144">So by the time I got on the train was already afternoon and I was the only one from Breslau at this time so I was all alone on that train and really heard, heard only fragments of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="145">So I had to stay over and change trains on a little town so I got there about ten at night and I was afraid to stay alone on the in the station so I went to the nearest hotel and got myself a room and told them at five o'clock they should wake me up and bring me here back and went back to the station and back on that train. </sentence><sentence id="146">And here comes a whole bunch of SS people and sit in the same compartment with me. </sentence><sentence id="147">And start talking and telling the stories about the Kristallnacht how they were, uh how they smashed all the windows and how the synagogues were burning and how many people they arrested and beat up and so uh I got more and more scared. </sentence><sentence id="148">What will I find at home? </sentence><sentence id="149">Will I find my parents? </sentence><sentence id="150">Will I find, how will I ... so I got to this, to Breslau about two in the afternoon and uh uh the station was right in the middle of town so I took the trolley car and I saw already all the Jewish stores, all the stores the glass was on the ___ and here we passed by the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="151">The synagogue was still not burning but smoldering and I saw what happened. </sentence><sentence id="152">And I came home. </sentence><sentence id="153">Nobody was home. </sentence><sentence id="154">So, but after a while my mother came and told me that they were arresting all the men so my father had been hiding at his mother's house because there was no men in that house and my grandfather too was not arrested, but uh most Jewish men were arrested that night and many in smaller towns were beat up but I, I stayed home then for the winter and we knew then and there that the time has come to leave. </sentence><sentence id="155">Before that time, if I may go back, I was fifteen like I say, fourteen, fifteen, and I wasn't so emerged in in daily living or making a living and I always knew that we're going to have a terrible end in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="156">I couldn't figure out, you know, that they're going to burn us and kill us but I always had the feeling that they had in mind to to to have us die somehow. </sentence><sentence id="157">I always thought they're not going to give us any food coupons anymore and they're going to starve us to death and I begged my parents, let's get out, let's get out, and my father had a very good boss and he unfortunately loved him and said as long as you're with us we're going to keep you and you're going to make a living and he he put in a non Jew into the office and did all kinds of things to keep him there and uh that of course was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="158">So by the time they realized that time was up for us it was already pretty late and no other country took in Jews. </sentence><sentence id="159">The only possibility at this time  was to go to Shanghai and uh my parents didn't want to go to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="160">So they managed, we had a cousin in Cuba and after many weeks of communications, we, she sent us a so called visa to go to Cuba and my parents purchased us seat (ph) uh the the cabin space on the Havana (ph) American line, on the St. Louis, and we were supposed to leave on I think was the 13th of May. </sentence><sentence id="161">Now to be on the personal side, on the 24th of April I had my sixteenth birthday. </sentence><sentence id="162">And my parents thought well you know, I had such terrible youth, at least she wants to make me a little party and I had a friend and he said uh can I bring another friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="163">And my mother said yes, and I had some very good girl friends that uh my parents are friends with their parents from way back from World War | already, and so we had a little party, and he brought this boy. </sentence><sentence id="164">And he had come from so and that's how I met him. </sentence><sentence id="165">That was my future husband. ( </sentence><sentence id="166">PAUSE) So a couple of days later these friends, these, they were two sisters and their parents left for Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="167">And uh this young man Marcos (ph) said we'll go together to the station to say goodbye to them, and I met him again and he gave me, had given me a book so I went up and I met his mother. </sentence><sentence id="168">I went up to his apartment and I went and met his mother for the only time. </sentence><sentence id="169">And he told me that uh he wants to leave but his parents are quite old already and his father got quite beaten in this smaller town in during the Kristallnacht and he won't be able to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="170">So his mother wrote, he was also an only child, his mother will bring him to to the Belgian border and he will try to go illegally over the border to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="171">He has a, he had a girlfriend that he met the year before in in some camp and uh her parents have written that they will be willing to take him as a border and he should come to Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="172">They are in Brussels already and he is going to try to go there illegally. </sentence><sentence id="173">So we said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="174">I was going to Cuba and he was going to Brussels, and we were never going to see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="175">So we went uh... a week later or so we said goodbye to my grandparents and uh I must say that to this day that affects me terribly to think back at how we said goodbye to those old people. </sentence><sentence id="176">You know, today I'm as old at this time, they were really old when you were sixty five or sixty you know, and my grandmother was a tiny little woman and she was not well and they just couldn't ... my parents thought we can send for them later on. </sentence><sentence id="177">Otherwise they probably wouldn't have left them. </sentence><sentence id="178">But there was no way at that time to take them along so we had to say goodbye to them and that was a terrible terrible moment. </sentence><sentence id="179">And my other grandmother also. </sentence><sentence id="180">So uh we went to the, to Hamburg. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Just before you get to... slow down a little. </sentence><sentence id="230">We have time. </sentence><sentence id="231">Tell us about your your grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="232">Uh they stayed behind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Yes, they stayed behind and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: What happened to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Well, they were eventually sent to Theresienstadt, this couple, my mother's parents. </sentence><sentence id="242">They were sent to Theresienstadt, but my other grandmother was alone. </sentence><sentence id="243">She was a widow and when she got the order to come to present herself you know to be sent away, she said no, I don't want to do that. </sentence><sentence id="244">I'd rather die peacefully in my kitchen rather than go to this camp  and be killed there. </sentence><sentence id="245">But my other grandparents couldn't do that because they, first of all they were quite religious and they wouldn't commit suicide and uh they lived for each other. </sentence><sentence id="246">They thought they're going to help each other and maybe but and but they both died. </sentence><sentence id="247">I never heard from them. </sentence><sentence id="248">They never came out after the war. </sentence><sentence id="249">But my Grandmother Blachman, my , she was quite a lady and she always had her hair done so she had her hair done and she put on a wonderful, her best dress and she sat in a kitchen chair and opened the gas and went that way. </sentence><sentence id="250">People told us that after the war and we only heard about that later. </sentence><sentence id="251">But that was maybe two years later. </sentence><sentence id="252">And my husband's parents, I still have letters from them. </sentence><sentence id="253">They were sent to uh forced labor in Breslau at first after we left and uh it got harder and harder and they had to leave uh live in smaller and smaller apartments and rooms and they finally were sent to Theresienstadt also and never came back. </sentence><sentence id="254">So where was I? </sentence><sentence id="255">Oh, we were going to Hamburg and uh we, we got on this boat and you know, it's one laughing and one crying out because we knew we never going to come back and we never, we didn't know what the future will bring us but on the other hand we were happy that we left as a family and healthy. </sentence><sentence id="256">My parents were so young in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="257">My mother was 38 years old and my father was in his early forties so there was still the future we thought. </sentence><sentence id="258">And uh on the passage, going there was fine. </sentence><sentence id="259">I had a good time. </sentence><sentence id="260">I was sixteen and I had young men friendly and older uh, young men who taught me how to dance which I never did because in the Zionist Youth Movement you don't dance. </sentence><sentence id="261">You don't put on lipstick and you don't do anything but think of working and you know what. </sentence><sentence id="262">I changed and I had a good time. </sentence><sentence id="263">I played ping pong and I but uh everything of course was very innocent then. </sentence><sentence id="264">It's not like today that he was already twenty years old and I was sixteen but he was a gentlemen and . .. </sentence><sentence id="265">So we came to Havana ... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: Well, I personally didn't think of that. ( </sentence><sentence id="296">OK) Uh we knew that uh the shipping line had uh asked for return tickets and uh it should have told us something but maybe my parents knew. </sentence><sentence id="297">I never thought about that. </sentence><sentence id="298">As a matter of fact when we uh came into Havana there was a big rush at the uh telegraph office on the boat that uh everybody was you know, the ship money, it was German money that would have been useless afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="299">They wanted to send telegrams send telegrams back home we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="300">But my mother also sent a telegram to her parents arrived safely in Havana. </sentence><sentence id="301">You know, and they didn't know much about this either. </sentence></p></dialogue>

it takes today a half hour. </sentence><sentence id="623">At that time it took maybe three quarters of an hour. </sentence><sentence id="624">There were already really good trains. </sentence><sentence id="625">It took all day and we got to Antwerp it was dark and it was full of glass from the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="626">It was worse there than in Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="627">And uh, but there were we weren't the only ones. </sentence><sentence id="628">There were thousands of refugees you know so they herded us to a convent into the basement and we spent the night there. </sentence><sentence id="629">They gave us shelter and uh they gave us breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="630">And it was a terrible night that we'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="631">You know, the bombs were flying and uh we were there down in the cellar and uh with hundreds of other people. </sentence><sentence id="632">So in the morning we got up on the street and here again everything was covered with glass and the only way to go to the French border was the tramway, the tramway that went all the way the co... all along the coast from Antwerp I don't remember any more the last station in Belgium, uh, all little resort places that all along the coast and that tramway used to you know connect these little places. </sentence><sentence id="633">So we went to the end of the line till we found a young boy there that had lost his from this Mrs. Matulski (ph) that was with us from the boat and one of the three children she had gone the same route without us knowing it and she was there in the morning waiting for the tramway and she was a very nervous person, boom boom, she was on the tram with the girl and the boy was a little slower and he was standing there, and so we took him along and we eventually found the mother and the other girl and so we stayed together on this trip, on this what we called the and again something personal. </sentence><sentence id="634">When we got out of this tramway even though I was on the St. Louis and we were four weeks on this, on the water, I had never been on the uh on the shore of the of  the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="635">You know, never seen the beach like that on the ocean and it was in evening and I really remember that that was such an incredible sight, and you know, the peacefulness and in the midst of all this uh turmoil and war and running and then there was the ocean, untouched and beach and the sunset and this is something I have never forgotten in all these years. </sentence><sentence id="636">So we tried. </sentence><sentence id="637">We found a place to stay. </sentence><sentence id="638">I was almost a woman. </sentence><sentence id="639">I was you know and the two ladies and the two children and uh they said the French border is closed. </sentence><sentence id="640">No body can go across the border. </sentence><sentence id="641">But we couldn't go back either. </sentence><sentence id="642">We couldn't go back and we couldn't go forward, so we stayed in this little hotel room and waited. </sentence><sentence id="643">Then one day they said, tomorrow they're going to open the border. </sentence><sentence id="644">You can go. </sentence><sentence id="645">So from there to the border was still a ways to walk, but we walked. </sentence><sentence id="646">That was the only, the only way to go. </sentence><sentence id="647">There was no transportation and there were no buses or anything so if you can picture this, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of people walking to the border and they thought across the border will be safe. </sentence><sentence id="648">It's France. </sentence><sentence id="649">So here comes the famous story of my mother's silver fox. </sentence><sentence id="650">We come to the, to the border and you know, we didn't have much luggage. </sentence><sentence id="651">We didn't have anything, you know, but she wanted the silver fox and she had it like just a stole like so when we came to the border and we showed our German papers, he said, oh no, you can't go through here with German papers. </sentence><sentence id="652">You go back. </sentence><sentence id="653">You can't, we won't let you in. </sentence><sentence id="654">So as the and then the people were pushing from the back and there was a young boy with a bicycle and somehow that wonderful silver fox got tangled up in the uh in the wheels of that bicycle and my mother ran after him. . ;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="863">A: Yeah, well for a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="864">As a matter of fact, that's where I started uh my, my sewing career. </sentence><sentence id="865">Because by this time I was seventeen and my mother said, girl, you'll never go back to school. </sentence><sentence id="866">There's no way. </sentence><sentence id="867">You should learn a trade. </sentence><sentence id="868">And sewing was always my big uh strength. </sentence><sentence id="869">I was very good in Home Economics and sewing in school and in that household school in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="870">I was always good in sewing so she found two Viennese dressmakers who was who were established and they, they uh in  dressmaking, you know. </sentence><sentence id="871">To order. </sentence><sentence id="872">People came and brought their fabrics and so I really learned it there, learned a lot from them to do to do fine sewing and to do fittings and to do that's really where I got my first apprenticeship so to speak, with those two ladies. </sentence><sentence id="873">And uh my mother was able to make a little bit money and we didn't need very much and we finally got our uh the lift, this this box with things from Germany we got them out and uh out of the uh out of the they had been in the warehouse all the time (in storage?) </sentence><sentence id="874">In storage, yes... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="887">Q: What was in the box? </sentence><sentence id="888">What did you have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: There was a very ingenious way of packing. </sentence><sentence id="892">They had made to order boxes like like uh closets and you know, on the one side were some clothes and then there were shelves on the shelves and then, they were sometimes as big as a small room but it was all one great box. </sentence><sentence id="893">So I don't remember any more exactly but I think my mother had uh uh table service that she was able, that we were able to sell and some crystal. </sentence><sentence id="894">No silver. </sentence><sentence id="895">No silver. </sentence><sentence id="896">No gold. </sentence><sentence id="897">That had to be brought to Hitler you know we had to, they allowed us two uh table settings silver a person, one for milk and one for supposedly. </sentence><sentence id="898">And uh, but everything else including jewelry and silver had to be uh brought you know, give them away, but she had the table, so she had beautiful linens. </sentence><sentence id="899">She had uh crystal and things like that that we sold. </sentence><sentence id="900">Little by little we sold it and she made a little bit of money and I must have made some money there too. </sentence><sentence id="901">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="902">Anyhow, we lived. </sentence><sentence id="903">We had a little apartment then in uh in Brussels and on the other side =. </sentence><sentence id="904">Then she made friends with uh Jewish people who had lived there for a long time and they helped us and we got along. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="919">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="920">Tell me about your, the papers that you had at this time. </sentence><sentence id="921">They were... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A: At this time we still had our regular papers. ( </sentence><sentence id="926">OK) And nobody really bothered us because the Germans, you know, that was the beginning of the Germans but, and the and the occupation and the Belgiums were kind of in the background but we got food stamps. </sentence><sentence id="927">I mean not for free but for rationing. </sentence><sentence id="928">That we got. </sentence><sentence id="929">I don't, I guess with our regular papers. </sentence><sentence id="930">I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="937">Q: You brought a Juda, the star. </sentence><sentence id="938">Were you wearing that later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="941">A: In a minute. </sentence><sentence id="942">So in 1942 then they, the Germans started to tighten the screws about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="943">First they said curfew. </sentence><sentence id="944">You had to be home by eight o'clock at night when, you know. </sentence><sentence id="945">And then they started yes to, all the Jews had to wear this star out on their on their outer garments when we were out on the street. </sentence><sentence id="946">And a lot of Belgium people put it on too in solidarity to us. </sentence><sentence id="947">In Sweden, the King of Sweden wore it. </sentence><sentence id="948">A lot of people wore this to be, you know, in, to show solidarity with us. </sentence><sentence id="949">But we were still free. </sentence><sentence id="950">We could still go around with this or without it, not without it, you know, but this is, we could go. </sentence><sentence id="951">Till one day there was a proclamation, all Jews have to go the uh uh City Hall, City Hall and register. </sentence><sentence id="952">Just register. </sentence><sentence id="953">So my mother said, we are not going to register. </sentence><sentence id="954">If they don't know  about us, they you know, that _ I'm not going to register. </sentence><sentence id="955">And this other lady, this Mrs. Matulski, said no, we have we have to, they're going to send us to work you know. </sentence><sentence id="956">We cannot do against it. </sentence><sentence id="957">Too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="958">And she did register, but we never did. </sentence><sentence id="959">So time wore on and it got a little bit worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="960">All of a sudden it started with people catching people on the streets or deportations. </sentence><sentence id="961">And they, on the street they took anybody that had this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="962">They went on trolley cars. </sentence><sentence id="963">They went in the front and in the back of trolley cars, the SS, and nobody could escape and they went through all the people and we had, we had identification papers, Jews. </sentence><sentence id="964">But from the lists that been registered they went from house to house and you know, they had the addresses. </sentence><sentence id="965">They had the people. </sentence><sentence id="966">It was very easy. </sentence><sentence id="967">They went and picked them up. </sentence><sentence id="968">So they sent them letters that they have to report, and it said for work only for labor. </sentence><sentence id="969">But my mother got around and they started to get rumors to rumors already that specially girls that they put girls in whore houses, that they used the Jewish girls for the soldiers and that's all she had to hear. </sentence><sentence id="970">So she wasn't going to let us down. </sentence><sentence id="971">We weren't going to go to any forced labor and we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="972">But then one day this lady got the letter. </sentence><sentence id="973">She has to report then and then for labor. </sentence><sentence id="974">It always said for labor. </sentence><sentence id="975">So uh she came, the boy came running to us. </sentence><sentence id="976">Mrs.Blochman, my mother wants go to labor camp and please help us. </sentence><sentence id="977">I don't want to go and so my mother went over there and she said start packing. </sentence><sentence id="978">They lived with a family that had a grocery store downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the country with, to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them. </sentence><sentence id="979">And you and will go away like here is punctual and you can go under false names and you go there. </sentence><sentence id="980">Nobody knows you there and we will see what happens. </sentence><sentence id="981">Nobody ever sent us a letter but they came closer and closer and they had these deportations so mother made arrangements we should hide like Ann Frank, you know, like in the house only we didn't have that much money and it was very expensive. </sentence><sentence id="982">People didn't do it just for the love only. </sentence><sentence id="983">You know, they, they wanted to be paid and they wanted to be paid for the food at least and for the room so mother and I we went, one night somebody said there's going to be a, said it's going to be uh some you know people going to be picked up tonight so we went into this room. </sentence><sentence id="984">We spent one night there. </sentence><sentence id="985">And I said mother, that's not right. </sentence><sentence id="986">We're going to go crazy. </sentence><sentence id="987">We can't stay here the two of us until the end of the war you know, alone and we don't have enough money to pay her so we came out of hiding the next day. </sentence><sentence id="988">And we had friends and he said, he got us into connection with the French underground. </sentence><sentence id="989">There were already the French underground and there were some uh English uh prisoners of wars that had escaped from Germany and there was an underground route to bring them to Switzerland and from Switzerland to Portugal and back to England. </sentence><sentence id="990">And somehow they got us into connect...into contact with this group and we were the first women that went. </sentence><sentence id="991">Mother and I first. </sentence><sentence id="992">Not this lady. </sentence><sentence id="993">She was still in the and her little girl was in the country and everything was so far so good. </sentence><sentence id="994">So, but we didn't have that much money anymore. </sentence><sentence id="995">You know, when they only took you to the French border you know and then you had to have some money so we got together with another, with a Belgium lady or at least a lady who had lived there, had a business there for a long time, and she had also three children "a little girl was the smallest, was only two years old or three years old. </sentence><sentence id="996">And they said if you help me she said with the children on this trip I'll pay your expenses. </sentence><sentence id="997">So one Sunday, uh  the meantime in France had started the deportations already. </sentence><sentence id="998">And the people like my father and, they were in this French camp. </sentence><sentence id="999">had come and the south of France wasn't free anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Was also German. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So they got all the non-Jewish Germans out of this camp and took the Jews to Drancy. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Drancy was this camp in Paris from where the French Jews were sent to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1003">It's a... so we wanted to go on a Sunday and on Thursday morning we get a card, a postcard from my father from Drancy. </sentence><sentence id="1004">So we knew, and my mother was very upset and she said, you do what you want. </sentence><sentence id="1005">If you want to go, I'll go but she was out of her you know. </sentence><sentence id="1006">So we left everything standing there like we lived you know and our whole apartment, we had everything threes between. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Three blouses and three bras and three this, so we could change. </sentence><sentence id="1008">One changed and the next day somebody, the other one changed. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And we only had little uh like an attache case, that was all our luggage because they told us not to take anything. </sentence><sentence id="1010">But we had some dollar bills. </sentence><sentence id="1011">My mother had some dollars I mean, at that time maybe two hundred or three hundred dollars which was a lot of money then, and that was the most dangerous if, you know, if they found this on you that was immediate death. </sentence><sentence id="1012">But this other money wasn't worth anything. </sentence><sentence id="1013">So this French, that friend, said don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1014">We'll do something so he took a whole loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Everybody stuck it in their shoes and that where the first place the Germans were looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1016">But he was smart. </sentence><sentence id="1017">He took a piece, a whole loaf of bread and he sliced it very fine and two slices, he put the dollar bill in and he sewed the two slices of bread together you know, so you couldn't tell no way, unless you really pulled it away, so we had this bread. </sentence><sentence id="1018">You know, like we wanted to have something to eat on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And he gave us, there's where we got the false papers. </sentence><sentence id="1020">From this underground uh from this underground organization. </sentence><sentence id="1021">With different names and we rehearsed the names over and over and we were supposed to been born in Luxembourg or in so to explain our German accent, that we didn't speak perfect French. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And we got on this on the train and uh with this other lady with the three children, and we we somehow got through. </sentence><sentence id="1023">I mean there was a control on the border, on the French border, and we, we showed our papers and he accepted that. </sentence><sentence id="1024">That was we got through that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1111">Q: How did you, you were coming up to the border </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1113">A: Yeah ... in the train... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1115">Q: ..in the train. </sentence><sentence id="1116">How did that feel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1119">A: Very fine. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I mean, you know, we were but uh we somehow made it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1121">We, we just sat very quietly on our seats. </sentence><sentence id="1122">We were not in the same compartment with the other lady, and then we had somebody with us. </sentence><sentence id="1123">He didn't, from the underground he didn't communicate with us but he had his ears open and he might have heard some uh people reporting to him from the underground or, you know, and we knew he was there. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And he you know it was either that or going to the camp in any event. </sentence><sentence id="1125">I mean the alternative you know, wasn't that much better. </sentence><sentence id="1126">We had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1127">And then we came to a another, then we got out in the next, in this French town I don't remember anymore but there was uh border patrol and SS on the on the exit and they looked everybody over and you know,  they, but we got through that. </sentence><sentence id="1128">So we got the little hotel room and we stayed overnight and then when they, I think next morning, we went for breakfast into like a cafe, you know, this little French town, and we were all sitting around and here comes, in a round, ina round table with the children, and here comes the SS, comes in and looks because we weren't the only ones. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I mean that the way to Switzerland and we weren't the only ones going to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And they were trying uh to catch as many as possible but they didn't want to make uh very big thing out of it so they just went, came into the cafe and looked and looked and our hearts stood still. </sentence><sentence id="1131">It was like you know, like you're frozen in time. </sentence><sentence id="1132">You know, we don't and then he looked at each other and he said no, I don't think there are any here. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And they left you know. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And you die a little bit at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1135">So that was really the closest we came with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And then this young man told us uh we're coming very close to the Swiss border now and they are even more vigilant and more uh you know, so he won't go. </sentence><sentence id="1137">He doesn't want to jeopardize the this underground. </sentence><sentence id="1138">You know, they don't want him to, and we are on our own now. </sentence><sentence id="1139">But we should look in this village there on the French uh Swiss border, we should look around and ask for a guy named Gerard (ph) and Gerard will take us over the border. </sentence><sentence id="1140">He knows we are coming and he will take us over. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Well, we got off the train didn't go to this village. </sentence><sentence id="1142">We got off before and we were afraid to go all on the same bus so we sent this lady with the smaller children on the bus and mother and I were walking. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And we were walking on the highway with our little attache case and two women it looked kind of in in city clothes after all, and we looked a little bit conspicuous I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1144">So the French gendarme stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And he really questioned us. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Questioned our papers and he heard as a Frenchman more than the Germans that our French wasn't up to par and we said well, we are from and we always spoke German but well, it was a long story and but finally my mother said, look, uh you hate the Germans don't you. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And he said yes, I hate the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1148">I said more than you hate the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1150">So, she said, what do you want from us. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Let us take our chances. </sentence><sentence id="1152">You know, she didn't tell we're Jews, we're not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So he says OK. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I'll, he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So we went to this village. </sentence><sentence id="1156">We came to this village and we couldn't locate Gerard. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And wherever we asked for Gerard they just froze. </sentence><sentence id="1158">The people froze up. </sentence><sentence id="1159">So we stayed one night and there was a lot of German soldiers in this village and we were very scared. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So we said, well, we have to get out of here because here they will catch us. </sentence><sentence id="1161">So here we started walking again, and we walked up the highway and we came up to a little country inn. </sentence><sentence id="1162">So we got in there and we asked for two rooms for the two families and there we were. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And I think that people knew who we were. </sentence><sentence id="1164">You know in German we have a saying when you die and you don't leave any money for the funeral, he says we're going to smell him out. </sentence><sentence id="1165">You know, it's going to smell. </sentence><sentence id="1166">They're going to have to bury us with a . </sentence><sentence id="1167">So we're going to sit here until we smell, till they do something with us. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="1169">They they got together and they called the uh, without us talking about it, they knew exactly what what we wanted you know. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Was very close, within walking distance of the Swiss border. </sentence><sentence id="1171">So uh, so they got the the priest and the priest talked it over with some people in the village and they talked it over. </sentence><sentence id="1172">There came the letter carrier. </sentence><sentence id="1173">The letter carrier was going on a bicycle, was always going on a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1174">So they said to us, I mean we paid. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I mean the lady had . </sentence><sentence id="1176">We paid her for what nights we stayed and you know, and uh they sent a hay wagon with clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1177"> They gave us uh old aprons like this farm women are wearing and they hid, they put us on the hay wagon and the, the children, they were hiding in the hay and they gave us milk cans. </sentence><sentence id="1178">You know there were milk canson _ like we were farmers" women that were going on the, coming home from uh milking cows or something. </sentence><sentence id="1179">And they hiding our little bit of luggage under the hay and they took us back; the highway that was the way was back to the village. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Oh, I forgot to tell, I went back one day with this young man, with this with this boy, to the village to ask again for Gerard, and I found out that he had been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1181">That's why everybody was so afraid to even mention his name. </sentence><sentence id="1182">So we went back, they had to go back to this village in order to get to the border. </sentence><sentence id="1183">And the letter carrier, they went around the dinner hour when the German border patrol was having dinner and they knew exactly by observation what time, but still, to make sure, the letter carrier on his bicycle went right in front of us, ahead of us to make sure that we don't run into any patrols or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1184">So he went ahead and we came on that hay wagon and they brought us to the farm right on the border and we got out and we got, each got a glass of milk yet and that was the farm was like a hundred years ago and | can still see it and they said well, that's as far as we can go. </sentence><sentence id="1185">You go down here in the back of us is like a ravine and there's a little brook. </sentence><sentence id="1186">We go over the brook but there is barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="1187">You have to go through this barbed wire or over or under or whatever, and on the other side is Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Good luck. </sentence><sentence id="1189">So that little girl had a pacifier and we, we went down this ravine and we went over the brook and we went up the other side and that little girl lost her pacifier and started screaming bloody murder, but we still made it and we came over the border and uh but the Swiss border guard had heard her all the way across and he came and he helped us and you know, and we were kind of happy, but my mother said let's go, let's go little bit further in. </sentence><sentence id="1190">They can still send us back, and you know, we'll celebrate later. </sentence><sentence id="1191">So we got but he was good. </sentence><sentence id="1192">In the meantime in the beginning of the deportations, the Swiss didn't let anybody in. </sentence><sentence id="1193">And they turned back a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="1194">But in the meantime, we came a little bit later already, the public opinion had forced them to take them in, especially women and children and we had no man with us, so he wasn't going to turn us back anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1195">So he took us, I don't think to another hotel by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1196">He took us to a little, to, to a town where there was a bigger uh police headquarters and uh we stayed overnight and we had he stayed with us and he even watched us when we went to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1197">He stood in front of the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1198">I mean he didn't let us get out of sight and uh my mother said by the way, we're not free. </sentence><sentence id="1199">They watch us. </sentence><sentence id="1200">They treat us nicely but we're not going to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1201">So we tried to call our relatives in Zurich but we couldn't uh commu.., there was no communication. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I don't remember any more. </sentence><sentence id="1203">We couldn't tell them that we were in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So uh we told them of course right way that these papers are false, and we gave them our right papers, our right names. </sentence><sentence id="1205">We had no papers to the effect but we gave them our right names and and everything and they were OK. </sentence><sentence id="1206">I mean they fed us and they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And then in the afternoon, there was a bigger group of us. </sentence><sentence id="1208">They put us on the train and it was a very strange feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1209">You are in a new country, and they do with you what they want. </sentence><sentence id="1210">They put us on the train didn't say a word where we're going or what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And uh they marched us through the city of and there must have been about ten or twelve of us and uh people were looking out the windows. </sentence><sentence id="1212">They'd say ah, the poor people, the poor people, they're going  to the I don't remember anymore but they uh we spoke enough French to know that the prison is a prison is a prison, but it was a different word it was different they said a different word that we didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1213">Well, we understood pretty soon, pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="1214">We came to this prison that must have been five hundred years old. </sentence><sentence id="1215">The keys were this big. </sentence><sentence id="1216">They had you know, thick walls and thick and they, right away they separated this lady from her family. </sentence><sentence id="1217">They took the son. </sentence><sentence id="1218">He was only ten or twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="1219">They took him to stay with other men and she and her daughter went in one room and mother and I were in another in another cell, and uh as a matter of fact the first cell had only one bed and we didn't know how, so we slept like this, like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="1220">We had funny things that happening too you know. </sentence><sentence id="1221">like I said the key was so big and the key hole was that big too, so I was laying in bed like this and all of a sudden I said mother, somebody is looking at me, somebody is looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="1222">She said who's going to look. </sentence><sentence id="1223">So anyhow there was a prisoner outside that had it wasn't you know a penitentiary or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1224">It was an old jail where people was kept and all of a sudden I see, there comes a knife with a pad of butter through this key hole. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And this was apparently in __ or something that could order his own food in there and he had wonderful breakfast and he wanted us to have a pad of butter. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Oh, we had all kinds of . . . </sentence><sentence id="1227">then we heard singing. . . </sentence><sentence id="1228">Hebrew songs, Jewish songs, singing. </sentence><sentence id="1229">And there was another group of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1230">They wanted us to know that they are there. </sentence><sentence id="1231">You know, they couldn't communicate with us any different way, so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were, they had time out in the morning to make their beds and to empty their sinks (ph) and so you know they kept us in the cells, but when they were, when the regular prisoners were in their cells during the day, then they kept us, we could go out in the hallways. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And they were great big hallways with and we met with the other refugees and you know, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And we, we got food and we uh the basement they had bathtubs. </sentence><sentence id="1234">We could even take a bath. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And not everyday but you know, they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1236">But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know, the regular Jewish mother. </sentence><sentence id="1237">So one day she said to this, to the , can't I get anything else for my daughter? </sentence><sentence id="1238">And I said, mother, what do you think we are in prison what are you . . . </sentence><sentence id="1239">Sure enough a couple of days later he comes up with a whole tray with a little steak and other things and I almost died because all these, our poor prisoners, got only water and you know the regular food and here I had a steak, but I guess mothers will be mothers even in prison. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So that little by little everybody was transported away and even this lady with the children I think got out earlier than we did. _ </sentence><sentence id="1241">and we were left just the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="1242">We had Rosh Hashanan there and they had taken us to another little town for, and the women were in the hotel but they didn't have money to put the men in the hotel too. </sentence><sentence id="1243">The men they put in prison there over night but OK. </sentence><sentence id="1244">We were happy then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1372">Q: You got to go to services? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1374">A: We got to go to services and they gave us a very nice meal in the hotel, under surveillance. </sentence><sentence id="1375">They were policemen there, but we met the Jewish people and it was it was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1376">Yom Kippur we spent in prison and there were a couple of men who held services in the cell. </sentence><sentence id="1377">We were, like I said, we could visit during the day and they held our  food until at night and we got the whole meal at night and it was OK. </sentence><sentence id="1378">But then mother and I we were the only ones left and it got colder already and we didn't have any clothes so there was one family in had a beautiful department store, wealthy Swiss Jews and they always came visiting and see, to see what they can do for the refugees and uh when you know it got colder then uh mother said to them we really don't have any clothes and you know Switzerland is, gets cold pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="1379">Oh, they said, there's no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1380">And he asked the prison warden, you know, can these people come to my store and pick out clothes, and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1381">So was a very strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="1382">They opened the gates and mother and I we walked out and we went to the store, and the lady invited us up for tea. </sentence><sentence id="1383">We had beautiful tea in the salon with cake and you know, like real people and he took us around in the store, and he said pick out what you need you know, was for winter and it became a habit. </sentence><sentence id="1384">We went every day we went out walking and five o'clock we went back to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="1385">You know, there was no place else to go. </sentence><sentence id="1386">Was home. </sentence><sentence id="1387">But of course not for very long. </sentence><sentence id="1388">Then I got sick and we got to the Salvation Army and we stayed at the Salvation Army a little bit and then in the meantime this Mrs. Matulski and her two children came the same way we came and she was a very nervous person so she took some sleeping pills and she slept through the border. </sentence><sentence id="1389">She was, and the boy was already you know children have to grow up pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="1390">He gave the policemen the the patrol their papers and she slept. </sentence><sentence id="1391">So they thought if this lady sleep so well she can't be very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So they made it too. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And they were already in a camp uh like they called lager it was the beginning where people got processed. </sentence><sentence id="1394">And she wrote to Mother we are here and it's very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1395">We even have curtains on the window. </sentence><sentence id="1396">We have and it's not so bad and why don't you try coming here. </sentence><sentence id="1397">So while we were at the Salvation Army, we went to this to the police to the you know, and my mother said we have friends at this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1398">We wouldn't mind going there. </sentence><sentence id="1399">So he said Mrs. Blachman, I don't think you want to go there. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I wouldn't like you to go there, but if you want to we will send you there. </sentence><sentence id="1401">So he gave us a policeman and we you know went to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1402">That camp was worse than the prison because the camp was barracks and in the meantime it's November and it's raining and it's muddy and they have a toilet out on the yard and the watchman out in the yard, and my mother got a bladder infection and the food was terrible and we had it was like almost. </sentence><sentence id="1403">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And not only that there were a lot of people from France that we for the first time talked to and found out what my father went through and they told us that my father was deported. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Actually that's where we learned it. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And we saw how terrible these people looked already. </sentence><sentence id="1407">You know, we were still fresh from Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="1408">We hadn't lost so much weight yet and we looked still like people, but these people looked already like they had been through the mill you know, so so it was very depressing and uh there was nothing to do and we were sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1409">We had little curtains on the windows but that didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="1410">So it became winter and we got, we were divided into different camps, and mother and I we went, and this lady too with her daughter, went to uh Leistahl (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1411">That's close to . </sentence><sentence id="1412">And in the meantime I think we had communications with our family in Zurich. </sentence><sentence id="1413">I think we wrote to them from the camp and they wrote back so one day, low and behold I get a postcard to Gerta Blachman from Marcos. </sentence><sentence id="1414">Marcos is also in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1415">He had walked. </sentence><sentence id="1416">He had, he was a member of . </sentence><sentence id="1417">Uh not a member a child in the camp and he was in  an school in France at uh one night they was going to be deported and the policemen came to the director of that____ school and said, send your oldest ones, the ones that you think can make it on their own, out tonight because tomorrow morning the SS is coming to take all the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1418">So he was seventeen, eighteen, in the meantime and the director gave them whatever they could and money or whatever little, and he had made it to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1419">Like over five or six weeks he walked, in hotels and he walked at night and slept in daytime and he spoke beautiful French. </sentence><sentence id="1420">He was very talented with languages. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Spoke a perfect French. </sentence><sentence id="1422">He worked for a time in the French youth group and they had trouble with them and I don't know how he made it to Geneva coming from south of France. </sentence><sentence id="1423">He made it in to Geneva and in Geneva he got on the train. </sentence><sentence id="1424">He was never caught. </sentence><sentence id="1425">He was never__ and he traveled to Zurich to his uncle and he presented he had an uncle or a relative in Zurich and he presented himself there. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And uh the uncle said I am very happy but you can't stay with me for the rest of... you have to go to the police and present yourself, you know, tell them. </sentence><sentence id="1427">So they sent him to a different camp but not back you know. </sentence><sentence id="1428">So he wrote to my relatives we had given each other the addresses so in case you know there were, and here he is also in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And uh so the next spring by coincidence he got into what called . </sentence><sentence id="1430">That was also nearby but maybe two hours by foot from my camp to his camp. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And uh at that time we weren't allowed to go much yet but he sent, some other young man came and told me about him and maybe we could use telephone or something, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1432">But anyhow we got together and that's really when our courtship started and we walked and walked to get to each other you know. </sentence><sentence id="1433">It was down to and up through the fields and there were beautiful cherry orchards in the summer and the things were... Each had to walk an hour to meet and then we started walking because there was no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1434">I mean we couldn't you know was a very strange courtship but... Sometimes we met in the little town in the winter and we sat in the tearoom and had uh coffee or tea or called cafe in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Was this bread and jelly and butter and coffee that's very uh Swiss? </sentence><sentence id="1436">So that's where we started our friendship, our courtship when we got so we were in this working camp and here I sewed. </sentence><sentence id="1437">I was sewing again. </sentence><sentence id="1438">I, there were also the people sent in, donated clothes and there were also some Viennese who seemed to be the best dressmakers and they asked me, I said yes, I know a little bit and there I learned some more. </sentence><sentence id="1439">And we changed, we altered the clothes, these donated clothes, for the for the people in the camp you know. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And uh one day the director of the camp received a uh request, you know if there are young girls in there that know how to sew, there's a shortage of operators like operators you know for uh in a blouse factory in Bern and they would get the papers on the working permission for such a person. </sentence><sentence id="1441">So she asked me would I go. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And I said yes, sure. </sentence><sentence id="1443">You know, to be free and to learn more in my trade. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So was very upset and very heart broken that I would leave and he wouldn't be there. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So the only way for him to be free was to become a dishwasher. </sentence><sentence id="1446">That was also in shortage. </sentence><sentence id="1447">So he put in to go to Bern to be a dishwasher and my, these people put in for me the papers to be an operator. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Well, the dishwashers were needed more than the operators. </sentence><sentence id="1449">He was there in one week. </sentence><sentence id="1450">And he was washing dishes in Bern in a in a restaurant. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And he was quite a spoiled young man but when it came you know from at home, he was an only child but when it, something had to be done, he did it. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And he was alone in Bern and I was alone there in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="1453">But we  stuck it out. </sentence><sentence id="1454">He came back one weekend to see me and then finally my papers came through and I came to Bern too and we were together. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I mean he stayed, he had to live there under very bad conditions and very dirty conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1456">You know, but anyhow, this is so many years back. </sentence><sentence id="1457">So we were there together again and uh I learned a lot in this factory. </sentence><sentence id="1458">That was my first job as a power machine, you know, uh experience on a power machine and uh it was quite a strict thing. </sentence><sentence id="1459">I had to be there very early and I am not an early riser so I had to be there from, they just started to change from uh sixty hour uh from uh from uh six day working day to five days a week and that meant of course more hours every day to put it into five days you know. </sentence><sentence id="1460">They started very early but uh we managed to see each other on weekends. </sentence><sentence id="1461">But he had to work weekends too. </sentence><sentence id="1462">You know, in a restaurant was a different schedule so one day he stuck himself with a fork in the dishpan and he got an infection and couldn't and they sent him to the hospital and he got all bandaged up and he couldn't work so he, his boss said if you can't wash dishes you are no good to me. </sentence><sentence id="1463">You are fired. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="1465">So he came to stay with me in the same building. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Had a little room next door and he stayed there for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And my landlady was very proper and she got very upset and she sent no less the vice police after him and he got arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1468">I mean he got taken in and they took, brought him to the police where he should have reported that he wasn't working anymore you know. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And he, they said well, what's you know, what's the story and he told them and he said that's my fiancee but we can't get married because we have no papers so he says, oh sure, you can get married. </sentence><sentence id="1470">He says do you have any _. </sentence><sentence id="1471">He said yeah, my mother in law is here, you know, her mother is here and I have a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1472">He said well, if they uh certify that this is your name, you can get married. </sentence><sentence id="1473">So we got married.
