<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2398">Q: The -- some of the stories that Mira shared with us today, are they ones that you are familiar with, that you had heard about before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2400">A: Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but -- you know, these were things that were discussed, especially at -- during holiday times, or whenever our Polish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories, and they would start to talk about all these things. </sentence><sentence id="2401">Or just Sunday dinners, you know, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. </sentence><sentence id="2402">Especially my mother. </sentence><sentence id="2403">You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very -- you know, she -- she wo -- she went through so much, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2408">Q: So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I'm clear about, she had to work as a lumberjack? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2410">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2411">She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she was, you know, generally speaking, the -- the Soviets took people who were  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Mira Zimmerman degdeg January 23, 2015 working in the country to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And the people who were in the cities were doing lighter work. </sentence><sentence id="2413">And as Mira was saying, there was no one else f-- to work for them. </sentence><sentence id="2414">It was just my mother. </sentence><sentence id="2415">And so they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the forest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they felled, and -- and yes, there was one occasion when she -- I don't know, you know, she was so tired by then, and -- and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated by the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving Mira, that she didn't end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. </sentence><sentence id="2416">And -- and so this tree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they -- and watched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a pile of rubble, and the -- the branches from this rubble actually cut the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2417">Q: Broke the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2418">A: -- broke the fall. </sentence><sentence id="2419">So she -- she was in there, and they thought -- the Soviets, the brigadier, the supervisor of the -- of the work team thought she was trying to kill herself, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2420">And so they got mad at her for -- for, you know, doing that. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up getting ga new job working -- fixing -- changing the oil on tractors, and also filling -- there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. </sentence><sentence id="2422">And she got paid more for that. </sentence><sentence id="2423">But, you know, in the co -- in the course of all of that, you know, she di-- she  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Mira Zimmerman " January 23, 2015 almost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the Soviets, especially the -- the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or Byelorussian's that were the supervisors in these barracks. </sentence><sentence id="2424">And she would sing Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just really -- she kind of did things that didn't help her, you know, and that's another thing that happened. </sentence><sentence id="2425">So when she went to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were -- they were just -- you know, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn't like her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2435">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2436">I wanted to get a sense of how this -- how this developed, the context of such a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having hay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2439">A: Actually, there were two court incidences. </sentence><sentence id="2440">One was the hay, and then there was another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten -- like gone back to get a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And that one was actually a much more serious one. </sentence><sentence id="2442">But the first time I think they docked her for, I think a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn't getting paid very much anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2443">It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a day. </sentence><sentence id="2444">And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2451">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2452">And did you ever know, or did she ever -- was she ever told why she was deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2455">A: Because she was a landowner. </sentence><sentence id="2456"> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Mira Zimmerman " January 23, 2015 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2457">Q: That's what I thought, that's what I thought. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2458">A: And -- and also, I think they may have also known that her -- they were still married, even though they were separated, her husband was a -- a soldier, you know, he was sergeant in the army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2460">Q: Okay, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2461">All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there's the agreement between the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people who had been citizens of Poland who had been deported, they learned about it from a former prisoner, rather than officials. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2464">A: Right, they -- the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about this, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but they weren't -- they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they escaped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2466">Q: So tell me, this incident what -- that Mira was talking about, where she would be a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an orphanage, was this -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2467">A: Well, that's much later, actually. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2468">Q: Oh, I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2493">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
