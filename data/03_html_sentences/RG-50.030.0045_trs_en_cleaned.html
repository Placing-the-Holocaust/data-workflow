<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Uh, well, we had a lot of pockets of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="94">The German people, the Volksturm and the SS would drive the local farmers into shooting at us. </sentence><sentence id="95">If they didn't shoot at us, they would shoot the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="96">And they made feeble attempts at trying to shoot us naturally and the SS, uh, troops kept moving back in towards the interior of Germany, and, uh, the, well, you know, this went on a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="97">I'm trying to talk here in a few minutes and describe, uh, uh, a couple of months of activity--it's very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="98">The, uh, thing that I remember was we started to see our men being killed and because of our men being killed, a couple here and a couple there, we would kill whole squads of Germans the way they mowed down the, uh, prisoners and, uh, their opponents. </sentence><sentence id="99">And sometimes the hillsides would be covered with bodies of the Americans, or a hillside would be covered with the bodies of the Germans, and then later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in, concentration camp inmates or, uh, slaves on farms, they would, uh, march them ahead of  them trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these people apparently. </sentence><sentence id="100">Anduh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Did you see any of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="112">These bodies were lying along the roadsides where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they were shot because they weren't going fast enough and, uh, it was a terrible thing but, uh, it was practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war. </sentence><sentence id="113">From April 15th to the end of the war we saw this in many places and, uh, uh, the, uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Was that your first contact with concentration camp victims? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Was, was in April, about the 15th of April, yeah, we started to see the where they had been marched ahead of us because, uh, in because of the nature of the spear-heading, the 11th Armored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap, this is the 11th Armored Division, and I was in the 56th Engineers, and that's this little insignia right here which is our uniform insignia. </sentence><sentence id="120">And the 11th Armored patch was ordinarily worn on your shoulder and, uh, there there were several armored divisions. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were one of them. </sentence><sentence id="122">The 4th Armored was a sister division, and we were leap-frogging ahead, uh, in spurts as it were until and then we'd rest for a day or two until the infantry caught up to, to, uh, contain the lands that we had just over-run. </sentence><sentence id="123">And that's when we would see these prisoners who had been walking ahead of us for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="124">We'd catch up to them and we'd see the ones who had been, uh, uh, had died along the roadsides. </sentence><sentence id="125">And by the hundreds in some cases, and then just here and there and then they tried to bury some and they were, made half-hearted attempts because they took too much time to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="126">They were trying to hide the, the ones that had died and then there were so many of them they just left them after a while. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: All right, tell me if you would where you were as you were about to approach Mauthausen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="137">How did you get there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Well, uh, we were in a combat command. </sentence><sentence id="139">And Combat Command A is the one I was in ordinarily. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, we were down in...in Linz. </sentence><sentence id="141">We were, we forked out. </sentence><sentence id="142">A combat command, one would go to the left, one would go to the right and sometimes a third combat command called "CCR," or "Reserve," would take a central point. </sentence><sentence id="143">And there would be three prongs of us armored, uh, divisions spanning out and covering as much territory as we could; and taking it in and and opposing and and mowing down the opposition with our heavy guns, our 75, uh, millimeter guns and three-inch guns on, uh, tank destroyers. </sentence><sentence id="144">And, uh, we kept going and going and until we got to Linz. </sentence><sentence id="145">That was CCA, but CCB went, uh, to the north ofus... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Well, the camp, the doctors started coming in and they had already had, uh, uh, experience April 15th, uh, out in, uh, Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="377">It was one of the biggest ones we overran, which was around April 15th. </sentence><sentence id="378">So by the 5th of May when we got there, and a couple of days later when the engineers got there to, to start digging trenches to bury the dead, uh, they were pretty much, uh, they pretty well knew what they had to do to help these people, so we rushed in supplies and, uh, emergency supplies from, uh, the Army medical, uh, supplies and surplus, uh, Army uniforms and, uh, the, uh, various factories and warehouses around that the Germans had or the Austrians had were utilized to supply foo. </sentence><sentence id="379">We raided those in other words, and we, the civilian population had, was, had to go without. </sentence><sentence id="380">In fact that winter, the following winter, they a lot of them almost starved. </sentence><sentence id="381">Uh, but we were trying to to feed these people. </sentence><sentence id="382">And, uh, our division set up the, uh...and Colonel Seibel was in command, and he was in command of CCB at the time as I mentioned earlier. </sentence><sentence id="383">And he directed the, uh, uh ...the proceedings, that is, uh, the cleaning up of the camp and the burning of this and burning of that. </sentence><sentence id="384">Some of the clothes and things that we, were burned up and old, uh, latrines--uh, they were filthy. </sentence><sentence id="385">Uh, we tried to get rid of some of the things that were contagious that would spread germs and so on. </sentence><sentence id="386">So the people themselves were still dying because they were beyond help. </sentence><sentence id="387">We got there too late and they died daily, uh, by the hundreds the first few days and then they tapered off and there was a few, maybe a dozen a day, uh, thirty days later. </sentence><sentence id="388">But, uh, we were there for about thirty days, our division, and then the 26th Infantry Division took  over. </sentence><sentence id="389">In fact, some of those came in early so they could see how we were doing it. </sentence><sentence id="390">Our men stood guard to keep the, uh, people under control because some of the, the Russian prisoners were very aggressive anduh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: What does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: Well, they they wanted to shoot every German that came in the place because they had been, uh, put in, incarcerated in this camp and they were skin and bones and they, they were ready to tear them apart with their bare hands, so we had to have our men walking around with guns to keep everything, keep the keep these people from uh killing each other or killing their former, uh, masters so called. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: Well, I was, uh, an engineer and and as I said our, my project was to, uh, help bury the dead because my buddy, Al Salzman, was on a bulldozer and I helped him grease it and maintain it and, uh, had opportunity to see quite a lot of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="413">Well, and so did he, and its amazing how, uh, you can forget details. </sentence><sentence id="414">There was so many things going on and if somebody prompts you or if you see a picture, they'll bring back a whole story just about a picture. </sentence><sentence id="415">Uh, a picture can tell a thousand words. </sentence><sentence id="416">Well, I took a lot of movies and maybe they'll be put on tape later and that'll explain some of what I'm talking about. </sentence><sentence id="417">But, uh... . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: What other parts . . . </sentence><sentence id="425">you've, you've described the burial of the dead very well and I thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Uh, what other parts of the camp did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: Oh I, we went through the, uh, barracks, the different barracks to see how the people were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="434">Q: What was the condition of the barracks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="436">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="437">The barracks were, this was, in the few days that we were there, the first few days that we were there, there were still some dead in the bunks, and we were getting the German people to take them out, and they threw them out like (ph)_ out in the yards, and they were piled up there. </sentence><sentence id="438">Then from there they took and put them into wagons and took them down to the graveyard. </sentence><sentence id="439">And now in the barracks where the, uh, people, where there were six hundred in a barracks, there were two and three people in each bunk. </sentence><sentence id="440">They were so skinny from malnutrition that, uh, two people could sleep side by side very easily and they, there were so few bunks they had to take turns sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="441">And, uh, uh, I took pictures, movies inside the barracks and, uh, I'll never forget these people were so weak that the ones who had, were stronger, would strip the clothes off of the weak ones who couldn't fight back and  put those clothes on themselves because they were better for instance than their own. </sentence><sentence id="442">None of these people were issued clothes. </sentence><sentence id="443">They had uniforms and when the uniforms wore out at this late stage of the war, why they were nude. </sentence><sentence id="444">And there were so many women just lying nude in their bunks they and I I felt bad about taking movies of them so I got some of them waving but I didn't make it a point to ... and anyhow I didn't get all those movies home anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="445">But I do have some in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="446">This will explain what I am talking about. </sentence><sentence id="447">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="448">The barracks, uh, in the barracks the bunks were four to six high and had to climb up like monkeys and some of them were too weak to get to their bunks, so they sleep on the bottom one and the ones that were stronger would sleep on top. </sentence><sentence id="449">And, uh, that's where I interviewed the young lady from, uh, Sil... Upper Silesia, and you'd wonder when you see her, uh, why she looked so, uh, well-nourished. </sentence><sentence id="450">It's only because she had of her own via...volition, of her own free will, marched with those prisoners ahead of the Russians to get away from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="451">And, uh, it was an anachronism in the middle of all this starving, starv...and starved people and these human skeletons to see someone looking as well as she did. </sentence><sentence id="452">But there were quite a few others that had just been marched in a few days before and hadn't had a chance to starve. </sentence><sentence id="453">The way, I hate to even, it, it, it's so silly when you think back on it, how these people just starved to death. </sentence><sentence id="454">They would give them rations of one piece of bread, a crumb of bread for a day, and a lot of times the bread was moldy and we started feeding them with soup and, uh, bread which we made from the flour we got downtown. </sentence><sentence id="455">We got the bakeries going and a little later on we got carpenters in, from the German soldiers, carpenters and plumbers and to get everything back in order because a lot of things were destroyed in the, by the people in fighting and then they destroyed it themselves because they were so sick of the camp--they were trying to knock down wire and everything. </sentence><sentence id="456">It was, uh, double electrified fences to keep them in the compounds and, uh, the bodies were just thrown outside the barracks into pile, into piles in the streets there. </sentence><sentence id="457">There's no place else to bur...there's no place to bury them in the camp, the upper part, until we started digging these trenches. </sentence><sentence id="458">And, uh, let's see.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: What else did you see in camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: Well, as I said, the people were lining up, uh, uh, to, uh, go to these, uh, soup mill... or kitchens or soup pots and what always struck me so odd, the people would be walking without shirts or without pants on, and they didn't think anything of it; they were so used to seeing humans nude most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="485">They stripped them everyday and hosed them down. </sentence><sentence id="486">This is stories that they told us later. </sentence><sentence id="487">But I actually saw and have movies of people walking around without clothes on and think nothing of it. </sentence><sentence id="488">The men in particular. </sentence><sentence id="489">Uh, the women weren't that, uh, uh, aggressive. </sentence><sentence id="490">In other words they, they were more polite. </sentence><sentence id="491">They tried to hide themselves. </sentence><sentence id="492">And the women that were nude in their bunks would put their hands over their breasts and it was pathetic. </sentence><sentence id="493">Very sad. </sentence><sentence id="494">I'm, I'm glad that it, that it has never been that bad since, uh, that is that we we haven't publicized these things, but what we do know and we hope that it never happens again and, uh, if these pictures will help prove a point, I'm sure they won't happen again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="506">Q: Did you see the quarry? </sentence><sentence id="507"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="510">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="511">It was, as I said, it was down, uh, uh, below the camp itself. </sentence><sentence id="512">The camp was on the highest point of the hill. </sentence><sentence id="513">The quarry was, was starting to go into the side of the mountain towards the; ultimately they, as I said earlier, the camp would have fallen in if they quarried that far. </sentence><sentence id="514">But the the staircase, they, they quarried the staircase right out of the stone of the mountain and, uh, there were big blocks of stone. </sentence><sentence id="515">It was a typical quarry. </sentence><sentence id="516">They were making building blocks for the bridges and the highways and also for stone buildings that they, uh, were putting up here and there. </sentence><sentence id="517">Uh, most of the stones were going for, uh, highways and for reinforcing underground bunkers and things like that and the people had to carry stones up the stairs, to the main camp because they built a hugh dividing wall between the quarters of the SS troopers and the, uh, kitchen and the infirmary or the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="518">They built a stone wall between those and the, uh, barracks where they had the experimental prisoners, where they they inoculated them with all kinds of, uh, germs or they froze them in vats of water and, uh, experimented generally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: Describe if you would what the experimental compound looked like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Well, uh, if you've ever been in an Army camp in the United States, you'll see rows and rows of barracks. </sentence><sentence id="531">Well, these were a little closer together. </sentence><sentence id="532">Uh, it reminded me of chicken coops on a big chicken ranch, and, uh, there was about seven rows of them and about ten buildings in each row. </sentence><sentence id="533">And there was about two hundred people in each one of those barracks. </sentence><sentence id="534">They were smaller than the ones down at the lower side of the camp where, where the quarry prisoners, uh, were quartered, and, uh, I don't know uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="540">Q: What was the condition, what were conditions like inside these barracks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="542">A: Uh, well they were less crowded because, uh, they still had the bunks but they had about three high and they still had about two people in in each one, but they weren't, they weren't as elaborate, hugh; the buildings weren't as big as the ones in the lower camp, the lower section of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="543">Uh, they were smaller and only about two hundred people in each, which is almost what we had in our own Army barracks in the States. </sentence><sentence id="544">We had about a hundred and fifty--well not a hundred and...uh, the bigger ones did but we had about seventy-five men and where we had seventy-five men, they had two hundred. </sentence><sentence id="545">That's how much more crowded the bunks were on top of each other whereas we only had bunks on the floor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="550">Q: What were the condition, the physical condition of these prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="552">A: Well, it was very much the same as these the ones that we saw ear... earlier who were when we first came in--the ones who were the strongest naturally had the guns and everything. </sentence><sentence id="553">And but these people that we saw were very weak. </sentence><sentence id="554">They were all starved and all trying to eat a little soup. </sentence><sentence id="555">Uh, we had already started soup kitchens, the first, first day we got there practically. </sentence><sentence id="556">Because the Army, we have so many cooks-- every one, every company has a cook--so we didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="557">We forfeited our food and told our mess sergeants to take it to the  1 camp, which they did for the first couple of days until we got steady stream of supplies coming in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="564">Q: Did you go in to the experimental labs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="566">A: No, I, I, they didn't have them set up. </sentence><sentence id="567">They, uh, these experiments were going on before we got there. </sentence><sentence id="568">This is what these people were telling us. </sentence><sentence id="569">I didn't see any of, of these inno...inoculations or bathing in ice water or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="570">It's just, uh, what the people were telling us and what the records show now that from all kinds of witnesses and from the German records and so on. </sentence><sentence id="571">It collor...you know; it confirms the stories that we heard then. </sentence><sentence id="572">Couldn't-- they were unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="573">In fact most of the guys were in a daze--so when they got, they couldn't, they they didn't want to comprehend what they had seen. </sentence><sentence id="574">They wanted to forget it. </sentence><sentence id="575">If you ask any of the fellows about what they saw at this camp, they--it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="576">It stunk and the smell was awful. </sentence><sentence id="577">As I said, I was brought up on a farm from age 10, and farm smells didn't bother me, uh, even the vilest, and they were vile--you know, these dead people. </sentence><sentence id="578">Some of them had been dead for a couple of days or more and then they had dysentery and their rectums were all sore and the, the skin was eaten away. </sentence><sentence id="579">These were people that are still alive let alone the dead ones, and they smelled. </sentence><sentence id="580">But I--the, the decaying flesh I was used to because on a farm we had all sorts of dead animals and it was much the same. </sentence><sentence id="581">To me, I wasn't, uh, it didn't bother me. </sentence><sentence id="582">But most of the fellows remember the smell because they were city boys. </sentence><sentence id="583">They had not, uh, been exposed to this type of thing. </sentence><sentence id="584">So and as I said, uh, have thought it since then, we were in order and we were used to it because we had seen these bodies along the road for a few days before we got to the camp and, uh, we had seen these stripped uniforms and these these human skeletons that, uh, were dead as we went by them, as we went, as we were spear-heading. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="605">Q: Was there anything else about Mauthausen that strikes you in particular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="607">A: Well, the the security they had: they had the, they built another stone wall between the double electrified fence which was the original partition between the, the German officers" quarters; they had a double electrified fence with this trench in between with barbed wire on the ground over the trench and, uh, the the security that they had to provide for themselves to keep these people from climbing over the wall to get at them. </sentence><sentence id="608">And, uh, they had machine gun nests at every corner of the walls overlooking the compound, and, uh, the other thing I couldn't get over was how the people were all out in the sun trying to sun themselves because they were confined in the barracks a lot of them and they weren't even out working anymore. </sentence><sentence id="609">They were just kept in the barracks and they'd feed them with a few crusts of bread and it was a real mess. </sentence><sentence id="610">Everything was smelly. </sentence><sentence id="611">There were no latrine facilities and, uh, they were doing it out in the streets in you know their bowel movements and so on--such as they had, which wasn't very much. </sentence><sentence id="612">And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in, having taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on maneuvers, I was a medical aide, corpsman we called them. </sentence><sentence id="613">Uh, I was quite stricken, uh, stricken I should say by the fact that the genitals, or genitalia of the men and the women were the last things to apparently go because they looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="614">The women's breasts had  2 shrunk quite a bit, but their nipples and, uh, and looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="615">And the men's penises and testicles were about normal. </sentence><sentence id="616">And the rest of them were absolutely bones and, uh, with skin stretched over them. </sentence><sentence id="617">And that's the one thing that I'll never forget is, is the condition of, of the things that are needed to reproduce life. </sentence><sentence id="618">They're the last things to go, as far as I could see. </sentence><sentence id="619">In other words, Mother Nature was trying to save the reproductive organs. </sentence><sentence id="620">It was the one thing that struck me out of looking at all these thousands of dead whenever we buried them. </sentence><sentence id="621">And as I said, we had these, uh, they couldn't dig the graves fast enough so we got our bulldozers to dig the trenches, push the dirt out and then was a, uh, was a token for the Germans to get shovels and start to shovel the dirt back into the trenches. </sentence><sentence id="622">Well we'd have been there for another two weeks burying them if we had to do everything by hand. </sentence><sentence id="623">We did dig a few trenches by hand, but we then used the bulldozers because there were so many. </sentence><sentence id="624">They had them stacked up by the hundreds waiting to be buried. </sentence><sentence id="625">They couldn't dig the graves fast enough by hand, so that's why we got the German, uh, civilians in there to, uh, handle them. </sentence><sentence id="626">They put them down in the graves and laid them side by side and then they would throw a few shovels of dirt in and I'll never forget as the bulldozer, as Al pushed the, uh, stone and sand back into the trenches, you would hear a stone crunching the ribs and the bones of the poor bodies down below. </sentence><sentence id="627">It was, because this was backfill for the soccer field was made out of backfill and from the quarry and there were a lot of hard stones mixed in and when they pushed the stones in they further crushed the poor things that were laid to rest in that, uh, area. </sentence><sentence id="628">After the war they said that they moved the bodies to the upper camp--see this was down at the lower level, the sports field. </sentence><sentence id="629">Then there was another lower level down around on the quarry level and, uh, there's now a third graveyard up on the top where the, uh, the old barracks used to be for the experimental prisoners in the upper part of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="630">The stone wall is gone now that was in between, the electrified fences are long gone and shortly after we got most of the people into medical tents away from the camp even. </sentence><sentence id="631">We moved them out into field hospitals; we burned the buildings down because they were that smelly and filthy from all the you know unclean--there's no place, no la...no facilities for latrines. </sentence><sentence id="632">They had these ditches in the streets, and when the rains came, it would wash everything down the hillside. </sentence><sentence id="633">So all that's gone now and it's, it's a graveyard. </sentence><sentence id="634">They said they moved the bodies from that sports field or soccer field but when I went back in 1975 the trees had grown over it already in 35 years. </sentence><sentence id="635">I went there 35 years later and, uh, the, it was so changed. </sentence><sentence id="636">It was a big museum now. </sentence><sentence id="637">Where we had seen all these barracks there were only; they left three of, uh, in the first row, I think there were three, no four left which were now made a museum. </sentence><sentence id="638">They showed, they had those on exhibit. </sentence><sentence id="639">But the huge barracks down below--they had six hundred to eight hundred people in them were all gone, used up for other purposes. </sentence><sentence id="640">But we did burn most of the barracks in the upper part. </sentence><sentence id="641">We left a few in the front which apparently were the cleanest. </sentence><sentence id="642">And, uh, we went back in 1975 and the Austrian civilians had a dinner for us. </sentence><sentence id="643">They provided us with, uh, a chauffeur and a limousine and they, uh, it was unbelievable how they treated us. </sentence><sentence id="644">We were like heroes. </sentence><sentence id="645">And the people, when we went back were hugging us again and trying to touch us and they were grabbing souvenirs and we were giving out little buttons like I have here from my various outfits. </sentence><sentence id="646">These are unit insignia. </sentence><sentence id="647">Here's the 41st Cavalry which happens to be the unit that was the first ones in the gate. </sentence><sentence id="648">And this Michael Green who was in the 41st Cavalry is going back to Europe this, uh, in 1990 for the 40th Anniversary, 45th Anniversary and, uh, he's bringing  3 some of these along to give to the people for souvenirs. </sentence><sentence id="649">But, uh, we were back again in 1980 and we're trying to go back every five years, and we meet the people that we released, and we meet their children, and now we're bringing our children and it's a great thing that the survivors of Mauthausen, and there were around 12,000 alive when we got there. </sentence><sentence id="650">And I guess maybe un another couple of hundred died and so there were 11,000 actual people alive when we got there, but the ones coming back are the families of the victims who died in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="651">They come back by the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="652">But we were back in 1975 there were around 12,000 people there and you wouldn't know how they got there because every road was full of these big, uh, tourists bus that hold fifty people--they were lined up like, uh, cars around a football stadium in the States. </sentence><sentence id="653">Incredible where they come from Spain and Hungary, Hungaria--all the countries of Europe and, uh, we were, as I said, when they found out we were the liberators they couldn't do enough for us. </sentence><sentence id="654">They practically tore the, they wanted our hats; they wanted, they were going to tear the clothes off us. </sentence><sentence id="655">We were real celebrities. </sentence><sentence id="656">So I felt good about that and I'm; I just felt so sad about all those that were killed, over a hundred twenty thousand were killed in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="657">Or more. </sentence><sentence id="658">They're not sure. </sentence><sentence id="659">It's between a hundred twenty, hundred fifty thousand that they know of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: Is there anything else about Mauthausen that you remember in particular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: Well, nothing except that it was made so the people couldn't get out, and as I said it looked like a prison when we first observed it, and it was more like a prison when you got in it, uh, because they don't have the double electrified fences. </sentence><sentence id="716">Our prisons have fences, but not electrified, and, uh, the, uh, condition of the people--the human skeletons walking around was another thing that impressed me. </sentence><sentence id="717">As I said the, uh, that anybody could be alive and that thin when they looked like bones, their legs, their arms, their feet looked swollen in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="718">That was the only thing that looked anywheres near normal was from their ankles down to their insteps. </sentence><sentence id="719">Uh, the rest of the bodies were, uh, skin drawn over their faces as if it were shrunk in the heat or whatever--just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="720">And I don't know what else to say...the smells as I said were terrible, but I wasn't too fazed by that for some reason, and I think it was because of my upbringing on a farm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="728">Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="729">You had mentioned that some of your men were in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="730">Were you in Dachau as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="739">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="740">Tell us if you would please, you were in Mauthausen for thirty days roughly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: Where did you go from...no, before we do that, what--by the time you left at the end of thirty days--what shape was the camp in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: Oh, as I said, we started to burn some of the buildings and, uh, the, uh, we backfilled the  4 trenches and the latrines and most of the people were gone. </sentence><sentence id="748">The ones who could walk started walking home within a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="749">And, uh, the ones who were very sick we moved out into field hospitals and, uh, some of those that stayed were trying to help us get the records to find out and to check on how many people were killed and to keep track of everything and we had some of the people working there because they didn't want to go home. </sentence><sentence id="750">A lot of them were Russians and they didn't want to go back to to Russia, so, uh, we tried to keep them, uh, working in the camp and they, because the they said if we go back to Russia it will be the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="751">And it was we found out later. </sentence><sentence id="752">They were sent to the salt mines, to Siberia in other words, and, uh, that was something that I didn't think of until just now, but, uh, they were glad to be left behind. </sentence><sentence id="753">They didn't want to go back to Russia and we, they, uh, incidentally from after we let the, as I say, uh, should say, we took the demolitions off the bridge in Linz. </sentence><sentence id="754">Our group, our engineers were then sent out into, uh, north of CCB and the camp, and thousands, hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and White Russians tried to surrender to us. </sentence><sentence id="755">And we accepted their surrender, and, uh, in place, but they wanted to come into Germany you know, on our side of the line because they didn't want to be anywheres near the Russians and unfortunately our politicians had said this is the line of demarcation and all those Russians on that side, I mean Germans, will have to go back to the Russians and so a couple of hundred thousand soldiers that surrendered to us were returned to the Germans [Russians] and shipped to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="756">But that was, that was the 6th of May. </sentence><sentence id="757">In fact it was the afternoon of the Sth, the 6th and the 7th, and on about the 8th I got to the camp, and I was there on and off for a couple of days, but the main part was when we got the the ditches or trenches dug for the graves. </sentence><sentence id="758">That was my main job there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: Oh, we were sent into various little cities in Austria, uh, to maintain order and, uh, make sure there was no looting by the, uh, prisoners who had gotten away from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="774">They were all over. </sentence><sentence id="775">They were going to march home, but they wanted clothes. </sentence><sentence id="776">They were either stealing it from the Germans or taking it from the Germans, and they were fighting going on and we had to maintain order. </sentence><sentence id="777">It was a real madhouse. </sentence><sentence id="778">And, uh, we were sent to Schwanenstadt. </sentence><sentence id="779">And then from there we were, as engineers, we were sent out to maintain roads and rebuild bridges and, uh, electrical plants and, uh, to guard the prisoners in Ebensee, which was a camp--a concentration camp--and it was now full of SS prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="780">And these haughty bastards, as we called them, were very independent; and, uh, they...they wouldn't...they didn't want to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="781">They thought they were still lords of the universe, being SS and being used to that, uh, having control, uh, full control over civilians and full control over the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="782">They were the masters of Hitler, they were, uh, Hitler's, uh, supermen. </sentence><sentence id="783">And, uh, we now had them crawling because we didn't feed them. </sentence><sentence id="784">They were digging up worms and eating worms. </sentence><sentence id="785">They dug up all the grass. </sentence><sentence id="786">It was in May and June that we started putting them in, in late May. </sentence><sentence id="787">And they were digging up the grass. </sentence><sentence id="788">They were eating worms. </sentence><sentence id="789">I mean it. </sentence><sentence id="790">And, uh, they were waiting, praying for rain and we had a few days of rain and the worms would come near the top and they would dig them out. </sentence><sentence id="791">And so we started giving them crackers and things, give them a couple of crackers from our K-ration boxes. </sentence><sentence id="792">And we'd get a wristwatch which was worth maybe seven or eight dollars, and then we sold them to the  5 Russians for over a hundred. </sentence><sentence id="793">And some of the Russians later on were paying five hundred to a thousand dollars for a Mickey Mouse watch, in particular. </sentence><sentence id="794">And we were getting these watches from the SS men and then selling them to the Russians for souvenirs, because we all had watches. </sentence><sentence id="795">We could get them anytime in the PX for about ten bucks. </sentence><sentence id="796">And here we were getting a hundred dollars to five hundred dollars. </sentence><sentence id="797">And some of the fellows that were able to go to Berlin and trade with the Russians got over a thousand dollars for a wristwatch that we got for a cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="798">The cigarettes were worth money to them. </sentence><sentence id="799">They were like gold. </sentence><sentence id="800">And every soldier had a pack of cigarettes, a carton of cigarettes, a week issued. </sentence><sentence id="801">Whether you used them or not, you were entitled to a carton. </sentence><sentence id="802">So a lot of the guys learned how to smoke; and I hate to say this, but many of them are dead now because of the lousy habit. </sentence><sentence id="803">And their wives always complained, "Oh, yeah, he's been smoking like this ever since he got out of the Army, and dying of emphysema and lung cancer." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="835">Q: Let's go back to Ebensee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="837">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="838">There we had double electrified fences for them. </sentence><sentence id="839">We left them in place. </sentence><sentence id="840">And, uh, we had guard towers and machine guns, and that's what we took turns guarding. </sentence><sentence id="841">And I hated that. </sentence><sentence id="842">I was only there a couple days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="849">Q: Can you describe the camp? </sentence><sentence id="850">In addition to the fences, what what did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: Well, the, the main barracks were in back of it and, uh, I just stayed, we had guard towers in a wire enclosure which we had put up in front. </sentence><sentence id="854">It was something new. </sentence><sentence id="855">We had built that. </sentence><sentence id="856">And I...I'd seen Mauthausen, so I didn't go to look at the quarters there because I figured they're all the same. </sentence><sentence id="857">And we were too busy taunting the SS men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="863">Q: How did you taunt them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: Well, by offering them cigarettes and then crushing them in front of them and then stamping on them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="867">Q: What, uh.... Did you make the SS do, uh, certain chores? </sentence><sentence id="868">How did you...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: Well, there was so many of them. </sentence><sentence id="872">And there was really nothing much for them to do. </sentence><sentence id="873">We made them build the fences, yeah, their own "corrals" you might call it. </sentence><sentence id="874">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="875">But we didn't trust them to to do what the ordinary soldiers were doing back in camp, in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="876">There, they were restoring the facilities and cleaning up and they were doing the buggy- lugging (ph) when they burnt the camp. </sentence><sentence id="877">And they were burning up anything stuff that was Nazi that they didn't like--I got a Nazi flag. </sentence><sentence id="878">I said, as | was watching it burn. </sentence><sentence id="879">I said, "Oh, I'll grab that and see if it's...." And it bur... guess it's full of holes. </sentence><sentence id="880">L..I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="881">I've never unrolled it since I picked it out of the burning pile. </sentence><sentence id="882">And I got it in the car. </sentence><sentence id="883">I was going to show it to you, if you were interested. </sentence><sentence id="884">But that's the only souvenir that I got from the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="899">Q: The SS, uh, I assume eventually you got, uh, soup kitchen up and you fed them finally? </sentence><sentence id="900"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="903">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="904">Well, as I said, I was only there a couple of days because I hated guard duty and, uh, it was just standing there watching these guys do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="905">They'd play cards and dig for worms and they didn't have much to do. </sentence><sentence id="906">There was not much of an area to dig for worms. </sentence><sentence id="907">In a couple of days the worms were gone. </sentence><sentence id="908">Unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="909">So they were and they were without shirts, they were, uh, their uniforms were, uh, either torn off of them or whatever by somebody but a lot of them didn't have any shirts. </sentence><sentence id="910">They had pants and, uh, as I said we taunted them the way they did, uh, the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="911">They would shoot the civilians if they didn't fire at us earlier in the war and, uh, many times the people said the SS made them do it, which was true enough. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="921">Q: Did you see any trace of the real prisoners of Ebensee, the former prisoners of Ebensee? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="923">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="924">Uh, the camp was, I had been working at Mauthausen and most of those prisoners now the same as in our camp had, uh--well, those who were well were walking home. </sentence><sentence id="925">They weren't going to wait for convoys. </sentence><sentence id="926">And the sick ones were already in camps, uh, hospital tents with the 26th Infantry Division. </sentence><sentence id="927">See, the 26th Infantry Division later took over Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="928">And, in fact, I think they got the credit for taking Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="929">Because by the time the newspapers finally got there, they claimed--the 26th Infantry Division claimed--they had liberated the camp. </sentence><sentence id="930">They did, in a way; but not the way the 11th Armored did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="939">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="940">We are almost finished with the tape. </sentence><sentence id="941">Is there anything else that you want to add, anything else that you saw that relates to the Holocaust? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="945">A: I'd like to bring out a point which I don't see, uh, discussed very often. </sentence><sentence id="946">And that is the fact that I personally knew thirteen men that were killed in action, and some right along side of me. </sentence><sentence id="947">And, uh, three hundred were killed in the Battle of the Bulge in the first few days of combat. </sentence><sentence id="948">And then ultimately we lost eight hundred men killed, and four thousand wounded or injured; and, uh, these were all expended in the effort to save Europe from Hitler's Nazi terrorism. </sentence><sentence id="949">And, uh, I'd like to bring that out, that we made a lot of sacrifices and those fellows that did it did it for the freedom not only of the United States but of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="950">And it's a point that is only brought home when you go over and you walk over their graves, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="951">And you think of the 45 years, it was 40 years when I walked on the grave of my best friend, accidentally. </sentence><sentence id="952">I backed up to take a picture of Patton, his monument, which is at the head of the uh___ Cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="953">And I backed up to get the big cross in and I put my hand down on a tombstone, and as I walked around it I looked and it was August uh Heddenbock (ph), my buddy from back home. </sentence><sentence id="954">And I just bawled. </sentence><sentence id="955">And I am sorry. </sentence><sentence id="956">I'm just overwhelmed. </sentence><sentence id="957">But that is what I'm thinking about--how lucky we are, all of us, to be here, to see the tapes, to have a free world, and even with the events happening today to see it coming to pass that our efforts have not been in vain. </sentence><sentence id="958">And that is the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that we lost a lot of good buddies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
