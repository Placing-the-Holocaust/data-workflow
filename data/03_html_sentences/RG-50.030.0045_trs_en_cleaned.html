<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Was the fighting very heavy at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Uh, well, we had a lot of pockets of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="94">The German people, the Volksturm and the SS would drive the local farmers into shooting at us. </sentence><sentence id="95">If they didn't shoot at us, they would shoot the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="96">And they made feeble attempts at trying to shoot us naturally and the SS, uh, troops kept moving back in towards the interior of Germany, and, uh, the, well, you know, this went on a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="97">I'm trying to talk here in a few minutes and describe, uh, uh, a couple of months of activity--it's very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="98">The, uh, thing that I remember was we started to see our men being killed and because of our men being killed, a couple here and a couple there, we would kill whole squads of Germans the way they mowed down the, uh, prisoners and, uh, their opponents. </sentence><sentence id="99">And sometimes the hillsides would be covered with bodies of the Americans, or a hillside would be covered with the bodies of the Germans, and then later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in, concentration camp inmates or, uh, slaves on farms, they would, uh, march them ahead of  them trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these people apparently. </sentence><sentence id="100">Anduh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Did you see any of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="112">These bodies were lying along the roadsides where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they were shot because they weren't going fast enough and, uh, it was a terrible thing but, uh, it was practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war. </sentence><sentence id="113">From April 15th to the end of the war we saw this in many places and, uh, uh, the, uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Was that your first contact with concentration camp victims? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Was, was in April, about the 15th of April, yeah, we started to see the where they had been marched ahead of us because, uh, in because of the nature of the spear-heading, the 11th Armored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap, this is the 11th Armored Division, and I was in the 56th Engineers, and that's this little insignia right here which is our uniform insignia. </sentence><sentence id="120">And the 11th Armored patch was ordinarily worn on your shoulder and, uh, there there were several armored divisions. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were one of them. </sentence><sentence id="122">The 4th Armored was a sister division, and we were leap-frogging ahead, uh, in spurts as it were until and then we'd rest for a day or two until the infantry caught up to, to, uh, contain the lands that we had just over-run. </sentence><sentence id="123">And that's when we would see these prisoners who had been walking ahead of us for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="124">We'd catch up to them and we'd see the ones who had been, uh, uh, had died along the roadsides. </sentence><sentence id="125">And by the hundreds in some cases, and then just here and there and then they tried to bury some and they were, made half-hearted attempts because they took too much time to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="126">They were trying to hide the, the ones that had died and then there were so many of them they just left them after a while. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: All right, tell me if you would where you were as you were about to approach Mauthausen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="137">How did you get there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Well, uh, we were in a combat command. </sentence><sentence id="139">And Combat Command A is the one I was in ordinarily. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, we were down in...in Linz. </sentence><sentence id="141">We were, we forked out. </sentence><sentence id="142">A combat command, one would go to the left, one would go to the right and sometimes a third combat command called "CCR," or "Reserve," would take a central point. </sentence><sentence id="143">And there would be three prongs of us armored, uh, divisions spanning out and covering as much territory as we could; and taking it in and and opposing and and mowing down the opposition with our heavy guns, our 75, uh, millimeter guns and three-inch guns on, uh, tank destroyers. </sentence><sentence id="144">And, uh, we kept going and going and until we got to Linz. </sentence><sentence id="145">That was CCA, but CCB went, uh, to the north ofus... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="155">Translate. </sentence><sentence id="156">What is CCB...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Combat Command B. There are three combat commands in an armored division - Combat Command A, which is, uh, composed of select troops depending on a situation from the  main body of the division which of 11,000 men, and, uh, CCB would be another group of men, engineers and tank destroyers, uh, or artillery depending on what we thought we needed, medical men and of course supplies always brought up the rear, following the trains- -they called it division train. </sentence><sentence id="161">And then CCR was a reserve command of troops ready to go to the aid of CCB or CCA whichever was needed. </sentence><sentence id="162">In most cases they were always in the back. </sentence><sentence id="163">But when needed, they would be shifted to the front, or to relieve the pressure of one group that was in the front. </sentence><sentence id="164">For instance, CCA was stuck in the, uh, certain section of Siegfred line for a couple of days and couldn't get through and had some casualties, so they took them back and CCR replaced them. </sentence><sentence id="165">That's the, that's the, there's three parts--they call it a triangular division, and those are the three parts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: So you were moving toward Mauthausen ... . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Right, and CCB, uh, were the ones that found the camp. </sentence><sentence id="175">They, uh, the doctor--that's, uh, Doormeyer (ph), I believe it was, he had gotten a Red Cross, uh, official and they came down the road and with a Red Cross flag flying on their, uh, Volkswagen, and, uh, our men spotted it and the one fellow, uh, Sergeant Albert, uh, J. Kosiek,! </sentence><sentence id="176">uh, was able to speak Polish and so did the doctor that was in this, uh, uh, vehic..uh, Volkswagen. </sentence><sentence id="177">And, uh, he said, "We have a camp. </sentence><sentence id="178">They're ready to surrender. </sentence><sentence id="179">We want you to come and take the...the Germans prisoner." </sentence><sentence id="180">And they came down to meet us; so they took us right to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="181">And, uh, the fellows were greeted with cheers and the SS troops had already evacuated because they knew what was going to happen to them, and they only left the ordinary German soldiers there who were guards. </sentence><sentence id="182">And these, uh, German soldiers, uh, had of course thrown all their weapons in and now the people had them. </sentence><sentence id="183">And they were ready to shoot all the soldiers, but, uh, we kept them from doing that and, uh, but they did hang some of the worst, uh, guards, some of the ones that had treated them the worst--the, they took care of them before we got there actually. </sentence><sentence id="184">They were hanging on the fences, uh, butchered and, uh, desecrated; it's no worse than what they had done except here you saw an able-bodied man now hanging on an electric fence and, uh, cut apart and they they were paying back a little bit you know of what they had gotten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="197">Let's back up a minute. </sentence><sentence id="198">You are about, you are approaching the camp. </sentence><sentence id="199">You have your your doctor in front of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Describe that. </sentence><sentence id="207">Describe entering the camp. </sentence><sentence id="208">Tell me exactly what you saw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Well, uh, let let me put this, uh, let me get you straight on this. </sentence><sentence id="213">I had gone with CCA to Linz  and we had, uh, taken over two tons of dynamite off the Adolph Hitler Bridge, my squad and I, because we don't want nobody else there because if, if there was booby trap we overlooked, it would have blown the whole bridge and ourselves to bits. </sentence><sentence id="214">Meantime this was going on at the camp. </sentence><sentence id="215">I'm telling you what Albert Kosiack told us, when we went back in 1975 and he had, we had, uh, we went over by plane and we went, we were together for a week or so, and we talked this thing over and, uh, I feel as if I were there. </sentence><sentence id="216">And, uh, well the people just hugged them fellows; they just, they--it was indescribable. </sentence><sentence id="217">They were so happy. </sentence><sentence id="218">They were screaming and they were trying to touch them and, uh, fellows and, uh, he said he'll never forget it and of course the doctor who was, uh, who could speak Polish was, was, the doctor told, uh, Kosiack told the doctor to have the people who now had the German machine guns and everything to please stack them up and, uh, we'll take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="219">So they set fire to them. </sentence><sentence id="220">So that the people wouldn't have the guns because they would be going down in the countryside shooting everybody, so to keep them from doing that, they stacked all the guns and then they set fire to them. </sentence><sentence id="221">But the, by the time we got near, the people knew the war was over because airplanes and radios, they had, somebody had a radio--they had one radio in the camp--and they knew the war was almost over. </sentence><sentence id="222">It wasn't over until the 8th. </sentence><sentence id="223">We got there on May Sth, three days before the war was over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: When did you physically get to the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: I got into the camp about May 10th, when they called for the engineers to come with bulldozers. </sentence><sentence id="239">I was in the engineers as I explained before, and my friend Al Salzman (ph) from Massachusetts was a bulldozer operator so, uh, I was helping him and, uh, taking movies and black and white pictures, slides. </sentence><sentence id="240">I had all the film I needed because, you may think this is funny, but I had a lot of girlfriends and these girls were sending me film from the United States, and I had all the movies that I took pictures everyday of combat. </sentence><sentence id="241">When I wasn't being shot at I was shooting with movie film and with, uh, black and white. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I have hundreds and hundreds of feet of movie film which unfortunately didn't all get home. </sentence><sentence id="243">It was x-rayed. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was, uh, lost. </sentence><sentence id="245">It was stolen. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was buried. </sentence><sentence id="247">One, one, in one time a went right through  consisting of barracks, which held a couple of hundred people and these were in the main part of the camp, on the top part and here we saw double electrified fences. </sentence><sentence id="248">Uh, uh, people were by this time sunning themselves, and a lot of people were nude because they had no clothes: they had been worn off or torn off by those who were stronger and, uh, people were walking around nude because they didn't have enough clothes at the time. </sentence><sentence id="249">Uh, we had, uh, as I said there were other visitors coming. </sentence><sentence id="250">In fact I think the Russians came one of the days and they of course they started then to bring troops in from the Russian front, from the American side, (cough) excuse me, and from the German civilians nearby we started to get those people to come up by the truckload and we told them to dress in their Sunday best, and then we made them dig graves, and, uh, we wanted them to see what was going on and then we had them carry the bodies, load the bodies in the wagons. </sentence><sentence id="251">We took wagonload after wagonload of bodies out to the grave site, which was the soccer field or the sport, uh, they call it the Sportplatz. </sentence><sentence id="252">And, uh, we made the Germans handle, load them up in the wagons from inside the camp, take them down to the the, uh, graveyard, the grave site, and unload them, put them down in the graves, side by side, by the hundreds--would be a hundred and fifty people or so in a row--and side, practically on top of each other. </sentence><sentence id="253">They were such, they were all skin and bones and it was--I have pictures of them and movies which you'll see later, but the, uh, uh, bodies were so emaciated that that you you couldn't possibly understand how those people were alive and walking around. </sentence><sentence id="254">And, uh, some of those walking around looked better than the dead, of course, a little better than the dead and some of them looked worse, and they're still alive depending on their resistance or whatever--I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="255">But it was incredible that they were still walking in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="256">The walking dead we called them at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: What was the reaction of the German civilians to having to bury the dead? </sentence><sentence id="277">What did they . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="280"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: They, they all they just shook their heads. </sentence><sentence id="282">They were crying. </sentence><sentence id="283">They said, No, nein, nein--we didn't know--we knew they were a camp," but they didn't realize what was happening to all the people because they had, uh, a quarry with a railroad--they ran, uh, stone out you know on the train down below. </sentence><sentence id="284">On a lower level there was a railroad track to take the train, uh, the quarry stone out to different building projects throughout Austria. </sentence><sentence id="285">Went to the main railroad, down along the Danube. </sentence><sentence id="286">And, uh, they didn't realize that the there would be carloads of, uh, uh, clothing going out from all these people, would be going out by the carloads to be reprocessed into new blankets and German Army uniforms or whatever, uh, from the people who had died. </sentence><sentence id="287">And they didn't incinerate any of the clothing the clothing because, uh, it was bad enough burning up the bodies that they burned, and, uh, the German people were were, knew there was a camp. </sentence><sentence id="288">They knew people was going to it but I don't thing they knew how bad it was. </sentence><sentence id="289">It's a similar situation in the United States--now we have newspaper reporters that get in and we tear our jails apart. </sentence><sentence id="290">We know what's going on because we're an open free public, but under a dictatorship, I believe that most of those people did not know and they acted as if they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="291">And they cried. </sentence><sentence id="292">Of course we did too. </sentence><sentence id="293">I can cry right now thinking about how terrible it was and, uh, I had an empathy for them because, uh, I was of German descent. </sentence><sentence id="294">My parents spoke German and, uh, but however they didn't teach it to me  because it was taboo in World War I and I knew my English and only knew a few words, mostly cuss words in German. </sentence><sentence id="295">When my father would get mad, he would say, . </sentence><sentence id="296">Uh, that, that's my imperfect German but that's what about the extent of my  over. </sentence><sentence id="297">In fact, some of those came in early so they could see how we were doing it. </sentence><sentence id="298">Our men stood guard to keep the, uh, people under control because some of the, the Russian prisoners were very aggressive anduh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: What does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Well, they they wanted to shoot every German that came in the place because they had been, uh, put in, incarcerated in this camp and they were skin and bones and they, they were ready to tear them apart with their bare hands, so we had to have our men walking around with guns to keep everything, keep the keep these people from uh killing each other or killing their former, uh, masters so called. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: What was your role in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Well, I was, uh, an engineer and and as I said our, my project was to, uh, help bury the dead because my buddy, Al Salzman, was on a bulldozer and I helped him grease it and maintain it and, uh, had opportunity to see quite a lot of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="325">Well, and so did he, and its amazing how, uh, you can forget details. </sentence><sentence id="326">There was so many things going on and if somebody prompts you or if you see a picture, they'll bring back a whole story just about a picture. </sentence><sentence id="327">Uh, a picture can tell a thousand words. </sentence><sentence id="328">Well, I took a lot of movies and maybe they'll be put on tape later and that'll explain some of what I'm talking about. </sentence><sentence id="329">But, uh... . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: What other parts . . . </sentence><sentence id="337">you've, you've described the burial of the dead very well and I thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Uh, what other parts of the camp did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Oh I, we went through the, uh, barracks, the different barracks to see how the people were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: What was the condition of the barracks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="349">The barracks were, this was, in the few days that we were there, the first few days that we were there, there were still some dead in the bunks, and we were getting the German people to take them out, and they threw them out like (ph) out in the yards, and they  put those clothes on themselves because they were better for instance than their own. </sentence><sentence id="350">None of these people were issued clothes. </sentence><sentence id="351">They had uniforms and when the uniforms wore out at this late stage of the war, why they were nude. </sentence><sentence id="352">And there were so many women just lying nude in their bunks they and I I felt bad about taking movies of them so I got some of them waving but I didn't make it a point to ... and anyhow I didn't get all those movies home anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="353">But I do have some in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="354">This will explain what I am talking about. </sentence><sentence id="355">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="356">The barracks, uh, in the barracks the bunks were four to six high and had to climb up like monkeys and some of them were too weak to get to their bunks, so they sleep on the bottom one and the ones that were stronger would sleep on top. </sentence><sentence id="357">And, uh, that's where I interviewed the young lady from, uh, Sil... Upper Silesia, and you'd wonder when you see her, uh, why she looked so, uh, well-nourished. </sentence><sentence id="358">It's only because she had of her own via...volition, of her own free will, marched with those prisoners ahead of the Russians to get away from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="359">And, uh, it was an anachronism in the middle of all this starving, starv...and starved people and these human skeletons to see someone looking as well as she did. </sentence><sentence id="360">But there were quite a few others that had just been marched in a few days before and hadn't had a chance to starve. </sentence><sentence id="361">The way, I hate to even, it, it, it's so silly when you think back on it, how these people just starved to death. </sentence><sentence id="362">They would give them rations of one piece of bread, a crumb of bread for a day, and a lot of times the bread was moldy and we started feeding them with soup and, uh, bread which we made from the flour we got downtown. </sentence><sentence id="363">We got the bakeries going and a little later on we got carpenters in, from the German soldiers, carpenters and plumbers and to get everything back in order because a lot of things were destroyed in the, by the people in fighting and then they destroyed it themselves because they were so sick of the camp--they were trying to knock down wire and everything. </sentence><sentence id="364">It was, uh, double electrified fences to keep them in the compounds and, uh, the bodies were just thrown outside the barracks into pile, into piles in the streets there. </sentence><sentence id="365">There's no place else to bur...there's no place to bury them in the camp, the upper part, until we started digging these trenches. </sentence><sentence id="366">And, uh, let's see.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: What else did you see in camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: Well, as I said, the people were lining up, uh, uh, to, uh, go to these, uh, soup mill... or kitchens or soup pots and what always struck me so odd, the people would be walking without shirts or without pants on, and they didn't think anything of it; they were so used to seeing humans nude most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="389">They stripped them everyday and hosed them down. </sentence><sentence id="390">This is stories that they told us later. </sentence><sentence id="391">But I actually saw and have movies of people walking around without clothes on and think nothing of it. </sentence><sentence id="392">The men in particular. </sentence><sentence id="393">Uh, the women weren't that, uh, uh, aggressive. </sentence><sentence id="394">In other words they, they were more polite. </sentence><sentence id="395">They tried to hide themselves. </sentence><sentence id="396">And the women that were nude in their bunks would put their hands over their breasts and it was pathetic. </sentence><sentence id="397">Very sad. </sentence><sentence id="398">I'm, I'm glad that it, that it has never been that bad since, uh, that is that we we haven't publicized these things, but what we do know and we hope that it never happens again and, uh, if these pictures will help prove a point, I'm sure they won't happen again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: Did you see the quarry? </sentence><sentence id="411"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="415">It was, as I said, it was down, uh, uh, below the camp itself. </sentence><sentence id="416">The camp was on the highest point of the hill. </sentence><sentence id="417">The quarry was, was starting to go into the side of the mountain towards the; ultimately they, as I said earlier, the camp would have fallen in if they quarried that far. </sentence><sentence id="418">But the the staircase, they, they quarried the staircase right out of the stone of the mountain and, uh, there were big blocks of stone. </sentence><sentence id="419">It was a typical quarry. </sentence><sentence id="420">They were making building blocks for the bridges and the highways and also for stone buildings that they, uh, were putting up here and there. </sentence><sentence id="421">Uh, most of the stones were going for, uh, highways and for reinforcing underground bunkers and things like that and the people had to carry stones up the stairs, to the main camp because they built a hugh dividing wall between the quarters of the SS troopers and the, uh, kitchen and the infirmary or the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="422">They built a stone wall between those and the, uh, barracks where they had the experimental prisoners, where they they inoculated them with all kinds of, uh, germs or they froze them in vats of water and, uh, experimented generally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="432">Q: Describe if you would what the experimental compound looked like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="434">A: Well, uh, if you've ever been in an Army camp in the United States, you'll see rows and rows of barracks. </sentence><sentence id="435">Well, these were a little closer together. </sentence><sentence id="436">Uh, it reminded me of chicken coops on a big chicken ranch, and, uh, there was about seven rows of them and about ten buildings in each row. </sentence><sentence id="437">And there was about two hundred people in each one of those barracks. </sentence><sentence id="438">They were smaller than the ones down at the lower side of the camp where, where the quarry prisoners, uh, were quartered, and, uh, I don't know uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="444">Q: What was the condition, what were conditions like inside these barracks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: Uh, well they were less crowded because, uh, they still had the bunks but they had about three high and they still had about two people in in each one, but they weren't, they weren't as elaborate, hugh; the buildings weren't as big as the ones in the lower camp, the lower section of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="447">Uh, they were smaller and only about two hundred people in each, which is almost what we had in our own Army barracks in the States. </sentence><sentence id="448">We had about a hundred and fifty--well not a hundred and...uh, the bigger ones did but we had about seventy-five men and where we had seventy-five men, they had two hundred. </sentence><sentence id="449">That's how much more crowded the bunks were on top of each other whereas we only had bunks on the floor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="454">Q: What were the condition, the physical condition of these prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: Well, it was very much the same as these the ones that we saw ear... earlier who were when we first came in--the ones who were the strongest naturally had the guns and everything. </sentence><sentence id="457">And but these people that we saw were very weak. </sentence><sentence id="458">They were all starved and all trying to eat a little soup. </sentence><sentence id="459">Uh, we had already started soup kitchens, the first, first day we got there practically. </sentence><sentence id="460">Because the Army, we have so many cooks-- every one, every company has a cook--so we didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="461">We forfeited our food and told our mess sergeants to take it to the  1 camp, which they did for the first couple of days until we got steady stream of supplies coming in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: Did you go in to the experimental labs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: No, I, I, they didn't have them set up. </sentence><sentence id="471">They, uh, these experiments were going on before we got there. </sentence><sentence id="472">This is what these people were telling us. </sentence><sentence id="473">I didn't see any of, of these inno...inoculations or bathing in ice water or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="474">It's just, uh, what the people were telling us and what the records show now that from all kinds of witnesses and from the German records and so on. </sentence><sentence id="475">It collor...you know; it confirms the stories that we heard then. </sentence><sentence id="476">Couldn't-- they were unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="477">In fact most of the guys were in a daze--so when they got, they couldn't, they they didn't want to comprehend what they had seen. </sentence><sentence id="478">They wanted to forget it. </sentence><sentence id="479">If you ask any of the fellows about what they saw at this camp, they--it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="480">It stunk and the smell was awful. </sentence><sentence id="481">As I said, I was brought up on a farm from age 10, and farm smells didn't bother me, uh, even the vilest, and they were vile--you know, these dead people. </sentence><sentence id="482">Some of them had been dead for a couple of days or more and then they had dysentery and their rectums were all sore and the, the skin was eaten away. </sentence><sentence id="483">These were people that are still alive let alone the dead ones, and they smelled. </sentence><sentence id="484">But I--the, the decaying flesh I was used to because on a farm we had all sorts of dead animals and it was much the same. </sentence><sentence id="485">To me, I wasn't, uh, it didn't bother me. </sentence><sentence id="486">But most of the fellows remember the smell because they were city boys. </sentence><sentence id="487">They had not, uh, been exposed to this type of thing. </sentence><sentence id="488">So and as I said, uh, have thought it since then, we were in order and we were used to it because we had seen these bodies along the road for a few days before we got to the camp and, uh, we had seen these stripped uniforms and these these human skeletons that, uh, were dead as we went by them, as we went, as we were spear-heading. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="509">Q: Was there anything else about Mauthausen that strikes you in particular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="511">A: Well, the the security they had: they had the, they built another stone wall between the double electrified fence which was the original partition between the, the German officers" quarters; they had a double electrified fence with this trench in between with barbed wire on the ground over the trench and, uh, the the security that they had to provide for themselves to keep these people from climbing over the wall to get at them. </sentence><sentence id="512">And, uh, they had machine gun nests at every corner of the walls overlooking the compound, and, uh, the other thing I couldn't get over was how the people were all out in the sun trying to sun themselves because they were confined in the barracks a lot of them and they weren't even out working anymore. </sentence><sentence id="513">They were just kept in the barracks and they'd feed them with a few crusts of bread and it was a real mess. </sentence><sentence id="514">Everything was smelly. </sentence><sentence id="515">There were no latrine facilities and, uh, they were doing it out in the streets in you know their bowel movements and so on--such as they had, which wasn't very much. </sentence><sentence id="516">And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in, having taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on maneuvers, I was a medical aide, corpsman we called them. </sentence><sentence id="517">Uh, I was quite stricken, uh, stricken I should say by the fact that the genitals, or genitalia of the men and the women were the last things to apparently go because they looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="518">The women's breasts had  2 shrunk quite a bit, but their nipples and, uh, and looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="519">And the men's penises and testicles were about normal. </sentence><sentence id="520">And the rest of them were absolutely bones and, uh, with skin stretched over them. </sentence><sentence id="521">And that's the one thing that I'll never forget is, is the condition of, of the things that are needed to reproduce life. </sentence><sentence id="522">They're the last things to go, as far as I could see. </sentence><sentence id="523">In other words, Mother Nature was trying to save the reproductive organs. </sentence><sentence id="524">It was the one thing that struck me out of looking at all these thousands of dead whenever we buried them. </sentence><sentence id="525">And as I said, we had these, uh, they couldn't dig the graves fast enough so we got our bulldozers to dig the trenches, push the dirt out and then was a, uh, was a token for the Germans to get shovels and start to shovel the dirt back into the trenches. </sentence><sentence id="526">Well we'd have been there for another two weeks burying them if we had to do everything by hand. </sentence><sentence id="527">We did dig a few trenches by hand, but we then used the bulldozers because there were so many. </sentence><sentence id="528">They had them stacked up by the hundreds waiting to be buried. </sentence><sentence id="529">They couldn't dig the graves fast enough by hand, so that's why we got the German, uh, civilians in there to, uh, handle them. </sentence><sentence id="530">They put them down in the graves and laid them side by side and then they would throw a few shovels of dirt in and I'll never forget as the bulldozer, as Al pushed the, uh, stone and sand back into the trenches, you would hear a stone crunching the ribs and the bones of the poor bodies down below. </sentence><sentence id="531">It was, because this was backfill for the soccer field was made out of backfill and from the quarry and there were a lot of hard stones  3 some of these along to give to the people for souvenirs. </sentence><sentence id="532">But, uh, we were back again in 1980 and we're trying to go back every five years, and we meet the people that we released, and we meet their children, and now we're bringing our children and it's a great thing that the survivors of Mauthausen, and there were around 12,000 alive when we got there. </sentence><sentence id="533">And I guess maybe un another couple of hundred died and so there were 11,000 actual people alive when we got there, but the ones coming back are the families of the victims who died in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="534">They come back by the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="535">But we were back in 1975 there were around 12,000 people there and you wouldn't know how they got there because every road was full of these big, uh, tourists bus that hold fifty people--they were lined up like, uh, cars around a football stadium in the States. </sentence><sentence id="536">Incredible where they come from Spain and Hungary, Hungaria--all the countries of Europe and, uh, we were, as I said, when they found out we were the liberators they couldn't do enough for us. </sentence><sentence id="537">They practically tore the, they wanted our hats; they wanted, they were going to tear the clothes off us. </sentence><sentence id="538">We were real celebrities. </sentence><sentence id="539">So I felt good about that and I'm; I just felt so sad about all those that were killed, over a hundred twenty thousand were killed in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="540">Or more. </sentence><sentence id="541">They're not sure. </sentence><sentence id="542">It's between a hundred twenty, hundred fifty thousand that they know of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="575">Q: Is there anything else about Mauthausen that you remember in particular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="577">A: Well, nothing except that it was made so the people couldn't get out, and as I said it looked like a prison when we first observed it, and it was more like a prison when you got in it, uh, because they don't have the double electrified fences. </sentence><sentence id="578">Our prisons have fences, but not electrified, and, uh, the, uh, condition of the people--the human skeletons walking around was another thing that impressed me. </sentence><sentence id="579">As I said the, uh, that anybody could be alive and that thin when they looked like bones, their legs, their arms, their feet looked swollen in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="580">That was the only thing that looked anywheres near normal was from their ankles down to their insteps. </sentence><sentence id="581">Uh, the rest of the bodies were, uh, skin drawn over their faces as if it were shrunk in the heat or whatever--just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="582">And I don't know what else to say...the smells as I said were terrible, but I wasn't too fazed by that for some reason, and I think it was because of my upbringing on a farm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="589">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="590">Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="591">You had mentioned that some of your men were in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="592">Were you in Dachau as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="605">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="607">Q: Where did you go from...no, before we do that, what--by the time you left at the end of thirty days--what shape was the camp in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="609">A: Oh, as I said, we started to burn some of the buildings and, uh, the, uh, we backfilled the  4 trenches and the latrines and most of the people were gone. </sentence><sentence id="610">The ones who could walk started walking home within a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="611">And, uh, the ones who were very sick we moved out into field hospitals and, uh, some of those that stayed were trying to help us get the records to find out and to check on how many people were killed and to keep track of everything and we had some of the people working there because they didn't want to go home. </sentence><sentence id="612">A lot of them were Russians and they didn't want to go back to to Russia, so, uh, we tried to keep them, uh, working in the camp and they, because the they said if we go back to Russia it will be the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="613">And it was we found out later. </sentence><sentence id="614">They were sent to the salt mines, to Siberia in other words, and, uh, that was something that I didn't think of until just now, but, uh, they were glad to be left behind. </sentence><sentence id="615">They didn't want to go back to Russia and we, they, uh, incidentally from after we let the, as I say, uh, should say, we took the demolitions off the bridge in Linz. </sentence><sentence id="616">Our group, our engineers were then sent out into, uh, north of CCB and the camp, and thousands, hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and White Russians tried to surrender to us. </sentence><sentence id="617">And we accepted their surrender, and, uh, in place, but they wanted to come into Germany you know, on our side of the line because they didn't want to be anywheres near the Russians and unfortunately our politicians had said this is the line of demarcation and all those Russians on that side, I mean Germans, will have to go back to the Russians and so a couple of hundred thousand soldiers that surrendered to us were returned to the Germans [Russians] and shipped to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="618">But that was, that was the 6th of May. </sentence><sentence id="619">In fact it was the afternoon of the Sth, the 6th and the 7th, and on about the 8th I got to the camp, and I was there on and off for a couple of days, but the main part was when we got the the ditches or trenches dug for the graves. </sentence><sentence id="620">That was my main job there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: Where did you go when you left Mauthausen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="635">A: Oh, we were sent into various little cities in Austria, uh, to maintain order and, uh, make sure there was no looting by the, uh, prisoners who had gotten away from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="636">They were all over. </sentence><sentence id="637">They were going to march home, but they wanted clothes. </sentence><sentence id="638">They were either stealing it from the Germans or taking it from the Germans, and they were fighting going on and we had to maintain order. </sentence><sentence id="639">It was a real madhouse. </sentence><sentence id="640">And, uh, we were sent to Schwanenstadt. </sentence><sentence id="641">And then from there we were, as engineers, we were sent out to maintain roads and rebuild bridges and, uh, electrical plants and, uh, to guard the prisoners in Ebensee, which was a camp--a concentration camp--and it was now full of SS prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="642">And these haughty bastards, as we called them, were very independent; and, uh, they...they wouldn't...they didn't want to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="643">They thought they were still lords of the universe, being SS and being used to that, uh, having control, uh, full control over civilians and full control over the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="644">They were the masters of Hitler, they were, uh, Hitler's, uh, supermen. </sentence><sentence id="645">And, uh, we now had them crawling because we didn't feed them. </sentence><sentence id="646">They were digging up worms and eating worms. </sentence><sentence id="647">They dug up all the grass. </sentence><sentence id="648">It was in May and June that we started putting them in, in late May. </sentence><sentence id="649">And they were digging up the grass. </sentence><sentence id="650">They were eating worms. </sentence><sentence id="651">I mean it. </sentence><sentence id="652">And, uh, they were waiting, praying for rain and we had a few days of rain and the worms would come near the top and they would dig them out. </sentence><sentence id="653">And so we started giving them crackers and things, give them a couple of crackers from our K-ration boxes. </sentence><sentence id="654">And we'd get a wristwatch which was worth maybe seven or eight dollars, and then we sold them to the  5 Russians for over a hundred. </sentence><sentence id="655">And some of the Russians later on were paying five hundred to a thousand dollars for a Mickey Mouse watch, in particular. </sentence><sentence id="656">And we were getting these watches from the SS men and then selling them to the Russians for souvenirs, because we all had watches. </sentence><sentence id="657">We could get them anytime in the PX for about ten bucks. </sentence><sentence id="658">And here we were getting a hundred dollars to five hundred dollars. </sentence><sentence id="659">And some of the fellows that were able to go to Berlin and trade with the Russians got over a thousand dollars for a wristwatch that we got for a cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="660">The cigarettes were worth money to them. </sentence><sentence id="661">They were like gold. </sentence><sentence id="662">And every soldier had a pack of cigarettes, a carton of cigarettes, a week issued. </sentence><sentence id="663">Whether you used them or not, you were entitled to a carton. </sentence><sentence id="664">So a lot of the guys learned how to smoke; and I hate to say this, but many of them are dead now because of the lousy habit. </sentence><sentence id="665">And their wives always complained, "Oh, yeah, he's been smoking like this ever since he got out of the Army, and dying of emphysema and lung cancer." </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="700">There we had double electrified fences for them. </sentence><sentence id="701">We left them in place. </sentence><sentence id="702">And, uh, we had guard towers and machine guns, and that's what we took turns guarding. </sentence><sentence id="703">And I hated that. </sentence><sentence id="704">I was only there a couple days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="711">Q: Can you describe the camp? </sentence><sentence id="712">In addition to the fences, what what did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: Well, the, the main barracks were in back of it and, uh, I just stayed, we had guard towers in a wire enclosure which we had put up in front. </sentence><sentence id="716">It was something new. </sentence><sentence id="717">We had built that. </sentence><sentence id="718">And I...I'd seen Mauthausen, so I didn't go to look at the quarters there because I figured they're all the same. </sentence><sentence id="719">And we were too busy taunting the SS men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: How did you taunt them? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: What, uh.... Did you make the SS do, uh, certain chores? </sentence><sentence id="730">How did you...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="733">A: Well, there was so many of them. </sentence><sentence id="734">And there was really nothing much for them to do. </sentence><sentence id="735">We made them build the fences, yeah, their own "corrals" you might call it. </sentence><sentence id="736">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="737">But we didn't trust them to to do what the ordinary soldiers were doing back in camp, in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="738">There, they were restoring the facilities and cleaning up and they were doing the buggy- lugging (ph) when they burnt the camp. </sentence><sentence id="739">And they were burning up anything stuff that was Nazi that they didn't like--I got a Nazi flag. </sentence><sentence id="740">I said, as | was watching it burn. </sentence><sentence id="741">I said, "Oh, I'll grab that and see if it's...." And it bur... guess it's full of holes. </sentence><sentence id="742">L..I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="743">I've never unrolled it since I picked it out of the burning pile. </sentence><sentence id="744">And I got it in the car. </sentence><sentence id="745">I was going to show it to you, if you were interested. </sentence><sentence id="746">But that's the only souvenir that I got from the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="761">Q: The SS, uh, I assume eventually you got, uh, soup kitchen up and you fed them finally? </sentence><sentence id="762"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="766">Well, as I said, I was only there a couple of days because I hated guard duty and, uh, it was just standing there watching these guys do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="767">They'd play cards and dig for worms and they didn't have much to do. </sentence><sentence id="768">There was not much of an area to dig for worms. </sentence><sentence id="769">In a couple of days the worms were gone. </sentence><sentence id="770">Unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="771">So they were and they were without shirts, they were, uh, their uniforms were, uh, either torn off of them or whatever by somebody but a lot of them didn't have any shirts. </sentence><sentence id="772">They had pants and, uh, as I said we taunted them the way they did, uh, the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="773">They would shoot the civilians if they didn't fire at us earlier in the war and, uh, many times the people said the SS made them do it, which was true enough. </sentence></p></dialogue>
