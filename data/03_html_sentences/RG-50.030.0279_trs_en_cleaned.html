<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Mechanical engineer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Mechanical engineer, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: And so next day, I came and we all went to see this Timisoara (ph). </sentence><sentence id="325">And he went along at my  side, and he asked me, "What can we do here? </sentence><sentence id="326">What can we do here and here?" </sentence><sentence id="327">And I said, "It's very difficult, but we have to do whatever we can, and we will do." </sentence><sentence id="328">He said, "All right." </sentence><sentence id="329">So that was the beginning of my relationship with Yegendorf. </sentence><sentence id="330">He made me -- I have this document as a , the chief engineer. </sentence><sentence id="331">Chief engineer was a Mr. Bingerstratts (ph). </sentence><sentence id="332">He was the, how shall I say, the son-in-law of a very rich man from Radom, who was on the . </sentence><sentence id="333">Yegendorf was also on the . </sentence><sentence id="334">So this Bingerstratts was made chief engineer; I was his deputy. </sentence><sentence id="335">So we started little by little, we started to build up this Timisoara. </sentence><sentence id="336">Yegendorf was in the beginning a nice fellow, but the more power he got the more he became brutal. </sentence><sentence id="337">And he was intellectually a lightweight, but there were people around us, which certainly you know, there was a Dr. Kessler (ph), a lawyer, from Donetsk (ph). </sentence><sentence id="338">He was a very, very clever man and a highly intelligent man. </sentence><sentence id="339">Kessler was his alter-ego for Yegendorf. </sentence><sentence id="340">If Kessler proposed what to do, Yegendorf signed and said, "I did it." </sentence><sentence id="341">And so it went with a lot of penchants in the Timisoara. </sentence><sentence id="342">People did a lot of things to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: Can you explain how come this Timisoara (ph), this foundry, was created? </sentence><sentence id="364">What was the interest of the Romanian authorities to create the foundry and why they wanted -- why they went ahead with this idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Well, so far as I know, there was a lot of people, the prefect of Mogilev had some people around himself that were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="368">Yegendorf had some people around him that were also Jews. </sentence><sentence id="369">And they made business, one group with the other. </sentence><sentence id="370">In order to make business and that it should be something we make work for the benefit of the country, so it was war. </sentence><sentence id="371">The Timisoara (ph), which could repair cars, tractors, and do other things, was very important for the Germans and for the Romanians. </sentence><sentence id="372">And besides, the great motive of this, I believe, was people -- the Romanians, the Prefect, the Major of the gendarmerie, who was -- they wanted to make business; they wanted to get rich. </sentence><sentence id="373">And my personal opinion is that this is our luck, because we could corrupt them with money and we could stay there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: So if I understand when Mogilev was practically a huge ghetto, which had this foundry, this Timisoara (ph), as the main industrial unit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="384">The Timisoara (ph) was there when the Russians had -- after they were done. </sentence><sentence id="385">When they left they destroyed a lot of this. </sentence><sentence id="386">Now, Yegendorf and Prefect Bayona (ph), who was, by the way, an Austrian-Romanian, he was serving in the Austrian Army during the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="387">Yegendorf was a lieutenant of the First -- in the Austrian Army of the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="388">So they had a common language. </sentence><sentence id="389">They both spoke German, and they both understood each other. </sentence><sentence id="390">They made it in order to have a hinterland. </sentence><sentence id="391">To provide for the army, for the force or whoever. </sentence><sentence id="392">And we did a lot of things for the army, for the Romanian Army and for the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="393">The Germans came in and gave the order and we did it. </sentence><sentence id="394">In the beginning we had our difficulties because we -- there was not instruments. </sentence><sentence id="395">We had to begin from zero. </sentence><sentence id="396">The first hammer we made, I remember there was an old man by the name of Bloan (ph) Schmitt. </sentence><sentence id="397">And he took a piece of iron and two bricks and put a fire in the two big bricks, and put the iron in the fire. </sentence><sentence id="398">Then with another brick, he hammered this out and we had the first hammer. </sentence><sentence id="399">So we made instruments and we made instruments for our lathe machine, for our planning  machine, for our blazer, the Timisoara (ph) infected was a -- have a molten, the iron started to work and we did a lot of things over for the government, for the Romanians. </sentence><sentence id="400">And, by the way, some people made money, the big ones of the Romanians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: If my understanding is correct, some of the Jews from Mogilev were deported later from Mogilev to Szydlowiec, am I correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: Can you elaborate on this? </sentence><sentence id="424">Can you describe to us what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: I can only tell you that one day we had a lot of some -- in my department there was about five Mogilev Jews, workers, real good workers. </sentence><sentence id="428">And in order not to be deported, they had to be working in the Timisoara (ph). </sentence><sentence id="429">And so we had a lot in other departments, some Russian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="430">But the majority was deported to Szydlowiec or other places. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: Did you witness those deportations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
