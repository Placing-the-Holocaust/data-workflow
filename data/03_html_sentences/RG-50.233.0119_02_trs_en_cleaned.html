They lived, mostly Jews lived in the town. </sentence><sentence id="432">Mostly Jews lived around the market place and the market place all houses were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="433">Only four houses in the market place, which was very big, were no Jewish and all the Jews had the businesses and the rest of the Jews were not rich, were very poor lived around the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="434">They were small crooked houses, old houses falling down. </sentence><sentence id="435">Rozia lived I would say about half a mile or maybe a kilometer, no about a mile out of town on the road to go to Rzeszow. </sentence><sentence id="436">And they lived there and they had two houses. </sentence><sentence id="437">Three families had two houses. </sentence><sentence id="438">There was a brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="439">Her parents. </sentence><sentence id="440">Her mother had a sister and a brother and they were all in the business. </sentence><sentence id="441">In the business before the war and they lived in those houses. </sentence><sentence id="442">They were nice houses. </sentence><sentence id="443">It's not comparison like we have in America because there was no running water and there was no indoor plumbing. </sentence><sentence id="444">But the houses were nice with beautiful gardens with flowers. </sentence><sentence id="445">Now one of the sisters of her mother, her name was Mrs. Smith, she was very particular in her garden. </sentence><sentence id="446">She always worked, with beautiful flowers and every time there was a concourse, it was how you say, to judge which flowers, a contest, her flowers were the nicest. </sentence><sentence id="447">She didn't have children so she had the flowers. </sentence><sentence id="448">So they lived there, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="449">The only thing they had more than we in the town, we didn't have electricity, they had electricity. </sentence><sentence id="450">The reason why is because they had electricity from the mills because they had there the generators, so they had electricity for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="451">So for us it was something important because when we come we saw electricity. </sentence><sentence id="452">They had very beautiful homes, very nicely furnished. </sentence><sentence id="453">But for our town it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="454">But it was lacking water and indoor plumbing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: Was the mill fairly successful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: It was successful, but later it fell down because in the beginning of the "30s it was a fire, there was a big fire in the mill and they somehow could never recuperate, they could never build themselves up as it was before the fire. </sentence><sentence id="482">So it was not so big, it was a small flourmill and a small lumber mill, it was not big. </sentence><sentence id="483">It wasn't that they manufactured to send out for export like other mills, it was mostly for domestic use. </sentence><sentence id="484">Peasants needed to have flour brought over some grain but it was not successful after the fire, it was not successful. </sentence><sentence id="485">But it was a very prominent family. </sentence><sentence id="486">They were a little more modern than the majority people in our town. </sentence><sentence id="487">The majority people were very orthodox and they were already a little more progressive, like you could see like Rozia's sister and brother already went to gymnasia, my sisters didn't go because my father would never allow us to go on a Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="488">Rozia didn't go anymore to the gymnasia but her brothers went. </sentence><sentence id="489">The reason Rozia didn't go to the gymnasia because this was after the fire and probably this was quite expensive because it was a private gymnasia, private high school, and probably it was too expensive for them to send Rozia to the gymnasia. </sentence><sentence id="490">So instead of the gymnasia, so after she finished the she went to a seamstress to learn how to sew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="501">Q: The seamstress worked in town or next door to her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="503">A: Well, not far from them. </sentence><sentence id="504">There was a seamstress, she was special, a very elegant seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="505">She was from Kollupzowa originally and later she moved to Vienna and she had a workshop in Vienna.. Later she came back when Hitler started to, when Hitler came to power in Germany because her husband was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="506">His name was Rosner. </sentence><sentence id="507">So her husband was Jewish and she wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="508">But anyway because when they started with all the laws in Germany and Vienna, so she figured she didn't want to wait so she came back home. </sentence><sentence id="509">The woman by whom she worked. </sentence><sentence id="510">So   see I know all those stories, I don't know what else I can tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="520">Q: I think that's good.. So they were sewing like dresses? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: Well, mostly they were sewing to order. </sentence><sentence id="523">If somebody wanted to have elegant nice dress, but they didn't sew dresses to sell or something, this was only to people from the town would come. </sentence><sentence id="524">Not the average person because average person went to somebody who was cheaper, but somebody who wanted to have a very elegant dress, a very elegant suit, women, so they came to her. </sentence><sentence id="525">Because her being already having already a workshop in Vienna, she was a little more sophisticated. </sentence><sentence id="526">And then Rozia after the war and before the war she was very capable. </sentence><sentence id="527">She did all her dresses herself. </sentence><sentence id="528">She was very good at it and then later when her sister left for Russia, so she left all her clothing with her because they wouldn't take away, so later she fixed them over to fit for Rozia. </sentence><sentence id="529">And then later when she needed to eat, so she started to sell little by little what her sister left in the house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: So in the ghetto she had things from her family to sell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="540">A: She had things from her family to sell, yes. </sentence><sentence id="541">But she was by herself, so she ate with her uncle. </sentence><sentence id="542">With her uncle who didn't have no children and how they lived, they lived together. </sentence><sentence id="543">I know I used to travel a lot and I used to go out in the ghetto, I took off always my armband, because I didn't look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="544">So I used to go out and I used to bring in a lot of food to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="545">So every time they needed something, so I brought it for them. </sentence><sentence id="546">This is how we went along. </sentence><sentence id="547">If the Germans wouldn't have a total destruction, a lot of people could survive. </sentence><sentence id="548">You see Rozia had the big chance because she looked so much gentile and she spoke so good Polish. </sentence><sentence id="549">Because her language actually was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="550">They didn't speak home Yiddish like the majority. </sentence><sentence id="551">The majority Jews did. </sentence><sentence id="552">Like for instance, in my home we spoke Yiddish, but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="553">I spoke a good Polish because we spoke Polish in the business, in the store with the non-Polish population and my father was practically the only Jew with the long grey beard who spoke beautiful Polish. </sentence><sentence id="554">But the majority people in our town didn't speak good Polish. </sentence><sentence id="555">But Rozia's family spoke only Polish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Did Rozia speak Yiddish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: Very bad. </sentence><sentence id="575">She spoke always, I remember, when she came to us and sometimes she spoke to my father, so my father laughed and she always, well you speak Yiddish like a shiksa. </sentence><sentence id="576">She spoke very bad. </sentence><sentence id="577">She spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="578">Everybody by us in our section spoke German because our section was Galicia and this belonged to Austria until the end of the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="579">So everybody spoke Polish, I mean German. </sentence><sentence id="580">But Yiddish, she didn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="581">She understood, but.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: So when you two spoke it was in Polish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: It was in Polish, yes. </sentence><sentence id="593">And I remember even when she came to our house so my sisters, my mother spoke to her in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="594">And late when she came to our house when we were in the ghetto and there were certain times that I brought over things that you couldn't get in the ghetto, salami, a piece of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="595">All I remember my brother in America sent through turkey, a package with chocolate, with salami with other goodies that you couldn't get in the ghetto, and I would divide it for all the children. </sentence><sentence id="596">When she made little pieces, she always included Rozia. </sentence><sentence id="597">She said it was for her, she got also a part. </sentence><sentence id="598">I remember it was Rozia's birthday and I wanted to give her a present and I there was nothing to sell in the time of the war and my sister had a beautiful   manicure set and she got it from her first boyfriend. </sentence><sentence id="599">It was with initials R.S. so she gave it to me I should give it to Rozia. </sentence><sentence id="600">My sister was Rachel Saleschutz and Rozia was Rozia Shiskin, and she said give it to Rozia. </sentence><sentence id="601">Then later she said to me, well maybe I shouldn't give it to you because this gift didn't work out good for her, but nevertheless she gave it to me and I gave it to Rozia. </sentence><sentence id="602">You see, we were very close and I was the youngest in the family and if I wanted something it was all right with the family. </sentence><sentence id="603">See her family was different from my family. </sentence><sentence id="604">My family was more Hassidic, ultra, ultra orthodox and their family was modern. </sentence><sentence id="605">So this was a little bad, but later it didn't make no difference. </sentence><sentence id="606">It so happens that her brother, now in America, he's very religious. </sentence><sentence id="607">He goes every day to shul. </sentence><sentence id="608">I don't go. </sentence><sentence id="609">I go once a year. </sentence><sentence id="610">You know, it changed those things. </sentence><sentence id="611">You don't always have the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
