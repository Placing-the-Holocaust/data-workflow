<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: -- appropriate, but -- one thing that I wanted to ask about, specifically, just from looking at the other interview, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what your family was like fr -- you know, from -- from your childhood. </sentence><sentence id="48">What -- I mean, were they - - I mean, you know, things like was it a religious family or were you -- you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: Mm. </sentence><sentence id="50">I think you couldn't -- you couldn't grow up or live in the city of Frankfort, in Germany, without being touched by religion. </sentence><sentence id="51">There were -- of course the city had undergone all these movements of -- when the reform movement started, they went to that one extreme and then they went to an -- the other extreme and throughout reform movement and -- but generally, a-around 1850 or so, Rabbi Samson Raffelhirsch be -- came to Frankfort. </sentence><sentence id="52">He was Orthodox and there was an -- a t-tone of Orthodoxy all throughout the city. </sentence><sentence id="53">The stores were -- Jewish stores were closed on Shabbas, except for two department stores that were owned by Jews, but they -- they -- they were open. </sentence><sentence id="54">And most people kept kosher. </sentence><sentence id="55">My school was not the real -- Samson Raffelhirsch religious school, it was a school that had been opened in 1804 by a secretary of one of the Rothchild's. </sentence><sentence id="56">They had seen to a Yeshiva Baharim and walking around and they f -- and </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="65">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 5 Rothchild felt they should have a -- a secular -- or any kind of education. </sentence><sentence id="66">So he commissioned his secretary to start a school for -- for them and out of this grew a school that was called Filantropine, which was -- because of it's beginning was -- had the -- had a philanthropic connotation, but by the time when my brother and I went, my father was joking that it cost him as much for our education as a -- what a German workman would earn per month. </sentence><sentence id="67">Well, not quite, but, you know, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="68">So this school really -- also [indecipherable] Samson Raffelhirsch school, they were always Orthodox and there was no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="69">This school, when -- when -- it had started experimenting with Sunday schooling and with Saturday schooling. </sentence><sentence id="70">They didn't write on Shabbat, but they ha -- they had school on Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="71">And then they gave that up again. </sentence><sentence id="72">By the time we went -- this went on through the century. </sentence><sentence id="73">By the time we went to school, it was fairly -- well, the people who went were -- who went there were -- not the very Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="74">So my parents kept kosher and we kept Shabbat, we kept Eviomtop, but we didn't -- it wasn't as the other school. </sentence><sentence id="75">Now, but I remember we were 43 children in the beginning and I -- I don't know -- I think one confessed that she didn't -- that that family didn't keep kosher, and everybody else did. </sentence><sentence id="76">So, if -- if that answers your question -- I don't know if it's enough. </sentence><sentence id="77">I mean we -- my parents belonged to a synagogue that was burned down in 1938 in the Kristallnacht, that would be considered, probably Conservative by today's standards, even though it was different. </sentence><sentence id="78">There was still the mareetzah, with women upstairs and men downstairs and other things, but it -- but it -- and it didn't have a -- an organ like the Reform synagogue -- that one Reform synagogue that's still standing in    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0022 6 Frankfort now, but it -- it was a little less str-strict than the Samson Rafellhirsch's sh -- synagogue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="94">And -- I mean what -- what -- how would you describe your -- o-obviously your fam -- I mean, they could afford to send you to that kind of school and -- and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Would you describe them as -- as -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Oh, just probably middle class. </sentence><sentence id="98">I mean, we weren't ju -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: -- middle class or [indecipherable] class or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Not -- maybe middle-middle class -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: That's what I felt, that they put up a united front against the outside forces. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="141">But wh -- but why do you think they didn't -- why -- do you -- what do you think about why they didn't leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: It's a hardship, certainly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Yeah, well -- what then -- in -- when Czechoslovakia was invaded, in 1938, I think it was, We -- my parents sold everything in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="199">My father relied on his passport and we made our way to the French border. </sentence><sentence id="200">The borders were closed, they wouldn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="201">We had to sleep in a farmhouse overnight and then the next day we went back to Frankfort. </sentence><sentence id="202">I've heard of people who followed that same route, but they were adults and they swam across the river -- a river -- illegally and made their way into France. </sentence><sentence id="203">Now, my parents couldn't have done this in [phone ringing] Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="204">What's the next question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Well, I guess the next question is what -- what do you -- what do you remember about yourself, kind of as -- as a -- as a child? </sentence><sentence id="213">What kind of -- do you know what -- what kind of kid were you, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>

much for them. </sentence><sentence id="2271">I think recently they have -- some of their publications have written about the Greek people, but not much. </sentence><sentence id="2272">So, there were

from Selonika and I turned around -- I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people there, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2274">I think it must have been thousands. </sentence><sentence
