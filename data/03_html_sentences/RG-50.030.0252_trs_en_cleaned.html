<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: O.K., O.K. Uh, my father was considered a political refugee from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="135">Now political refugees from Germany were not just Jews but they were communists, democrats, anybody who had fled Germany because of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="136">And when the war started, the Belgiums and the French, uh, arrested everybody that was German, men first, uh, mostly men, in some cases some women, but my mother and I did not get arrested because we were German. </sentence><sentence id="137">My father was arrested because he was a German and they knew that he was Jewish, but these

concentration camps but internment camps in southern France - St. Cyprien, Gurs, Rivesaltes and there were several others. </sentence><sentence id="140">Now at the time my father was arrested, by the police of course, Belgium police, we only knew that all these men were being transported to France because the German advance came very fast and they had to put them somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="141">At that time we decided, my mother and I decided, or rather my mother decided, that we should go and look for my father. </sentence><sentence id="142">We knew southern France, we had some names, but we weren't sure. </sentence><sentence id="143">So we tried to get across the border ahead of the German Army into France. </sentence><sentence id="144">At the border, Belgian, at the Belgian- France, uh French border, uh we were arrested for being Germans. </sentence><sentence id="145">They looked at our ID cards, Belgian ID card, which were for foreigners, and it said of course nationality German. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were arrested by the police at the border, trying to cross, and were put in prison. </sentence><sentence id="147">Uh, my mother was put in the women's section, and I, for the first time in my life, was in a prison cell, and that was one of the worse experience, experiences up to that date, of my life, because I was in solitary so to say, I was all by myself in a cell, for almost a week. </sentence><sentence id="148">And the Germans bombed the city. </sentence><sentence id="149">I can't recall the city right now but it was at the border, it was a small town, Vavik (ph) was the name of the city, Vavik (ph).And, uh, the women's section was served by nuns and I got to see my mother only once when she was being walked in the courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="150">After a week, or about a week, we were all assembled in the courtyard, all, more, more, I would think, there were mostly Jews from Germany and put on a train under heavy guard and sent to southern France to the , which is rather large camp which later on became more famous because they put uh the Jews from Baden (Ballon) (ph) in there and other people. </sentence><sentence id="151">It was originally a camp that was created by the French to put the remnants of the French, of the uh Spanish uh army who were fighting Franco in there when they fled to France they were put in there. </sentence><sentence id="152">But most of them they were gone by the time we came there. </sentence><sentence id="153">There were a few of them left who had not been resettled. </sentence><sentence id="154">And we were put in the , which in the Pyrenees, in the southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, then the war was over pretty quick which we all know, and uh, where to go. </sentence><sentence id="156">There were releases everyday people got released. </sentence><sentence id="157">If you had papers to go to some foreign country, the French were glad to get rid of the people. </sentence><sentence id="158">The food was terrible there and people were, there were no killings, mass killings or anything like that but uh people died from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="159">If you didn't have any packages coming in from the outside there was a good chance you would die from hunger there. </sentence><sentence id="160">And there is a very large cemetery which I visited after the war, and uh, I assume that most people are buried there. </sentence><sentence id="161">There were no crematoriums, uh crematoriums, and uh, so, uh the camp itself was very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="162">It was muddy, it was filthy, it was uh full of fleas, uh uh and it was just a makeshift camp. </sentence><sentence id="163">And uh so then the time came for some people to leave to be released, and uh uh, as we know it was the unoccupied zone of France, and uh but the Germans did have some control because Germans did come there with the French, the Vichy police, or Vichy government officials, uh and uh, made sure that uh certain people are kept in there, but by that I mean probably German communists who were so-called enemies of the German state. </sentence><sentence id="164">Now when it came to the women and children, like my mother and myself, uh they say can you go anyplace. </sentence><sentence id="165">And we decided we would look for my father and it was also at that time determined that my father as in the which is on the Mediterranean coast. </sentence><sentence id="166">I failed to mention that the first camp is toward the Atlantic coast, one in the Pyrennnes and one is the Bas-Pyrennes of France, so we said we had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="167">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="168"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection a destination finally; we said we wanted to join my father. </sentence><sentence id="169">We didn't know whether or not he was going to be released but he was there.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: What year is this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="212"> A Iam talking about 1940, late. </sentence><sentence id="213">Uh, we traveled to this place, we found my father, and uh, through again some help of the French, but at the time we were all speaking French pretty well, uh, we uh, went to a little town called Auchtafa (ph) in the Pyrenees, near in, uh very close to the Spanish border, near Pier-pinon (ph) which is the place and the people were very helpful, the French in this particular, very small village in the mountains and uh who were uh had a lot of vineyards and that was their business mostly up there. </sentence><sentence id="214">And the French priest who was in a nearby parish had a house in this little place near the church, and he made his house available to some Jewish refugees and there were about three families living in this house. </sentence><sentence id="215">So my mother and I got refuge there, then we went to visit my father and there were visiting hours I think twice a week. </sentence><sentence id="216">We went to see my father and, uh, this went on for a couple of weeks or months, and uh, during one of the visits, we didn't go into the camp - there was sort of visiting enclosure with barbed wire, and we could sit and chat for an hour or so, and during one of the visits when the visit was over, and they said all visitors leave, the uh French policeman who was in charge of the group there, Vichy policeman, told me where, that I wasn't going to leave, and uh, I say well I came in, uh, I am already resettled. </sentence><sentence id="217">All he said I am not considered a child anymore, I am a man. </sentence><sentence id="218">I was fourteen at the time, and uh, I was kept in, just like that. </sentence><sentence id="219">They say you stay with your father here, you're you're not a child, you're a man. </sentence><sentence id="220">So all of a sudden my status changed, I was not able to go back and stay with my father. </sentence><sentence id="221">Uh - I was, uh, among a group of men, I was the youngest one among a group of mostly German Jews or also some, one German communist I remember and one German nobleman who had fought the Nazis who had, was fleeing from the Nazis and got caught there. </sentence><sentence id="222">And he was later delivered, uh turned over too to the Nazis when they came . </sentence><sentence id="223">Well, anyway, he, uh I was in another camp in and then a year later the rumors came, in 1941, 1942 I guess, uh this was still the end of 1941, the rumor came that all the Jews are going to be transferred to camps, work camps in Germany, and uh the French of course wanted to get rid of us and the Germans needed labor. </sentence><sentence id="224">Uh, in part some of the people were shipped to labor camps in France. </sentence><sentence id="225">This was not a labor camp, this, this was just, St. Cyprien was just an internment camp, there was no work being done there, it was uh on sand, on a sandy beach actually on the Mediterranean. </sentence><sentence id="226">And uh, but people, people were being continually shipped out in groups and to labor camps throughout southern France. </sentence><sentence id="227">Well, then the word came that's not completely true, some people are also being shipped out to Germany, to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="228">At that time we were very well aware of concentration camps and concentration contrary to what some people think that some people say well we didn't know there were such concentration camps, I already knew it as a child before I went to Belgium, because people used to make jokes about Hitler and say well keep your mouth shut otherwise you will go to concentration camp and on the Kristallnacht, and that is a story I missed by the way, uh, when Jews were arrested in Germany, uh, my father left our home to look after his father and was not arrested, and it was just a coincidence and uh, his brother was arrested and his, uh my mother's brother was arrested and sent to Dachau Concentration This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="229">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="230"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Camp. </sentence><sentence id="231">Well, uh the uh place my father went to was about twenty miles from where we lived and his father lived in the country in a home all by himself but his younger, my father's younger brother lived with him, and he was married to a non-Jew. </sentence><sentence id="232">And uh which is also an interesting story but I am getting off the subject there a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="233">She was offered to get a divorce from him because her brothers were in the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="234">And she refused. </sentence><sentence id="235">She say, she said will stay with him in the bad days, she will stay with him in the good days. </sentence><sentence id="236">And, but he was still living there, but his wife had taken refuge someplace when he was arrested and when my father came to his father's home, in , which is near Muchenglablak (ph), excuse me, they were demolishing the house inside. </sentence><sentence id="237">And there were Nazi storm troopers up there. </sentence><sentence id="238">As my father walked in and see what was going on, the storm troopers were from another city apparently, not from the same town, there was a common thing that they brought in people from outside, there there were no - but the Chief of Police was present, a small police force, and it so happened that the Chief of Police had been sitting in uh grammar school on the same bench with my father. </sentence><sentence id="239">And he recognized my father right away. </sentence><sentence id="240">He said, Ziechfred (ph), what, what are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="241">Was I looking after my father. </sentence><sentence id="242">He said, uh, well you're not supposed to be here. </sentence><sentence id="243">But he said nobody told me and uh so he took him to the police station. </sentence><sentence id="244">He said I can't do but arrest you. </sentence><sentence id="245">I have to uh, anybody who shows up has to be arrested, so I have to take you police station to your status. </sentence><sentence id="246">BREAK police chiefs and let him see his brother in jail who was later on transported to Dachau and uh so knowing that my father had the Iron Cross and he had it too, my father always wore it in miniature uh form on his uh suit, particularly during the Nazi era, because he wanted to show that he was as good a citizen as anybody else, he did his duty for his country and so on and so. </sentence><sentence id="247">Uh, and he said, well he said we have to do something for you. </sentence><sentence id="248">I, I don't see where a front-line combatant should should be in jail the guy said. </sentence><sentence id="249">So he called the local police in Muchenglablak and they ordered that my father be sent back, but they didn't specify that he be sent back under escort or without escort, so this policeman took it on his own to send, to put my father on the bus and say when you get back to your hometown, you report to the police. </sentence><sentence id="250">He didn't send another policeman with him. </sentence><sentence id="251">My father never did. </sentence><sentence id="252">And therefore escaped arrest and was not arrested during Kristallnacht or the day after. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Let's back up a little bit to talk about Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="298">Do you remember seeing synagogues burning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: I don't remember seeing synagogue burning but I remember the synagogue the day or two days after, after it was burned, because uh we had to uh, uh, move out of German schools into a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="302">Uh, and the last school I attended, the Jewish school, was right in the, in the same building as the synagogue was. </sentence><sentence id="303">So we weren't able to go to school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="304">As a matter of fact I received a certificate from my teacher, uh Jewish teacher, only Jews were taught by Jews, and it said in there this letter is instead of certificate because the certificate was destroyed by fire, which was the fire in the synagogue, and uh, this man by the way is still living in New York, my old head teacher from the Jewish school and he is 87 years old today and I'm still in touch with him. </sentence><sentence id="305">And he saved his life by being hidden by two Christian families in the same town, Muchenglablak. </sentence><sentence id="306">He survived the war in Much.. and came to New York after the war. </sentence><sentence id="307">He had no children. </sentence><sentence id="308">Extremely This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="309">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="310"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection unusual, extremely unusual. </sentence><sentence id="311">But I uh believe, I am not sure, that he, the people that hid him were fellow teachers. </sentence><sentence id="312">And the women dyed their hair blonde, to survive the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

these were our guards who were at the uh the camp was surrounded by barbed wire and when these people did guard duty, some of them were sympathetic and every once in a while somebody would throw me a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="368">They came, there was one particular French gendarme who uh, whenever he was on duty I, he had something for me. </sentence><sentence id="369">He threw it over the fence, and I asked him one day if he heard that people are being transported. </sentence><sentence id="370">He says yes, if you can get out, get out. </sentence><sentence id="371">When he said if you can get out, get out, I thought he is insinuating to me that with him I have a chance to get out through the barbed wire under the fence when he is on guard duty, and that is exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="372">Both my father This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="373">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="374"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and I escaped when this man was on duty - he turned around, he walked away like he didn't see it, this was at night. </sentence><sentence id="375">And we went to the village where my mother lived, and uh with the O.K. of the priest and with the O.K. of the mayor, who happened to be a communist, of that city, the mayor and the Catholic priest worked hand in hand, an unusual team, but at the time they thought they were fighting the Germans and I don't know but I suspect that the mayor was a member of the . </sentence><sentence id="376">He was very anti-German and he tried to help. </sentence><sentence id="377">And by helping I mean that we had shelter from the priest. </sentence><sentence id="378">And he issued a phoney ID card. </sentence><sentence id="379">This was a real ID card but the number of the ID card was not registered at City Hall, and he took a big chance. </sentence><sentence id="380">Nothing happened to him that I know, but we were arrested later on based on that ID card, when Vichy police came under the guide of the Nazis, they raided places, they were looking for people, and I mean, also in addition they picked whoever else they could, particularly Jews. </sentence><sentence id="381">And during one of those checks, and we, I don't know to this date whether we were turned in by somebody, or the mayor was turned in by somebody or the priest was turned in by somebody. </sentence><sentence id="382">Uh, they also , | know that. </sentence><sentence id="383">But somebody must have told something, must have spoke something, either was unhappy about us or unhappy about the mayor or whatever was going on there. </sentence><sentence id="384">And uh so one day during a raid, we were all arrested and then we were shipped off and they compared the uh, uh IDs with what records were at City Hall and they found out they were phoney ID cards. </sentence><sentence id="385">And that is how we got caught. </sentence><sentence id="386">From there on we were sent in by train to Drancy, which is the big camp near Paris which was a collection camp for Jews from all over France. </sentence><sentence id="387">And uh after the war I found out what transport number I was in. </sentence><sentence id="388">Of course I didn't know at that time, nobody was telling anything. </sentence><sentence id="389">We stayed several days in Drancy, (cough) excuse me, and not knowing what our destination was and this was my father, mother and myself, plus the other Jewish families who were arrested in that little town in the south of France, uh, it was on 12th September, uh, 1942, that our transport was put together and these transport usually a thousand people, uh cattle cars, going out of Drancy, near Paris, to the east. </sentence><sentence id="390">There were rumors where we were going, but not rumors that we were going to be gassed or anything rumors of labor camps and so on. </sentence><sentence id="391">Uh, the transport that I mentioned and the date I found that after war because uh there is a book which was made uh, uh, published with the help of the French government and I think the Krazfelds (ph) had the hand in it and I have the book and in this book is my name, my parents, name, nationality, date of births, and the people that I was with on our transport, and from then I found after the war that our transport was transport number 31 out of Drancy, and I understand there total of 75,000 people involved in transports out of Paris, out of Drancy, and, like I say, we were transport number 31 and that transport left on the 12th of September, 1942 for Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>

wood some of the station names that we went through, so we definitely knew that we were going to upper Salezia, which is now Poland, and which is near Breslau, what used to be the German city of Breslau, and where most of the concentration camps that we found out after the war were located, including Auschwitz, and a lot of the subcamps. </sentence><sentence id="434">Uh, the cars were opened at stations every once in a while and people were beaten up mercilessly and outside of that, people were starving. </sentence><sentence id="435">Uh, people didn't have any food, didn't bring anything along. </sentence><sentence id="436">Some people stuffed their pockets full of something and they ate it, but I don't remember ever having been given any food except that we were given water and in some cases people weren't even given water. </sentence><sentence id="437">So that a lot of people arrived dead or starved or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="438">Uh, on the way to Auschwitz, and again, I didn't know the destination at that time, at one station in, uh, I can't recall the name right now, in upper Salezia, a small station, the doors were opened, and they said all men out. </sentence><sentence id="439">That was the order. </sentence><sentence id="440">All men, working men that were able to work, out. </sentence><sentence id="441">Uh, like I said, this was not arrival at Auschwitz or any other camp, but it was just a small station, and uh, at that time I had to make a decision. </sentence><sentence id="442">In the meantime I was going on 16, and I was pretty strong because I had worked that summer in the French vineyards to make some money. </sentence><sentence id="443">And it was hard work so I had pretty strong muscles and uh it wasn't just that but uh uh the decision I had to make whether I was a child staying with the women or men. </sentence><sentence id="444">I wanted to stay with my father. </sentence><sentence id="445">And I came out and we didn't know at that time what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="446">Work meant able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="447">To live. </sentence><sentence id="448">And, but we didn't know what it meant for my mother and from that transport number 31, according to the, this book from the French government, of, of the thousand people or so, I think there are six survivors. </sentence><sentence id="449">They determined after the war. </sentence><sentence id="450">So all the women and children went straight into the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="451">At that point I searched for my mother after the war, and I wound up with the German Red Cross, or International Red Cross, at and they had a listing saying that all the women and children went straight into the gas chamber, of that transport. </sentence><sentence id="452">So I assume that my mother was gassed right away on arrival at Auschwitz which was sometimes in September 1942. </sentence><sentence id="453">Uh, the decision I made to stay with my father was my lucky decision, and again, uh, maybe there was at the time a feeling if you worked, you can survive. </sentence><sentence id="454">And we didn't know, we thought maybe the women are also going to be put to work in factories or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="455">But I didn't know the gas chamber would be at the other end. </sentence><sentence id="456">Uh, again, I didn't know about my mother until after the war, and I searched for my mother in Brussels, Belgium, and in Muchenglablak, and various other places but I didn't find her, until I was

people who tried to prove they were better than the Germans and didn't like the Jews and were very uh sadistic sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="458">I'm not saying that the Germans or the Nazis were not sadistic but the uh first experience we have from these guards were the horrible experience and uh I always felt that I was maybe more German than they were. </sentence><sentence id="459">They called, so-called people who lived in the territories. </sentence><sentence id="460">They were sometimes Polish, sometimes German, in upper Salezia, and at that time they had opted to be German and some of the people didn't speak German that well. </sentence><sentence id="461">Their Polish was a lot better. </sentence><sentence id="462">And uh, the uh, experience we had, the initial experience was not very good. </sentence><sentence id="463">Of course, the initial experience was the roughest experience under the circumstances. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="511">Q: Why don't you talk about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: O.K. Prior to going to a larger camp, we were in two smaller camps and each camp was, I don't remember exactly the, I would say less than a thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="514">I think in one case it was six hundred and the other one may have been a thousand. </sentence><sentence id="515">One was the camp of Lazy -L-A-Z- Y, which was mainly for the construction or reconstruction of bombed-out railways. </sentence><sentence id="516">And we went out everyday to the, uh, we be marched under guard, to the sites where the railways had been bombed by the Russians I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="517">In those days I don't think the Americans were coming out that far. </sentence><sentence id="518">And they bombed two transports, whatever, and also building new railways, which was the hardest work because people were not strong and the food was very limited and uh, uh, the people were beaten to death on the job or in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="519">And the system was at that time whenever they needed more labor, new people were coming and being fed into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="520">Supposed they had in the camp of a thousand people, they had a hundred people who died during a week or two on the job. </sentence><sentence id="521">Well, they got a hundred more from a transport or from Auschwitz or wherever they got them from to be sent in to fill up the void. </sentence><sentence id="522">And uh, so we were also digging up unexploded bombs which, and, and this I did twice during my concentration camp career, uh, which was very dangerous of course and the German guard would stay pretty far away in case something exploded. </sentence><sentence id="523">And some people did get killed that way. </sentence><sentence id="524">Uh, but, uh, railroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people were not strong enough to lift up the rails, and uh, some people got crushed under the rails, and people fell down. </sentence><sentence id="525">Our clothing was uh, uh, limited. </sentence><sentence id="526">In the wintertime we had clogs on, we had shoes with wooden soles, blue/white stripped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="527">In the beginning we had our own with the Star of David on it. </sentence><sentence id="528">Later on we got the blue/white-striped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="529">Uh, but it was very, we weren't properly dressed, we didn't have the proper food, and people were just uh walking skeletons in a lot of cases. </sentence><sentence id="530">And a lot of people committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="531">This was the most, the most vivid recalling I can do about the camps, is not people being killed but people committing suicide. </sentence><sentence id="532">Particularly in one camp that I am coming to later on which was the last camp. </sentence><sentence id="533">Uh, but nobody thought they were going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="534">Uh, the first camp, uh, was like I said most railroad and then later on we were sent to another camp and I don't know if the first camp was done away with, but the whole camp was transferred. </sentence><sentence id="535">We went to another camp and uh, when we worked on construction of bunkers and buildings for the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory which I assume was producing shoes for the German army because I don't think we were used for any non-military projects. </sentence><sentence id="536">They were all always in support of the military. </sentence><sentence id="537">So we worked near the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory. </sentence><sentence id="538">Uh and I was lucky in, I guess, in, in general I was lucky This is a verbatim transcript of

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 that I was able to speak German. </sentence><sentence id="541">I had an advantage over the other Jews who were coming from Poland, who didn't speak German unless they spoke Yiddish, and uh, Yiddish to some unfortunately, to some of the Germans, to the SS was like waving a red, uh, red drape or something in front of because that showed he's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="542">And if you're able to speak German, correct German, you got sometimes less beatings, or you were also able on the job to execute an order right away. </sentence><sentence id="543">You understand the order was given immediately. </sentence><sentence id="544">And that was very important. </sentence><sentence id="545">Some people picked it up pretty fast. </sentence><sentence id="546">Some of the other people, if they came from France, I'm not just saying uh Polish Jews, but the Jews from other countries, and in the first camps we were all Jews which changed later on through mix. </sentence><sentence id="547">Uh, and uh, if you were able to speak German and follow orders you got less beatings, you were able to do it right away, and if you had a team, uh, sometimes we had to work in teams uh loading lorries (ph) and we were two people or four people as a team and all of them spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="548">We tried to team up that way or working that way because it always worked better than shouting one, two, three or something like that in German. </sentence><sentence id="549">And the Germans, being very militaristic, and frankly there is something I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="550">I was grew up that way, to be almost like a, like a Prussian. </sentence><sentence id="551">My father was very great disciplinarian and uh, when he said go, I went, and when uh he said jump, I jumped, and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="552">It wasn't like our kids are today. </sentence><sentence id="553">And, but it helped me later on, being able to jump when the Nazis said to jump, you know, and to do things and understanding what they meant and doing it sort of a little bit of a military way. </sentence><sentence id="554">Uh, which I understand from uh, from other people that I swapped stories with after the war, it is true in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="555">If, if you knew the German language it definitely helped. </sentence><sentence id="556">And in some case, uh, uh, when we were building bunkers you had to read the diagram, how to, into uh concrete, solid concrete you have to put uh wiring and uh wiring has to be wired up a certain way that the designs, if it is rounded and so on, and it has to be tight with uh, with uh the wire, the smaller wire, and if you're able to read the diagram from German, your job was much easier. </sentence><sentence id="557">You didn't make any mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="558">And so on, so that helped. </sentence><sentence id="559">Anyway, the camps, the second camp I went to, I made by first great friend for life, uh although I still did have my father with me, but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew and I also forgot to mention since I lived with a Dutch Jewish family in Brussels, Belgium, I also picked up Dutch, which was spoken at home, but Dutch and Flemish is almost the same. </sentence><sentence id="560">And so I was very fluent in Dutch by that time, and I picked, uh, or he picked me, I picked him, uh, uh, a young man my age whose father and brother-in-law was also in the same camp. </sentence><sentence id="561">So we teamed up. </sentence><sentence id="562">We were about the same height, and the same age, and we teamed up, became very good friends and since uh he came with a group of Dutch Jews that arrived at the camp, and it is a sad experience to tell about the Dutch Jews. </sentence><sentence id="563">Because Holland was a country where people eat a lot of cheese, a lot of butter, all the rich things, uh, the Dutch Jews were dying like flies. </sentence><sentence id="564">All of a sudden no food at all or very little food, no butter, no cheese, and uh the Dutch Jews within a short, the shortest period of time, there were very few left. </sentence><sentence id="565">I don't, I think we did receive one time a group of two hundred Jews and within a matter of six weeks they were down to maybe fifty or less. </sentence><sentence id="566">I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="567">Because uh, it was much harder on them, whereas the Jew from the East, a Polish Jew family who had always had a hard life, where lived in a ghetto maybe and who was poor, and didn't have all the rich foods, he was able to resist much better in a concentrate, for a longer period of time. </sentence><sentence id="568">In the end it was all the same. </sentence><sentence id="569">But uh, uh, that was a big difference with a Jew from the West and

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 Jew from the East - the survival rate. </sentence><sentence id="572">Uh, a Jew from Poland was toughened up, or a Russian Jew or whoever they had from the, the eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="573">So in that respect I think, uh, there was greater survival rate among the eastern European Jews than the western European Jews. </sentence><sentence id="574">But the Dutch Jews were particularly badly hit because of their life style that they had before. </sentence><sentence id="575">So I teamed up with this boy. </sentence><sentence id="576">At the time probably more so than his family, his father and his brother-in-law were killed in the camp, and I must tell this story because Mike Swab (ph) was his name, my best friend, Mike, who unfortunately died in Holland two years ago of cancer, and we were the best of friends. </sentence><sentence id="577">As a matter of fact we're like brothers. </sentence><sentence id="578">And uh, Mike Swab's father and brother were killed by cold water shower. </sentence><sentence id="579">The team was, came back from work one day where there were a lot of Dutch Jews and they were lined up in the camp street, and they had said that they did not perform their job properly. </sentence><sentence id="580">They were sabotaging the German war effort, the Dutch Jews. </sentence><sentence id="581">And they took all these Jews who were in that particular group that came back from work and hosed them down - they call it hosing down. </sentence><sentence id="582">By that they took a fire hose in the middle of the winter, and this must have been 1942, to 43 the winter, and uh hosed the people the people had to stand at attention and they actually froze to death. </sentence><sentence id="583">This is, this is a winter not like here but uh a Polish winter you are talking about now. </sentence><sentence id="584">A eastern European winter, with snow on the ground, leaving people outside all night and by morning most of them were frozen to death. </sentence><sentence id="585">And that was the end of Mike Swab's father and brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="586">So from then on, we just became brothers and uh my father was of course still alive but uh, we then teamed up as a team and, at work, Mike knew German quite well, because first of all Dutch and German is very close and he picked it up very fast; he knew some before. </sentence><sentence id="587">Mike came from a rather large family and all of his family was wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="588">This is another story for after the war. </sentence><sentence id="589">But uh, we could not have been closer because in everything we just ticked, we just, he had the same ideas about how to survive and our main idea was to be able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="590">And I said here I have somebody who's, maybe my father won't be able to make it. </sentence><sentence id="591">I knew at that time he was getting weaker but he was pretty good at that time. </sentence><sentence id="592">So I said if we're going to make it, the young people are going to make it and uh, we then decided, in actual words I think you could almost say we made a pact, that we're going to stick it out together. </sentence><sentence id="593">We talked about it and then said we just have to help each other the best way we can. </sentence><sentence id="594">If you find some food, you share it with me. </sentence><sentence id="595">I find some extra food, I share it with you and it has to be complete honesty and none, none of this taking away from the cabin. </sentence><sentence id="596">Many times it feels people come like beasts sometimes when they are hungry, and uh, become dehumanized. </sentence><sentence id="597">And we're not become, we're not going to become dehumanized. </sentence><sentence id="598">We're going to remain the way we came as much as possible and we're going to get out. </sentence><sentence id="599">Never to leave that idea behind that we're not going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="600">We are going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="601">And uh, that was the singlest biggest thing in my life, I'm sure his life, that uh, that made me so live, plus a lot of luck, plus a lot of faith, plus a lot of other things. </sentence><sentence id="602">But I think that the, think the idea that uh, we're going to make it by escaping or some other way, uh, made us stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="603">Now, Mike Swab then uh moved fortunately for me and for him I think, that when we move from camp to camp we always stick together. </sentence><sentence id="604">His number, uh that was tattooed on his arm was just a few away from me and which was given to us later, not in the first camps but when we moved to the subcamp of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="605">And uh, we uh, the bond was even stronger because I felt also that he had lost his father, on my part at least, he doesn't have a father or brother, he is all by himself, and I still have my father. </sentence><sentence id="606">Although my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="607">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

each other in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="609">And we were also able to help each other out by uh, for instance in this particular case, I had to hold the measuring equipment for a German which is a, a surveyor of uh, uh, on a, a construction site, on a railroad site, you had what these guys they call mister ,or , which is a supervisor and sometimes, because I spoke German, he left a piece of bread or something. </sentence><sentence id="610">And then I would take it back and share it with my friend Mike and my father or something. </sentence><sentence id="611">But there was a little help every once in a while if you were lucky and if you were maybe away from the big group which I was at times. </sentence><sentence id="612">And uh, when we were transferred to the other camp, with Mike Swab, of course, we teamed up, uh, filling lorries (ph), and they have a name for that, auch 5 which I don't know if there is a name in English, means in working, you fill your lorry and then if the others are finished, you can rest up. </sentence><sentence id="613">In other words, you don't have to fill another lorry (ph) because there are two people to each lorry. </sentence><sentence id="614">You throw the dirt in, and then some other place, and you unload it, and you fill holes and so on. </sentence><sentence id="615">Or bunk craters or whatever we did there (mumbled). </sentence><sentence id="616">And uh, uh Mike and I were probably among the best team there was, uh, and the reward for being good was not food but it was ciga - one cigarette a day. </sentence><sentence id="617">These were Russian mahorka (ph) cigarettes which had been either captured or gotten from the Soviet Union; they weren't real tobacco, but to the smoker this was better than nothing. </sentence><sentence id="618">And there were people in the camps who would give their bread away instead of (mumble) rather not eat than smoke a cigarette. </sentence><sentence

I didn't realize that. </sentence><sentence id="828">O.K. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="829">Anyway, I started talking about my faith. </sentence><sentence id="830">Now, I mentioned that I, uh, we belonged to conservative synagogue which was the only one in the town where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="831">And we had an outstanding rabbi there. </sentence><sentence id="832">Was quite impressive man. </sentence><sentence id="833">And so I had a good Jewish education. </sentence><sentence id="834">In Germany, in the, in the public school, you also get lessons of religion, and so the Jews are, just like here you may have to, but you do it here on a Sunday, or, or you don't do it in a public school, you go outside to your church to get religious lessons. </sentence><sentence id="835">But in Germany, it's part of the curriculum that once or twice or three times a week you have an hour on Judaism, or Catholicism or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="836">And so uh, I grew up, to make a long story short, to be with a solid Jewish education, a little Hebrew, and, but, I was not, neither was my father, very religious. </sentence><sentence id="837">My grandparents were, on one side. </sentence><sentence id="838">And uh, so, my faith, that I want to talk about, I lost towards the end of the war, my faith in God. </sentence><sentence id="839">I say how can there be a God, and I was not thinking about myself, or this was even before my father was killed. </sentence><sentence id="840">Uh, I lost my faith because I say how can God allow that little children and women be killed. </sentence><sentence id="841">And uh, I kept this for about a year after the war. </sentence><sentence id="842">And then I felt I came back not because somebody tried to convince me there is a

there has to be something superior, but I will never call him almighty again, because if he was almighty, he could have prevented that. </sentence><sentence id="847">So I don't believe that God is almighty. </sentence><sentence id="848">I do believe in architect of the universe, call him God, call him what you will, I do believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="849">But, uh, and my children believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="850">Uh, and I, these questions I have talked extensively, uh, to my children about and I told them they are free to believe whatever they want to. </sentence><sentence id="851">They grew up with a Jewish education, and the reason, I didn't point this out before, why I wanted to be Jewish and that was a question that uh, came up with, between me and my wife before we got married. </sentence><sentence id="852">I said, look, you are protestant and uh, I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="853">Now, I am not very strong on Judaism, but the children, we have to decide when we have children, what they will be. </sentence><sentence id="854">So, I said whatever you want them to be is alright with me, and she said, I said, I don't feel either way. </sentence><sentence id="855">So I decided the children would be Jewish with the agreement of my wife, for one reason only. </sentence><sentence id="856">In the memory of my parents, because my parents had to die because they were Jews, and, in their memory, the children are going to be Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="857">If it had to be one way or another, it had to be some reason why they're one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="858">So my wife fully agreed. </sentence><sentence id="859">And my wife, after several years, wanted also to become Jewish, and I said this means nothing to me - it's a piece of paper. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="860">You'll continue living just the way we do now - it means nothing. </sentence><sentence id="861">And as far as the children, they can feel, they grew up with ten years of Jewish education and know all there is to know, and they can do whatever they want. </sentence><sentence id="862">And, uh, I give them that freedom, because I am not myself so strong on, on religion, but I do believe in God and it came back to me after the war. </sentence><sentence id="863">Because I really had a hard time for a long time, and while I was in the U.S. Army I had a very deep uh, talk with a Catholic chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="864">And, about faith, and he was the only man that ever admitted to me, the only preacher that said if he had experienced some of the things, we had many evenings together, that he had experienced some of the things that I talked to him about, that he wasn't sure he could still believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="865">And that comes from a Catholic priest in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="866">Anyway, that's, I mentioned religion. </sentence><sentence id="867">Uh, if religion is a strong support for people, I recommend religion, one or another religion, as long as you have some belief in something, in God, or in your fellow man. </sentence><sentence id="868">To me, I look at my parents as being godly. </sentence><sentence id="869">They were good people, they died, they had never done anything wrong, and to me that, I see God in them. </sentence><sentence id="870">And I can see God in other people, live people. </sentence><sentence id="871">They are good people. </sentence><sentence id="872">I see God in nature. </sentence><sentence id="873">So I can consider myself as believing in God, although at, for, for a while, for me about two years, I didn't believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="874">This was one year after the war. </sentence><sentence id="875">Uh, the belief to survive I talked about. </sentence><sentence id="876">O.K., one was religion or the belief in God. </sentence><sentence id="877">One was luck. </sentence><sentence id="878">Health was of utmost importance. </sentence><sentence id="879">Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="880">Because there were so many diseases. </sentence><sentence id="881">There was typhus in places. </sentence><sentence id="882">Diarrhe </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="883">A: The worst enemy that I, that I have seen. </sentence><sentence id="884">Once you had it, you couldn't get rid of it. </sentence><sentence id="885">And, fortunately, in some of these camps, and I am getting back to the story later on more extensively, you had many Jewish doctors, who weren't allowed to practice medicine. </sentence><sentence id="886">There was no hospital, but who recommended certain ways of keeping yourself fit, even without, with little food. </sentence><sentence id="887">For instance, in the case of diarrhea, we took wood that was burned and ground it up and ate the ashes, uh, the coal actually. </sentence><sentence id="888">The coal, and that is one thing that will help you in preventing diarrhea, or if you have diarrhea maybe you can get rid of it. </sentence><sentence id="889">So from coal. </sentence><sentence id="890">So there were many very primitive ways that we used, or even chewing on a piece of wood. </sentence><sentence id="891">Just to kill the feeling of hunger. </sentence><sentence id="892">So, and, and, and like I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="893">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for

those camps, even though they weren't allowed to practice, with that advice. </sentence><sentence id="895">And uh, so, uh, disease was the big killer and if you were able to survive that you were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="896">Now uh, while I'm thinking of it, my, uh when I escaped later on, my weight, I was uh put on the scale by the U.S. Army and was seventy-five pounds. </sentence><sentence id="897">I was a walking skeleton, but I was healthy. </sentence><sentence id="898">And that was my luck. </sentence><sentence id="899">Uh, just skin and bones, but walking and still fairly strong, and weighed seventy-five American pounds. </sentence><sentence id="900">And so was my friend Mike Schwab about the same. </sentence><sentence id="901">And we picked it up, about fifty pounds in six months, in three months. </sentence><sentence id="902">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="903">But uh, from the smaller camps that I was talking about, we went to a larger camp which was called Blechhammer (ph) and this was an actual small concentration camp of about four thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="904">When I say concentration camp I must make the difference between a camp like Auschwitz, and this was a subcamp of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="905">Auschwitz had something like I believe maybe a hundred subcamps, some smaller, some bigger, and this one four thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="906">And these subcamps were mainly used not for the destruction of people but for work people to death. </sentence><sentence id="907">That was the point in those camps. </sentence><sentence id="908">They were used for the German war effort in most cases. </sentence><sentence id="909">In this particular case, Blechhammer (ph) was a camp that was about I think maybe a hundred kilometers from Auschwitz, maybe less, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="910">And it had the largest German synthetic gas factory, which was several miles long, wide, and everyday we went to work in this factory. </sentence><sentence id="911">Now, the, the factory, the gasoline factory was being bombed once by American long-range bombers. </sentence><sentence id="912">And I must as a side-line state something. </sentence><sentence id="913">I was very upset for a long time when the question came up in the newspapers about the bombing of Auschwitz, that it couldn't be done. </sentence><sentence id="914">It was too far. </sentence><sentence id="915">Well, we were just, I would say within fifty miles of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="916">And we were being bombed by American bombers, which was something happy event for us although some prisoners got killed, and in the factory, where we did also mostly construction work. </sentence><sentence id="917">We didn't actually participate in the operation of the factory. </sentence><sentence id="918">These were Germans or other foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="919">And they had also British prisoner of war camp nearby. </sentence><sentence id="920">Uh, the uh, uh, we were mainly used to clean up from the bombings. </sentence><sentence id="921">We built and built new bunkers where the Germans could hide. </sentence><sentence id="922">Now when the bombers came overhead, there were several bombing raids who dropped what they call, uh carpet bombings. </sentence><sentence id="923">That means releasing, a hundred planes releasing all the bombs at one time for effect. </sentence><sentence id="924">And they tried to destroy the factory in order to prevent the Germans from having gasoline to continue the war. </sentence><sentence id="925">Uh, the camp was, like I said, a work camp and not a camp with gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="926">The people, and I didn't know this at the time, only when they came to my father which I'm going to talk about in a minute, the people were not destroyed in gas chambers there because that was done at Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="927">And we were there for one purpose, to work. </sentence><sentence id="928">We worked to death. </sentence><sentence id="929">The food was so so but compared to the previous camp it was a little better because they really needed us very badly there. </sentence><sentence id="930">But there was uh, one meal in the morning and one meal at night. </sentence><sentence id="931">And if you're lucky, there was some soup at lunch time at the place of work. </sentence><sentence id="932">And working hours were usually, and this was true for most of the camps, were anywhere from ten to twelve hours average day. </sentence><sentence id="933">And the facilities for hygiene were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="934">I didn't touch on that in the camps, and the common latrines and the people had diarrhea like I mentioned before and uh, and people would catch bugs one from one another. </sentence><sentence id="935">The water was someplace on, the cold water. </sentence><sentence id="936">And anyway, the Blechhammer (ph) camp uh was probably one of the more modern or well-kept camps because the camp commander and the Jew which was the uh Jewish guy in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="937">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence

which was so bad, but he was also was a winner of a German medal during the First World War and was somewhat respected by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="940">And he was a learned man and his name was Klemper, Kempor or Kemora (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="941">And because of him I think uh, uh a lot of people, not a lot of people, but the, the lifestyle was somewhat more decent than in other places. </sentence><sentence id="942">Uh, we were not bothered too much while we were in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="943">We had to work. </sentence><sentence id="944">Uh, people were sometimes beaten to death. </sentence><sentence id="945">It was up to the local SS who guarded us. </sentence><sentence id="946">Or even to some of the German, uh, to the uh fuabata(ph) who were sometimes pretty bad guys who knew that it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="947">You kill one prisoner they got replacement ones pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="948">Now at Blechhammer, it was a replacement, uh, uh, the replacement worked this way. </sentence><sentence id="949">Ifa hundred prisoners, or two hundred or three hundred prisoners had died over a period of time, a short period of time, two or three hundred prisoners would come in from Auschwitz immediately, which wasn't very far away. </sentence><sentence id="950">So they could work people to death and then the bodies, I don't even know what they did with the bodies, whether they were taken to a crematorium in Auschwitz or not or whether they were taken care of locally. </sentence><sentence id="951">I really don't know that. </sentence><sentence id="952">But whenever there were prisoners missing, they just brought a couple hundred more. </sentence><sentence id="953">And this was true also in the last camp. </sentence><sentence id="954">Uh, exactly the same method of replenishment. </sentence><sentence id="955">Uh, with my father in, this happened in about uh, I don't know exactly but uh, November or so of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="956">My father became very weak. </sentence><sentence id="957">Uh, was also like a skeleton and uh, he was reaching the age of 50. </sentence><sentence id="958">He was going to have, and uh, at that time there was unwritten rule, and I've checked it out after the war, this, there was someplace there was something in writing, and someplace there was nothing, I don't know the sit was__, but it was an accepted fact that any Jew or any worker, non- Jewish, who worked in these labor camps, uh, who reached the age of 50 was not good enough for the war effort of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="959">Therefore, he was disposed of. </sentence><sentence id="960">Disposal meant gas chamber if they have one. </sentence><sentence id="961">In our case Auschwitz was nearby. </sentence><sentence id="962">So what they did ever once in a while, they picked up the people. </sentence><sentence id="963">Some people said I can't, I'm weak. </sentence><sentence id="964">Well the SS picked them out or they picked out older people. </sentence><sentence id="965">But there was always a group of people that was sent back from Blechhammer to Auschwitz by truck. </sentence><sentence id="966">But whoever reached the age of was automatically put in that group, to be disposed of. </sentence><sentence id="967">Well, what they said just for fun, they said we sending them to rest and recreation because they worked so hard. </sentence><sentence id="968">They needed to rest. </sentence><sentence id="969">But what it really meant and we knew that not officially but the rumors were they was being sent to Auschwitz to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="970">And that is exactly what happened to my father. </sentence><sentence id="971">I came back from work one day. </sentence><sentence id="972">My father wasn't there and didn't come back, and I was, where is my father, trying to find out frantically. </sentence><sentence id="973">Well, he was ina special enclosure within the camp, a barbed wire enclosure with one barracks where they assembled those people. </sentence><sentence id="974">They referred to it as the dispensary but it wasn't a dispensary - it was just a gob of people and sent them away in a couple of days or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="975">Well, I saw my father one more time through the barbed wire and it was nothing I could do and nothing he could do. </sentence><sentence id="976">And I could only hope for the best, not wanting to be true it is the gas chamber at the other end, but it was. </sentence><sentence id="977">And so I know the exact fate of my father. </sentence><sentence id="978">Uh, he was taken from Blechhammer to Auschwitz and gassed and disposed of. </sentence><sentence id="979">And, which also happened to be the fate of my father, of my mother, uh, but in 1942 already. </sentence><sentence id="980">And uh, so when I was alone, I still had by friend Mike Swab, which was something great to have, to have uh somebody to lean on and he can lean on you. </sentence><sentence id="981">And we decided from then more than ever that the first chance we get we're going to escape. </sentence><sentence id="982">And we worked together, but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="983">It is not the primary source, and it

impossible. </sentence><sentence id="985">The, the concentration camp had very high walls. </sentence><sentence id="986">They were made from concrete slabs, and on top of the wall of this particular camp was electrically loaded barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="987">There was no way to get out. </sentence><sentence id="988">And it was well controlled with guard towers. </sentence><sentence id="989">And being marched to work everyday, which was several miles, there was no way to escape either. </sentence><sentence id="990">There were SS with machine pistols and dogs on each side. </sentence><sentence id="991">The only place where it would have been possible to escape was at the work site. </sentence><sentence id="992">If you worked in a separate group like I did, I did sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="993">But when I worked in a separate group, Mike Swab didn't work in a separate group. </sentence><sentence id="994">And our plane, plan was that if we can escape it should be in a group. </sentence><sentence id="995">Some of us might be shot in the process of escaping, if it is found out, but some of us might get through. </sentence><sentence id="996">So it always better in a group, then split up once you're outside. </sentence><sentence id="997">O.K. Uh, we had at that time planned if we get away from the factory, but then was, once you get, we had blue/white stripped uniforms, and what, what do you do when you escape. </sentence><sentence id="998">You're in the middle of Germany or some place or Polish border or something. </sentence><sentence id="999">My idea was to get to my German friends, this Catholic family by the name of Sonnon (ph) in Muchenglablak (ph), whose parents were friends of my parents, to get to the house and then to survive the war in their cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And I am sure they would have done it because they helped my grandparents till they were deported to Joasenchat (ph) in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And uh, uh, so Mike Schwab was going to go along with me. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Either that or we go to Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1003">But he wasn't sure where he would go to in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1004">I was sure where I would go to in Germany, so we decided it would be Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1005">But then the question was, once you escape, a tattooed number on the arm and uh hair shorn. </sentence><sentence id="1006">In other words, you looked like a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And blue/white stripped uniforms that you could throw away if you had other clothes, but you still looked like a prisoner with no hair and looking like a skeleton, you were immediately recognized, so where you going to go. </sentence><sentence id="1008">So even if you had a chance to escape, and the chances were there frankly, at the place of work, in, in the synthetic gasoline factory. </sentence><sentence id="1009">There were many chances. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And some people did escape, but they were all caught. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And when they were caught, they were brought back to camp and hung whether they were dead or not dead. </sentence><sentence id="1012">They were hung or put on the ground for all the prisoners to see. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Here's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Some of them were shot and the bodies, the mutilated bodies, sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners before uh going to work in the morning so everybody could see it. </sentence><sentence id="1015">They were left out all day, all night, you know, so everybody could see what happens to one who escapes. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And that was standard procedure - to bring them back to the camp and let all the prisoners see what happens to an escapee. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Well, uh, I have one other incident at Blesheimer. </sentence><sentence id="1018">Uh, I got hit by machine gun fire. </sentence><sentence id="1019">There was when a group was accused of sabotaging the German war effort and some people were, in this, this was a common, not very common, but occassionally some people were accused of not working hard enough, to sabotage the German war effort. </sentence><sentence id="1020">In other cases, where three people were hung at Blesheimer; they were accused of sabotaging the war effort by cutting telephone lines. </sentence><sentence id="1021">But what they had done, they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners had taken some wire, some electric wire and used them as belts on their pants because we didn't have any belts. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And they were caught and they were accused of having cut the wire and they were hanged publically in front of the group of, the whole camp being assembled. </sentence><sentence id="1023">In, in my case, our group was accused of not working too hard and made an example, and, and the SS started firing like a mass execution.

firing, to drop down, and let a body fall over you. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And then be covered up. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And maybe be left for dead. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And that is exactly what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1030">But, uh in this particular case, the SS came, apparently they had no intention of maybe having a mass execution but just fire into some prisoners because somebody got angry, or was upset about something, not performing enough work that they, uh whatever the reason was which could be many reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1031">They just started firing. </sentence><sentence id="1032">The reason as far as I know was that we didn't perform at work. </sentence><sentence id="1033">And so I was hit. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Now, my luck was I got out of it and that's another long story and I don't think we have time for that to go into that. </sentence><sentence id="1035">I got out of this alive by getting up later on, going back to the barracks and being treated by a prisoner doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Now there was no place that I could go to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1037">I was scrapped (ph) several times, three or four times on my head, and right here, and here, and the hair never grew back and there was a piece of bone missing, but luckily I was, I was a pretty good healer and although I did have puss in it I was healed by this doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1038">And uh with normal thread being used for sewing on buttons uh to fix me up and, and like I said there was no hospital or dispensary I could go to. </sentence><sentence id="1039">Well, next day I had to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="1040">There was no place to rest up or after loss of blood and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Uh, and I was asked since I was bloody and had a bandage around my head, not regular bandage but some old clothing, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And I said I got hit during the air raid. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And many prisoners were either killed or hurt pretty badly at Blesheimer during the air raids, the bombings of the synthetic gasoline factory. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And then prisoners were walked back. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Some days they were lucky - they got some bandage from the local German workers. </sentence><sentence id="1046">From the SS we got nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1047">From the local German workers, which were also hit sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1048">So, and when you walked down in the morning people would say, hey you, you fit to work. </sentence><sentence id="1049">You say yes, I'm fit to work. </sentence><sentence id="1050">I looked very strong even though you had lost some blood you would be really weak, but that was always the thing during the selection process that went through several times. </sentence><sentence id="1051">So even if you were, don't come walking up there like you weak, almost falling over, which was the case in most cases and in my case sometimes too but I never let anybody see that I was weak and just looked straight and strong when you went through selection line. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Well, when I walked out that morning, it wasn't a selection line, it was just the guys going out, the guy pointed me out and I said I was hit during the bombardment and he passed me. </sentence><sentence id="1053">So that's how I was able to survive that. </sentence><sentence id="1054">Uh, Blesheimer after my father, did exist and I don't have my exact dates. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Till December of 1944 when the Russians advanced. </sentence><sentence id="1056">At that time, uh the uh order was given to evacuate the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1057">We could already hear the sound of war by hearing guns, artillery, tanks or whatever, bombings. </sentence><sentence id="1058">And the word we got and we were always a little bit in the dark since officially we got no word at all what was going in the outside world, but occassionally somebody would get a newspaper which was sometimes in some cases punishable by death, depending on how the SS felt. </sentence><sentence id="1059">You know, somebody could bring a paper back to camp or having a radio which I don't know if anyone had, but uh, we were able to find some old newspapers maybe at place of work somebody had thrown away and so we were sort of informed. </sentence><sentence id="1060">But that was the German side that we were reading. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Uh, in this particular case, I uh, we heard the guns and the rumor came we going to be evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Uh, where to nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1064">Away from the front. </sentence><sentence id="1065">That wasn't to do us a favor, to get us away from the firing, but because they needed more labor inside Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1066">And they had to get it from somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1067">And I think, I'm not sure, that This is a verbatim

knowledge of that. </sentence><sentence id="1071">But they were getting close to Auschwitz too, and Auschwitz I don't think made any death marches. </sentence><sentence id="1072">People were just left in there or killed or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1073">But in this particular labor camp that we were in, or subcamp of Auschwitz, we were evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="1074">This was the plan I assume, and in an orderly manner we were marched every day, all day and in the night time put in a field with lights away from the front towards Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And we finally arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1076">When somebody couldn't walk because the food, there was almost no food, days, we went for days without food. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Water we got once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="1078">And I assume, I don't have any specific figure, that we were about four thousand or somewhere close to four thousand prisoners that were marched out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1079">Some people remained behind, and there were other people in other camps that I read up after the war, that came to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1080">They had to put them somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1081">People who had been marched into this camp from other camps when we were out already. </sentence><sentence id="1082">They didn't know what do to with them, the Russians were advancing too fast, and uh, so I don't have any exact figures. </sentence><sentence id="1083">It was very confusing times but I assume about four thousand prisoners were marched out of Blesheimer. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Fourteen days later, the death march arrived at the camp of Gross Rosen which was another large, larger concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1085">And in the group that I was in, we were standing in mud being counted, and I was standing in the front row being able to understand German, being able to understand the SS was reporting to his superior. </sentence><sentence id="1086">He was delivering 276 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Now, I can't say to this day if that is what was left of four thousand. </sentence><sentence id="1088">I don't know how many got there. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I don't know how many were killed every day. </sentence><sentence id="1090">But what one of the common things they did was put..... END OF TAPE.....barnes from farmers. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Whenever they could they usually put maybe about five hundred prisoners to a barn. </sentence><sentence id="1092">They would lock them up in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="1093">This was for proper control so nobody could run away during the night. </sentence><sentence id="1094">If they had you out in the open, that meant they have lights on and they couldn't go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1095">But if they could lock you up in a barn, they just have to post two or three guards around and the rest of them could go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1096">And the prisoners were locked up. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Uh, so I don't know how many people were executed in barns because there were a lot of executions going on and everyday, every morning before mein dof (ph) they said who cannot march any more, and people would say I can, I can, but they were just dragging themselves on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1098">They would shoot them by the side of the road. </sentence><sentence id="1099">They would just pile them up and fire into the group. </sentence><sentence id="1100">The regular mass executions. </sentence><sentence id="1101">They make sure nobody is left behind. </sentence><sentence id="1102">They even went so far to make it easy, I don't know what they tried to do, they picked cemeteries to execute people, next to cemeteries. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Maybe they thought they ought to get buried in a cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1104">I don't know why but it is very odd. </sentence><sentence id="1105">But in two cases, I've seen people be executed near cemeteries, next to cemeteries. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Uh, so from Gross Rosen, the 276 prisoners plus other prisoners that were at Gross Rosen, were transported in cattle cars to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1107">This was a few days later. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Buchenwald was of course well inside Germany, was on the western front. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Here we're coming from the eastern front to the western front. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And we arrived at Buchenwald, we didn't arrive, we arrived near the city of Weimar, which is rather large city, on the track leading through the city of Weimar to the other side of, to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1111">And uh we were very unfortunate. </sentence><sentence id="1112">The train must have been spotted by air, by airplanes, and I don't know whether they were British or American airplanes, uh, but the train was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="1113">The train was stationary at that time, the engine was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1114">But it was just outside the city of Weimar before getting to Buchenwald, and when the city was bombed, our car was hit This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1115">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1116"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 and split open. </sentence><sentence id="1117">Some people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1118">But neither Michael or I were hit at all, probably covered by others, and we got out of the car, and this was near some German homes. </sentence><sentence id="1119">Now, we knew we were hungry, we were starved because we hadn't gotten any food from the time we left Gross Rosen in the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="1120">Uh, we went into a house, it was the nearest house where the car was. </sentence><sentence id="1121">It was near the railroad tracks and went in the kitchen and helped ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1122">The inhabitants of this house were sitting in the cellar, because the bombing was still going on. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And the clear wasn't given. </sentence><sentence id="1124">The moment the all clear was given we had our parkas full of food and we had eaten quite a bit while we were stuffing ourselves, or loading up with food. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And many prisoners did that. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Those that were caught were shot by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1127">We didn't get caught because that was uh, taboo, of course, going into German homes and grabbing food. </sentence><sentence id="1128">But again there was no way to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1129">At that time it would have been very easy to escape during the bombing. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Where to go? </sentence><sentence id="1131">Hair shorn off, number on the arm, and blue/white stripped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1132">No place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1133">No. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And it was so easy to escape at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1135">Well, I don't know how many survived the, uh, this bombing but the rest of us finally arrived at Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1136">Being in Buchenwald, we thought this was going to be the end now. </sentence><sentence id="1137">They're not going to take us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1138">Apparently they didn't know which way to go, from the east to the west, from the west to the east. </sentence><sentence id="1139">The Americans were coming the other way, so, and there were selection processes at Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And I didn't mention the selection processes before, but I went through several selection processes. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Some of them were more formal than others, and others were just when you went to work guys were picked out and you stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="1142">You were not strong enough anymore or you go. </sentence><sentence id="1143">But this was a regular selection process, where to we didn't know at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Uh, and again, Mike and I went to the right side, looking strong and fit, and even asked the questions, are you strong and do you speak German? </sentence><sentence id="1145">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Now, O.K. So we had no idea where we were being shipped off to, but we were given shots at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I am coming back to that in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1148">What worried me long after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Uh, there was apparently typhus, and we had heard of sterilization. </sentence><sentence id="1150">In many camps there they had experimented with sterilization and in some cases people were sterilized just for the sake of sterilization and in other placces it was just for experimentation. </sentence><sentence id="1151">And I had thought that at Buchenwald before going to the next camp of Leigenstein-Zwieberge (ph), that I had maybe been sterilized. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I didn't know what sterilization involved. </sentence><sentence id="1153">It's not just giving somebody a shot, but for a long, for about a year after the war, I never wanted to face the question but I thought maybe I had been sterilized. </sentence><sentence id="1154">But it turned out that I never was sterilized because we have six children, so I was safe on that point. </sentence><sentence id="1155">But for a long time it was on my mind, and the only thing that I could find out that we were given shots against typhus and some other things, which was prevalent at the time and they wanted healthy workers, healthy as they could possibly be, at least not have a disease that kills everyone in the room. </sentence><sentence id="1156">From Buchenwald then we uh, from Buchenwald we were transported to the camp of Leigenstein- Zwieberge (ph) which was a subcamp of Buchenwald, a forced labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And it was hidden in the Harz Mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1158">But we didn't know at the time that it was a secret project of the SS where they were building tunnels into the Harz Mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Their was Mauthausen (ph) which is a more famous camp on the other end of the Harz Mountains and we were at the lower end of the Harz Mountains, building tunnels to construct the V-2, the flying bomb or like we have seen in the Smithsonian Museum here. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Uh, the V-2 was the secret weapon of Hitler, and the only way they could produce any was underground because of the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 bombing. </sentence><sentence id="1163">So they had picked the Harz Mountains to construct a factory underneath. </sentence><sentence id="1164">Now at the end where we were, there was no factory. </sentence><sentence id="1165">The factory was operating up north, but we were constructing the second project, and the job consisted of being marched from work everyday from this camp which was also about four thousand people, and which was a very mixed camp. </sentence><sentence id="1166">The Jews were a minority in there. </sentence><sentence id="1167">The camp was practically led by communist prisoners, German communists, who had been there, the first ones in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Another group, there was a replenishment group and they were pretty well organized. </sentence><sentence id="1169">But the camp was a terrible camp, was a temporary camp. </sentence><sentence id="1170">The camp had existed, by the time I got there, only about four months or five months, so it was a brand new camp so it was only going to be there for the purpose of constructing these tunnels. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Uh, the march to the tunnels was very tedious every day, and almost no food. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And again the replenishment method was five hundred people from Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1173">Uh, each time five hundred people were dead, five hundred people, and they were thrown in mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="1174">There was no burning of bodies and I worked on one of the mass graves, I was detailed to that for a short while and fortunately only doing one thing, digging the hole. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And today there are out of seven thousand prisoners who were totally there, for the normal amount of prisoners was four thousand, but there were three additional thousand that came to replenish. </sentence><sentence id="1176">So then all of them in mass graves near the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1177">There is a site - I never went back there although I have a standing invitation from the East German government to come back and be their guest - that they know of me as the only survivor who lives in the western world. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And uh so the camp is still in existence, a national monument, and young soldiers, East German, are being sworn in at the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1179">But it is one of the worst camps that existed. </sentence><sentence id="1180">So the mass graves are there. </sentence><sentence id="1181">They have a very nice site. </sentence><sentence id="1182">They send me pictures every year, and the story exists although I do believe that uh, uh, that maybe the story is not complete. </sentence><sentence id="1183">It is probably worse than if you actually read this. </sentence><sentence id="1184">It is not the same thing if somebody tells you about it is my opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1185">You cannot picture this. </sentence><sentence id="1186">You cannot picture going hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1187">Sometimes | think if you tell someone what hungry is like. </sentence><sentence id="1188">But in Lichtenstein, the work was the killing method of people. </sentence><sentence id="1189">By that I mean working in tunnels without the proper protection. </sentence><sentence id="1190">You had to dig, get the rocks out, haul them on lorries out or carry them out. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And then the blasting. </sentence><sentence id="1192">They never had the prisoners far enough away that somebody wouldn't get killed by the dynamite blasting and then they would carry the rocks off. </sentence><sentence id="1193">So the German guards, the SS guards always stood far enough away so they wouldn't get hit, but they didn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be safe from the blasting, so many people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And those people had to be carried back at night and put into the mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="1195">You know, thrown in. </sentence><sentence id="1196">And I also must mention one horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="1197">At the camp at Leichenstein, they buried many people who were alive. </sentence><sentence id="1198">People who were too weak, who couldn't get off their knees anymore, to get up, to stand up to go to work, and they were put in a pile with the dead people and buried. </sentence><sentence id="1199">At one time somebody refused to bury after they were all thrown in, a few live people were still moving. </sentence><sentence id="1200">He had recognized somebody that he knew and refused to throw earth on him and the man was shot at the mass grave. </sentence><sentence id="1201">That happened to Leichenstein. </sentence><sentence id="1202">And uh, there are many stories, too many of them to tell because it was by far the worst camp that I existed in, and was the least known camps because it was a secret project. </sentence><sentence id="1203">Now, when I mentioned it contained a secret project, this I also read up after the war although there was something known about it, something special about this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1204">It was like a lot of rumors were circulating all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1205">It was a common rumor which turned out to be true This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1206">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1207"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 after I read up on it that the order from the SS was that in case of, there wouldn't be no evacuation of the camp in case the Americans come. </sentence><sentence id="1208">All prisoners have to be killed, no survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1209">Because it was considered a secret project which they were building a special factory. </sentence><sentence id="1210">Now, uh, while we were working in the tunnels, there were German engineers in there. </sentence><sentence id="1211">I was able to get to one and ask him what he would do with his torn clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Every once in a while he would take something off that was torn or bring it back and even some of them would give it to the prisoners because we were always cold. </sentence><sentence id="1213">First of all, it was freezing in there. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Uh, I'm talking about the beginning of 1945, the mid-winter, when we started there. </sentence><sentence id="1215">And I asked this German engineer if he has any old clothing he could bring in that we could wear under our prisoner blue/white stripped uniform and he said yes he would. </sentence><sentence id="1216">And I said I have a friend too, and I said he would bring in some warm clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1217">So he was one of the good guys. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And we were able to pick up this clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1219">He left it ina certain place, we picked it up. </sentence><sentence id="1220">And the main reason for this clothing was not to be warm. </sentence><sentence id="1221">That too, but the main reason was to be able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1222">We figured this is one camp we will never get out of if the war lasts any longer and we had no idea in January or February how long the war was going to last. </sentence><sentence id="1223">And we say if we did well so far, we are not going to do well here because no way. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And there was killing by working people to death. </sentence><sentence id="1225">That was all, and beating to death. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1588">A: Yes, this was one of the camps where Mike was working in another place, but at night time we were together in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1589">Uh, the specific story that I can tell, there are really too many, but is how we were put in the barracks, just lined up like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="1590">There was not enough place to sleep, for everybody to stretch out. </sentence><sentence id="1591">There were no double bunks. </sentence><sentence id="1592">It was just the plain floor of the barracks I was in. </sentence><sentence id="1593">But apparently the camp was created for a lot less people and then there are four thousand people and maybe the camp was created for a thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="1594">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1595">I would say so. </sentence><sentence id="1596">But then the people just stretch out on all these barrack floors. </sentence><sentence id="1597">And uh, at night time when people would come back from work in the dark, there would be no light on. </sentence><sentence id="1598">People would fight and actually strangle each other, become like animals, just to get a place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1599">And we were attacked many times, but Mike and I, we always stood together and we defended ourselves, just for having a place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1600">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1601">People were just like animals and there were people who went to the pile up place where there were bodies and thought they could cut out a piece of meat. </sentence><sentence id="1602">And they were caught. </sentence><sentence id="1603">And some would be severely punished for doing that. </sentence><sentence id="1604">These peoples were considered inhuman, but they were crazed from hunger, some of these people. </sentence><sentence id="1605">And particularly when somebody was left in the barracks of a couple of days, too weak to go to work, and it would be the end after a few days anyway and people would die. </sentence><sentence id="1606">And like I said, they grabbed some of these people and buried them alive. </sentence><sentence id="1607">They didn't even pile them up anymore outside, just took them directly to the mass grave. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And each mass grave at Leigenberg-Zwieberge (ph) has five hundred people and I believe there were six of them. </sentence><sentence id="1609">Uh, now, the story in the barracks, this is one of my most vivid memories of all the camps, is that overhead, these were just one floor barracks, and we sleep on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1610">There were rafters overhead holding the roof together, and every morning as we got up there would be people hanging. </sentence><sentence id="1611">Every morning, in every barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1612">Because people knew they were not going to survive and any This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1613">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1614"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 day, and might as well die now instead of living a few more days, a few more weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1615">Well, lucky for Mike and me, we didn't feel that way. </sentence><sentence id="1616">We figure it's got to be the end. </sentence><sentence id="1617">We're going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1618">We have to. </sentence><sentence id="1619">And, uh, maybe they're going to evacuate us you know. </sentence><sentence id="1620">We also hear that the Allies are coming closer, but we were just .. And we teamed with four other guys at that time who also had the same ideas. </sentence><sentence id="1621">They were all about our age and they were all making it sort of, like we did, being able to stand up on their own two legs. </sentence><sentence id="1622">And we said, we shall escape together. </sentence><sentence id="1623">And they also had gotten civilian clothes like we did from some other place they were working, they were wearing underneath their blue/white stripped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And, uh, so we said, well we'll try and escape and then we go in different directions, maybe two one way, two another way, maybe one SS guard is firing, maybe he'll hit some of us, maybe he won't hit anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1625">But some of us will get out. </sentence><sentence id="1626">But we always noticed that if one person would escape they would always hit him, by submachine gun fire. </sentence><sentence id="1627">Automatic fire. </sentence><sentence id="1628">So we had that in mind. </sentence><sentence id="1629">We always stuck together. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And said if it comes to an evacuation we won't be on a death march like the one from the eastern front that we will never survive, because we know what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="1631">And we should escape then from the march because that would be towards the end anyway from . </sentence><sentence id="1632">Uh, coming back to the people that were hanging themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1633">It was our job every morning before going outside for report period, people would be counted - how many are still alive, how many are still there - that we had to take those bodies down from the rafters. </sentence><sentence id="1634">And pile them outside the barracks, and then another group would come and pick them up and take them to the mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="1635">Uh, my, if I, for years, and I still do occasionally, there wasn't a night, and I, like I mentioned, I have a large family so my family gets my mind off these things and I have a very normal life. </sentence><sentence id="1636">I have had after the war, or soon after I get married it was more normal than ever. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Uh, for years, when I had dreams it was about escaping, escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1638">Because it was always on our minds, escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1639">Whenever I had a dream, even today when I am sometimes, probably tonight I'll have one, I will dream about escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1640">It was a standard thing. </sentence><sentence id="1641">And that is what kept me alive. </sentence><sentence id="1642">That's what kept Michael Schwab (ph) alive, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1643">And, but the other dream that is more frequent than any dream about the concentration camp, is about the people hanging themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1644">There is nothing more vivid in my mind than seeing those people taking their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="1645">It was bad enough, somebody else taking your life, or mass execution, but people just giving up, just plain giving up. </sentence><sentence id="1646">And I have had occasions, and I don't do this anymore since I know what my problem is, that I watered the lawn one day at my home, and my pants were very wet, and I hung up the pants in the shower, and the pants were just hanging there, and I got up during the night and that's nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1647">When I have a bad dream, and I walked into where the toilet is and I saw these pants hanging and immediately I thought somebody was hanging there. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And, uh, like suicides are, is one of the worst memories I have, because so many people committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Not just by rafters. </sentence><sentence id="1650">We had people, and my thoughts have been divided on that - whether it was a courageous act or a coward's act, I'm not judging people when they commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1651">I would never do it. </sentence><sentence id="1652">Uh, I would feel, I get through things. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And uh, although, given thought, yes, I must admit I've given it thought. </sentence><sentence id="1654">I think everyone who has been in concentration camp has given thought to suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1655">But uh, I have seen a man commit suicide why I thought it was a courageous act. </sentence><sentence id="1656">When he stood in front, when we were repairing a railway, and the second line (ph) a speed train came by and he just went in front of the train and he stood there facing it and he got run over by the train. </sentence><sentence id="1657">It killed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1658">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1659"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 him. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And I, you know, there were many other ways. </sentence><sentence id="1661">We tried to prevent suicides, but that is a shameful thing in my opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1662">On my own part, the only thing I would help somebody that wants to die, let them die if they want to die. </sentence><sentence id="1663">That's an old man that I saw had cut his wrists, and I shouted because there was blood spurting from his wrists, and we made a tourniquet, bandaged him up and he was taken back to camp and he was beated up savagely and he was killed that night for trying to deprive the German state of labor. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And that was the sentence on this guy. </sentence><sentence id="1665">You couldn't even commit suicide - that was against the law to commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And that man would have been much better off dying on the ground where I found him, at work. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And uh, so, from then on my idea was about suicide, if somebody wants to do it, let them do it. </sentence><sentence id="1668">Now, if it would have been somebody close to me it would have been a different story. </sentence><sentence id="1669">Like if my friend Mike Schwab would have done it, I would have tried to talk him out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1670">But I knew that he, that just a momentary thing, it is not something he believes in. </sentence><sentence id="1671">I think a lot of people think about it for a long time before they do it. </sentence><sentence id="1672">Or they do it on short notice. </sentence><sentence id="1673">They say all of a sudden, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1674">Well, uh, these are some of the incidents, and Lagenstein was probably the worst camp and the worst memories I have. </sentence><sentence id="1675">Everything goes into the background when I think about Langenstein. </sentence><sentence id="1676">And uh, we were also the first time, I didn't mention this, this was also common practice, when you did something you weren't supposed to be doing, or they just wanted to get to you somehow, you got beatings. </sentence><sentence id="1677">Officially, not just being hit, but being laid over what they called the bok (ph), which is like a special chair for beatings, and they would lash you. </sentence><sentence id="1678">Mike and I both got caught one time, hiding, trying to get out of some work, and we got special beating. </sentence><sentence id="1679">But we were strong and we were able to survive it, although Mike got the worst of it and on your bare rear and I got hit, by other prisoners - they had to do this, the SS didn't do this, just counted and stood by - but my guard left for a while because he wanted to get some cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="1680">And so the prisoner didn't beat me as hard as he should have, and he told me to shout real loud, to scream. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And I did, so I didn't get a very hard beating. </sentence><sentence id="1682">It was fifty lashes and my friend Mike got fifty full, and his posterior was bleeding and pussy for a long, long time. </sentence><sentence id="1683">There was nothing to treat him with. </sentence><sentence id="1684">So this was common place. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Not only at Langenstein but in other places too. </sentence><sentence id="1686">But Lagenstein was the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1687">So I am coming to the next and the last story I think. </sentence><sentence id="1688">My escape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1851">A: O.K. We knew the Allies were approaching. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And in this case the American Army. </sentence><sentence id="1853">That was more or less known. </sentence><sentence id="1854">Uh, some people overheard the SS - they were talking the Americans are coming. </sentence><sentence id="1855">O.K. What's the next thing. </sentence><sentence id="1856">The order was to evacuate the prisoners, but noboby knew where. </sentence><sentence id="1857">So Mike and I made up our mind, the other four guys, we're going to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1858">The first march that we make, the first night or the second or third or whenever we can, we're not going to last for fourteen days. </sentence><sentence id="1859">But, as they transported us, we went out in groups of five hundred people, and the SS did that for a purpose. </sentence><sentence id="1860">I didn't know that at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1861">We thought it was for better control. </sentence><sentence id="1862">Instead of having a large group of four thousand prisoners, or three thousand five hundred together in one group, if there is a mass escape, they cannot kill everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1863">So they took groups of five hundred people each. </sentence><sentence id="1864">And we thought that was for better control. </sentence><sentence id="1865">Have the guards around, and some of them with dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1866">I think each group had about one or two police dogs, German Shepherds, and they were pretty vicious. </sentence><sentence id="1867">And I didn't even tell any story about the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1868">Cough. </sentence><sentence id="1869">Uh, when we were marched out in groups of five hundred, we thought it was for control purpose and the order was to march prisoners at night so the population wouldn't see us, and to sleep them and rest during the day, because the SS had to rest to. </sentence><sentence id="1870">But we walked out and we were walking towards the tunnels, and then we were redirected. </sentence><sentence id="1871">Now this I found later. </sentence><sentence id="1872">I didn't know all this at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1873">Because from the publication that the East Germans sent me, what actually happened. </sentence><sentence id="1874">The order, and this I found out after the war, I didn't know this at the time, the order was to take the groups of prisoners, in group of five hundred, in different tunnels and dynamite the tunnels and bury the prisoners alive in there, so there would be no survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Because the order was no survivors from that particular secret project. </sentence><sentence id="1876">If they shoot them, yes, they could have done it. </sentence><sentence id="1877">But easier to drive them to the tunnels, which was just a few miles away, and dynamite the tunnels alive. </sentence><sentence id="1878">But as it turned out, they were in radio contact with their former observers, or troops, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1879">Uh, there was American tank column cited coming around the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And they were looking for the tunnels. </sentence><sentence id="1881">They knew there was something secret This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1882">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1883"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 going on because they are trying to find the tunnels by air one time because we were there and there was air alarm, and a torpedo plane and tried to put a torpedo into the tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="1884">It was not successful. </sentence><sentence id="1885">It was all camouflaged. </sentence><sentence id="1886">Uh, they redirected us because they thought the American tank column was going to cut us off before they get to the tunnels. </sentence><sentence id="1887">So we marched back. </sentence><sentence id="1888">We marched to camp, and then we marched, to make a long story short, we marched three nights till we actually escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1889">And what happened, every night, they parked us, let us rest in a barn, just like in the first march. </sentence><sentence id="1890">During the day, they took, they requisitioned a barn from a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="1891">Since we were only five hundred people and they could put five hundred people in almost any barns, squeeze them in if it's a small barn, and then, bring us out at night. </sentence><sentence id="1892">Now, if the farmer was a decent guy, he had some potatoes and food for the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1893">Even for five hundred because he's feeding cows and other animals. </sentence><sentence id="1894">So in the first and second night we got some food from the farmer, it was the only thing, and water. </sentence><sentence id="1895">In the night time, they put the prisoners, of course, into these barns and they posted guards outside. </sentence><sentence id="1896">The next morning, march again. </sentence><sentence id="1897">Whoever couldn't march was shot by the SS - the same system like the other. </sentence><sentence id="1898">So, again, we were prepared at that time - we were wearing our civilian clothes underneath and we said we've got to go the first chance we get. </sentence><sentence id="1899">So on the third night, we had just, we had decided if we had crossed several small bridges or small streams or rivers, we have to get across the river because, we could all swim, we knew that. </sentence><sentence id="1900">And we had decided after crossing a bridge would be the most opportune moment to escape and then go towards, or swim across because a dog would pursue you on land. </sentence><sentence id="1901">But a dog would not swim across the river unless he is trained to do so. </sentence><sentence id="1902">But the concentration camps" dogs I don't think were trained to go into water. </sentence><sentence id="1903">They were trained to pursue prisoners on land. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So we decided that ours, and then he would not, he could not smell, dogs cannot smell across water but they can smell across land, so they can follow you. </sentence><sentence id="1905">If they turn the dog loose. </sentence><sentence id="1906">Well what happened then, on the third night we had just come across a small bridge. </sentence><sentence id="1907">We didn't know where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1908">We were getting away from the American front, that's all we knew. </sentence><sentence id="1909">Where to nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="1910">And I don't think, the SS were just trying to get us away because they didn't know what to do, and I think there must have been a dissention among them whether to kill or not to kill the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And I think one case I heard that a SS tried to make contact with the prisoners, that he was a good guy, that they should say so in case the Americans come. </sentence><sentence id="1912">So maybe some of them were O.K. and some of them were not, and some were just scared and maybe the troop transports on the roads and they were particularly following roads. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And that's where all the transportation. </sentence><sentence id="1914">As we came across a small river there was an air alert, and it was normal procedure, as we were walking in ranks of four, with the SS on the side on a small country road, a body seen from the air, and by that I mean at night time, signled airplanes who would be the observation plane ... TAPE ENDS . .. </sentence><sentence id="1915">and prisoners escaped and this happened and they got shot. </sentence><sentence id="1916">When planes were not around, they put the searchlights on and sent the dog after them, or they would shoot the prisoner and they couldn't run so fast, you know, and __.So there were several, there were, a matter of fact, quite a few escapes but everyone of them would get caught, so we thought that the time to escape was near a small river if we were lucky amd we had lucky a plan overhead, just above where we were going to go. </sentence><sentence id="1917">So we were lying down and we knew that were going to be no searchlight on and we took off. </sentence><sentence id="1918">All six of us said go, and we went. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And we must have been just a couple of hundred yards away from the river and one dog that decided the last moment's enough for us. </sentence><sentence id="1920">I got This is a verbatim

even know I was bitten. </sentence><sentence id="1924">I thought, I fell a couple of times, but the dog, you cannot see as well, but the dog went after the other prisoners, and I don't know to this date - I never found out the story - but only Mike and I made it. </sentence><sentence id="1925">The others went in different directions, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="1926">That was our plan, to go in different directions and some of us get through. </sentence><sentence id="1927">Either some of these people are killed by the dog, but we didn't see anybody and we inquired a little bit about it later on after our liberation, but they didn't know of any other prisoners that escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1928">They knew, because we were reported by the SS to the local police, there are two escaped prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1929">So I assume that the other four were killed and they found them. </sentence><sentence id="1930">But Mike and I got to the river, and we swam across, and then we were safe from the SS, from the dog, and the first thing we did, we figure if we stay out in the open, we're sunk. </sentence><sentence id="1931">They maybe come with a local police dog and sniff us out. </sentence><sentence id="1932">And we didn't smell so good and uh, we were full of lice and I mean, even with our civilian clothes on, I had a black jacket on, the white lice were just running around on the suit. </sentence><sentence id="1933">And anybody would have recognized somebody coming from a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1934">But anyway, the first thing we did we went to some, there were some farmhouse nearby, and like I said it was at night and I don't remember what time it was but it must have been past midnight, maybe two or three in the morning and people would be asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1935">So we decided we have to get off the roads, off the land where somebody could find us the next morning and hid someplace where it is safe, but not out in the open. </sentence><sentence id="1936">So we got to a farmhouse and we found a window next to the, where the stable is. </sentence><sentence id="1937">Underneath the stable there is, this was a solid build, brick stable. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And underneath the stable they had a cellar, and this was a cellar for the foods for the animals, and also the potatoe cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1939">They store hugh amount of potatoes in Germany, and we decided to get in through the cellar hole which was from the outside, not going through the front. </sentence><sentence id="1940">When we lifted it up, I let myself down. </sentence><sentence id="1941">We didn't know what we would hit in the dark, whether it would be some water or something. </sentence><sentence id="1942">We were scared. </sentence><sentence id="1943">And Michael was holding on to my arms, and I said there must be something below me. </sentence><sentence id="1944">It smells like maybe potatoes, I wasn't sure you know. </sentence><sentence id="1945">And I guess right, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1946">I figured it was potatoes, and then he let me go, and maybe about a couple inches below my feet I hit potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1947">But I was afraid that I wouldn't get out anymore if I let myself drop or whatever in the dark, and you don't know what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="1948">So anyway, Michael came in and then we dug a hole in the potatoes so we figured in the morning somebody might open up the door to the potatoe cellar, we'd be sitting right on top of the potatoes sleeping or something. </sentence><sentence id="1949">So we dug a hole into the potatoes, covered us up with potatoes, and there was enough air to get in of course, that was no problem, until we knew the next day where we were and what we could do. </sentence><sentence id="1950">So we got out the next day when everything was quiet, the next evening when it started getting dark, and we stayed there a full day, and of course were not found. </sentence><sentence id="1951">And then we went into, we got some milk to drink. </sentence><sentence id="1952">We went into the stable. </sentence><sentence id="1953">We found some milk. </sentence><sentence id="1954">I think it was put there for the cats. </sentence><sentence id="1955">They had a lot of cats. </sentence><sentence id="1956">We drank the milk from the cats and we got food that was for the cows, and we took and filled out pocket up with potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1957">We ate raw potatoes, that didn't, but we were worried about diarrhea, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1958">Anything raw. </sentence><sentence id="1959">But we got our first real food, and then we went our way. </sentence><sentence id="1960">Uh, we decided that to use the same routine, to sleep during the day, in bushes, but get away from the villages now, and uh, to go towards the sound of the artillery fire that was coming closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="1961">We didn't know which direction. </sentence><sentence id="1962">We didn't know which

We had the most fantastic thing happen. </sentence><sentence id="2104">I think you have to have, you have to be lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2105">I keep stressing that, not just do some thinking, but also be lucky and healthy. </sentence><sentence id="2106">On the sixth day or so, it was just a day or two before our actual liberation, we were sleeping in bushes. </sentence><sentence id="2107">Actually one was supposed to be watching, one was supposed to be sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="2108">I was supposed to be sleeping, Mike was supposed to be watching. </sentence><sentence id="2109">And, but watching would not have helped very much except somebody's coming and they couldn't run away and then somebody would know. </sentence><sentence id="2110">But we could kill one person. </sentence><sentence id="2111">We decided if somebody is getting dangerous and tells us to come along with them or something that we would strangle the person. </sentence><sentence id="2112">We knew we could do it. </sentence><sentence id="2113">We had absolutely made up our mind that's what we would do. </sentence><sentence id="2114">But we were both asleep and being awakened by jack boots. </sentence><sentence id="2115">Now jack boots was what the SS wore, but he was the local policeman. </sentence><sentence id="2116">There must have been only one policeman in that little village. </sentence><sentence id="2117">And uh, he said, identification, he said in German. </sentence><sentence id="2118">And we said, well we are foreign workers, we are from Holland we said. </sentence><sentence id="2119">And Michael started talking Dutch a little bit and I spoke Dutch of course too, and we started mixing our German with a little Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="2120">And he said I want to see papers. </sentence><sentence id="2121">We don't have any papers. </sentence><sentence id="2122">He said where are your papers. </sentence><sentence id="2123">I said we've been bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="2124">When we came back from the fields from work, we were foreign workers here, the place wasn't there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2125">Everything just what we're wearing to work - that's what we have, no more papers. </sentence><sentence id="2126">And he started looking at us and he started going like this, He saw the lice crawling around. </sentence><sentence id="2127">You know, stay away. </sentence><sentence id="2128">Then he said, mitcom, come with me. </sentence><sentence id="2129">I said oh my God, the SS, where to. </sentence><sentence id="2130">Well he said, and he seemed to be inebriated a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2131">He had just had a couple of drinks, beers probably, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2132">And the war was coming to an end, and things were pretty confusing. </sentence><sentence id="2133">And we could smell the alcohol on him, and figured well, this man is maybe not dangerous but we don't want to anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2134">What are we doing to do? </sentence><sentence id="2135">He had a pistol in his holster, and I said we can grab it and kill him but then somebody is really going to come looking for us, and maybe we can't get that far away. </sentence><sentence id="2136">Everybody be alerted or something. </sentence><sentence id="2137">So we figure, we noticed that the man was not decent, but he was scared. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And he said at the end, he made a comment to it, well he said I have to take you because there are some escaped prisoners in this are </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2139">A: And we figured I said are we going to get there. </sentence><sentence id="2140">Well, he said if you, if we can identify you, he said you can get some temporary papers because a lot of people have lost their papers because of bombings. </sentence><sentence id="2141">They came home - no more homes. </sentence><sentence id="2142">But I cannot let you go. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2143">So I said to Michael, I looked at him and I said, what do we do. </sentence><sentence id="2144">I said, kill him? </sentence><sentence id="2145">You know, we had a little sign. </sentence><sentence id="2146">But we couldn't say anything, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2147">We could just look at each other and try to understand each other through eye movements, and we could see this guy wasn't really all there. </sentence><sentence id="2148">He was, as a matter of fact, he was about, I was going to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2149"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2150">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2151"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2152"> 0 say an old man. </sentence><sentence id="2153">He was my age or older. </sentence><sentence id="2154">And, uh, so I said well, let's try it. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Maybe we're lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2156">And, we can't, maybe we're, somebody's going to find out about us here in the open anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2157">If he lets us go now maybe then send a search house party for us or let's go. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2158">So he took us to city hall. </sentence><sentence id="2159">The city hall was just a part-time job for - it was a full time job for the policeman - part-time job for the mayor who was a farmer, and he was burning papers. </sentence><sentence id="2160">We came in there and he had a stove burning papers. </sentence><sentence id="2161">And he said in German, or course, we couldn't understand everything, he said I pick up some Dutch workers here. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2162">When he said that I felt pretty secure you know. </sentence><sentence id="2163">And he said they lost there papers in a bombing raid. </sentence><sentence id="2164">Uh, can we give them some papers? </sentence><sentence id="2165">Ah, he said, 5 what's the use, the war is finished. </sentence><sentence id="2166">He said who cares about papers the mayor said you know. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And he didn't want to have anything to do with anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2168">And he looked at us and he said to us, and the guy, the policeman went in the next room to make a phone call or to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2169">I didn't know what he was doing, but he left for a second. </sentence><sentence id="2170">He said to us, the mayor, we have some concentration camp escapees in here, so we are being careful you know. </sentence><sentence id="2171">He looked at us like he knew we were. </sentence><sentence id="2172">And we figured he's not going to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2173">So we said, well, the policeman came back in, and he said, get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="2174">I don't want to have anything to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="2175">And he said, well, I said, we have to get some, and then we started getting frantic (ph), and said give us some paper please. </sentence><sentence id="2176">I said that you know we lost our papers in a bombing. </sentence><sentence id="2177">Well I said, I can't give you any paper. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2178">There is nothing you can prove, nothing I can prove. </sentence><sentence id="2179">So anyway, there was a big discussion and finally said, well, we're not going to insist because this guy might change his mind. </sentence><sentence id="2180">And so he, the mayor said to the policeman, why don't you take them and get them out of this village. </sentence><sentence id="2181">Well, he got us out of the place. </sentence><sentence id="2182">By the time we got to the next guest house, beer house, he smelled beer again, and he said well, you go this way and then you go to next village. </sentence><sentence id="2183">Maybe they will give you some paper. </sentence><sentence id="2184">And he went into the beer hall. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And we were free. </sentence><sentence id="2186">I said, Michael, I said, we got out of something that could have turned out bad. </sentence><sentence id="2187">The only thing it would have made us is killers. </sentence><sentence id="2188">We trying to save our lives and it would have gone wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2189">So we were lucky again. </sentence><sentence id="2190">And somehow it was always a sense that we're going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="2191">I mean the sense never left us, Michael and myself. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And then, somehow, through luck or through our own thinking, or, or doing things the right way and uh, mostly luck, that we're going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="2193">The one thing that never left me is the sense that if anybody's going to make it, I'm going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="2194">And never give up hope. </sentence><sentence id="2195">And Michael was the same way. </sentence><sentence id="2196">And O.K. Now our actual liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2197">So we went to the next village. </sentence><sentence id="2198">And we noticed that this village when we got inside, on the outskirts of the village, there were fields that some people had next to their farms. </sentence><sentence id="2199">We said we cannot be out in the open fields. </sentence><sentence id="2200">There wasn't that much other vegetation there. </sentence><sentence id="2201">Let's get close to the village where there are some bushes or something and sit down or lay down and go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2202">The Americans got to be here anytime. </sentence><sentence id="2203">So, we laid out there, and in the night we heard tanks rolling. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And then we heard German voices, and we didn't know this, when we got there, they had placed that same evening what they called faukstorma (ph), which is the German national guard if you call it. </sentence><sentence id="2205">They are old guys and young fellows. </sentence><sentence id="2206">Last minute they put them into uniform and make soldiers out of them. </sentence><sentence id="2207">And they had placed these guys with ponce so founst (ph) in little holes in the ground to be a defense against tanks. </sentence><sentence id="2208">And ponce so foust (ph) is a, I'm not sure what, we call it a anti-tank weapon. </sentence><sentence id="2209">It's a shoulder held weapon that one man can fire. </sentence><sentence id="2210">It's not a gun and they can sit in a hole and usually one loads the gun and one fires the gun. </sentence><sentence id="2211">And there </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2212"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2213">It is not the primary

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2215"> 1 was one very close to us, and we wanted to, the first thing we wanted to do was when we would hear tanks coming across the field, go towards the tanks, put our arms up. </sentence><sentence id="2216">But we figure if we do this we may get shot from behind or something for deserters in the dark or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2217">And we didn't want to get shot by the other side either you know, by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="2218">So as the tanks were coming across in the morning, it must have been about five o'clock in the morning, as it started getting a little light - no it wasn't getting light that time - but they started coming about five o'clock I think - I didn't have a watch - we decided we're going to move on the ground towards them. </sentence><sentence id="2219">Well, somebody noticed something moving in that one hole, and they had in the meantime had holes on the right, probably on both sides of where we were __. </sentence><sentence id="2220">But we were far enough away not to be seen, maybe uh, hundred and fifty yards from each hole. </sentence><sentence id="2221">I don't know, but we must have been right in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="2222">And uh, one guy called over in German, what is that patrol (ph) - is this a patrol, because they didn't know from their own people that - they just thought it was a German army patrol. </sentence><sentence id="2223">And I said to the guy, hel mut (ph), keep your mouth shut, shut up I said, and the guy was quiet you know. </sentence><sentence id="2224">And he probably was believing that we were German patrols since he could only see us crawling. </sentence><sentence id="2225">And then it takes the tank, one company of tanks for seventeen tanks, all of a sudden came across the field. </sentence><sentence id="2226">And as soon as we saw the first tank coming we put up our hands and we were just hoping that they wouldn't start firing, because prisoners get shot sometimes too, even if you give up. </sentence><sentence id="2227">Well, the lead tank, the guy jumped down, and he spoke German, he was a German-American that they used as an interpreter, and he made all the tanks stop and he brought the officers up, the commanding officer, and they radioed back to the battalion that they had some guys who were escaped prisoners, and to make a long story short, they used us. </sentence><sentence id="2228">In other words, we knew what was in front of them. </sentence><sentence id="2229">Which was the right thing to do and we were glad to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2230">And they said you're prisoners, you look like prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2231">can you prove it? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2232">We showed the number on the arm and apparently some of them knew already. </sentence><sentence id="2233">They had crossed a concentration camp, another one someplace. </sentence><sentence id="2234">This was the Third Armored Division, D Company of the 32nd Armored Regiment of the Third Armored Division. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2235">One of Patton's divisions. </sentence><sentence id="2236">And uh, so we had a small conference there, and they if we say any German army units, or they were particularly interested German 88 anti-tank guns, and I said all we know the German ponce de foust (ph), the anti-tank weapon, and they are all old or young guys as far as we can determine from their voices but we don't know for sure. </sentence><sentence id="2237">We just crawled through. </sentence><sentence id="2238">So they got on the tank with the P. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2239">A: system and the guy in this German said there are no German army troops around, there are only the army helpers, the national guard or the uh, German folkstrom (ph), young guys and old people - that it would be silly to fire one shot because the moment the first shot is fired, they are going to destroy the village. </sentence><sentence id="2240">And they hoisted white flags and they gave up and there was not one shot fired. </sentence><sentence id="2241">And uh, so, then, it came to us, and we were taken back to battalion headquarters where the battalion surgeon examined us right away. </sentence><sentence id="2242">We were then put on scales and uh, it was a small, like a small, not hospital, a batallion aid station. </sentence><sentence id="2243">And they had all the medical equipment to take care of, and that was basically our liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2244">And then the regimental commander came looking at us, congratulating us and then the company commander said if they want to stay with us, the boys they can stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="2245">Then when they went into the village, they requisitioned a house for the two of us, and told the women to make a hot bath for us. </sentence><sentence id="2246">That we were going to be bathed by This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2247">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or

to go on, and we can't go with lice with them on the tanks. </sentence><sentence id="2249">That we have to be , and they came with Lysol and whatever you have as a disinfectant, and we were completely taken care of medically. </sentence><sentence id="2250">And examined by a medical doctor or military doctor and found to be healthy, not have any communicable diseases. </sentence><sentence id="2251">But it actually wasn't exact the first day, we went through a couple of days of check-ups. </sentence><sentence id="2252">But in the meantime, we were then, the first thing to do was get rid of the lice. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And that we did. </sentence><sentence id="2254">And our hair shorn off again for last time. </sentence><sentence id="2255">And uh, then, we stayed, to make a long story short, we stayed with D Company of this tank battalion for six months. </sentence><sentence id="2256">The war was over in another few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2257">And they were taken out of combat immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2258">After that village, that was their last combat session. </sentence><sentence id="2259">And we stayed with them, and with an O.K. by the higher ups, that we can stay as long as we want to until we find our families, "til we are certain we are finding anybody family. </sentence><sentence id="2260">In the meantime, we are changed from these old prisoner garments to GI uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2261">We were just like soldiers without rank of course and we were treated in the mess hall like kings, and we had access to the mess hall, not during dinner hours but anytime we wanted to walk in eat. </sentence><sentence id="2262">We picked up 50 pounds in three months. </sentence><sentence id="2263">Which was really a dangerous thing to do because I heard a lot of prisoners overate, and we did too, and killed themselves overeating. </sentence><sentence id="2264">And that basically is the story. </sentence><sentence id="2265">And uh, so, then to finish up, after our escape, my first thought was to find the family, but I didn't know where to start. </sentence><sentence id="2266">And first we had to get back on track, get normal again. </sentence><sentence id="2267">So Michael and I stayed and like I said for six months. </sentence><sentence id="2268">And then we were taken back, they were moved back to the area near Schofenborg (ph) which is near Frankfurt, into their regular area where they were going to settle down. </sentence><sentence id="2269">This little town, which called Viny Koomstad (ph) near Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="2270">And this company was then settled down and we settled down with them. </sentence><sentence id="2271">We given a place, a place they requisitioned. </sentence><sentence id="2272">So the first thing, we still didn't have any papers, the question of papers, what to do about papers. </sentence><sentence id="2273">So they inquired with the police and say, they have to go to DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="2274">When we heard camps, just the name camps, no way we're going to any camps. </sentence><sentence id="2275">We didn't know at the time about DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="2276">To us DP camps was another, a better concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2277">You know, another camp. </sentence><sentence id="2278">But it wasn't true of course. </sentence><sentence id="2279">But we just heard the name camp and we said no. </sentence><sentence id="2280">And uh, the batallion commander said the boys don't have to go to any camp if they don't want to. </sentence><sentence id="2281">They just go to get papers. </sentence><sentence id="2282">So they commander officer sent an officer with us to Frankfurt DP camp. </sentence><sentence id="2283">This was right in the city of Frankfurt where there was a compound where all the Jewish refugees moved in. </sentence><sentence id="2284">Ah, not just Jewish refugees, there were other refugees, but they were mostly Jews that had been liberated from camps or were picked up in other places, forced laborers from other foreign countries. </sentence><sentence id="2285">They were in an enclosure and there was a guard at the gate but you could walk in and out once you had your papers. </sentence><sentence id="2286">But people were taken care of medically and furnished papers after they were identified. </sentence><sentence id="2287">So he took us in there and the uh, official said they have to stay here, they can't go back with you because they don't have any papers. </sentence><sentence id="2288">It will take maybe, take weeks before we get any confirmation on them. </sentence><sentence id="2289">And we have such a overload here anyway, and the lieutenant looked at us, and he said, well, what you decide boys. </sentence><sentence id="2290">And the thing was up to us, not to this guy, official there. </sentence><sentence id="2291">And I said we're not staying. </sentence><sentence id="2292">Papers or no papers, we're not going to stay in another camp. </sentence><sentence id="2293">And we stay with you. </sentence><sentence id="2294">So he took us back and then there was an agreement reached that we can stay until we get papers, until we also, even after we get papers, we can stay with them while we decide where our families are, go back to, Michael to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2295">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

and Muchenglablak (ph), Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2297">Because either place our family could have been. </sentence><sentence id="2298">But we had decided in the case of my immediate family was in Brussels, Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="2299">My parents that we would meet in Brussels, Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="2300">Or meet in Muchenglablak (ph) with a Catholic family that we know. </sentence><sentence id="2301">So I went to both places. </sentence><sentence id="2302">Didn't find of course anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2303">And I did find some distant cousins and I did make some contact with the Joint Distribution Committee, which was of course a Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="2304">And although I didn't find anybody, I stayed in Brussels, and uh, was taken care of by the Jewish organization in Brussels, and then the thing I have to get some education and so on, and then I, by that time I was alsmost 19. </sentence><sentence id="2305">No, by the time I came back I was 19 already. </sentence><sentence id="2306">Uh, they said that I am too old for an orphanage, too lot Jewish orphans or kids that were picked up after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2307">But the man that ran the Joint Distribution Organization in Brussels was Mr. Munsba (ph) who had been one of my father's friends in one of the camps, in the French camps of St. Cyprien, and he said, well, 18 is the limit for orphanages, but you're past limit, but we'll let you have a little room in here, and you find a job. </sentence><sentence id="2308">We'll put you through school. </sentence><sentence id="2309">We'll do something for you. </sentence><sentence id="2310">So I got a little room in the orphanage there and I went to school, back to school, and tried to learn a trade at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="2311">And Michael went back to Holland at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="2312">He wasn't as lucky as I was. </sentence><sentence id="2313">He didn't find, well I didn't find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2314">He didn't find anyone from his family. </sentence><sentence id="2315">Everybody was killed. </sentence><sentence id="2316">And uh, he didn't have the offer to go into an orphanage or anything up there. </sentence><sentence id="2317">So he went back to the Third Armored Division. </sentence><sentence id="2318">They had given him papers, they had given me papers too, to use official transportation and just like military, like an American military guy, to get back to this place in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2319">We were fully covered. </sentence><sentence id="2320">So Michael took advantage of that and uh, make his long story afterward short, he was adopted by an American soldier, non-Jewish soldier, to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2321">And he stayed with him until he actually left for the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2322">I remained in Belgium, and I also came to the United States, but I came in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="2323">I came by asking for visa to go to the United States, and I had to wait until December "47 to get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2324">I did get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And the draft was still going on here. </sentence><sentence id="2326">I was going to be drafted. </sentence><sentence id="2327">In Europe, if you were in Germany of course, but Germany didn't have an army, but other countries, like France, or Belgium, they were still drafting too after the war for a while. </sentence><sentence id="2328">I would have been subject to the draft. </sentence><sentence id="2329">Well, it would have been a bad thing after the concentration camps of course. </sentence><sentence id="2330">You know, you want to lead a regular life. </sentence><sentence id="2331">But here the United States had nothing to do with me, that my past was in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2332">I would have been subject to the draft. </sentence><sentence id="2333">So what I did instead, I volunteered for military service with the agreement they had at this time to get the GI Bill, or to remain and make the military a career. </sentence><sentence id="2334">What I was after getting an education from the military. </sentence><sentence id="2335">I did exactly that. </sentence><sentence id="2336">I came in as an enlisted man, I became a sergeant, then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able to go to Officer's Candidate School and became an officer and make the Army a career for twenty years. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And uh, I had by initial boots anyway with the army after my liberation and I was very successful. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And then I joined the civil service after my military career. </sentence><sentence id="2339">And I was another twenty years in the civil service. </sentence><sentence id="2340">But I probably missed the story that is very close to my heart that I wanted to mention about my children, about my wife. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And I married a German woman who's not Jewish, and my children grew up Jewish in remembrance of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2342">And nothing else, if I don't feel that strong about religion, I wanted them to have something. </sentence><sentence id="2343">Everybody should grow up with a religion, and have a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2344">It is

the sole reason, because they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And uh, I'm going to bring up one more thing here. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Uh, about two months ago, I made a trip to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2349">And I visited my, the old folks are not alive anymore, the Christian people that helped my family, that helped my grandparents who by the way were deported to Lasenstadt (ph), the ghetto and also perished, including an 80 year old grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="2350">My father, before he died, sat down with me in the camps at night, and tried to recall everybody that was left from the Willner family in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2351">And that possibly also had the same fate that we had went to the concentration camps.
