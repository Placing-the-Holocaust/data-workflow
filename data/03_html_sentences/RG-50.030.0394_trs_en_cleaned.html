<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: It was a complete shock to me. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was a life changing hour, and a growing up hour, and also of taking things in hand. </sentence><sentence id="262">My mother was an extremely nervous person, very hysterical for everything, so I became the leader with my mother, because I was more calm. </sentence><sentence id="263">And so I aged very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="264">At that time, that day when everything went awry, my father started to say we've got to leave here. </sentence><sentence id="265">But then, things happened so fast. </sentence><sentence id="266">The very first week of Hitler's coming into Austria, somebody came with a rifle, knocked on our door, and said, "Car keys." </sentence><sentence id="267">That wa -- that's all that -- that was the whole interchange, and we handed over the car keys. </sentence><sentence id="268">And then somebody came and said, "I like this apartment." </sentence><sentence id="269">My parents had bought it before they were married, and had put in a bathroom, and -- a co -- like a co-op, they had done all the alterations and everything, it was ours. </sentence><sentence id="270">And we had to be out in six hours or die. </sentence><sentence id="271">And what do you do first? </sentence><sentence id="272">Do you pack, do you find a place, do you moo -- what do you do? </sentence><sentence id="273">So one of my parents went and got boxes, and one went to find a place to live, and I started packing. </sentence><sentence id="274">And in six hours we were out with as much as we could pack. </sentence><sentence id="275">The rest we had to leave just like it was. </sentence><sentence id="276">You know, we had all kinds of built ins, and things, and was all gone. </sentence><sentence id="277">And the -- we moved to a place that was almost like a ghetto, because it was an very old house, and most of the people there had to move out quickly, had to move into places like that, so that was quite a shock. </sentence><sentence id="278">We had two stores, and you were no longer allowed to have employees that were not Jewish, and we always had help in the house, living in, and she had to leave, and the  people in the store could no longer help us. </sentence><sentence id="279">So -- but they were still open, and we were trying to sell enough to have enough money to -- for every day things, because the bank accounts were closed, and all in all, this was our income. </sentence><sentence id="280">So we lived like that until Kristallnacht -- Crystal Night. </sentence><sentence id="281">Kristallnacht, we woke up in the morning, and my father had said -- we didn't know it was happening, and my father said, "Things are getting so bad." </sentence><sentence id="282">This was already November. </sentence><sentence id="283">He said, ""Why don't I take some of our valuables to the store and hide them there?" </sentence><sentence id="284">And he took out cameras, and some jewelry, and -- and he left. </sentence><sentence id="285">And as he left the phone rang, and my girlfriend called and said, "Don't let your father leave," and hung up. </sentence><sentence id="286">We had no idea what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="287">You know, what people don't realize is there was no television, and there was -- there was very little communication, so that nobody knew it was happening, really. </sentence><sentence id="288">So about two minutes later, doorbell rang, and it was my father, and he said, "I'm lost. </sentence><sentence id="289">I'll never see you again, they arrested me, and they're taking me away." </sentence><sentence id="290">And I knew one of the men, and I ask him could I leave some keys with you? </sentence><sentence id="291">So he had all this camera, and jewelry and all on him, and he took that and put it somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="292">And then he put on long underwear because he was cold, and my mother was almost screaming. </sentence><sentence id="293">And then she had an idea, and she went next door to the neighbor, it was a Jewish woman with a son who was not well. </sentence><sentence id="294">He was Si -- a very sickly man at the time. </sentence><sentence id="295">And she said to her, "Would you hide my husband?" </sentence><sentence id="296">And she said yes, and she put my father in her closet. </sentence><sentence id="297">They came and took her son away, and she didn't tell them that my father was hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="298">Luckily at that time, there was no concentration camps yet, so they send him home because they -- they didn't know what to do with him. </sentence><sentence id="299">So we felt better that we -- you know, that my father survived, and he did, too. </sentence><sentence id="300">But this is how it was done. </sentence><sentence id="301">It was -- it -- it snuck up on us. </sentence><sentence id="302">It -- it -- we couldn't believe people would do things like that. </sentence><sentence id="303">So then we didn't know what to do about my father, then we found out from the radio that the Viennese had 24 hours to do with the Jews as they pleased. </sentence><sentence id="304">And they were taking away Jews from everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="305">Men. </sentence><sentence id="306">They -- they put men into prisons and things, but they had no room for the women yet, that came later. </sentence><sentence id="307">But I went downstairs and got a taxicab, and my father laid down on the floor of the cab, and the cab driver did not give us away. </sentence><sentence id="308">And we went to the store -- one of our stores, and we have a friend, a mutual friend of my husband and mine, who was helping us out in the store, and he had opened it that day. </sentence><sentence id="309">And we went in there -- we closed the store with the iron gates from the inside. </sentence><sentence id="310">The store had no bathroom, and nothing. </sentence><sentence id="311">We wen -- we went in there and we closed that. </sentence><sentence id="312">And this young man and I, and my mother and father stayed in there. </sentence><sentence id="313">We had a telephone, and my girlfriend kept us aware of what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="314">She also sent somebody with some sandwiches to po -- put under the door. </sentence><sentence id="315">We didn't know how long we didn't there -- we would be there. </sentence><sentence id="316">We stayed about 30 some hours in there, and even though it was so terrible, we told stories -- we had no light, we couldn't turn on a light. </sentence><sentence id="317">People knocked on the doors, and we didn't open. </sentence><sentence id="318">And then finally my girlfriend says they have lifted this terrible thing that -- of Kristallnacht, and she said, you can come out now, I think. </sentence><sentence id="319">But we were still scared. </sentence><sentence id="320">And when we looked out, the Nazis had put a swastika seal on the key lock -- on the -- where the key goes, and at that time the keys were these large keys with the long tops. </sentence><sentence id="321">And I took a key, the key from the inside, and I unlocked it, and it didn't tear. </sentence><sentence id="322">Because that would have been certain death. </sentence><sentence id="323">Nobody could hurt the swastika seal. </sentence><sentence id="324">We ha -- w -- I had  an aunt that wa -- had no husband. </sentence><sentence id="325">She lived with her sister and her daughter, and my father went in to hide there, because they didn't expect a man to be there. </sentence><sentence id="326">And he spend the next two days there. </sentence><sentence id="327">The young man that was with us, was -- they looked for him many times. </sentence><sentence id="328">He would not have survived if he had been hiding with us. </sentence><sentence id="329">It was a horrendous day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: When you went out of this building, and this was right after Kristallnacht -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: What did you see? </sentence><sentence id="405">What was -- what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: A lot of broken glass. </sentence><sentence id="409">All Jewish businesses had been torched, or broken. </sentence><sentence id="410">All the merchandise was either looted, or thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="411">It was -- it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="412">And w-we couldn't believe we survived it, or that my father survived it. </sentence><sentence id="413">And h-he came back home after two days, and we had no more stores, we had nothing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="414">I remember going out of the store, I even took money out of the cash register, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="415">But we -- we -- thank God we survived it, and we were looking for ways to get out of Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="416">As you know, nobody wanted us. </sentence><sentence id="417">No country wanted us. </sentence><sentence id="418">The countries, most of the time just were closed to us, and you couldn't get out of Austria unless you had a permit to go to another country. </sentence><sentence id="419">So we had no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="420">And then, after that, it was probably in January, my father got an invitation to come to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="421">And nobody ever came back from that. </sentence><sentence id="422">And that same day, the same friend was visiting me, and my father said, "I'm leaving." </sentence><sentence id="423">And -- and my mother says, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="424">He says, "Pll find something, but I'm not going to the Gestapo." </sentence><sentence id="425">And this young man said, "Please take me with you." </sentence><sentence id="426">So they each put a shirt and a shaving brush into one of my dolls suitcases. </sentence><sentence id="427">I still had dolls with suit -- I never liked dolls, I liked teddy bears -- and put it into little suitcases like that, they each had one. </sentence><sentence id="428">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="429">And my father and I had made up a whole language between us. </sentence><sentence id="430">And they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="431">And a few days later, I got a call from Antwerp, Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="432">My father said, "We're here, we're safe," and he told me what to do. </sentence><sentence id="433">And what he did was this, he got on a train from Vienna to Rotterdam. </sentence><sentence id="434">Well, there was no more border between Austria and Germany, but there was a border between Germany and Holland. </sentence><sentence id="435">And before he came to the border, he contacted one of the waiters that looked simpatico, and he said, "I have money I'd like to give you if you would hide my friend and me under table." </sentence><sentence id="436">And he said okay. </sentence><sentence id="437">So they got under table at the border, they put tablecloths over them, and then they stood in front of the table while they searched the train. </sentence><sentence id="438">They found the two little suitcases, and nobody claimed them, so they searched some more. </sentence><sentence id="439">In the meantime they had the heating unit in their back. </sentence><sentence id="440">They said it was unbelievable, and they couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="441">But they finally left, they couldn -- nobody knew what happened to these men. </sentence><sentence id="442">So, when they got to Rotterdam, my father said to this young man, "Get out of the train and stretch, and act like you're lighting a cigarette, like you're going to get back on, because they" ll be looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="443">And then make your way to the exit, and go to the streets, and when you find the -- a place that has a kosher sign on it, they'll help you." </sentence><sentence id="444">And that's exactly what they both did. </sentence><sentence id="445">They found a place with a  kosher sign. </sentence><sentence id="446">They went in and told them they were refugees, and what should they do. </sentence><sentence id="447">These people knew -- these Jews knew that in an -- in Belgium, in Antwerp, they were giving 30 day permits to people to stay. </sentence><sentence id="448">So they made them up false papers, and they send one by car, and one by bus to Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="449">And that's how they got to Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="450">And our family in Poland send us money -- send my father money so he could exist. </sentence><sentence id="451">And my father said to me, "And you do the same with mother." </sentence><sentence id="452">And I said [indecipherable] gave me all the details, he described the waiter, and said, "He said he would help you. </sentence><sentence id="453">And have twice the money." </sentence><sentence id="454">So my mother and I packed up huge boxes, and send them to my father in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="455">They did not get there, they took out all the valuables, but I do have my things that -- from my grandmother, and pictures, and all that really survived by going to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="456">My mother and I got on the train, the train that we knew he would be on. </sentence><sentence id="457">We went into a compartment of people who were -- turn out to be some Jews, and there was one young man that had a shaved head. </sentence><sentence id="458">He had already been to a camp, and they let him out and said, "If we catch you again, you're dead." </sentence><sentence id="459">And they had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="460">Nobody had any place to go, and I couldn't tell them what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="461">I felt like a traitor, but I wasn't going to say, because there's no way that many could be under tables. </sentence><sentence id="462">We went to the dining car, and I spotted the waiter, and I s -- I -- sit in front of me -- I had the menu in front of me, and I spoke to him, and I said, "I have twice the money, you promised my father." </sentence><sentence id="463">I identified myself. </sentence><sentence id="464">And he said to me, "Don't speak to me, I'm being watched." </sentence><sentence id="465">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="466">So here were my

</sentence><sentence id="478">It took five weeks of unbelievable things. </sentence><sentence id="479">We were caught five times. </sentence><sentence id="480">There was ice and snow. </sentence><sentence id="481">My mother had a 105 temperature. </sentence><sentence id="482">And we used to walk like half the night through the woods, and then be caught and sent back.

catch us, but then the man came on his mot -- on a bicycle, and he caught us. </sentence><sentence id="565">We once made it to no man's land, to a -- we had walked all night, and [had to go to the

</sentence><sentence id="590">There was a woman searching women, and a man searching men all over the body. </sentence><sentence id="591">And then he took us -- we had to walk about three hours through the night, in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="592">And then he picked us up in cars without lights, and we drove for two hours without lights, at night. </sentence><sentence id="593">And then we drove into Antwerp, and he delivered us. </sentence><sentence id="594">I went into hiding for two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="595">I couldn't -- I was afraid to go in the street.

scared to death. </sentence><sentence id="602">I was real brave until we got to Antwerp, and then I be -- I just let loose. </sentence><sentence id="603">And after two weeks of not leaving the place, my parents made me go to a movie with them. </sentence><sentence id="604">What they didn't know is there was a Communist giving a speech for the movie, and I was so afraid, because you get so afraid
