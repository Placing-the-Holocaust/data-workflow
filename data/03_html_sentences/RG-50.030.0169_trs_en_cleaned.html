<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Oh yes, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="128">As a matter of fact the immediate reason for the uh request by General Eisenhower for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain to be dispatched immediately to the European theater, was because there was some kind of a problem that could have become a uh cause-celebre. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh a Jewish soldier had had been killed in a uh motor, Army motor motor vehicle accident and since there was no American Army Jewish chaplain at the time, the uh rabbi in Belfast, Rabbi , was asked whether he would officiate at the funeral service, the burial service for this Jewish soldier. </sentence><sentence id="130">And he was very quick to respond of course he would be pleased to oblige, but he said that he would insist that this Jewish soldier be buried in a Jewish cemetery as is provided for by Jewish law, and he even offered to provide a grave in the cemetery of his congregation in Belfast. </sentence><sentence id="131">The Army authorities told him that according to Army regulations, every American Army soldier overseas who would have to be buried in a foreign, in foreign soil, would have to be buried in an American Army, a military cemetery because after the war would be over, the remains of these soldiers, at the request of their families, would be returned to the United States, would be returned home. </sentence><sentence id="132">The Irish rabbi said that he, he could not officiate under those circumstances, and since the military were concerned for the feelings and the good opinion of the civilian population, uh the American military authorities saw the need immediately for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="133">Hence the request for such a chaplain and therefore I was dispatched. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: Well, uh I uh I found that the Army had planned uh fully as to what to do with any survivors who might be found in German concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="570">There had been set up a combined displaced persons executive, which was a large office staffed by a number of officers. </sentence><sentence id="571">There was a general who was in charge, General Nicholson. </sentence><sentence id="572">Uh this combined DP executive was under the general command of uh the G5 on General Eisenhower's staff, General Adcock (ph), and they were doing a good job in following the plans that had been prepared a long time before. </sentence><sentence id="573">Those plans said simply that the survivors found in German concentration camps should be quickly sent back to the lands of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="574">And indeed French and, and Belgian and Greek and other nationals found in the concentration camps within ninety days were sent back to their homelands. </sentence><sentence id="575">But what the planners had not thought of was number one there would be German Jews and Austrian Jews and Hungarian Jews who came from countries that were considered enemy countries by the American Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy nationalists to be found in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="576">The irony was that the Germans, the Hungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived these Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian citizenship, but now they were given that citizenship again because to do otherwise would be to follow the practice of of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="577">And so they were enemy nationalists. </sentence><sentence id="578">That was one problem. </sentence><sentence id="579">The second problem was, and this was a far greater problem, the planners, the military planners had never contemplated the possibility that there would be survivors who were, who would be Jews who would refuse to return to the lands of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="580">Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="581">Ukrainian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="582">Lithuanian, Estonian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="583">Uh Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="584">Romanian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="585">Because they knew that their homes, their businesses that they once had had in their lands of origin had been seized by their erstwhile neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="586">They knew also that in many cases their former non-Jewish neighbors had cooperated with the Nazis in turning in their Jewish neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="587">Indeed in helping the Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to death camps. </sentence><sentence id="588">They knew that it would be dangerous even to return to the lands of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="589">They were concerned less their neighbors now in possession of Jewish homes and businesses attack them, as indeed happened. </sentence><sentence id="590">Moreover, psychologically these Jews, survivors of German concentration camps, knew that the very land, the very soil where they had once lived was now a soil that absorbed the blood of their children and their parents and their spouses. </sentence><sentence id="591">That the very air was polluted with the smoke of the crematoria where Jews had been burned. </sentence><sentence id="592">They had no desire to return to the lands from which they had come. </sentence><sentence id="593">Now it was the problems of these Jews in particular that had not been thought of in advance. </sentence><sentence id="594">Therefore the Army indeed did not take care properly of these Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="595">It This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="596">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="597"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 wasn't until the 22nd of August when General Eisenhower issued an order that the Army take care of these survivors and that so-called enemy nationals who were Jewish and who had suffered under the Nazis should be taken care of as victims of the Nazis, that the whole situation was turned around. </sentence><sentence id="598">And a part of that turning around of the situation involved my being ordered to take on the duties of visiting these camps, seeing what the conditions were, bringing back my reports to General Eisenhower or in his absence to his Chief of Staff, General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence><sentence id="599">And to recommend changes in whatever conditions had to be changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

were in the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="679">Some had volunteered to come because of their sympathy with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="680">Well, now these foreign workers were also displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="681">They claimed the status of displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="682">And their housing that had been used for them was now being used by Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="683">And I thought the conditions in, in Feldafing were deplorable. </sentence><sentence id="684">And I wondered how bad could the conditions be elsewhere if Feldafing had been praised by Dean Harrison as a model DP camp. </sentence><sentence id="685">I found out why Harrison praised Feldafing, and that was because Feldafing at that time was almost unique in that it was an all-Jewish camp. </sentence><sentence id="686">Now other camps where Jewish survivors were being housed were camps where non-Jews were also being housed. </sentence><sentence id="687">Who were these non-Jews? </sentence><sentence id="688">They were the foreign workers I mentioned a moment ago. </sentence><sentence id="689">In many cases they were sympathetic to the Jews, but in most cases they were anti-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="690">Many of them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi cause, had volunteered to come as workers to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="691">Moreover they had been fed well and housed well and clothed well, all through the years of the war and what the Jewish survivors of concentration camps required was not what they needed. </sentence><sentence id="692">And to give the Jews in the camps where they were housed with the non-Jews special treatment, more food than the others got, better clothing than the others had gotten, more medical attention than the others received, would be unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="693">It would, it could create riots, that the Jews were getting special treatment. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="694">Never mind that the Jews needed the special attention. </sentence><sentence id="695">It was the Jews who had suffered under the Nazi severely in the concentration camps, not the foreign workers. </sentence><sentence id="696">But it was an impossible situation. </sentence><sentence id="697">So what Dean Harrison had recommended was that camps should be set up with Feldafing as a model, that is they should be all Jewish camps and they should have a Jewish committee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the camps, whether it would be uh a military group or an company or workers from the Joint Distribution Committee who were by now being permitted to come into Germany, and to work in the camps, and General Eisenhower in that famous order of his of August 22nd also ordered that camps be made available for Jews alone, that non-Jews be removed from those camps and sent back as quickly as possible to the homelands from which they had come. </sentence><sentence id="698">And that was a great step forward because that permitted additional special treatment for Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="699">And when I came back to headquarters in Frankfurt, and I uh made my first recommendations, first orally to General Nicholson (ph), General Adcock and very quickly to General uh General Walter Beetle Smith, Eisenhower's Chief of Staff, later to be Ambassador of the United States to the Soviet Union and Secretary of State, my first reports included a number of recommendations. </sentence><sentence id="700">One with regard to the crowding, that more and better housing be obtained. </sentence><sentence id="701">Uh secondly, with regard to food, uh two thousand calories a day which was an improvement over what the Jews in the camps had gotten earlier under the American Army treatment, that two thousand calories a day was not sufficient to build up people who had been suffering from malnutrition for years. </sentence><sentence id="702">In addition, the two thousand calories did not provide sufficient nutrition. </sentence><sentence id="703">The diet was not a balanced diet. </sentence><sentence id="704">And I made another recommendation that was of vital importance to the Jews in the camps in Bavaria, including Feldafing. </sentence><sentence id="705">Namely, that they saw that their camps were surrounded by barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="706">Uh that irritated them to no end because in the concentration camps under the Nazis, their camps had also been surrounded by barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="707">Moreover, under the orders of General Patton, a pass system existed in each camp under which no more than a certain percentage of Jews in the </sentence></p><p><sentence

for a certain number of hours. </sentence><sentence id="712">The Jews in the camps looked out and saw Germans who were, were the enemies of the Americans, Germans who had placed them in concentration camps, walking freely on the roads, on the highways. </sentence><sentence id="713">They were not behind barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="714">They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass to walk around freely. </sentence><sentence id="715">They, the Jews, who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were still behind barbed wire and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the DP camp. </sentence><sentence id="716">Well, uh I must say that uh General Eisenhower acted quickly on all these recommendations. </sentence><sentence id="717">Orders were done quickly to General Patton to correct these situations and I had a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one instance if not in others, the orders were not carried out by General Patton. </sentence><sentence id="718">Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's orders beginning with his August 22nd initial order correcting the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of command, the situation for Jewish survivors in Germany would have changed radically quickly. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="719">Unfortunately there was a wide gap between the headquarters in Frankfurt and the military units dealing with the Jewish displaced persons, and with all the intermediary levels through which the orders had to pass, including General Patton's headquarters in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="720">And so, for example, when I went back again on my second trip to Bavaria, the Jews complained to me that the barbed wire still existed. </sentence><sentence id="721">The pass system had not been changed, and when I came back to Frankfurt, I reported that to General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence><sentence id="722">Soon afterwards I came into the anteroom to General Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's headquarters, to his office, and I saw General Patton sitting in the anteroom at eight o'clock in the morning when the Army day began in Germany, and I knew that I must be the reason for his being there. </sentence><sentence id="723">I had reported that he had not carried out Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal of the pass system and the barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="724">I saw him sitting there with his pearl-handled pistols, one on each side of him, with his shiny helmet and boots. </sentence><sentence id="725">He glared at me with distaste and I beat a quick diplomatic retreat out of the office. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="726">Later General Smith told me that what had happened was that when he had reported to Eisenhower that I had said that Patton had not carried out the orders about the removal of the barbed wire and the pass system, Eisenhower had instructed General Smith to call General Patton to have him report the following morning at eight o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="727">General Patton had to ride overnight from Munich to Frankfurt to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when General Eisenhower saw him, General Eisenhower said to Patton after reminding him of the barbed wire and the pass system and his not carrying out Eisenhower's orders with regard to them, General Eisenhower asked him, George, why don't you do something for these Jews? </sentence><sentence id="728">And General Patton replied thinking that he was talking to his buddy, his close friend with whom he had gone to school at West Point, he replied uh Eisenhower, in a jocular way, well, why the hell should I. And Eisenhower lost his temper, which he normally kept under control, and retorted, well, God damn it, if for no other reason than because I have ordered you to. </sentence><sentence id="729">Now shortly after that General Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army and was given the command of the 15th Army, with headquarters at Bad Nauheim (ph). </sentence><sentence id="730">I don't know why that happened, but the 15th Army was only a paper Army. </sentence><sentence id="731">It consisted of no troops, only of the headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="732">The general story as uh told by newspaper correspondents, the war correspondents and by the movie about General Patton, was that he had slapped a soldier in a military hospital in Sicily, charging him with malingering. </sentence><sentence id="733">But the question asks itself, why should Eisenhower have waited so long to punish Patton for something that had happened a long time before. </sentence><sentence id="734">I'm not saying that this incident of the barbed wire and pass system were the immediate cause of Patton's demotion, but I'm guessing that it may have played some part in it.

found them in various places in Germany and later when I went into the American zone of Austria and I soon gradually came to be a kind of a communications factor in their operations. </sentence><sentence id="743">Scattered as they were in different areas of Germany and Austria, it was very difficult for them to communicate with each other. </sentence><sentence id="744">It was impossible for them to give reports to a representative of the Jewish agency in London. </sentence><sentence id="745">At this particular time is was Mosha (ph) , later Mosha (ph) .

and psychically. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And that was because of their strength and their will and their determination that they were able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1012">We talked until two o'clock in the morning, until we both fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1013">In the morning I took him, after the train landed, after the train arrived in, in uh Frankfurt, I took him first to uh be registered, to be signed in, to the American Army mess. </sentence><sentence id="1014">We had breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Then I took him to General Eisenhower's suite of offices. </sentence><sentence id="1016">General Eisenhower was not there at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1017">He was on a field trip. </sentence><sentence id="1018">But I introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, saying General Smith, if there were a Jewish state now, I would be introducing the prime minister of that state. </sentence><sentence id="1019">That was uh no great feat on my part. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Of course Ben Gurion was the leading Jew of the Jewish community and it was a foregone conclusion that if there were to be a Jewish state, he would be at its head. </sentence><sentence id="1021">I was later told by General Smith that when he introduced him to General Eisenhower, that General Eisenhower was greatly impressed by this man, Ben Gurion, and that he reported to General Smith that he was very much taken by him. </sentence><sentence id="1022">He asked Ben Gurion to visit the camps and of course Ben Gurion had come for that purpose, and to report to General Eisenhower upon his findings after his tour would be over. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Well after I had introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, and we had had lunch, I took uh David Ben Gurion to his first DP camp, to Zilesheim (ph), which was not far from Frankfurt, near the German town ofH___. </sentence><sentence id="1024">In Zilesheim--I would come often because it was close to Frankfurt--the people there were accustomed to my coming in with an American Army vehicle, and a number of them saw me come in this time too. </sentence><sentence id="1025">A few of them came over to say hello. </sentence><sentence id="1026">They happened to peer inside my car in the back seat and they saw something that was incredible to them. </sentence><sentence id="1027">They knew the picture of Ben Gurion, but they couldn't by the wildest stretch of their imagination imagine that he would be there in their camp in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1028">They began to scream "Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion. </sentence><sentence id="1029">As others heard the shouts, they came running, and I was afraid of a riot and I cried out, my friends, please show Ben Gurion the discipline of which you are capable. </sentence><sentence id="1030">You go around and tell all the people in the camp that David Ben Gurion is here and that he will speak to them. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Let them come to the assembly hall. </sentence><sentence id="1032">They ran. </sentence><sentence id="1033">They gathered up the people who were there. </sentence><sentence id="1034">They came to the

the windows and the doors. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And I came out to introduce Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="1038">As the two of us came on the stage, the large throng of people rose and the people began to sing the Hatikvah (ph) and as they sang the Hatikvah, many of them burst into weeping. </sentence><sentence id="1039">And I must confess that Eisenhower...that David Ben Gurion and I also wept for the Jews in that assembly hall. </sentence><sentence id="1040">At that moment, that DP camp, their liberation was complete. </sentence><sentence id="1041">They had dreamed most of them of some day getting to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Here, in the form of Ben Gurion, Palestine had come to them. </sentence><sentence id="1043">The Nazi nightmare was ended. </sentence><sentence id="1044">They were free. </sentence><sentence id="1045">They were now in touch with their brothers in . </sentence><sentence id="1046">And when the weeping subsided, Ben Gurion spoke to them, movingly. </sentence><sentence id="1047">He continued to break down and the Jews listening continued to sob. </sentence><sentence id="1048">It was one of the most moving experiences in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And to my dying day, I shall not forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1050">He then asked to meet with the leaders of the committee chosen by the residents of

go either to the United States or Canada or to South America or to Australia and he he also wanted to know the answer to an important question that he put to them. </sentence><sentence id="1061">I knew it was a test question. </sentence><sentence id="1062">He said to them, if we of the Jewish agency were to issue an order that on a certain day all the Jews in the DP camps of Germany should march out of those camps, march across borders to ports in southern Italy, would you follow such a command, knowing that you would be ordered by the American military to return to your camps, that you would be shot at by perhaps by Italian border police, that it might cost you your lives? </sentence><sentence id="1063">Would you follow such an order? </sentence><sentence id="1064">And to a man they answered, give the order. </sentence><sentence id="1065">We will follow it. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Ben Gurion told me afterwards he was extremely pleased by the metal of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1067">His first meeting with survivors, and he saw what they were like. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Unhappily, I could not accompany him on the rest of his tour of DP camps

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1168">Q: What did you do then? </sentence><sentence id="1169">Where... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1172">A: Well uh, Ben Gurion went on his way to cover the major DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I went to the railroad station to meet Judge Rifkin who was arriving on the military train from Paris, and later I learned that when Ben Gurion came back, and I saw him again when he came back to Army headquarters in Frankfurt before he departed, he gave General Eisenhower, as the general had requested, a report on his findings. </sentence><sentence id="1174">He requested certain things that the Jewish DPs had asked of me which I knew could not happen. </sentence><sentence id="1175">For example, he asked that the Jews be taken out of the DP camps, that whole German villages should be requisitioned for them, that the German occupants of the housing in those villages be evicted, and that the, the Jewish displaced persons be brought to take the houses of the Germans evicted from their homes in these villages. </sentence><sentence id="1176">I knew that would be turned down by Eisenhower, and I myself never made that recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Ben Gurion did. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And Eisenhower turned it down. </sentence><sentence id="1179">But another request by Eisenhower was honored by Eisen...another request by Ben Gurion to Eisenhower was honored by the general. </sentence><sentence id="1180">He asked that teams of Jews from the then called Palestine be permitted to enter the DP camps to serve on the staffs of those administering the camps, people, JDC people, to be of help to the Jews in these camps in several ways. </sentence><sentence id="1181">To teach them agriculture so that they would be able to become farmers when they would eventually arrive in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1182">To teach them Hebrew so that they could speak the language of the Jews of Palestine before they got there and other similar tasks. </sentence><sentence id="1183">And Eisenhower indeed agreed to that request, and Jews were brought from Palestine and brought into the camps to serve these functions and any other functions that they had in mind. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And of course they prepared the Jews in these camps for the eventual immigration from the camps to Palestine. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1209">What was he like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1210">A: I'm glad you asked that question. </sentence><sentence id="1211">Uh General Eisenhower, I learned years later when he received an honorary degree at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, spoke of the fact that he and his brothers were raised by their mother on the stories of what he called the Old Testament, and he grew up believing that the Jews were indeed the chosen people. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And that they were the first to bring to humanity the divine message of ethics and morality. </sentence><sentence id="1213">I got to know him through the humanitarian approach that he took to the improvement of the Jewish survivors in the DP camps in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1214">At the very beginning he cut through what was a gordion (ph) knot with which generals at American Army headquarters were wrestling for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1215">The gordion knot consisted of the old question, who are the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1216">A question that has been given much attention by scholars of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="1217">Are the Jews a nation? </sentence><sentence id="1218">Are they a religious grouping?Are they arace? </sentence><sentence id="1219">Are they a people? </sentence><sentence id="1220">On the one hand it was argued that the Jews could not be given special attention in the DP camps because you couldn't look upon them as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1221">There were either German nationals or Austrian nationals or Polish nationals or Czech nationals. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And if you were to look upon them as Jews and deprive them of their nationality, were you not doing the same thing that the Nazis had done, of robbing them of their citizenship, and looking upon them as a racial group. </sentence><sentence id="1223">On the other hand, how could you help them if you did not look upon them as a special separate group. </sentence><sentence id="1224">Well, Eisenhower cut through that gordion knot and when he received these several communications from Washington, from General Marshall, from Secretary Stimpson, and I must stress from President Truman, that the situation must be corrected, Eisenhower at once made up his mind he was going to stop with all of this argument, all of this debate, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate group. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And German Jews and Austrian Jews and Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy nationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to go back to their homelands, they were to be treated as a special group, given special help, brought back to the level of ordinary common place health of human beings and because he did that, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1226">He came to speak at the Park Avenue Synagogue at my invitation in May of 1965. </sentence><sentence id="1227">By that time he had been President of the United States, and he was living in Gettysburg. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I telephoned him and I asked him would he come to speak at a special service at my synagogue commemorating the 20th anniversary of the liberation of the German concentration camps by the American Army under his command. </sentence><sentence id="1229">He agreed to come. </sentence><sentence id="1230">In introducing him to my congregation, I said to them, I want to tell you one story about this man which will be sufficient to tell you about his character, his humanitarianism, and his answer to the difficult Jewish problem. </sentence><sentence id="1231">I said when we, when the German arm...when the American Army liberated the concentration camps in Germany, there were definitions of who was a displaced person. </sentence><sentence id="1232">Who was a displaced person who would benefit from housing, food, clothing and all the rest under the aegis of the American Army. </sentence><sentence id="1233">The displaced person was defined as a survivor, in this case particularly a Jewish survivor, liberated in a concentration camp on German soil. </sentence><sentence id="1234">But soon there came into the American zone of Germany, other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1235">Jews who had been in hiding in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Jews who had been shoved back by the Russians behind the front lines, all the way back to Siberia, an action that actually saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Now these This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1238">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1239"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 Jews came back in large numbers from Siberia to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1240">They found that their homes and their businesses could not be reclaimed. </sentence><sentence id="1241">They discovered that their loved ones had been murdered by the Nazis and the Polish or Ukrainian or Lithuanian helpers and they no longer wanted to try to make out, to make a new life where they had originally lived. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And spontaneously they started a trek from Poland to the American zone of Germany, later organized and assisted by the men and women of the Brichah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1279">Q: How did Eisenhower react to this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1281">A: Ah, this is a major point that I wanted to make. </sentence><sentence id="1282">When these Jews started coming across the borders to enter the American zone of Germany, Eisenhower was asked by the commanders on lower levels, what shall we do with these refugees who are coming into our zone in such large numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1283">I was asked for a recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="1284">The recommendation of course was that they be admitted into the DP camps in the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1285">General Eisenhower approved that recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Eighty thousand Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one order of approval, contributed to the saving of eighty thousand Jewish lives. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Now my friendship with him continued after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I was asked to help write items of interest in his campaign for the presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah message during the campaign. </sentence><sentence id="1289">My wife and I were invited to the Inauguration. </sentence><sentence id="1290">Before that time I was invited to give an invocation at the Republican National Convention that had that had nominated him. </sentence><sentence id="1291">I had him at my synagogue, but before that I had visited him at Gettysburg at his farm, so we remained in close contact all through the years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1303">Q: How did Eisenhower, did you and Eisenhower at the time you made this recommendation, did you talk to him face to face? </sentence><sentence id="1304">What did he say to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: I did not in most instances have the opportunity of speaking to him face to face. </sentence><sentence id="1308">I did often. </sentence><sentence id="1309">I did have the privilege of coming to his office, speaking to him face to face, most of the times answering his questions. </sentence><sentence id="1310">When he was not in his office, and that was, that occurred frequently, he would be out on a field trip, then my conversations were with the second in command, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1315">Q: Did Eisenhower ever talk to you about the Jews and his feelings about Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1317">A: I did have occasion to hear such remarks from Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="1318">He always spoke in an affirmative fashion. </sentence><sentence id="1319">He always condemned every kind of bigotry and prejudice. </sentence><sentence id="1320">He hated what the Nazis had done. </sentence><sentence id="1321">He issued orders, after he had first visited Dachau, that American military commanders should bring their units to see Dachau so that the troops might know what they had been fighting against. </sentence><sentence id="1322">He visited Feldafing on Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there, told them of his high admiration for them, for the Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them to keep their hope high, that they still had a future. </sentence><sentence id="1323">Eisenhower was that kind of personality. </sentence></p></dialogue>

among the Jews in the camps, to tell them that he was the person for them to speak to afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I returned to the United States on a troop transport and uh I came back to the United States at the end of November, beginning of December in 1945.Before my return I had been visited at my headquarters in uh Frankfurt by uh Major Edward Warburg (ph) who was at that time the president of the Joint Distribution Committee, and he was good enough to invite me. </sentence><sentence id="1343">After I would be discharged from the Army, to become a member of the staff of the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="1344">He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC operations in Germany, after I would spend at least a month or so with my family back home. </sentence><sentence id="1345">But I returned to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Soon afterwards I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the Joint Distribution Committee in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1347">I was full of vehement indignation at what I had seen. </sentence><sentence id="1348">I had, I contrasted that with what I had found among American Jews when I returned. </sentence><sentence id="1349">There was very little awareness among American Jews of what had happened to their fellow Jews in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1350">Very few were aware of it, and very few were concerned about it, naturally, because they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1351">So I was angry and at my uh, I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the JDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked to give an address the following week at the annual meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take place in Atlantic City where an unheard of goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to be raised during 1946 among the Jews of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1352">Of course I uh accepted the invitation. </sentence><sentence id="1353">I addressed the UJA Conference in Atlantic City the following week, and I was asked the next morning to have breakfast with the leaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at that conference, and at the breakfast table I was told that I was being relieved of the employment I was to have with the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="1354">Instead I was asked to accept employment with the United Jewish Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred million dollar campaign from which of course the JDC would be receiving its funds. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And I agreed and for the next six months I spoke in forty different states of the country. </sentence><sentence id="1356">I had no place I could call my home. </sentence><sentence id="1357">I just went from town to town, city to city, and spoke at UJA fund raising meetings. </sentence><sentence id="1358">According to the calculations that I kept myself, some $20,000,000 were raised at those meetings. </sentence><sentence id="1359">The JDC then asked me to return to Europe, to visit the DP camps in Germany, Austria, Italy, once again to bring myself up to date on what had happened and then to go to South Africa where I was to spend four months in South Africa, what were then called Southern and Northern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and Zambia, and to raise funds there for the South African Jewish War Appeal, the agency that then transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution Committee for work among the Jewish survivors in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1360">I spent a brief while in America. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I met the young lady at that time to whom I became engaged after three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1362">Sadly I departed on my
