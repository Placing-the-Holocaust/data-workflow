<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: Well, they were I suppose I should say difficult weeks for a person who had never known anything about the military. </sentence><sentence id="65">My father hadn't even allowed me to be a Boy Scout because he was afraid I might like, I might like military things and uh get to like to wearing a uniform and marching. </sentence><sentence id="66">Uh my father you can see was uh a pacifist and indeed uh he was more than that. </sentence><sentence id="67">He was a member of the , and that was the first Jewish school that I went to at the age of four, the Schula (ph). </sentence><sentence id="68">Uh but uh those first days and weeks at uh Fort Bragg were days of learning. </sentence><sentence id="69">Uh learning a totally new world. </sentence><sentence id="70">And so, for example, the very first day that I arrived, I knew that I was supposed to report to the Commanding General. </sentence><sentence id="71">I went to his office, knocked on the door. </sentence><sentence id="72">I hear a "come in". </sentence><sentence id="73">I walked in and not knowing that I should do anything differently, I walked up to his desk where he was seated, and uh put out my hand to shake hands with him. </sentence><sentence id="74">And uh he looked at me with a smile on his face, and uh he was a very kind and compassionate man he said chaplain, we don't do things that way in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="75">Now what you will do is you go out, come back in again. </sentence><sentence id="76">As soon as you're inside the door, you come to attention and salute, and say, Chaplain Nadich reporting for duty, sir. </sentence><sentence id="77">I uh was shame- faced, but I walked out of the room, knocked on the door again, came back into the room, did exactly as he had told me, and from that point on, he took me in hand. </sentence><sentence id="78">He uh got hold of a young officer and told him to spend the next day with me, to teach me about military courtesy, the courtesies of the service, and how to march in a military parade, for the very next day I was to march in a military parade behind the commanding general as a member of his staff. </sentence><sentence id="79">Well, I, fortunately I learned quickly and so uh it wasn't long before I was a regular member of the Army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: What were the circumstances that uh sent you overseas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Ah. </sentence><sentence id="99">I was at Fort Bragg for only seventy days, when I received orders to report to Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, New York, for overseas shipment to Army Post Office, APO 887. </sentence><sentence id="100">I quickly ascertained that APO 887 was London. </sentence><sentence id="101">And I was rather pleased to go to that part of the world. </sentence><sentence id="102">I proceeded to Fort uh Hamilton in Brooklyn and after waiting for ten days, I was shipped by uh bya uh Dutch freighter which was a part of a convoy of 55 ships and after sailing 24 days on the high seas, uh the convoy reached Liverpool. </sentence><sentence id="103">I learned afterwards, incidentally, that uh another chaplain who had far more experience than I, who had been in the Army Reserve in peace time, uh was first asked to go and he thought better of it. </sentence><sentence id="104">He declined and I was tapped as the next man, and I was glad to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: So you landed... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: We landed in Liverpool. </sentence><sentence id="115">I reported as I had been instructed to do at Cheltham (ph) which was our service of supply headquarters, and after a day or two in Cheltham and going through the uh routine, the red tape, I was assigned to the northern, the northern Ireland Bay Section which was located just outside the city of Belfast. </sentence><sentence id="116">The reason for my being sent there, since I was the first Jewish chaplain ordered to the European theater, was because our first American troops were stationed in Northern Ireland, and an armored headquarters, a corps headquarters, and uh two infantry divisions, and I immediately began visiting every camp, every military camp to search out Jewish soldiers and officers, and to arrange for services and for whatever, whatever other service I could render to the soldiers of Jewish faith. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: You had told me at lunch something about the particular way in which you solved a burial... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Oh yes, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="123">As a matter of fact the immediate reason for the uh request by General Eisenhower for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain to be dispatched immediately to the European theater, was because there was some kind of a problem that could have become a uh cause-celebre. </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh a Jewish soldier had had been killed in a uh motor, Army motor motor vehicle accident and since there was no American Army Jewish chaplain at the time, the uh rabbi in Belfast, Rabbi , was asked whether he would officiate at the funeral service, the burial service for this Jewish soldier. </sentence><sentence id="125">And he was very quick to respond of course he would be pleased to oblige, but he said that he would insist that this Jewish soldier be buried in a Jewish cemetery as is provided for by Jewish law, and he even offered to provide a grave in the cemetery of his congregation in Belfast. </sentence><sentence id="126">The Army authorities told him that according to Army regulations, every American Army soldier overseas who would have to be buried in a foreign, in foreign soil, would have to be buried in an American Army, a military cemetery because after the war would be over, the remains of these soldiers, at the request of their families, would be returned to the United States, would be returned home. </sentence><sentence id="127">The Irish rabbi said that he, he could not officiate under those circumstances, and since the military were concerned for the feelings and the good opinion of the civilian population, uh the American military authorities saw the need immediately for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="128">Hence the request for such a chaplain and therefore I was dispatched. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: . </sentence><sentence id="137">How long were you in Ireland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Uh I was in Ireland for approximately, well say August to November, and uh I I was uh ordered from Ireland to England uh when uh I appeared at the various camps one uh fine morning to visit the troops, and to my amazement the camps were empty. </sentence><sentence id="141">I did not know where the troops had gone, but later I learned they had been shipped of course secretly for the invasion of North Africa. </sentence><sentence id="142">Soon after that I was ordered to England and since I was still the only free, that is non-assigned to a division, Jewish chaplain, I was ordered to the American Military Cemetery at Brookwood in Surry, not far from London, and I was uh stationed with the American detachment uh who took care of burials at their uh quarters in the town of Wilking (ph). </sentence><sentence id="143">We actually occupied a a small inn in Wilking. </sentence><sentence id="144">At the cemetery I would officiate at all Jewish funerals on Mondays and Thursdays. </sentence><sentence id="145">The other days of the week, I would get a military vehicle and a driver from southern base headquarters in Salisbury, and cover one slice of England. </sentence><sentence id="146">I had carved up England into various slices so that I would be able to visit each area once a month. </sentence><sentence id="147">In each Army headquarters or hospital, I would find a Jewish officer or non-commissioned officer or private who would know how to conduct a Jewish service, give him prayer books and other religious supplies, have him conduct the services each week, but I would show up once a month to uh be of help, to conduct a monthly service, and to help with any problems that might arise. </sentence><sentence id="148">As more Jewish chaplains arrived in the United Kingdom, I would assign them to take parts of England or, and Scotland, and thus my own territory would be decreased as time went on. </sentence><sentence id="149">But I went as far as Glasgow and again to Belfast, and in all parts of England and to some parts of Wales. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: How long did this go on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Uh this uh continued for about a year while I was stationed in Surry, near London, and then for the second year I was stationed in London proper uh at American Army Headquarters uh in London uh at uh at or near Grosvenor (ph) Square. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: And what did you do from a </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: And there I was uh a chaplain in the office of the theater chaplain, who was a Roman Catholic monsignor, . </sentence><sentence id="167">His deputy was an Episcopalian chaplain, Edwin Carter, Jr., uh known familiarly as Nick Carter, and I was the uh the one Jewish chaplain at theater headquarters, and I was given the assignment of uh G3 (c) that is I was in charge of all religious supplies there and later on in France. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: What did it mean to be in charge of religious supplies? </sentence><sentence id="169">What are some of the things you had to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Uh well uh I recall particularly in France where my job was more difficult, uh that I had to uh obtain for Catholic chaplains, mass kits for example, and uh hymnals, and hymnals as well for Protestant chaplains. </sentence><sentence id="173">Uh I had to uh visit uh vineyards (ph) who had been approved by the local French Catholic bishop, uh that is whose wine was approved for, for use in mass, and I would uh taste the various wines to make sure that I got a good tasting wine for my friends who were uh Catholic chaplains, and I would uh buy the uh the wines for Catholic mass, and I supplied uh Protestant and Catholic chaplains and Jewish chaplains with all of their needs. </sentence><sentence id="174">Even going so far as to supply New Testaments in German for German prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="175">That I got a special kick out of, that a rabbi should be supplying German prisoners of war with New Testaments in German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="181">How did you get from England to Paris? </sentence><sentence id="182">What were the circumstances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Well, from England to Paris, uh I was uh flown over in a small plane together with a number of other officers, and we landed on an air strip in Normandy. </sentence><sentence id="187">The uh German troops and uh I told you were not that far away, and indeed as our plane landed on the air strip in Normandy uh Ger...German artillery began shelling the air strip. </sentence><sentence id="188">We were asked to uh leave the plane as quickly as possible and to run for cover, and uh of course I followed orders very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="189">And uh in the process I lost a brand new officer's trench coat that I had just purchased in London before departure for France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: You took up duties in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="196">What was your role in Paris? </sentence><sentence id="197">What was your title and what was your role? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Ah, in in Paris I was uh, my title was Deputy to the Theater Chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="202">Not the senior deputy. </sentence><sentence id="203">That was still Nick Carter. </sentence><sentence id="204">But I was deputy to the senior chaplain in the theater to the theater chaplain, Father Terrnand (ph) for Jewish affairs, so that when a new Jewish chaplain would arrive from the States, I was to assign him to his new location. </sentence><sentence id="205">Uh I was still uh G3, distributing religious supplies, and I was a Jewish chaplain at that time, in the beginning the only Jewish chaplain uh in the area, and of course we moved uh after the breakthrough at St. Lowe (ph) we moved into Paris as Paris was captured. </sentence><sentence id="206">In Paris | first met with the the survivors in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="207">Uh and uh my position there was to be of immediate help to the survivors because for most of them I was the first contact they had with the Jewish community outside. </sentence><sentence id="208">And I was a signal to them that uh the American Jewish community was there, at least in the person of this one rabbi, this one chaplain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Can you describe it? </sentence><sentence id="218">Describe your first meeting with a, with the group of survivors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Uh, my first meeting with the survivors happened in a rather interesting way. </sentence><sentence id="222">I uh took a jeep and drove to the area where I had been told Jews had been living, the area known as the , the little place. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I flew my Jewish chaplain's flag from the jeep. </sentence><sentence id="224">Uh you may know that the uh Jewish chaplain's flag consisted of a dark blue background, and in the center there was the Jewish chaplain's insignia, consisting of the Ten Commandments, the two tablets of the Ten Commandments. </sentence><sentence id="225">Above the tablets, uh the uh six-pointed Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="226">It didn't take long before some people came out and recognized, of course, the Jewish symbols, and began to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="227">And they noticed on the lapels of my Army uh uniform the same insignia. </sentence><sentence id="228">And they began to ask me who I was, what was I doing there. </sentence><sentence id="229">It didn't take long before a crowd had assembled. </sentence><sentence id="230">And some of them thought I should talk to a small committee of Jewish leaders that had already been created to be of help to the Jewish survivors of Paris. </sentence><sentence id="231">Now where did these Jews come from who had survived the German occupation of Paris? </sentence><sentence id="232">Most of them had fled during the German occupation, or just prior to it, to the south of France where the Italians were in charge. </sentence><sentence id="233">The south of France was under Italian occupation. </sentence><sentence id="234">The Italians were never as rigid or severe in their governance of their territory as were the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="235">And so it was easier for a Jew to hide himself in the south of France, in the area under Italian orders. </sentence><sentence id="236">And so when the war was over and Paris was liberated, very quickly these Jews came back out of hiding from the south of France. </sentence><sentence id="237">There were a few who had indeed been hidden in Paris itself. </sentence><sentence id="238">And who had miraculously survived. </sentence><sentence id="239">Now I was brought to this committee that was meeting uh in a house that they had taken over as a Jewish community headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="240">And they uh spoke to me uh and told me of their problems and their needs. </sentence><sentence id="241">And among other things they quickly gave to me uh a batch of uh the yellow star that the Jews of France had to wear, on which of course was the French word , Jew. </sentence><sentence id="242">And uh I brought those yellow stars back to America. </sentence><sentence id="243">Uh but uh they told me that their immediate need was to open a soup kitchen or soup kitchens, uh that food was in short supply. </sentence><sentence id="244">They also would like to open they told me a free loan society. </sentence><sentence id="245">Uh I communicated with uh the uh Joint Distribution Committee in New York, through military channels, and I was cabled from the JDC but through the Jewish Welfare Board which was the only organization set up to deal with American Army Jewish chaplains. </sentence><sentence id="246">Through the JWB I received $10,000 from the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="247">That $10,000 was used by this committee of Jews in France to open the first soup kitchens in Paris and to start the first Jewish free loan society that would enable uh small Jewish shop keepers and artisans to start up work again. </sentence><sentence id="248">Uh that uh didn't end my uh relationship with the Jews who had survived. </sentence><sentence id="249">I met with the committee very often, until the JDC opened its own headquarters on the Rue de in Paris uh but throughout my year in Paris, every morning virtually, there were as many as thirty to thirty-five Jews, Parisian Jews or French Jews, who found themselves in Paris, who lined up in the hall outside of my Army office at the Hotel Majestique which was American Army headquarters in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="250">Each one of whom had his own story that he wanted to tell me, to communi...communicate with relatives, particularly relatives in America, to try to find relatives or problems of all kinds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: You told me about a very special service that you conducted (ah, yes) in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="284">Let's talk about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="288">One of the most thrilling experiences I had in Paris during that year was to uh play a part in the first service that was held after the liberation of Paris in what is called the Rothchild Synagogue on uh uh Rue de la Victoire (ph). </sentence><sentence id="289">Uh it's formal title is really the, La Grande Synagogue and that synagogue was packed with French Jews, many of whom were women wearing black. </sentence><sentence id="290">And with American Army soldiers, most of whom were still wearing battle dress, their helmets on their heads, battle uniforms, their guns left in the lobby of the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="291">And I had the great privilege of uh preaching in French and speaking afterwards in English and I remember to this day that as I would come to the end of a sentence or the end of a paragraph as I was speaking, and as I paused to draw my breath, I could hear the gentle sobbing, particularly of women in the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="292">My French address, my English address, each was punctuated by the crying of people in the congregation, and it was an experience that I shall never forget. </sentence><sentence id="293">They were crying for those who would never return to Paris, those who had been killed by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="294">They were crying for all that they had lost during the years of the German occupation of France. </sentence><sentence id="295">That was a very moving service. </sentence><sentence id="296">Nobody who attended it will ever forget it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="297">(SHORT PAUSE) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Somewhere after, while you were still in Paris, I believe you were ordered to go to a cere...a ceremony? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="300">UhI was ordered to appear as the representative of General Eisenhower at a ceremony for French martyrs who had been killed by the Nazis and who had been buried in a mass grave in a French cemetery just outside of Paris. </sentence><sentence id="301">Uh General DeGaulle was to be the principle speaker but General Eisenhower had been asked to send a representative and the order had come to the theater chaplain to dispatch a chaplain who could speak French. </sentence><sentence id="302">So I was told to go. </sentence><sentence id="303">And I went. </sentence><sentence id="304">And there was quite a crowd there and we were ready to start the ceremony when suddenly there was a tremendous noise of bullets and artillery shells flying around us, past us in all directions, and there was a great deal of screaming of course. </sentence><sentence id="305">Everybody there was certain that the Germans who at that time were not too far away from Paris, that the Germans must have returned. </sentence><sentence id="306">That they were surrounding the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="307">That their target was General DeGaulle, and incidentally anybody else who was there. </sentence><sentence id="308">And therefore all of the shooting. </sentence><sentence id="309">And I quickly dodged behind a tall monument, and a little bo...little French boy ran past me. </sentence><sentence id="310">I grabbed him and pulled him down beside me. </sentence><sentence id="311">He had become separated from his mother. </sentence><sentence id="312">He was crying, and I held him near me all throughout the uh shooting. </sentence><sentence id="313">When it suddenly got quiet again, all of us left the cemetery quickly. </sentence><sentence id="314">It was only the next day that I learned through the French press that what had happened was that on the railroad tracks just outside the cemetery, the Germans had left two carloads of ammunition, shells, bullets of all description, and spontaneous combustion had started this tremendous racket of all the bullets and shells being fired and uh we were just very fortunate that uh we weren't killed. </sentence><sentence id="315">I never got to give my uh carefully prepared talk in French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: What else were you doing in Paris at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Oh, uh I must tell you of something in which I took great pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="337">I, I mentioned earlier that I was in charge of all religious supplies for the American Army on the continent of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="338">And months before Passover I realized that we would need matzo (ph) for the American Jewish troops. </sentence><sentence id="339">And when I went to the Quartermaster General he informed me of course as ... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="340">END OF TAPE ...that but that uh if I could locate a matzoth factory in England I could order as much matzo as I wanted, that it would be charged on reverse-lend-lease, and he added since the British are not going to pay us in total (ph) anyhow, order as much matzo as you want. </sentence><sentence id="341">We'll charge it to reverse-lend-lease and the British will pay for it. </sentence><sentence id="342">I took him at his word. </sentence><sentence id="343">I gave that English matzo factory that I had discovered the largest order it had ever received. </sentence><sentence id="344">When the matzo came sailing across the Channel to Paris to me, it filled an entire liberty ship, which rode high in the waters of the English Channel and the matzo was delivered to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="345">I distributed it to all of the Jewish chaplains then serving with the American Army for further distribution to American Jewish troops, for the various Passover that would be held. </sentence><sentence id="346">Incidentally I held my Passover Seder for six thousand troops in the Lido in Paris, on the Champs d'Elysee, the largest nightclub in Paris, an odd place to have a seder but it worked out very well. </sentence><sentence id="347">No nightclub acts but a seder each night for three thousand soldiers, three thousand the first night, three thousand the second night of Passover. </sentence><sentence id="348">But I had a great deal of matzo left over, so I distributed it first to the Jews of Paris and I gave matzo to the Jewish chaplains with the free French troops, the free Czech soldiers, the free Polish Army, and distributed the rest of the matzo to Jewish civilians in France and Belgium because food, bread in part...in particular, was not easy to purchase. </sentence><sentence id="349">It couldn't be found in in any great measure, and matzo could be eaten not only during the eight days of Passover of course, but throughout the year. </sentence><sentence id="350">So that was my big order of matzo, and its distribution. </sentence><sentence id="351">Further when came and there was a need for and for palm branches used during the festival services of the Feast of Tabernacles, again the Quartermaster General obliged me by arranging to have it on reverse-lend-lease and the British again paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="352">And the uh and were purchased in what was then Palestine, flown to Egypt, an..by British planes, flown from Egypt to Paris, once again by British planes, and I had enough to distribute to all parts of the American Army wherever troops were located. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="353"> (SHORT PAUSE) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="355">You were in France for quite a while. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: I was in France for a year. ( </sentence><sentence id="357">Um-hum) And I traveled incidentally to uh all parts of northern France, Belgium, and eastern France to meet with the Jewish chaplains, particularly those serving with the uh front line infantry and armored force divisions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: What did you see as you traveled in the way of survivors, Jewish survivors, in France? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: Well, uh interestingly enough, in a number of French communities, small groups of Jews returned and the American Army Jewish chaplains did an extraordinary piece of work in helping them. </sentence><sentence id="363">Uh I think of Chaplain, the late Chaplain Isaac Kline (ph) in and many Jewish chaplains in various Jewish commun...in various Jewish communities in France who first brought the returning Jews the necessities of life-food, medical supplies, medical treatment through Army medical officers and the where-with-all, the necessities for daily living and then helped reconstruct the communities. </sentence><sentence id="364">Uh these Jewish chaplains would write back to their home communities, to their home synagogue and ask the members of their synagogues to collect clothing and children's toys and soap and various other items that would be needed by uh the beginnings of Jewish communities in different parts of France and Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="365">And the communities responded generously. </sentence><sentence id="366">Hundreds of packages would arrive for a single Jewish chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="367">And he would distribute the contents to the Jews in the community where he was. </sentence><sentence id="368">And Jewish chaplains went further. </sentence><sentence id="369">They helped rebuild synagogues and Jewish community centers so that Jewish communal life began once again in these communities, albeit with far fewer Jews than had been there before. </sentence><sentence id="370">This I witnessed as I traveled through various parts of especially of northern and eastern France and Belgium. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Was it at this time that you first met up with representatives of the Brichah (ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: Ah, I'm glad you asked that question. </sentence><sentence id="383">Uh I first met with the representatives of the Brichah when I was still stationed in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="384">And I was approached one day by one of them who came to my office at the American Army Headquarters, the Hotel Majestique, and who told me uh that he was involved with some other Jews from Palestine in helping to bring Jewish survivors to ports in southern France. </sentence><sentence id="385">He told me that other comrades of his were working elsewhere to bring Jewish survivors to ports in southern Italy. </sentence><sentence id="386">From these French and Italian ports, the plan was that these survivors would board ships and would be brought to the coast of Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="387">Now this was prohibited by the British who were still in control of Palestine, and so these ships were called illegal ships. </sentence><sentence id="388">This was called quote "illegal immigration" unquote, uh but these men and women were working to save Jewish lives. </sentence><sentence id="389">This particular man who came to my office in Paris told me that a group of a few hundred, he mentioned possibly as many as eight hundred, would be moved soon from a southern French port. </sentence><sentence id="390">Could I possibly help with getting food supplies because even had they the money, it would have been very difficult to buy food in France at that particular time in history. </sentence><sentence id="391">So I said I would inquire and find out what I could. </sentence><sentence id="392">At the Officers" Mess that evening, I spoke to an officer who was working at uh the Quartermaster General's office. </sentence><sentence id="393">I asked him if he could help me. </sentence><sentence id="394">He said as a matter of fact uh there was a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="395"> large supply that filled several warehouses in Paris of prisoner of war parcels that had been sent from the United States during the war that were to be shipped to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="396">From there the International Red Cross would send them to American prisoners of war in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="397">Now these parcels were full of food of high quality and they, they were particularly chosen kinds of food for the nutrition that they would provide to those who would eat them. </sentence><sentence id="398">The war had just been ended in Europe, and the American prisoners of war had been transhipped to French ports and had been sent back home. </sentence><sentence id="399">Uh this food was still in the warehouses in Paris, was appearing in the French black market--in other words the parcels were being stolen from the warehouses and uh this uh American officer said to me if you go to the Quartermaster General and ask for these parcels for the prisoners of war, they might be given to you. </sentence><sentence id="400">I followed his advice. </sentence><sentence id="401">I went to the Quartermaster General. </sentence><sentence id="402">I told him there was need to send uh to ship uh uh Jewish survivors from one place to another without mentioning any particular locations. </sentence><sentence id="403">He wasn't interested in asking which locations. </sentence><sentence id="404">I said to him I know that there are these prison of war parcels that soon will rot, that are showing up in the French black market. </sentence><sentence id="405">Would he sign papers enabling me to take control of those prisoner of war parcels? </sentence><sentence id="406">He was relieved to get rid of the headache and he said just make out the orders and I shall sign them, five copies. </sentence><sentence id="407">He made out the orders and for the next several days, trucks of the Brichah were moving these prisoner of war parcels from the warehouses, the several warehouses in Paris, to their own channels for shipment ultimately to southern French ports to go on so- called illegal ships to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="408">By the way, there were a number of American Army Jewish chaplains who helped the Brichah in similar fashion. </sentence><sentence id="409">There were those who obtained medical supplies for these ships. </sentence><sentence id="410">There were those who even obtained ammunition to be taken aboard the ships. </sentence><sentence id="411">Indeed wherever there were Jewish chaplains stationed in France, if they were contacted by the men or women of the Brichah, they found ways of helping the members of the Brichah. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="412">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: Uh how did the Brichah get their trucks?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="429">Q: Did you help the Brichah in any other way at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: Ah yes. </sentence><sentence id="432">I helped the Brichah later on after I was ordered to Germany to American Army Headquarters in Frankfurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="436">Let's talk about Frankfurt, uh unless there's something else you want to add about France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: About France? </sentence><sentence id="440">No, not necessarily. ( </sentence><sentence id="441">OK. </sentence><sentence id="442">What...) Oh yes, I, there is. </sentence><sentence id="443">I must tell you that uh I made a number of friends among Jewish survivors in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="444">I was invited to preach in uh several synagogues during the High Holy Days and uh during the festivals and on different Sabbaths, and as a result of the preaching, I met a number of French Jews who invited me to their homes. </sentence><sentence id="445">And thus I got to know a number of them, and my friendship with several of them has continued to this day. </sentence><sentence id="446">They have visited America and I and my children have visited them in France. </sentence><sentence id="447">And similarly with friends among British Jews in London. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="458">Q: How did you get, why did you go from France to Frankfurt, Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: Well, after a year in Paris I received orders commanding me to go to American Army Headquarters in Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="461">And to report for duties as an advisor to the Commanding General uh dash, General Eisenhower, dash, uh to advise him on Jewish affairs. </sentence><sentence id="462">And uh I flew from Paris to uh, no--I didn't fly. </sentence><sentence id="463">I took the American military train which was an overnight train that ran between Paris and Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="464">Paris was our rear headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="465">Frankfurt was our forward headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="466">So I went by train overnight to Frankfurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="474">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="475">Can you give me a little bit of background about uh suddenly being appointed an advisor? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="478">A: As to why this came to be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="480">Q: How did this come to be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="482">A: This was, that's uh a question of interest because uh there was no such position ever before uh in the American Army or indeed in any other army. </sentence><sentence id="483">An advisor to a commanding general with regard to Jewish problems. </sentence><sentence id="484">And there, it's interesting as to how it came to pass. </sentence><sentence id="485">The war, American war correspondents had reported during the summer of 1945, and their reports were read by Americans in New York, Chicago, elsewhere, in the in the daily press, that Jewish survivors of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria were being badly treated. </sentence><sentence id="486">And as a result President Truman appointed uh Dean Earl G. Harrison who was Dean of the Law School of the University of Pennsylvania, to make an inspection trip. </sentence><sentence id="487">He came in July of 1945.His aid was Dr. Joseph J. Schwartz fortunately. </sentence><sentence id="488">He was the very able European director of the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="489">And when Dean Harrison returned to the United States toward the end of July, he made a report that was highly critical of the American Army uh in Germany and of the manner in which they were taking care of Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="490">And at the beginning of August there was a Zionist conference held in London, the first such conference since the last world Zionist conference of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="491">This was uh the beginning of August 1945. </sentence><sentence id="492">Uh several of us chaplains were lucky enough to get to London to attend that Zionist conference and we told the delegates, particularly I remember Rabbi Stephen S. Weiss (ph) of what we had seen in Germany and uh Dr. Weiss, uh at the suggestion of one of the chaplains, the late Rabbi Robert Marcus (ph), uh sent a dispatch through the American Embassy in London to General Eisenhower, suggesting the appointment of a Jewish chaplain as a liaison officer to coordinate the work being done to help the Jewish survivors in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="493">Uh General Eisenhower two days later replied to Rabbi Weiss on the 9th of August that uh he did not agree with the suggestion, that uh there could be no appointment of a Jewish liaison officer because liaison officers were at his headquarters representing various nations. </sentence><sentence id="494">There was a French liaison officer. </sentence><sentence id="495">There was a Polish liaison officer. </sentence><sentence id="496">A Czech liaison officer. </sentence><sentence id="497">But there couldn't be a reli...a religious liaison officer. </sentence><sentence id="498">Well, uh Gen...General Eisenhower had already received from General Marshall, the Chief of Staff, several days before this a communication telling him that the report of Dean Earl G. Harrison was very critical of the American Army in Germany but on the 10th of August, the day after Eisenhower had replied to Rabbi Weiss, he received a cable from Secretary of War Stimpson telling him that the report of Dean Harrison severely condemned the American Army, that something had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="499">General Eisenhower, the very same day, replied to Secretary of War Stimpson that only yesterday he had turned down the suggestion to appoint a Jewish liaison officer. </sentence><sentence id="500">Now he was going to appoint a chaplain, an Army chaplain, to advise him and to coordinate whatever was being done to help Jewish survivors who had been found in the German concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="501">So that's how the position came to be created. </sentence><sentence id="502">And that's why I got the orders in Paris to proceed during the third week of August at all full speed to Frankfurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: What did you find when you arrived in Frankfurt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: Well, uh I uh I found that the Army had planned uh fully as to what to do with any survivors who might be found in German concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="529">There had been set up a combined displaced persons executive, which was a large office staffed by a number of officers. </sentence><sentence id="530">There was a general who was in charge, General Nicholson. </sentence><sentence id="531">Uh this combined DP executive was under the general command of uh the G5 on General Eisenhower's staff, General Adcock (ph), and they were doing a good job in following the plans that had been prepared a long time before. </sentence><sentence id="532">Those plans said simply that the survivors found in German concentration camps should be quickly sent back to the lands of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="533">And indeed French and, and Belgian and Greek and other nationals found in the concentration camps within ninety days were sent back to their homelands. </sentence><sentence id="534">But what the planners had not thought of was number one there would be German Jews and Austrian Jews and Hungarian Jews who came from countries that were considered enemy countries by the American Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy nationalists to be found in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="535">The irony was that the Germans, the Hungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived these Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian citizenship, but now they were given that citizenship again because to do otherwise would be to follow the practice of of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="536">And so they were enemy nationalists. </sentence><sentence id="537">That was one problem. </sentence><sentence id="538">The second problem was, and this was a far greater problem, the planners, the military planners had never contemplated the possibility that there would be survivors who were, who would be Jews who would refuse to return to the lands of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="539">Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="540">Ukrainian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="541">Lithuanian, Estonian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="542">Uh Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="543">Romanian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="544">Because they knew that their homes, their businesses that they once had had in their lands of origin had been seized by their erstwhile neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="545">They knew also that in many cases their former non-Jewish neighbors had cooperated with the Nazis in turning in their Jewish neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="546">Indeed in helping the Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to death camps. </sentence><sentence id="547">They knew that it would be dangerous even to return to the lands of their origin. </sentence><sentence id="548">They were concerned less their neighbors now in possession of Jewish homes and businesses attack them, as indeed happened. </sentence><sentence id="549">Moreover, psychologically these Jews, survivors of German concentration camps, knew that the very land, the very soil where they had once lived was now a soil that absorbed the blood of their children and their parents and their spouses. </sentence><sentence id="550">That the very air was polluted with the smoke of the crematoria where Jews had been burned. </sentence><sentence id="551">They had no desire to return to the lands from which they had come. </sentence><sentence id="552">Now it was the problems of these Jews in particular that had not been thought of in advance. </sentence><sentence id="553">Therefore the Army indeed did not take care properly of these Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="554">It wasn't until the 22nd of August when General Eisenhower issued an order that the Army take care of these survivors and that so-called enemy nationals who were Jewish and who had suffered under the Nazis should be taken care of as victims of the Nazis, that the whole situation was turned around. </sentence><sentence id="555">And a part of that turning around of the situation involved my being ordered to take on the duties of visiting these camps, seeing what the conditions were, bringing back my reports to General Eisenhower or in his absence to his Chief of Staff, General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence><sentence id="556">And to recommend changes in whatever conditions had to be changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="587">Q: At this point we're going to break and change tapes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="589">A: Fine. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="590">END OF TAPE </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="592">Uh we've begun. </sentence><sentence id="593">You were, you have been assigned to Eisenhower and you have arrived. </sentence><sentence id="594">Uh can you tell me, what was your first assignment? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: Well, my first assignment was to meet of course with the uh uh officers who were the staff of the combined displaced persons executive. </sentence><sentence id="596">And I spent oh the better part of a week uh learning what my job was to, to consist of. </sentence><sentence id="597">I read through a lot of uh files and I had long discussions uh with uh the several officers who were a part of the combined DP executive and then I uh compiled for myself a list of questions that would be a questionnaire for me when I would arrive in a displaced persons camp. </sentence><sentence id="598">The questions would have to do with uh housing, food, sanitary conditions, medical conditions, health of people and uh the like and where did these people want to go. </sentence><sentence id="599">What did they see as the solution, the ultimate solution to their problems. </sentence><sentence id="600">So armed with this questionnaire, I started off on my first tour. </sentence><sentence id="601">And I went first to Bavaria uh then under the command of the 3"! </sentence><sentence id="602">Army, whose commanding general was General George Patton. </sentence><sentence id="603">And uh General Patton had appointed a Major Schaffer (ph) as his displaced persons officer on his staff in Munich, which was the headquarters of the 3rd Army. </sentence><sentence id="604">Well, I went to Bavaria and I headed first for Feldafing (ph). </sentence><sentence id="605">Now why Feldafing? </sentence><sentence id="606">Because in the report of Dean Harrison, Feldafing had been praised. </sentence><sentence id="607">Indeed uh Dean Harrison had stated that Feldafing should be the model for other DP camps in the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="608">I went to Feldafing. </sentence><sentence id="609">I found uh over five thousand Jews there and the Army contingent in charge was headed by a Lieutenant Irving Smith. </sentence><sentence id="610">Now Irving Smith was a very able and efficient Army officer. </sentence><sentence id="611">He was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="612">He was sympathetic to the plight of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="613">And yet the Jews of the camp voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen, their complaints about Lieutenant Smith. </sentence><sentence id="614">Why? </sentence><sentence id="615">Well, because he issued orders without consulting with the committee. </sentence><sentence id="616">He, well that that was his job. </sentence><sentence id="617">He was an Army officer. </sentence><sentence id="618">And he wasn't trained to be in charge of a group of civilians in dire need. </sentence><sentence id="619">But as I went around through the camp with the committee, the Jewish committee, I was appalled by what I had seen. </sentence><sentence id="620">Why was I so upset? </sentence><sentence id="621">Because Feldafing, which had been held up by Dean Harrison as the model camp, was severely over-crowded. </sentence><sentence id="622">There were uh a number of, of uh barracks that were completely unfit for human habitation. </sentence><sentence id="623">The barracks were in many cases uh housing with poor roofing so that whenever it rained everything inside would get wet. </sentence><sentence id="624">Certainly as I thought of the coming winter, people couldn't be housed in, under such conditions. </sentence><sentence id="625">In addition, there was severe crowding in all of the barracks where the Jews were living. </sentence><sentence id="626">Remember, this was not a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="627">The Jews had been moved out of the concentration camp soon after the liberation, and had been put into this kind of housing, which had been constructed originally for foreign workers who had come into Germany, who came into Germany from such countries uh as Poland and Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="628">Many of them were brought by the Germans as slave labor to work in German industry while the Germans themselves were in the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="629">Some had volunteered to come because of their sympathy with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="630">Well, now these foreign workers were also displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="631">They claimed the status of displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="632">And their housing that had been used for them was now being used by Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="633">And I thought the conditions in, in Feldafing were deplorable. </sentence><sentence id="634">And I wondered how bad could the conditions be elsewhere if Feldafing had been praised by Dean Harrison as a model DP camp. </sentence><sentence id="635">I found out why Harrison praised Feldafing, and that was because Feldafing at that time was almost unique in that it was an all-Jewish camp. </sentence><sentence id="636">Now other camps where Jewish survivors were being housed were camps where non-Jews were also being housed. </sentence><sentence id="637">Who were these non-Jews? </sentence><sentence id="638">They were the foreign workers I mentioned a moment ago. </sentence><sentence id="639">In many cases they were sympathetic to the Jews, but in most cases they were anti-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="640">Many of them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi cause, had volunteered to come as workers to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="641">Moreover they had been fed well and housed well and clothed well, all through the years of the war and what the Jewish survivors of concentration camps required was not what they needed. </sentence><sentence id="642">And to give the Jews in the camps where they were housed with the non-Jews special treatment, more food than the others got, better clothing than the others had gotten, more medical attention than the others received, would be unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="643">It would, it could create riots, that the Jews were getting special treatment. </sentence><sentence id="644">Never mind that the Jews needed the special attention. </sentence><sentence id="645">It was the Jews who had suffered under the Nazi severely in the concentration camps, not the foreign workers. </sentence><sentence id="646">But it was an impossible situation. </sentence><sentence id="647">So what Dean Harrison had recommended was that camps should be set up with Feldafing as a model, that is they should be all Jewish camps and they should have a Jewish committee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the camps, whether it would be uh a military group or an company or workers from the Joint Distribution Committee who were by now being permitted to come into Germany, and to work in the camps, and General Eisenhower in that famous order of his of August 22nd also ordered that camps be made available for Jews alone, that non-Jews be removed from those camps and sent back as quickly as possible to the homelands from which they had come. </sentence><sentence id="648">And that was a great step forward because that permitted additional special treatment for Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="649">And when I came back to headquarters in Frankfurt, and I uh made my first recommendations, first orally to General Nicholson (ph), General Adcock and very quickly to General uh General Walter Beetle Smith, Eisenhower's Chief of Staff, later to be Ambassador of the United States to the Soviet Union and Secretary of State, my first reports included a number of recommendations. </sentence><sentence id="650">One with regard to the crowding, that more and better housing be obtained. </sentence><sentence id="651">Uh secondly, with regard to food, uh two thousand calories a day which was an improvement over what the Jews in the camps had gotten earlier under the American Army treatment, that two thousand calories a day was not sufficient to build up people who had been suffering from malnutrition for years. </sentence><sentence id="652">In addition, the two thousand calories did not provide sufficient nutrition. </sentence><sentence id="653">The diet was not a balanced diet. </sentence><sentence id="654">And I made another recommendation that was of vital importance to the Jews in the camps in Bavaria, including Feldafing. </sentence><sentence id="655">Namely, that they saw that their camps were surrounded by barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="656">Uh that irritated them to no end because in the concentration camps under the Nazis, their camps had also been surrounded by barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="657">Moreover, under the orders of General Patton, a pass system existed in each camp under which no more than a certain percentage of Jews in the camps would get passes enabling them to leave the camp for a certain number of hours. </sentence><sentence id="658">The Jews in the camps looked out and saw Germans who were, were the enemies of the Americans, Germans who had placed them in concentration camps, walking freely on the roads, on the highways. </sentence><sentence id="659">They were not behind barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="660">They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass to walk around freely. </sentence><sentence id="661">They, the Jews, who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were still behind barbed wire and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the DP camp. </sentence><sentence id="662">Well, uh I must say that uh General Eisenhower acted quickly on all these recommendations. </sentence><sentence id="663">Orders were done quickly to General Patton to correct these situations and I had a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one instance if not in others, the orders were not carried out by General Patton. </sentence><sentence id="664">Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's orders beginning with his August 22nd initial order correcting the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of command, the situation for Jewish survivors in Germany would have changed radically quickly. </sentence><sentence id="665">Unfortunately there was a wide gap between the headquarters in Frankfurt and the military units dealing with the Jewish displaced persons, and with all the intermediary levels through which the orders had to pass, including General Patton's headquarters in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="666">And so, for example, when I went back again on my second trip to Bavaria, the Jews complained to me that the barbed wire still existed. </sentence><sentence id="667">The pass system had not been changed, and when I came back to Frankfurt, I reported that to General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence><sentence id="668">Soon afterwards I came into the anteroom to General Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's headquarters, to his office, and I saw General Patton sitting in the anteroom at eight o'clock in the morning when the Army day began in Germany, and I knew that I must be the reason for his being there. </sentence><sentence id="669">I had reported that he had not carried out Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal of the pass system and the barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="670">I saw him sitting there with his pearl-handled pistols, one on each side of him, with his shiny helmet and boots. </sentence><sentence id="671">He glared at me with distaste and I beat a quick diplomatic retreat out of the office. </sentence><sentence id="672">Later General Smith told me that what had happened was that when he had reported to Eisenhower that I had said that Patton had not carried out the orders about the removal of the barbed wire and the pass system, Eisenhower had instructed General Smith to call General Patton to have him report the following morning at eight o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="673">General Patton had to ride overnight from Munich to Frankfurt to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when General Eisenhower saw him, General Eisenhower said to Patton after reminding him of the barbed wire and the pass system and his not carrying out Eisenhower's orders with regard to them, General Eisenhower asked him, George, why don't you do something for these Jews? </sentence><sentence id="674">And General Patton replied thinking that he was talking to his buddy, his close friend with whom he had gone to school at West Point, he replied uh Eisenhower, in a jocular way, well, why the hell should I. And Eisenhower lost his temper, which he normally kept under control, and retorted, well, God damn it, if for no other reason than because I have ordered you to. </sentence><sentence id="675">Now shortly after that General Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army and was given the command of the 15th Army, with headquarters at Bad Nauheim (ph). </sentence><sentence id="676">I don't know why that happened, but the 15th Army was only a paper Army. </sentence><sentence id="677">It consisted of no troops, only of the headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="678">The general story as uh told by newspaper correspondents, the war correspondents and by the movie about General Patton, was that he had slapped a soldier in a military hospital in Sicily, charging him with malingering. </sentence><sentence id="679">But the question asks itself, why should Eisenhower have waited so long to punish Patton for something that had happened a long time before. </sentence><sentence id="680">I'm not saying that this incident of the barbed wire and pass system were the immediate cause of Patton's demotion, but I'm guessing that it may have played some part in it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="770">Uh you were so involved in all of this, and you were going to the camps. </sentence><sentence id="771">Did you have contact again with the Brichah during this period to help you at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: I had contact with Brichah. </sentence><sentence id="776">I found them in various places in Germany and later when I went into the American zone of Austria and I soon gradually came to be a kind of a communications factor in their operations. </sentence><sentence id="777">Scattered as they were in different areas of Germany and Austria, it was very difficult for them to communicate with each other. </sentence><sentence id="778">It was impossible for them to give reports to a representative of the Jewish agency in London. </sentence><sentence id="779">At this particular time is was Mosha (ph) , later Mosha (ph) . </sentence><sentence id="780">But I was situated at American Army headquarters in Frankfurt, and I could communicate by telephone with all parts of Europe, so that I could speak to in London and to various members of Brichah in different parts of Germany or Austria, and bring reports from the Brichah men and women to and his requests to the members of Brichah, so that I played a small role there uh acting as a kind of uha communications headquarters for Brichah. </sentence><sentence id="781">Of course I continued on my rounds of the DP camps regularly, week in, week out. </sentence><sentence id="782">Not only in Bavaria but in all other parts of the American zone of Germany, and at this time too, I had the good fortune of welcoming a delegation of Jewish survivors from Bergen-Belsen in the British zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="783">Uh they came to meet with me to find out what was happening in the American zone of Germany with survivors, to tell me what was happening in Bergen-Belsen under the British zone, and among them I remember was Rosen. </sentence><sentence id="784">and the lady , a physician who was later to become his wife, and several other leaders of the Jewish committee of survivors in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="785">Incidentally, the Jews of London, the leaders of the British, British Jewry, wanted also to have an advisor, a Jewish advisor, appointed to General Montgomery, who was the British commanding general in the British zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="786">They asked me for any kind of papers, military orders that might be uh copied by them and sent to General Montgomery to, to see if he would not create a similar position in the British zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="787">General Montgomery refused point blank. </sentence><sentence id="788">But I continued visiting, meeting with Jewish chaplains, who once again were doing a remarkable piece of work in helping Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="789">Uh Chaplain Gunther (ph) had found a number of Hungarian Jewish women wandering across the countryside. </sentence><sentence id="790">They had been brought to Germany as a part of a slave labor force, and upon liberation didn't know where to go or what to do. </sentence><sentence id="791">Similarly with other American Jewish chaplains, wherever they were. </sentence><sentence id="792">Chaplain Robert Marcus (ph), Chaplain Hershell Shactor (ph), and particularly Chaplain Abraham Klossner (ph) stationed in Munich who was of inestimable value in helping the Jews in Munich create the central organization of the Jews of Bavaria whose name was later changed to the Jews of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="793">I had sent Chaplain Klossner on a thirty-day order to Dachau where he was to help with the survivors in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="794">He did that. </sentence><sentence id="795">He did not come back after thirty days. </sentence><sentence id="796">Uh the uh field hospital that had been stationed by the American Army in Dachau to help save as many lives as possible of the survivors, moved on. </sentence><sentence id="797">He remained behind. </sentence><sentence id="798">He was attached to no no rican military unit, which was altogether contrary to American military orders. </sentence><sentence id="799">He remained on his own, finding shelter and food on his own with the Jewish survivors in Munich, but he was of extraordinary assistance in helping the Jews, the displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons, in Munich and throughout Bavaria. </sentence><sentence id="800">I cannot pay too much tribute to him and to the other American Army Jewish chaplains...(how much)...oh incidentally, excuse me for interrupting you, I was almost court martialed because of Klossner because my boss, the theater chaplain, Father , learned that I had ordered Klossner who was one of the last American Army Jewish    chaplains to arrive in that batch of thirty who arrived after the war was actually over. </sentence><sentence id="801">Chaplain Elia Bonen (ph) who had been with uh the 42nd Rainbow Division that had liberated Dachau, had helped as much as possible while his troops were still in the area of Dachau, but he telephoned me to say he was moving on from Dachau with his troops to Salzburg in Austria, and that I should send somebody to help the Jewish survivors in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="802">Chaplain uh Abe Klossner had just arrived. </sentence><sentence id="803">I had nowhere really to send him so I ordered him for thirty days to the American field hospital that was remaining in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="804">When the theater chaplain learned of what I had done, that I had not at the end of thirty days seen to it that Chaplain Klossner should be ordered to another military unit elsewhere, threatened to have me court martialed uh but fortunately I talked my way out of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="836">Q: How? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="838">A: How did I talk myself out of it? </sentence><sentence id="839">By fast talk and also because by this time I had been greatly involved--I was still in Paris at the time (c) I had been greatly involved in service to the Jewish survivors in Paris, to Jewish lay leaders in Paris, and he might have been just a little bit afraid to court martial a chaplain on his staff who had contacts, he knew, not only with civilians in Paris but with the Jewish community back in New York, with the heads of the Jewish Welfare Board and the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="840">There might have been a row created had he done it, so he thought the better of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="844">Q: Can you (cough), sorry, can you talk a little bit about, you've had these relations with Brichah. </sentence><sentence id="845">You're working with the Army. </sentence><sentence id="846">To what extent did the Army turn a blind eye to what you and the Brichah were doing about making sure that supplies got through, etc.? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="850">A: Ah that's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="851">I told you already about the Quartermaster General in Paris who did not ask questions he might have asked as to how many displaced persons were moving, where were they moving from, where were they moving to he didn't ask the questions. </sentence><sentence id="852">In addition, when Jewish chaplains obtained medical supplies and sanitation supplies and even ammunition for the Brichah, it was with the cooperation usually of their military superiors. </sentence><sentence id="853">When uh I met General Hume in Austria, and on behalf of the Brichah I asked him where would be a good place for survivors to cross the border. </sentence><sentence id="854">He said this is altogether unofficial and if you are ever asked, you never heard it from me, but he took me to the wall map and he showed me a point where it would be a good place to cross the border. </sentence><sentence id="855">Incidentally, he gave me an article that was printed as a brochure that he had written some years before, of Moses as the first great military commander who took care of medical and sanitation requirements for an army on the march. </sentence><sentence id="856">And it was quite a learned article that he had written, long before World War Two had started. </sentence><sentence id="857">He gave me a copy that I treasure to this day. </sentence><sentence id="858">Now later on, there is a similar story in connection with what happened in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="859">When I came to Vienna, and first I met with General Mark Clark who was the American general in command of Austria. </sentence><sentence id="860">I paid my courtesy call. </sentence><sentence id="861">He wanted to make certain that I had not come at the express orders of Eisenhower because Eisenhower was not in command of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="862">I told him I had simply come to see how well the American Army under his command was taking care of Jewish survivors in the Austrian camps. </sentence><sentence id="863">When I came to Vienna and I visited the Rothchild Hospital, which was kind of a way-station for the Brichah, where they housed Jewish survivors who were being brought from Poland across Yugoslavia through Broto...through Brotoslovia (ph), across the border into the Russian zone of Austria, and then into the American zone of Austria, and then into the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="864">I met members of the Brichah there who said they have a very important matter in which they asked my help. </sentence><sentence id="865">They explained that a border crossing from Yugoslavia into the Russian ....in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="866">END OF TAPE ... who had come there from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="867">They wanted to know if that Russian crossing point was closed permanently or whether it would be opened again, the reason being that they had made all kinds of preparations before they used that crossing point. </sentence><sentence id="868">Money had been passed from hand to hand to make sure that it would be safe to bring Jewish refugees across that border crossing point. </sentence><sentence id="869">Now it was closed. </sentence><sentence id="870">Would they have to open another border crossing point with the required payment of sufficient funds, with making certain that it was militarily safe? </sentence><sentence id="871">I said how could I help. </sentence><sentence id="872">They said that by coincidence, a sheer coincidence, there was a Russian officer who was an aid to the Russian commanding general in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="873">This Russian officer's name was the same as my last name, Nadich. </sentence><sentence id="874">This Russian Jew had come from the Ukraine, that they planned having a party in the apartment of one of the members of Brichah in honor of the two Nadichs, the one who was on the staff of the Russian commanding general, and the one who was the advisor to the American commanding general, that they would supply us both with plenty of vodka, that I should ply my colleague with drinks until I would get the answer, if he knew the answer. </sentence><sentence id="875">So the party took place. </sentence><sentence id="876">I was pleased to meet my colleague with the same name. </sentence><sentence id="877">We spoke about the Jewish conditions in the Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="878">He told me of his great concern, his great fear about his return after the war to the Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="879">The Nazis had been there for several years and had poisoned the minds of those who had not been antisemitic before. </sentence><sentence id="880">He didn't know what would befall the surviving Russian Jews if they were to return to the Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="881">Gradually we got around to the subject in which I was interested. </sentence><sentence id="882">I discussed with him the crossing point from Yugoslavia into the Russian zone of Austria. </sentence><sentence id="883">By this time I neglected to mention before we began to talk privately, the other members of the Brichah had had left the room, and the two of us were left alone. </sentence><sentence id="884">And I tried to keep up with him glass for glass with the vodka and then he gave me, he actually knew the answer and he gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="885">No, he said. </sentence><sentence id="886">That crossing is closed temporarily, only for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="887">Next week it will be opened again. </sentence><sentence id="888">As soon as I got what I wanted, I continued filling his glass but I stopped drinking, and soon the members of the Brichah came into the room, and the party was over and then I conveyed to them the information they wanted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: Quite a story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="931">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="932">That was an interesting experience that I had and I must say it was very, very difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="933">Difficult because I wasn't certain that I could successfully keep up with the Russian Nadich in the drinking the vodka. </sentence><sentence id="934">And I wanted to make sure that my mind would remain clear until I got the information I was charged to get. </sentence><sentence id="935">But it worked. </sentence><sentence id="936">It worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="951">A: The party was over. </sentence><sentence id="952">I visited several camps in Austria, wrote reports about them also for General Eisenhower and for General Clark. </sentence><sentence id="953">General Clark had told me that he and General Eisenhower were taking a brief, well-earned vacation in the south of France in early August, when the cables began flying from Washington about the report of Dean Earl Harrison that condemned the American Army for not adequately taking care of Jewish survivors in the American zone of Germany, and Eisenhower returned at once to Frankfurt and Mark Clark returned to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="954">Interestingly I met, in 1971, General Mark Clark's son. </sentence><sentence id="955">I was on my way to Japan and Viet Nam to hold torah convocations for the American Army chaplains serving in the Pacific and in Viet Nam and I called upon the commanding general of the American Army in the Pacific at his headquarters in Honolulu and he was the son of General Mark Clark. </sentence><sentence id="956">And he asked me about my meetings with his father in Vienna in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="957">I visited with my friend, my very close friend whom I really loved, uh Chaplain Elia Bonen (ph) with the 42nd Division, now at headquarters in Salzburg. </sentence><sentence id="958">I visited DP camps in various parts of Germany, including the large one at Linz. </sentence><sentence id="959">And then...(Tell me...)

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="969">Q: What condition did you find the survivors in these camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="971">A: That's a very important question. </sentence><sentence id="972">What condition did I find the survivors in in the various camps in Germany and Austria? </sentence><sentence id="973">I speak particularly of the camps in Germany because I visited them not once but a number of times. </sentence><sentence id="974">The housing was not adequate. </sentence><sentence id="975">The amount of food they were getting was not sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="976">They needed much better clothing, especially warmer clothing and decent shoes for the oncoming winter. </sentence><sentence id="977">They required all kinds of assistance so that they could work again. </sentence><sentence id="978">In the various camps, and I think particularly, I remember particularly Landsberg, work shops were set up under the supervision of some of the Jewish displaced persons themselves. </sentence><sentence id="979">For example in Landsberg, Jacob O'Likesky (ph) who had been the head of the program of the art in Lithuania and therefore had the experience in setting up workshops and supervising them. </sentence><sentence id="980">O'Likesky headed setting up workshops in the DP camp at Landsberg, but he needed tools. </sentence><sentence id="981">He need implements. </sentence><sentence id="982">He needed machinery, and I asked for the requisitioning of that from German sources. </sentence><sentence id="983">In addition there were German, there were Jewish musicians in the DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="984">They wanted to play their instruments again, but they had no instruments. </sentence><sentence id="985">They wanted to give concerts again in the DP camps, and so I asked that violins and uh wind instruments and string instruments and percussion instruments be requisitioned from German sources of supply, and they were. </sentence><sentence id="986">They needed athletic equipment, sports supplies. </sentence><sentence id="987">They wanted to play what they called football, but we play soccer. </sentence><sentence id="988">I don't mean all of them did, but there were sufficient numbers of younger men, and we requisitioned these supplies for them. </sentence><sentence id="989">And there was hardly an aspect of living conditions where they didn't need supplies of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="990">Gradually, as the weeks went by, the situation in the camps improved, bit by bit, week after week. </sentence><sentence id="991">They continued their improvement during the three months that I was at work in Germany and they continued their improvement even afterwards under the civilian advisors to General Eisenhower. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1013">Q: You uh had all these duties, but in addition you had a very import event. </sentence><sentence id="1014">I believe Ben Gurion (ph) came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1017">A: Oh yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1019">Q: Would you tell us about Ben Gurion's visit with Eisenhower, please, and how did that happen and what was your involvement in it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1021">A: Well, by uh sheer accident, I was awarded the uh by the French government, the Croix de Guerre (ph) and I was asked to obtain the uh, oh I got--I see the puzzle in your face I was awarded the Croix de Guerre because of my help to the French Jewish survivors during the year that I was in Paris and I was asked to come from Frankfurt to Paris, to the Hotel de where the medal would be given to me by uh General deGaulle. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I asked permission from my military superiors. </sentence><sentence id="1023">I was granted the permission, and I was to go to Paris for one day. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I took the night train to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I came into Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1026">I had heard that Ben Gurion was in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1027">I found out where he was, at a certain hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1028">I came to see him there, after the ceremony with the award of the medal, and sometime before that--this explains how I knew that he was in Paris--I had been asked by General Eisenhower's office to comment about a request they had received from a certain Mr. David Ben Gurion connected with the Jewish Agency for Palestine, who asked for permission to enter the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And my comment was that it would be very valuable for permission to be granted because his very presence would raise the morale of the Jewish survivors in the American zone of Germany in the DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So permission was granted. </sentence><sentence id="1031">I called upon General Eisenhower at his hotel room in Paris on that day that I had come for the Croix de Guerre. </sentence><sentence id="1032">I learned that he was scheduled to take the night American Army military train to Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I told him I would meet him on the railroad platform. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I got there early. </sentence><sentence id="1035">I found out that I was to uh be given a bedroom on the train with uh an American major. </sentence><sentence id="1036">At that time I also had the rank of major and uh officers of field rank were given bedrooms, so uh I looked for the commander of the train that happened by coincidence he was an American Army captain who was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1037">When I, when uh Ben Gurion arrived, I asked him where he was to be on the train, and he said that he was to be uh in the coach sitting up all night with uh American Army soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1038">So I went to see the captain commanding the train, and I said to him, do you see that man with a shock of white hair on the platform. </sentence><sentence id="1039">The uh captain said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I said his name is Ben Gurion. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Does that mean anything to you? </sentence><sentence id="1042">And uh, he David Ben Gurion's room said no. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I said well, uh he's the head of all the Jews of Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And he shouldn't be asked to sit up all night long in the coach. </sentence><sentence id="1045">He said what do you want me to do. </sentence><sentence id="1046">I said well, you tell the other major in the bedroom with me uh that there's an emergency, that there's a distinguished guest of the American Army on the train, that uh you're very sorry but the major would have to leave the bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And uh happily the captain followed my advice and Ben Gurion was ushered into my bedroom after the unfortunate major departed. </sentence><sentence id="1048">David Ben Gurion then continued to ply me with questions about the Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="1049">The major thrust of his questions was, were these people who are completely broken, were they hospital cases? </sentence><sentence id="1050">Would they have mental problems for as long as they would live, or were they valuable human material who could become important citizens in Palestine in the Jewish community? </sentence><sentence id="1051">And I assured him for, for from all that I had learned that they were indeed in the later category, that they survived because they were strong, that those who were weaker unfortunately did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="1052">They were strong both physically and psychically. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And that was because of their strength and their will and their determination that they were able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1054">We talked until two o'clock in the morning, until we both fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1055">In the morning I took him, after the train landed, after the train arrived in, in uh Frankfurt, I took him first to uh be registered, to be signed in, to the American Army mess. </sentence><sentence id="1056">We had breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Then I took him to General Eisenhower's suite of offices. </sentence><sentence id="1058">General Eisenhower was not there at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1059">He was on a field trip. </sentence><sentence id="1060">But I introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, saying General Smith, if there were a Jewish state now, I would be introducing the prime minister of that state. </sentence><sentence id="1061">That was uh no great feat on my part. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Of course Ben Gurion was the leading Jew of the Jewish community and it was a foregone conclusion that if there were to be a Jewish state, he would be at its head. </sentence><sentence id="1063">I was later told by General Smith that when he introduced him to General Eisenhower, that General Eisenhower was greatly impressed by this man, Ben Gurion, and that he reported to General Smith that he was very much taken by him. </sentence><sentence id="1064">He asked Ben Gurion to visit the camps and of course Ben Gurion had come for that purpose, and to report to General Eisenhower upon his findings after his tour would be over. </sentence><sentence id="1065">Well after I had introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, and we had had lunch, I took uh David Ben Gurion to his first DP camp, to Zilesheim (ph), which was not far from Frankfurt, near the German town ofH___. </sentence><sentence id="1066">In Zilesheim--I would come often because it was close to Frankfurt--the people there were accustomed to my coming in with an American Army vehicle, and a number of them saw me come in this time too. </sentence><sentence id="1067">A few of them came over to say hello. </sentence><sentence id="1068">They happened to peer inside my car in the back seat and they saw something that was incredible to them. </sentence><sentence id="1069">They knew the picture of Ben Gurion, but they couldn't by the wildest stretch of their imagination imagine that he would be there in their camp in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1070">They began to scream "Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion. </sentence><sentence id="1071">As others heard the shouts, they came running, and I was afraid of a riot and I cried out, my friends, please show Ben Gurion the discipline of which you are capable. </sentence><sentence id="1072">You go around and tell all the people in the camp that David Ben Gurion is here and that he will speak to them. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Let them come to the assembly hall. </sentence><sentence id="1074">They ran. </sentence><sentence id="1075">They gathered up the people who were there. </sentence><sentence id="1076">They came to the assembly hall and when Ben Gurion and I reached the assembly hall, we went to the back of the stage. </sentence><sentence id="1077">The assembly hall was quickly filled. </sentence><sentence id="1078">The windows and doors were flung open so that people who couldn't get in, who couldn't fi...get even into the standing room which was completely full, could at least hear standing outside the windows and the doors. </sentence><sentence id="1079">And I came out to introduce Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="1080">As the two of us came on the stage, the large throng of people rose and the people began to sing the Hatikvah (ph) and as they sang the Hatikvah, many of them burst into weeping. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And I must confess that Eisenhower...that David Ben Gurion and I also wept for the Jews in that assembly hall. </sentence><sentence id="1082">At that moment, that DP camp, their liberation was complete. </sentence><sentence id="1083">They had dreamed most of them of some day getting to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Here, in the form of Ben Gurion, Palestine had come to them. </sentence><sentence id="1085">The Nazi nightmare was ended. </sentence><sentence id="1086">They were free. </sentence><sentence id="1087">They were now in touch with their brothers in . </sentence><sentence id="1088">And when the weeping subsided, Ben Gurion spoke to them, movingly. </sentence><sentence id="1089">He continued to break down and the Jews listening continued to sob. </sentence><sentence id="1090">It was one of the most moving experiences in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1091">And to my dying day, I shall not forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1092">He then asked to meet with the leaders of the committee chosen by the residents of Zilesheim. </sentence><sentence id="1093">The first time I had come to that camp there were only two hundred and fifty Jews there, but the numbers quickly grew to five thousand. </sentence><sentence id="1094">That night we met with the committee of the Jewish leaders of Zilesheim. </sentence><sentence id="1095">Again he hurled questions at them. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Were they able to come to Palestine? </sentence><sentence id="1097">Did they want to come to Palestine? </sentence><sentence id="1098">I knew that in my questionnaire that I had asked in the camps, approximately three quarters of them wanted to come to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1099">They wanted to live for the first time in their lives as a majority in a in a Jewish country, that they could no longer be concerned about any future nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="1100">And the remaining 25% wanted to go either to the United States or Canada or to South America or to Australia and he he also wanted to know the answer to an important question that he put to them. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I knew it was a test question. </sentence><sentence id="1102">He said to them, if we of the Jewish agency were to issue an order that on a certain day all the Jews in the DP camps of Germany should march out of those camps, march across borders to ports in southern Italy, would you follow such a command, knowing that you would be ordered by the American military to return to your camps, that you would be shot at by perhaps by Italian border police, that it might cost you your lives? </sentence><sentence id="1103">Would you follow such an order? </sentence><sentence id="1104">And to a man they answered, give the order. </sentence><sentence id="1105">We will follow it. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Ben Gurion told me afterwards he was extremely pleased by the metal of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1107">His first meeting with survivors, and he saw what they were like. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Unhappily, I could not accompany him on the rest of his tour of DP camps because I had been informed that same day that the civilian advisor invited by General Eisenhower when he issued the order appointing me as his military advisor on Jewish affairs, the civilian advisor appointed by President Truman was soon to arrive in Frankfurt from the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1109">He was Judge Simon H. Rifkin (ph), then of the Federal bench. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1202">Q: What did you do then? </sentence><sentence id="1203">Where... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1206">A: Well uh, Ben Gurion went on his way to cover the major DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="1207">I went to the railroad station to meet Judge Rifkin who was arriving on the military train from Paris, and later I learned that when Ben Gurion came back, and I saw him again when he came back to Army headquarters in Frankfurt before he departed, he gave General Eisenhower, as the general had requested, a report on his findings. </sentence><sentence id="1208">He requested certain things that the Jewish DPs had asked of me which I knew could not happen. </sentence><sentence id="1209">For example, he asked that the Jews be taken out of the DP camps, that whole German villages should be requisitioned for them, that the German occupants of the housing in those villages be evicted, and that the, the Jewish displaced persons be brought to take the houses of the Germans evicted from their homes in these villages. </sentence><sentence id="1210">I knew that would be turned down by Eisenhower, and I myself never made that recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="1211">Ben Gurion did. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And Eisenhower turned it down. </sentence><sentence id="1213">But another request by Eisenhower was honored by Eisen...another request by Ben Gurion to Eisenhower was honored by the general. </sentence><sentence id="1214">He asked that teams of Jews from the then called Palestine be permitted to enter the DP camps to serve on the staffs of those administering the camps, people, JDC people, to be of help to the Jews in these camps in several ways. </sentence><sentence id="1215">To teach them agriculture so that they would be able to become farmers when they would eventually arrive in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1216">To teach them Hebrew so that they could speak the language of the Jews of Palestine before they got there and other similar tasks. </sentence><sentence id="1217">And Eisenhower indeed agreed to that request, and Jews were brought from Palestine and brought into the camps to serve these functions and any other functions that they had in mind. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And of course they prepared the Jews in these camps for the eventual immigration from the camps to Palestine. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1240">What was he like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1241">A: I'm glad you asked that question. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Uh General Eisenhower, I learned years later when he received an honorary degree at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, spoke of the fact that he and his brothers were raised by their mother on the stories of what he called the Old Testament, and he grew up believing that the Jews were indeed the chosen people. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And that they were the first to bring to humanity the divine message of ethics and morality. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I got to know him through the humanitarian approach that he took to the improvement of the Jewish survivors in the DP camps in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1245">At the very beginning he cut through what was a gordion (ph) knot with which generals at American Army headquarters were wrestling for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1246">The gordion knot consisted of the old question, who are the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1247">A question that has been given much attention by scholars of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Are the Jews a nation? </sentence><sentence id="1249">Are they a religious grouping?Are they arace? </sentence><sentence id="1250">Are they a people? </sentence><sentence id="1251">On the one hand it was argued that the Jews could not be given special attention in the DP camps because you couldn't look upon them as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1252">There were either German nationals or Austrian nationals or Polish nationals or Czech nationals. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And if you were to look upon them as Jews and deprive them of their nationality, were you not doing the same thing that the Nazis had done, of robbing them of their citizenship, and looking upon them as a racial group. </sentence><sentence id="1254">On the other hand, how could you help them if you did not look upon them as a special separate group. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Well, Eisenhower cut through that gordion knot and when he received these several communications from Washington, from General Marshall, from Secretary Stimpson, and I must stress from President Truman, that the situation must be corrected, Eisenhower at once made up his mind he was going to stop with all of this argument, all of this debate, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate group. </sentence><sentence id="1256">And German Jews and Austrian Jews and Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy nationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to go back to their homelands, they were to be treated as a special group, given special help, brought back to the level of ordinary common place health of human beings and because he did that, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1257">He came to speak at the Park Avenue Synagogue at my invitation in May of 1965. </sentence><sentence id="1258">By that time he had been President of the United States, and he was living in Gettysburg. </sentence><sentence id="1259">I telephoned him and I asked him would he come to speak at a special service at my synagogue commemorating the 20th anniversary of the liberation of the German concentration camps by the American Army under his command. </sentence><sentence id="1260">He agreed to come. </sentence><sentence id="1261">In introducing him to my congregation, I said to them, I want to tell you one story about this man which will be sufficient to tell you about his character, his humanitarianism, and his answer to the difficult Jewish problem. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I said when we, when the German arm...when the American Army liberated the concentration camps in Germany, there were definitions of who was a displaced person. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Who was a displaced person who would benefit from housing, food, clothing and all the rest under the aegis of the American Army. </sentence><sentence id="1264">The displaced person was defined as a survivor, in this case particularly a Jewish survivor, liberated in a concentration camp on German soil. </sentence><sentence id="1265">But soon there came into the American zone of Germany, other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1266">Jews who had been in hiding in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Jews who had been shoved back by the Russians behind the front lines, all the way back to Siberia, an action that actually saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Now these Jews came back in large numbers from Siberia to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1269">They found that their homes and their businesses could not be reclaimed. </sentence><sentence id="1270">They discovered that their loved ones had been murdered by the Nazis and the Polish or Ukrainian or Lithuanian helpers and they no longer wanted to try to make out, to make a new life where they had originally lived. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And spontaneously they started a trek from Poland to the American zone of Germany, later organized and assisted by the men and women of the Brichah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1305">Q: How did Eisenhower react to this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: Ah, this is a major point that I wanted to make. </sentence><sentence id="1308">When these Jews started coming across the borders to enter the American zone of Germany, Eisenhower was asked by the commanders on lower levels, what shall we do with these refugees who are coming into our zone in such large numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1309">I was asked for a recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="1310">The recommendation of course was that they be admitted into the DP camps in the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1311">General Eisenhower approved that recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Eighty thousand Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one order of approval, contributed to the saving of eighty thousand Jewish lives. </sentence><sentence id="1313">Now my friendship with him continued after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1314">I was asked to help write items of interest in his campaign for the presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah message during the campaign. </sentence><sentence id="1315">My wife and I were invited to the Inauguration. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Before that time I was invited to give an invocation at the Republican National Convention that had that had nominated him. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I had him at my synagogue, but before that I had visited him at Gettysburg at his farm, so we remained in close contact all through the years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1329">Q: How did Eisenhower, did you and Eisenhower at the time you made this recommendation, did you talk to him face to face? </sentence><sentence id="1330">What did he say to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1333">A: I did not in most instances have the opportunity of speaking to him face to face. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I did often. </sentence><sentence id="1335">I did have the privilege of coming to his office, speaking to him face to face, most of the times answering his questions. </sentence><sentence id="1336">When he was not in his office, and that was, that occurred frequently, he would be out on a field trip, then my conversations were with the second in command, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1341">Q: Did Eisenhower ever talk to you about the Jews and his feelings about Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1343">A: I did have occasion to hear such remarks from Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="1344">He always spoke in an affirmative fashion. </sentence><sentence id="1345">He always condemned every kind of bigotry and prejudice. </sentence><sentence id="1346">He hated what the Nazis had done. </sentence><sentence id="1347">He issued orders, after he had first visited Dachau, that American military commanders should bring their units to see Dachau so that the troops might know what they had been fighting against. </sentence><sentence id="1348">He visited Feldafing on Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there, told them of his high admiration for them, for the Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them to keep their hope high, that they still had a future. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Eisenhower was that kind of personality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1357">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="1358">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1359">When you had been relieved of your post and Judge Rifkin came in your place, uh what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1363">A: Well the first thing I did was to escort Judge Rifkin on a tour of all the camps, to introduce him to all of my contacts among the Jews in the camps, to tell them that he was the person for them to speak to afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1364">I returned to the United States on a troop transport and uh I came back to the United States at the end of November, beginning of December in 1945.Before my return I had been visited at my headquarters in uh Frankfurt by uh Major Edward Warburg (ph) who was at that time the president of the Joint Distribution Committee, and he was good enough to invite me. </sentence><sentence id="1365">After I would be discharged from the Army, to become a member of the staff of the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="1366">He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC operations in Germany, after I would spend at least a month or so with my family back home. </sentence><sentence id="1367">But I returned to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Soon afterwards I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the Joint Distribution Committee in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1369">I was full of vehement indignation at what I had seen. </sentence><sentence id="1370">I had, I contrasted that with what I had found among American Jews when I returned. </sentence><sentence id="1371">There was very little awareness among American Jews of what had happened to their fellow Jews in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Very few were aware of it, and very few were concerned about it, naturally, because they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1373">So I was angry and at my uh, I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the JDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked to give an address the following week at the annual meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take place in Atlantic City where an unheard of goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to be raised during 1946 among the Jews of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1374">Of course I uh accepted the invitation. </sentence><sentence id="1375">I addressed the UJA Conference in Atlantic City the following week, and I was asked the next morning to have breakfast with the leaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at that conference, and at the breakfast table I was told that I was being relieved of the employment I was to have with the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="1376">Instead I was asked to accept employment with the United Jewish Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred million dollar campaign from which of course the JDC would be receiving its funds. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And I agreed and for the next six months I spoke in forty different states of the country. </sentence><sentence id="1378">I had no place I could call my home. </sentence><sentence id="1379">I just went from town to town, city to city, and spoke at UJA fund raising meetings. </sentence><sentence id="1380">According to the calculations that I kept myself, some $20,000,000 were raised at those meetings. </sentence><sentence id="1381">The JDC then asked me to return to Europe, to visit the DP camps in Germany, Austria, Italy, once again to bring myself up to date on what had happened and then to go to South Africa where I was to spend four months in South Africa, what were then called Southern and Northern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and Zambia, and to raise funds there for the South African Jewish War Appeal, the agency that then transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution Committee for work among the Jewish survivors in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1382">I spent a brief while in America. </sentence><sentence id="1383">I met the young lady at that time to whom I became engaged after three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1384">Sadly I departed on my mission for the JDC to Europe, from there to South Africa where I met the most generous Jews I had as yet met in my career. </sentence><sentence id="1385">South African Jews gave generously, very generously, and I made friends among them, friends to this day, and similarly with the Jews, the few Jews in Zimbabwe and Zambia. </sentence><sentence id="1386">I went as far north as what was then called Livingston, in northern Rhodesia and now Zambia, and of course as far south as Capetown. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And I spoke in every city, town and dork (ph) in which there were seventy Jews or more. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And happily the South African Jewish War Appeal reported that the campaign was very successful. </sentence><sentence id="1389">I returned to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1390">I got married, happily, and then I worked for the United Jewish Appeal in the New York City campaign for six months. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Then tired of not having had a home for myself for a good number of years, my wife and I settled down in the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, where I accepted a congregation, Israel, in Brookline. </sentence><sentence id="1392">And so I started my life as a rabbi once again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
