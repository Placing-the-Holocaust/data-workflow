<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="935">It seems that in some cases I took the lead and she deferred to me in making some decisions. </sentence><sentence id="936">One of them was a life-and-death decision. </sentence><sentence id="937">There was a suicide in the house once. </sentence><sentence id="938">Somebody jumped off the floor above us and died. </sentence><sentence id="939">And I kind of remembered that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="940">That surfaced later on. </sentence><sentence id="941">But the time period between this conversion attempt and -- which had to be maybe August, September, October, things were really getting hairy. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="942">And I remember being out on the streets as usual and getting caught in a bombing raid away from home and coming home after the curfew, because the bombing raid didn't end, and dodging through and hoping to -- not to get stopped by the Nazis. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="943">And I'm trying to remember at what point, but it may be -- again, when we're talking about that 90-day period of September, October, November, things really get a little bit hazy, but I remember in one of the bombing raids I got caught under an arch in an apartment house and were cowering, lying on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="944">And the raid was over, and there was a bomb, an unexploded bomb within 20 feet of us, right in the open arch area, and we had to step over it to go home. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="945">And of course by that time I began to see an awful lot of death and injured people and things were -- bombings were three, four times a day really. </sentence><sentence id="946">And of course the Nazis were getting worse, and so the paranoia set in quite naturally that everybody was after me, whether it was on foot or in the air. </sentence><sentence id="947">And so things were going downhill fairly fast at that point. </sentence><sentence id="948"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="949"> Interview with Ivan Becker 28 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="950">Q: Were you ever stopped by any of the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="951">A: No, Iwas not. </sentence><sentence id="952">I looked very much like a German kid. </sentence><sentence id="953">I was blond, very light blond. </sentence><sentence id="954">I also wore the school uniform coat, which was a -- an old Hungarian type uniform -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: But you had the star on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="956">A: -- with braids. </sentence><sentence id="957">But I had the star on. </sentence><sentence id="958">The period I'm referring to really, I took the star off and was on the street without the star moving around without any papers. </sentence><sentence id="959">And of course -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="960">Q: This is September-October you're talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: I would say October-November. </sentence><sentence id="962">And I don't know how I had the guts to do it or why. </sentence><sentence id="963">I just did it. </sentence><sentence id="964">And I moved because I didn't like restriction. </sentence><sentence id="965">And it pretty much had to be that period, although I was doing that out of the Swedish house also for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="966">But at any rate, I moved around. </sentence><sentence id="967">The danger, of course, was -- is that if you were stopped, you had no papers, pulled your pants down and if you were circumcised, they killed you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
