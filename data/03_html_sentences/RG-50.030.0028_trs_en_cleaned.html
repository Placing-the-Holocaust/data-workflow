[ </sentence><sentence id="60">Urisha (ph)] is a house because it was built maybe 50, 80 years ago by my grand, grand, grandparents and later when the children did get grandchildren, they get married and so on, they divided this house. </sentence><sentence id="61">So...uh...finally when L...was already over there, when I was about 10 years old, this whole house was divided with partitions that everybody could hear everybody across the wall. </sentence><sentence id="62">So mine...mine aunt did hear me...did hear the conversation with my dad and she noticed by listening in that time, I'm eating pork meat. </sentence><sentence id="63">So what...the next thing I remember she opened the door where my father lived and said, "Tom." " </sentence><sentence id="64">Toivi," not "Tom." </sentence><sentence id="65">Not Tom. </sentence><sentence id="66">"Toivi, you eat pork meat?" </sentence><sentence id="67">I said, "Yes, Mimi, I ate."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Uh... remember the town...you know, we didn't have...uh... radios in that time, so any news  was...uh...transmitted by person who had a big...uh...drum...uh...Jewish guy. </sentence><sentence id="156">His name was Hydel (ph)], and he did go to the middle of the town to the marketplace and drummed up until all the people had come together, and now he said, "Hello, hello. </sentence><sentence id="157">This is the news..." and so on. </sentence><sentence id="158">He did say that a war started. </sentence><sentence id="159">Hitler invaded Poland, and a mobilization is in order and...uh...he was the latest news from the Burgermeister's office, Mayor's office, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="160">And he advised to glue in strips of paper on the windows so they shouldn't shatter if the bombs fall down, and that was the news. </sentence><sentence id="161">So people start to pick up newspapers, cut it in strips, and glue in and some people did prepare dry bread; and so it was in our place too. </sentence><sentence id="162">And later I remember planes coming. </sentence><sentence id="163">I remember Polish plane shot down, and the next I remember my family was moving out from the town, hiding in a village from the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="164">We were afraid that Izbica will be bombed because there was a big factory, a military factory in Izbica uh producing material for fortification purposes. </sentence><sentence id="165">So I went to this village, Panska- Dolina. </sentence><sentence id="166">Over there, I remember Polish soldiers and I remember when the news arrived that the Soviet Union is fighting against Poland, too. </sentence><sentence id="167">I remember the speech from the Polish officer, that they have, they are stabbed in the back by the Soviet soldiers and now they will fight to the last drop of blood. </sentence><sentence id="168">And ...uh...later I remember the rumor, the Germans are coming, and now we are a group of people about 25. </sentence><sentence id="169">We don't know what to do, scared in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="170">The young people say, "Oh, we will run away from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="171">We are going across the river Bug to the Russians." </sentence><sentence id="172">The older people, mine parents included...my father, "No, we're going back to Izbica. </sentence><sentence id="173">Germans. </sentence><sentence id="174">Of course, they're anti-Semites, but they're also people." </sentence><sentence id="175">And I remember we split then. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was in the night. </sentence><sentence id="177">I remember the stars and could be about maybe 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, like a...like a film, like a movie, we departed. </sentence><sentence id="178">And the sons did walk to the east, and some parents did go back to Izbica. </sentence><sentence id="179">And I went back with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="180">We come to Izbica and now...uh..

" </sentence><sentence id="186">Oh, there're two German soldiers still in the bakery buying bread." </sentence><sentence id="187">So I went to the bakery and I seen in front of them two German soldiers with bikes and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because German is pretty close to Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="188">So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my language. ( </sentence><sentence id="189">laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them. </sentence><sentence id="190">We did talk a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="191">| Yiddish and they're German. </sentence><sentence id="192">There's nothing wrong with it. </sentence><sentence id="193">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="194">Uh...A day later the Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="195">What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later did...did come to agreement about the...the demarcation line, and they moved out. </sentence><sentence id="196">And the Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="197">In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they were in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="198">The Russians are leaving again. </sentence><sentence id="199">The Germans are coming. </sentence><sentence id="200">So again what should we do? </sentence><sentence id="201">My mother told my father, "Listen, Let go out. </sentence><sentence id="202">I know Russian. </sentence><sentence id="203">I know the language. </sentence><sentence id="204">Let go out from here." </sentence><sentence id="205">And my father said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="206">Actually he bought a horse and carriage already. </sentence><sentence id="207">And later he said, "No, I was born here. </sentence><sentence id="208">I could die here." </sentence><sentence id="209"> And my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="210">He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's army...uh...uh...in the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="211">He was wounded. </sentence><sentence id="212">He was a invalid. </sentence><sentence id="213">And...uh...which was, you know, a very horrible in that time. </sentence><sentence id="214">So he...and he said, no, he will stay here. </sentence><sentence id="215">He was born here and he...he could die here. </sentence><sentence id="216">And he stayed. </sentence><sentence id="217">And this was...and this sealed our future, our destiny. </sentence><sentence id="218">So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close by the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I was a child 12 years old, but I felt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="220">We should go. </sentence><sentence id="221">But we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="222">The Russians left and Izbica was a no-man's land. </sentence><sentence id="223">No Russians. </sentence><sentence id="224">No Germans. </sentence><sentence id="225">The Germans did come. </sentence><sentence id="226">But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before Izbica in a district town of Krasnystaw. </sentence><sentence id="227">Izbica was nobody. </sentence><sentence id="228">So two...the third night, sitting in my room I hear a big explosion. </sentence><sentence id="229">And suddenly screaming, yelling, "What's happened?" </sentence><sentence id="230">A group of Jews stood on the street outside talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them. </sentence><sentence id="231">And they killed a few and they wounded a few. </sentence><sentence id="232">So we start to be terrorized by the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="233">So people were scared to go outside the town and there's another legation did form, a Jewish delegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein. </sentence><sentence id="234">Still I remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="235">By the way, this is the same, this is my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat... shouldn't eat unkosher. </sentence><sentence id="236">Under...under her leadership, they went to Krasnystaw. </sentence><sentence id="237">Actually, to invite Germans to come to Izbica because it...it is no law in Izbica and we are afraid and that they must come in. </sentence><sentence id="238">So Germans did come into Izbica to protect the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="239">No, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days. </sentence><sentence id="240">There were simple Wehrmacht soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="241">And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local command...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the streets so they were pretty quiet. </sentence><sentence id="242">As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="243">I remember a...kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff. </sentence><sentence id="244">It...it was rather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived. </sentence><sentence id="245">There were two of them. </sentence><sentence id="246">Ludwig Klein and Karl Engels. </sentence><sentence id="247">Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="248">They both committed suicide in...in Hamburg after the war, being in jail. </sentence><sentence id="249">Well, anyway, these two SS were a terror in Izbica. </sentence><sentence id="250">Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five, ten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized, finally, that we have no rights. </sentence><sentence id="252">And many times we wished that if the first Germans which arrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the town, it would be a blessing because everybody would escape with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="253">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="254">In the beginning!But, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called. </sentence><sentence id="255">So...now it was too late, and we were in a trap. </sentence><sentence id="256">In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="257">There were still families. </sentence><sentence id="258">Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was possible to live. </sentence><sentence id="259">There were...uh...there were labor camps and Jews were forced to go to work in labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="260">In the beginning, they were forced to work on the streets from 8 o'clock in the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released home. </sentence><sentence id="261">Later, as I said,  there were labor camps where they went out for a month or for a week. </sentence><sentence id="262">They worked. </sentence><sentence id="263">Later they...they were exchanged. </sentence><sentence id="264">New Jews did come and they were let home. </sentence><sentence id="265">Uh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans in that time established Jewish Councils, so-called "Judenrat." </sentence><sentence id="266">And through the Judenrat, they were able to execute their orders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the labor camps and the Judenrat also after a month or so sent new people. </sentence><sentence id="267">The old ones...the first ones should be released. </sentence><sentence id="268">So it wasn't a order. </sentence><sentence id="269">Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for one month to the labor. </sentence><sentence id="270">But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the poor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go. </sentence><sentence id="271">But as the time progressed, it was worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="272">We heard about beating. </sentence><sentence id="273">We heard about torture, and people refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="274">In that time the first so-called "Aktions" happened. " </sentence><sentence id="275">Aktion" is a roundup. </sentence><sentence id="276">It started with roundups to the labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="277">They would come in the morning and told the Jewish Council to deliver 500 men or 200 men. </sentence><sentence id="278">If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their own police, they started indiscrimate to go from house to house, beat, shot... Ukrainians, which worked with the Nazis together. </sentence><sentence id="279">And they...they caught...they simple caught people on the streets "til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: What were you and your parents doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: Twas a oov in the picture and later sot to the - So in that time. </sentence><sentence id="409">| was alreadv in  told me, "Tom, would you like to help me? </sentence><sentence id="410">I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put together a motorcycle." </sentence><sentence id="411">So I said, "Okay, I will just tell my dad." </sentence><sentence id="412">Told my dad that I will be a whole night working in Mr. [Solecky's (ph)]...I will call it from now on "garage," because Americans are familiar with what a...what a garage is. </sentence><sentence id="413">And while I was working next day, he said...[Solecky (ph)]..."Listen, why don't you work with me. </sentence><sentence id="414">Leave Mr. [Platow (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="415">Come to me." </sentence><sentence id="416">And I thought it was a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="417">First of all, I will be protected by Gestapo, clean the motorcycles, and I agreed. </sentence><sentence id="418">And from that time on, I started to work...uh...for Mr. [Solecky (ph)] and it was dangerous because the motorcycles of the Gestapo need to be cleaned, you know, spotless. </sentence><sentence id="419">And I worked very hard and I done a good job. </sentence><sentence id="420">And as I see it now, it was a good choice because later when the death camps did come, I was protected practically...practically the last minute, and I was able to see how town is sinking down, myself being protected. </sentence><sentence id="421">I didn't need to hide like another people that hide in that time. </sentence><sentence id="422">I've seen it. </sentence><sentence id="423">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="424">Going back to the labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="425">Suddenly, transports arrived from...uh...Pozna_...from west...from the western part of Poland...Pozna_, Ko_o, Konin, and lot of Jews arrived; we divided...the Judenrat divided the people to different houses and that time I did get very close with...uh...[Jussik Bresler (ph)], who was...uh...a dentist's son from Ko_o. </sentence><sentence id="426">In our place used to live a man, his name was Kohn, with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="427">Once I remember...it was the evening...I still remember my mother standing close...close to the window with Mr. Kohn and his wife, and discussing a letter. </sentence><sentence id="428">And I listen: "gassing people, gassing....". </sentence><sentence id="429">And my mother I remember saying, "It's impossible. </sentence><sentence id="430">It's a fantasy. </sentence><sentence id="431">Can't be." </sentence><sentence id="432">So a lot of time parents don't even realize how much children could listen in, pretending doing something else. </sentence><sentence id="433">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="434">What I understood, and later I find out more is Miss [Mrs.] Kohn, received a letter from her son in Ko_o, which was still in Ko_o, that in a place called Chelmno, they're gassing people. </sentence><sentence id="435">He wrote about this. </sentence><sentence id="436">But, as I said, it was dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="437">By the way, her son who wrote the letter survived and he lives in [Holland (ph)], in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="438">And I later talked to him when I went to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="439">And I was in the South, reminding him about this letter he wrote. </sentence><sentence id="440">Anyway, so this was a bad signal, but later quiet down. </sentence><sentence id="441">At least I didn't hear...at least I didn't hear anything. </sentence><sentence id="442">But once was some "Akcja." </sentence><sentence id="443">The SS arrived in the morning, did...uh...asked the Judenrat to deliver 2,000 people to the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="444">And the Judenrat did go home to home and delivered, but a lot of people already were afraid about the torture, about the beating, and hide. </sentence><sentence id="445">So the Nazis themselves start to look for them and collected them in the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="446">After such a "Aktion," after the...uh...the desired amount of Jews were concentrated in the marketplace, everybody else could go out and uh...town was like normal. </sentence><sentence id="447">The people were over there, then later they were taken to the station, there were already wagons for them loaded and taken away. </sentence><sentence id="448">Like they took them away before to labor camps close to Zamo _...was a labor...labor camp, [Mokre Zdanow (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="449">They left. </sentence><sentence id="450">But usual, in a case like this, they took away some family...family members, and the family  which was left usual...usually sent some Poles, Christian Pole, a friend, to go after the train to see the destination. </sentence><sentence id="451">And so after this transport left, some people...Polish people went after them with a bike or with...uh...either way, with another train tracing this train. </sentence><sentence id="452">The same night...uh...I...a day later, | remember I was at home and I heard some knocking in the window. </sentence><sentence id="453">It was already after the curfew...curfew time. </sentence><sentence id="454">But nevertheless, many times I did sneak out after curfew time. </sentence><sentence id="455">But I hear some knocking, and as I go to the window and...uh...there was a knock like I had...uh when I went to my friend [Jussik (ph)], I knock the same way...three times long and three times short it was. </sentence><sentence id="456">I recognize as my friend [Jussik (ph)] from...from Ko_o. </sentence><sentence id="457">So I opened the door, go out, sneak out, you know, because Jews are not allowed outside, and hidden behind this house I say...I noticed [Jussik (ph)] standing by. </sentence><sentence id="458">I said, "[Jussik (ph)], What's the urgency? </sentence><sentence id="459">What is so..." "Tom, I must tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="460">Tom, you remember [Ruza (ph)]?" </sentence><sentence id="461">I said, "Yes." " </sentence><sentence id="462">She was taken before yesterday." " </sentence><sentence id="463">Yes." " </sentence><sentence id="464">She's dead." </sentence><sentence id="465">I mean, "What do you mean, she's dead?" " </sentence><sentence id="466">I mean...you remember the transport which left with the trains...the last transport of 2,000 Jew? </sentence><sentence id="467">All of them are dead." " </sentence><sentence id="468">What do you mean, all of them are dead?"

Jewish guards, Jewish policja. </sentence><sentence id="1718">So...but now we're  2 going outside and it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="1719">I remember going through streets of Stryy and thinking, "Should Irun now? </sentence><sentence id="1720">Should I...." because the Jewish policia...they were only guarding. </sentence><sentence id="1721">There was no Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1722">But they were in front with the Jewish...uh..nurses, and they didn't give a damn about us, thinking that we are sick. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And was a ideal time to jump out and just go. </sentence><sentence id="1724">But I...I did look for a partner. </sentence><sentence id="1725">I didn't have a penny and didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="1726">So I noticed another fellow who I thought maybe he is simulating sicknesses too, and I told him, "Listen, do you want to run?" </sentence><sentence id="1727">And he told me, "Don't do it now. </sentence><sentence id="1728">Let go to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1729">My father's in the ghetto and my father will come. </sentence><sentence id="1730">He...will have money and everything else." </sentence><sentence id="1731">So L...I listened to him. </sentence><sentence id="1732">So now we're in this hospital I explained, this room. </sentence><sentence id="1733">Visitors from the city were able to come in, but we weren't able to go out with the Jewish militia... uh... uh ...watch us. </sentence><sentence id="1734">It didn't take long. </sentence><sentence id="1735">He was really sick. </sentence><sentence id="1736">So I wasn't able to go along later. </sentence><sentence id="1737">I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1738">I don't want to go into any particulars, but I was sick.

</sentence><sentence id="3333">Feuermann is like firemeister...master. </sentence><sentence id="3334">All the documents, heaps of documents, passports, pictures, books, soiled clothing was burned. </sentence><sentence id="3335">While they were burning it, when I was sorting, I put the papers in a big blanket. </sentence><sentence id="3336">Later with the blanket was still full, I put it on my shoulder and take it to the fire. </sentence><sentence id="3337">Taking it to the fire, I started to get familiar with the guy working over there. </sentence><sentence id="3338">Did bring him some food. </sentence><sentence id="3339">And slowly by slowly, I start to helping him; and later, when they built a bigger oven, I was working over there as a steady personnel. </sentence><sentence id="3340">My idea was to work in a...to be enclosed, out of  6 the view from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3341">I could see them. </sentence><sentence id="3342">They can't see me. </sentence><sentence id="3343">From the window, I was able to see. </sentence><sentence id="3344">But once I wasn't able and there was a terrible beating. </sentence><sentence id="3345">But anyway, so...they planned to kill a German in my place. </sentence><sentence id="3346">So this way...but I did need to be contacted. </sentence><sentence id="3347">Otherwise, I would...some stranger comes into this place, I would chase him out, being afraid myself. </sentence><sentence id="3348">So he calls me in the evening and tells me, "Toivi, I must tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="3349">I know you. </sentence><sentence id="3350">I know your father. </sentence><sentence id="3351">I will tell you something, but keep your mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="3352">We need your place to kill a German." </sentence><sentence id="3353">I was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="3354">Later, I find out about what's happened. </sentence><sentence id="3355">And I was informed on the purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3356">I... understood that something is going on, and I was informed about Sasha. </sentence><sentence id="3357">Especially I was a guy... was a guy in Sobibor which always did run around. </sentence><sentence id="3358">You know, I didn't keep in a place. </sentence><sentence id="3359">I was always hyper and would just run. </sentence><sentence id="3360">I did want to know everything like I would be...go out and I'd write book, which I've done, actually.(laughing) I was always a very...boy who...I want to know everything. </sentence><sentence id="3361">So in this way I did become, I was involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="3362">So I know the first plan was...there were different plans. </sentence><sentence id="3363">The first plan was to dig a tunnel from the blacksmith shop through the barbed wires to outside. </sentence><sentence id="3364">But when they analyzed it, it's did come out that we need to work many, many days, nights to dispose of this very dangerous dispose of the soil. </sentence><sentence id="3365">They need to find a way. </sentence><sentence id="3366">And when...let's assume everything is okay. </sentence><sentence id="3367">Six hundred people should go through the tunnel single file without quarrel will take a whole night. </sentence><sentence id="3368">Isn't practical. </sentence><sentence id="3369">They threw it away. </sentence><sentence id="3370">The next one was to poison...to kill all the Nazis while they're in bed, because there was a group of young kids like me, they called "putzers," which each morning 4 o'clock they're allowed to go out from the barrack to go to the Germans and while they are in the bed, clean their shoes, clean their belts and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3371">This time to smuggle in instead a such a young boy should go a little bit older, at night and kill in bed and get their weapons. </sentence><sentence id="3372">But they did...they discon...they disregarded because they didn't...they weren't able to depend on young people doing such an important job. </sentence><sentence id="3373">Anyway, a plan was accepted...the final plan, to kill all the Germans in a matter of one hour, between four and five. </sentence><sentence id="3374">We based our success on the German punctuality...punctuality. </sentence><sentence id="3375">Discipline. </sentence><sentence id="3376">And the plan was that the heads of the workshops because besides the people working in conjunction of the extermination, there were workshops. </sentence><sentence id="3377">Tailors, shoemakers working for the Germans only, because there was...so much... they had a labor force. </sentence><sentence id="3378">Why not? </sentence><sentence id="3379">So they established a few small workshops for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3380">And always a German have something...made something for himself, a uniform or shoes; or the...heads of the shop should make appointments with the Germans to come on that particular day, October 13, for appointments between 4 and 5 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="3381">And over there there would be some people which will... which will kill them. </sentence><sentence id="3382">So I know about this plan. </sentence><sentence id="3383">And this should happen between 4 and 5, and the whole lager should look normal. </sentence><sentence id="3384">We should not...we should not use the weapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time. </sentence><sentence id="3385">I remember I was in that time waiting and mine fire place...in mine place...where I burned  7 ..where the oven was. </sentence><sentence id="3386">I pushed all these papers against the window so nobody should be able to look in because in, because in the sides when did people did bring me documents, papers, we threw in in the sides, and the the oven was in the middle, and I just later burn it. </sentence><sentence id="3387">So anyway was a window so I blocked the window and was waiting. </sentence><sentence id="3388">And..uh...now I see a group...uh ... because they were divided. </sentence><sentence id="3389">The organization had about six fighting groups of three people and located in different places in the camp waiting for the Germans to be lured over there. </sentence><sentence id="3390">So I see the group is supposed to come to mine place coming to my direction, to my oven, but they're passing me. </sentence><sentence id="3391">They're going in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="3392">So I was panicky, but pretty soon a Jew called....from _6d_, Sender, comes to me and said, "Tom, they decide not to do anything to your place because the guard...the tower guard was very close." </sentence><sentence id="3393">I was very close to the fence and he could notice a German comes in, doesn't go out and could be suspicious. " </sentence><sentence id="3394">We rather...we'll kill him in the men's storeroom." </sentence><sentence id="3395">Then he told me to go over there, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the gate leading...connecting Lager | and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so- called four lagers, like 1, 2, 3 and 4. </sentence><sentence id="3396">In Lager 1 were the building where they used to sleep and these workshop. </sentence><sentence id="3397">Lager 2 we sorted, and Lager 3 we did burn, and Lager 4, we were building something over there. </sentence><sentence id="3398">So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this gate was very close to the storeroom I just seen them both coming in. </sentence><sentence id="3399">He was called in..in to try on a leather jacket, because it exactly his size. </sentence><sentence id="3400">And he did go in and suspected nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3401">While he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen. </sentence><sentence id="3402">This...the moment he was killed, he did come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming in, the Jewish prisoner said, "Achtung!" </sentence><sentence id="3403">immediately. " </sentence><sentence id="3404">Attention." </sentence><sentence id="3405">And start attention, took this leather jacket and he immediately...he hold it for him and while he put in the hands in the leather jacket, his arms very immobilized like....like in a straight jacket, and he was killed with an ax and we had a first gun. </sentence><sentence id="3406">I was scared up to that point. </sentence><sentence id="3407">I remember when he was killed and the guy who killed him did come out. </sentence><sentence id="3408">He's a little bit blood on his shoe. </sentence><sentence id="3409">He patted his pocket like to say, the gun is here. </sentence><sentence id="3410">I...my whole ...I wasn't scared any more. </sentence><sentence id="3411">I did want only to know what will happen to me a half an hour later. </sentence><sentence id="3412">That I did want to know. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And I...L..I did know there's no way back. </sentence><sentence id="3414">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="3415">They killed...as long as we didn't kill the German, everything could be.... And later they called Beckman, and Beckman I remember he went to...to the door over the barrack and like whatever feeling he did turn around and went back and they killed him anyway in the office. </sentence><sentence id="3416">And to make a long story...and I...and I at that point, I remember there was a little train, like a miners train, for the miners. </sentence><sentence id="3417">Little wagons with a little electric engine. </sentence><sentence id="3418">And the German who was the head of this little train which connected all the Lagers with Lager 3, was already killed. </sentence><sentence id="3419">But inside I notice there's canned food. </sentence><sentence id="3420">So a few cans, put into my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="3421">And I remember I had friend. </sentence><sentence id="3422">Linda Karoten (nh). </sentence><sentence id="3423">Linda ~ And she said. " </sentence><sentence id="3424">Tom. </sentence><sentence id="3425">vou're  8 group did come to me, "Tom, maybe you have some money?" </sentence><sentence id="3426">Because many times when I did burn in my oven the soiled clothing...when the clothing was burned or books, some money did come through in the ashes. </sentence><sentence id="3427">And when I cleaned the ashes, I find some gold always. </sentence><sentence id="3428">It did lose the luster, but it was not.... So...uh...he did know I could have it, so I did give him some money. </sentence><sentence id="3429">And the Germans were killed. </sentence><sentence id="3430">Nobody did know. </sentence><sentence id="3431">I was wondering that...this was like normal. </sentence><sentence id="3432">First of all the Kapos...the Kapos which were...there were two Kapos in the organization...and they were instructed to use the whip to beat us like everyday. </sentence><sentence id="3433">And they have done it. </sentence><sentence id="3434">And I remember like every day, singing. </sentence><sentence id="3435">We went back to Lager 1 for...uh...supper. </sentence><sentence id="3436">And now the biggest shock. </sentence><sentence id="3437">And this was I think was the...the most important ingredients of the success was so few people did know. </sentence><sentence id="3438">There were...we were about 600 people. </sentence><sentence id="3439">And this was the time before the roll call when we stand in line in front of the kitchen to eat. </sentence><sentence id="3440">Believe it or not, practically the whole camp was still like every day standing in the line. </sentence><sentence id="3441">Maybe about 50 people were missing, the people which did know. </sentence><sentence id="3442">But soon one told another one, "Listen, forget about supper. </sentence><sentence id="3443">Something is going on. </sentence><sentence id="3444">Let us grab an ax. </sentence><sentence id="3445">Grab anything and be prepared." </sentence><sentence id="3446">Now the dangerous moment did come because up "til now...the...the Germans were free to go and come. </sentence><sentence id="3447">Each German has a place to watch. </sentence><sentence id="3448">The sorters, where clothing was sorted, there was a German standing. </sentence><sentence id="3449">But he was allowed to go for a cup of coffee or whatever he want. </sentence><sentence id="3450">And another German ...let say...from the shoe sorters, the place they sorted shoes, did come by and he didn't notice the German who's suppose to be by sorting clothing. </sentence><sentence id="3451">He wasn't suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="3452">He thought, "Oh, maybe my friend went for a cup of coffee." </sentence><sentence id="3453">But now, 5:30. </sentence><sentence id="3454">Well, the...the time did come close when all the Germans supposed to be in this place, Lager Ein, to...they witnessed the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="3455">And now if a German is missing, they will look each other. </sentence><sentence id="3456">So we did know that the crucial time is coming and... uh...uh...the line in front of the kitchen start to...to dwindle and I remember a shot and I remember Sasha Pechersky jumping on a table. </sentence><sentence id="3457">And why L...now...a one Kapo whistled a whistle, like for a...like for a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="3458">Normal. </sentence><sentence id="3459">And made it a little bit earlier. </sentence><sentence id="3460">The original plan was actually to march... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3627">Q: Stick with what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3629">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="3630">The original plan was to march out to the front gate, but we heard a shot and the plan was disregarded to march out to the front gate because probably the...the guard wouldn't know what's happened and we could go too close, very close maybe to them also. </sentence><sentence id="3631">But I heard a shot, Sasha jumping on the table and he start to talk, "Listen." </sentence><sentence id="3632">Something in this sense. " </sentence><sentence id="3633">Listen to me." </sentence><sentence id="3634">I remember only one sentence from the whole talk. </sentence><sentence id="3635">It was very short. </sentence><sentence id="3636">"The time did come that we will take revenge. </sentence><sentence id="3637">We killed practical all the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3638">Now let's stood up and fight our way out." </sentence><sentence id="3639">In this sense...but the sentence I remember exactly what he said was: "If someone, if you will survive, he should remember to told...to tell the world the story of Sobibor." </sentence><sentence id="3640">And that what I did never forget, and that what I am doing. </sentence><sentence id="3641">And suddenly...I don't know if this was arranged, prearranged or not, but while he was still talking somebody yelled, "Hoorah!" </sentence><sentence id="3642">from the people standing. </sentence><sentence id="3643">And another one picked up, "Hoorah!"; </sentence><sentence id="3644">and the third one, and suddenly everybody, "Hoorah, Hoorah," and start to run. </sentence><sentence id="3645">I  9 didn't want to carry an ax, so I picked up a knife. </sentence><sentence id="3646">I prepared a knife from before. </sentence><sentence id="3647">It was easy to hide a knife. </sentence><sentence id="3648">Was a knife somebody probably from some...somebody brought us...to Sobibor maybe a rabbi or so...or so, because had pearl handles and the on..on the handle was written Kusheshov Paisach (ph) [NB: Kosher for Pesach]. </sentence><sentence id="3649">It's some kind traditional knife. </sentence><sentence id="3650">Was big, so I took it. </sentence><sentence id="3651">My knife in the hand and start to run with it and biggest group to the gate leading up to Lager 1, and over there I remember one Ukrainian did come by accident...did start to drive in with his bike, and he was thrown immediately from his bike, and I remember the bell was cut immediately with the gun. </sentence><sentence id="3652">And while running through I know... remember and on the left side, a Ukrainian guard with his rifle standing like that...like a...like a fixiated and just turning around himself. </sentence><sentence id="3653">He could use the rifle and shot, but he was handling it like a stick, like somebody hold...hold a can...cane, and just turning around. </sentence><sentence id="3654">He didn't...he didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3655">And I was running to go with the people to the front gate and half way I heard some whistles...shot was all the time, but I heard whistles like from bullets whistling and I noticed and I, on the left side behind a barrack is a German with a machine gun shotting at us. </sentence><sentence id="3656">And here two my friend fall down, another one third. </sentence><sentence id="3657">And I started to back up. </sentence><sentence id="3658">I did run back. </sentence><sentence id="3659">While everybody was running...running to the front, I did run back. </sentence><sentence id="3660">And...uh... some way I find my way to a little gate in a hallway for the guards, because between the fences guards were walking, this time empty. </sentence><sentence id="3661">Probably I went into that gate. </sentence><sentence id="3662">Luckily, I had behind myself...I left one barbed wire fence and another barbed wire fence. </sentence><sentence id="3663">Now | had only one barbed wire fence in minds. </sentence><sentence id="3664">Come to the fence, the last fence...the freedom is, only the fence. </sentence><sentence id="3665">I can't go through because I had a knife. </sentence><sentence id="3666">If I had a ax I would cut a hole. </sentence><sentence id="3667">Instead, I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3668">And here close me was Sasha Pechersky and Shlomo Szmajzner [NB: Stanislaw Szmajzner; surname also spelled Sjmyzner]. </sentence><sentence id="3669">Now, Shlomo Szmajzner had a rifle, and I remember what...this a minute later. </sentence><sentence id="3670">And Sasha was with a knife only. </sentence><sentence id="3671">And sudden, and suddenly a man appeared with a...with a ax and start to cut. </sentence><sentence id="3672">He made a hole in...in the fence. </sentence><sentence id="3673">Now...but more and more people come and they don't wait in the line when machine guns are shotting at us to go through the hole. </sentence><sentence id="3674">They start to climb on top of the fence. </sentence><sentence id="3675">In that time exactly when I was halfway going through the hole, the fence collapsed from the heaviness of the...of the...from the weight of the people which actually I thought that time...and it was over me, and that time I thought this is the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="3676">But actually, this saved me. </sentence><sentence id="3677">Because the first few went through I could see why the people is depending on me. </sentence><sentence id="3678">The mines exploding and bodies flowing there. </sentence><sentence id="3679">And finally when...when everybody when through at least at that part of the fence and I can't go out...from ...from the fence because the barbed wire did go in in the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="3680">So I left my coat. </sentence><sentence id="3681">By the way, I had a leather coat from...I took it the last minute from the storeroom. </sentence><sentence id="3682">It was also maybe lucky because the...the barbed wire wasn't able to go in too deep to the...my shirt or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3683">Anyway, I just slid out from under my coat and start to run. </sentence><sentence id="3684">I fall down a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="3685">I thought I'm shot and I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="3686">I start to run until I reached the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3687">Now, I'll really speed up. </sentence><sentence id="3688">Come to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3689">We are wandering about the day, the next day we come to a point and we under...I already understood that it's not good to run there. </sentence><sentence id="3690">We are about 50 people. </sentence><sentence id="3691">The next day we met another 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="3692">So, and I've seen  0 that we are too many and must...something must be done. </sentence><sentence id="3693">But...uh...we still kept together until one...until early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="3694">I remember we stopped out of the forest and Sasha said that we must go out to check where we are, and they need money. </sentence><sentence id="3695">So whoever had the money to give money to buy food. </sentence><sentence id="3696">And all the men with rifles did left. </sentence><sentence id="3697">Nine people with weapons left. </sentence><sentence id="3698">We were against it. </sentence><sentence id="3699">We understood that something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3700">Only Shlomo Szmajzner was left, only because the rest of us surrounded him that we must have a guy with arifle left. </sentence><sentence id="3701">And he promised he will come back. </sentence><sentence id="3702">He did never come back. </sentence><sentence id="3703">I talked with him later after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3704">Or maybe I shouldn't go into this. </sentence><sentence id="3705">He said when I met him that this was his soldier duty to go back to...to the army. </sentence><sentence id="3706">Anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3707">So when he left there was real tragedies because groups start to form. </sentence><sentence id="3708">The weak people did want to go with the strong ones. </sentence><sentence id="3709">And it was unforgettable...unforgettable scenes, which I won't even to go in it. </sentence><sentence id="3710">Finally, I took two boys and we left. </sentence><sentence id="3711">Shmuel Wycen [NB: Samuel Weitzen], who used to work with me as a fireman, and his friend, Kostman, Fredrick. </sentence><sentence id="3712">We eluded the guards. </sentence><sentence id="3713">We eluded the...the Germans and we made it to mine hometown, Izbica. </sentence><sentence id="3714">Over there, I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will hide us. </sentence><sentence id="3715">The two boys didn't want to go into the town. </sentence><sentence id="3716">They were in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3717">But I left to the town in the evening, hoping that nobody will recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="3718">It was sort of dark. </sentence><sentence id="3719">I come to the Polish lady. </sentence><sentence id="3720">She didn't want to hide me. </sentence><sentence id="3721">So I left back and told the guys, "Listen, it's no way. </sentence><sentence id="3722">We must look for another place. </sentence><sentence id="3723">But you know what? </sentence><sentence id="3724">Let go first eat. </sentence><sentence id="3725">We're hungry. </sentence><sentence id="3726">Come." </sentence><sentence id="3727">Not far, we have seen light from a little farm. </sentence><sentence id="3728">And we go to this farm. </sentence><sentence id="3729">We were afraid to go in the villages. </sentence><sentence id="3730">But these were farms..were little farms...little houses ... uh...single houses. </sentence><sentence id="3731">So we were not as...not as scared so much. </sentence><sentence id="3732">We went into this little house, little farm, we have seen from the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3733">We come. </sentence><sentence id="3734">There's light. </sentence><sentence id="3735">We go into the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="3736">There's food on the table, but no people. </sentence><sentence id="3737">We call...I call, "Farmer, Farmer." </sentence><sentence id="3738">In Polish: "Dzier_awca." </sentence><sentence id="3739">Nobody answered. </sentence><sentence id="3740">Finally, we go back to this room and start to eat. </sentence><sentence id="3741">We go back out again and finally, I see a little boy. </sentence><sentence id="3742">We asked him, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="3743">Come here. </sentence><sentence id="3744">Where your father?" </sentence><sentence id="3745">And he comes. </sentence><sentence id="3746">He recognized we are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3747">And he said, "Oh, my father and mother are scared. </sentence><sentence id="3748">They thought you are...you are bandits. </sentence><sentence id="3749">And they're robbing so much here." </sentence><sentence
