[ </sentence><sentence id="60">Urisha (ph)] is a house because it was built maybe 50, 80 years ago by my grand, grand, grandparents and later when the children did get grandchildren, they get married and so on, they divided this house. </sentence><sentence id="61">So...uh...finally when L...was already over there, when I was about 10 years old, this whole house was divided with partitions that everybody could hear everybody across the wall. </sentence><sentence id="62">So mine...mine aunt did hear me...did hear the conversation with my dad and she noticed by listening in that time, I'm eating pork meat. </sentence><sentence id="63">So what...the next thing I remember she opened the door where my father lived and said, "Tom." " </sentence><sentence id="64">Toivi," not "Tom." </sentence><sentence id="65">Not Tom. </sentence><sentence id="66">"Toivi, you eat pork meat?" </sentence><sentence id="67">I said, "Yes, Mimi, I ate."

" </sentence><sentence id="187">Oh, there're two German soldiers still in the bakery buying bread." </sentence><sentence id="188">So I went to the bakery and I seen in front of them two German soldiers with bikes and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because German is pretty close to Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="189">So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my language. ( </sentence><sentence id="190">laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them. </sentence><sentence id="191">We did talk a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="192">| Yiddish and they're German. </sentence><sentence id="193">There's nothing wrong with it. </sentence><sentence id="194">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh...A day later the Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="196">What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later did...did come to agreement about the...the demarcation line, and they moved out. </sentence><sentence id="197">And the Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="198">In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they were in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="199">The Russians are leaving again. </sentence><sentence id="200">The Germans are coming. </sentence><sentence id="201">So again what should we do? </sentence><sentence id="202">My mother told my father, "Listen, Let go out. </sentence><sentence id="203">I know Russian. </sentence><sentence id="204">I know the language. </sentence><sentence id="205">Let go out from here." </sentence><sentence id="206">And my father said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="207">Actually he bought a horse and carriage already. </sentence><sentence id="208">And later he said, "No, I was born here. </sentence><sentence id="209">I could die here." </sentence><sentence id="210"> And my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="211">He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's army...uh...uh...in the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="212">He was wounded. </sentence><sentence id="213">He was a invalid. </sentence><sentence id="214">And...uh...which was, you know, a very horrible in that time. </sentence><sentence id="215">So he...and he said, no, he will stay here. </sentence><sentence id="216">He was born here and he...he could die here. </sentence><sentence id="217">And he stayed. </sentence><sentence id="218">And this was...and this sealed our future, our destiny. </sentence><sentence id="219">So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close by the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east. </sentence><sentence id="220">And I was a child 12 years old, but I felt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="221">We should go. </sentence><sentence id="222">But we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="223">The Russians left and Izbica was a no-man's land. </sentence><sentence id="224">No Russians. </sentence><sentence id="225">No Germans. </sentence><sentence id="226">The Germans did come. </sentence><sentence id="227">But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before Izbica in a district town of Krasnystaw. </sentence><sentence id="228">Izbica was nobody. </sentence><sentence id="229">So two...the third night, sitting in my room I hear a big explosion. </sentence><sentence id="230">And suddenly screaming, yelling, "What's happened?" </sentence><sentence id="231">A group of Jews stood on the street outside talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them. </sentence><sentence id="232">And they killed a few and they wounded a few. </sentence><sentence id="233">So we start to be terrorized by the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="234">So people were scared to go outside the town and there's another legation did form, a Jewish delegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein. </sentence><sentence id="235">Still I remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="236">By the way, this is the same, this is my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat... shouldn't eat unkosher. </sentence><sentence id="237">Under...under her leadership, they went to Krasnystaw. </sentence><sentence id="238">Actually, to invite Germans to come to Izbica because it...it is no law in Izbica and we are afraid and that they must come in. </sentence><sentence id="239">So Germans did come into Izbica to protect the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="240">No, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days. </sentence><sentence id="241">There were simple Wehrmacht soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="242">And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local command...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the streets so they were pretty quiet. </sentence><sentence id="243">As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="244">I remember a...kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff. </sentence><sentence id="245">It...it was rather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived. </sentence><sentence id="246">There were two of them. </sentence><sentence id="247">Ludwig Klein and Karl Engels. </sentence><sentence id="248">Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="249">They both committed suicide in...in Hamburg after the war, being in jail. </sentence><sentence id="250">Well, anyway, these two SS were a terror in Izbica. </sentence><sentence id="251">Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five, ten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="252">It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized, finally, that we have no rights. </sentence><sentence id="253">And many times we wished that if the first Germans which arrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the town, it would be a blessing because everybody would escape with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="254">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="255">In the beginning!But, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called. </sentence><sentence id="256">So...now it was too late, and we were in a trap. </sentence><sentence id="257">In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="258">There were still families. </sentence><sentence id="259">Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was possible to live. </sentence><sentence id="260">There were...uh...there were labor camps and Jews were forced to go to work in labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="261">In the beginning, they were forced to work on the streets from 8 o'clock in the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released home. </sentence><sentence id="262">Later, as I said,  there were labor camps where they went out for a month or for a week. </sentence><sentence id="263">They worked. </sentence><sentence id="264">Later they...they were exchanged. </sentence><sentence id="265">New Jews did come and they were let home. </sentence><sentence id="266">Uh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans in that time established Jewish Councils, so-called "Judenrat." </sentence><sentence id="267">And through the Judenrat, they were able to execute their orders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the labor camps and the Judenrat also after a month or so sent new people. </sentence><sentence id="268">The old ones...the first ones should be released. </sentence><sentence id="269">So it wasn't a order. </sentence><sentence id="270">Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for one month to the labor. </sentence><sentence id="271">But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the poor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go. </sentence><sentence id="272">But as the time progressed, it was worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="273">We heard about beating. </sentence><sentence id="274">We heard about torture, and people refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="275">In that time the first so-called "Aktions" happened. " </sentence><sentence id="276">Aktion" is a roundup. </sentence><sentence id="277">It started with roundups to the labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="278">They would come in the morning and told the Jewish Council to deliver 500 men or 200 men. </sentence><sentence id="279">If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their own police, they started indiscrimate to go from house to house, beat, shot... Ukrainians, which worked with the Nazis together. </sentence><sentence id="280">And they...they caught...they simple caught people on the streets "til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="409">Q: What were you and your parents doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: I was a goy in____ the picture and later got to the ____. </sentence><sentence id="412">So in that time, I was already in danger. </sentence><sentence id="413">I was, of course, 12, 13 years old, 13. </sentence><sentence id="414">So my father looked for protection. </sentence><sentence id="415">What about my family in that time? </sentence><sentence id="416">My mother, of course, was a housewife. </sentence><sentence id="417">My father lost his business, He had from before, as a legionnaire, he had a liquor store business, so-called "monopol koncesja" in Poland, uh...as a veteran from the legionnaires. </sentence><sentence id="418">Lost my [NB: his] business, but still he was able to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="419">He was very well known. </sentence><sentence id="420">He has done some business with the Polish farmer, even if it was illegal; but he did look to protect me. </sentence><sentence id="421">So he made a deal with a Pole of German origin, Mr. [Platow (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="422">Mr. [Platow (ph)] had a blacksmith shop. </sentence><sentence id="423">He made with him a deal that I will work for him. </sentence><sentence id="424">So I should be employed in case the Germans are looking unemployed, because in the beginning they took so-called unemployed Jews. </sentence><sentence id="425">I went to work about 8 o'clock in the morning til 5:00. </sentence><sentence id="426">It was hard work because in that time we had a lathe, I remember; and the lathe, it's not like now--you put in an electric motor, and the lathe is running. </sentence><sentence id="427">I did need to move everything by myself, and many times I thought I...I will collapse but then my boss said, "You turn. </sentence><sentence id="428">Just turn." </sentence><sentence id="429">And I thought I...I must turn because this is my protection. </sentence><sentence id="430">I must turn the wheel even if I wasn't able to breath anymore. </sentence><sentence id="431">But I managed. ( </sentence><sentence id="432">Pause) When the Gestapo arrived, they went...they had two motorcycles and a car and they...and they need a repair shop. </sentence><sentence id="433">So they went to another mechanic, blacksmith. </sentence><sentence id="434">His name was [Solecky (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="435">And the motorcycles were over there, always, for the night to be cleaned or the car was over there...the Gestapo car. </sentence><sentence id="436">And once in the evening I was going by, the boss, Mr. [Solecky (ph)] from this...uh...repair shop  told me, "Tom, would you like to help me? </sentence><sentence id="437">I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put together a motorcycle." </sentence><sentence id="438">So I said, "Okay, I will just tell my dad." </sentence><sentence id="439">Told my dad that I will be a whole night working in Mr. [Solecky's (ph)]...I will call it from now on "garage," because Americans are familiar with what a...what a garage is. </sentence><sentence id="440">And while I was working next day, he said...[Solecky (ph)]..."Listen, why don't you work with me. </sentence><sentence id="441">Leave Mr. [Platow (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="442">Come to me." </sentence><sentence id="443">And I thought it was a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="444">First of all, I will be protected by Gestapo, clean the motorcycles, and I agreed. </sentence><sentence id="445">And from that time on, I started to work...uh...for Mr. [Solecky (ph)] and it was dangerous because the motorcycles of the Gestapo need to be cleaned, you know, spotless. </sentence><sentence id="446">And I worked very hard and I done a good job. </sentence><sentence id="447">And as I see it now, it was a good choice because later when the death camps did come, I was protected practically...practically the last minute, and I was able to see how town is sinking down, myself being protected. </sentence><sentence id="448">I didn't need to hide like another people that hide in that time. </sentence><sentence id="449">I've seen it. </sentence><sentence id="450">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="451">Going back to the labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="452">Suddenly, transports arrived from...uh...Pozna_...from west...from the western part of Poland...Pozna_, Ko_o, Konin, and lot of Jews arrived; we divided...the Judenrat divided the people to different houses and that time I did get very close with...uh...[Jussik Bresler (ph)], who was...uh...a dentist's son from Ko_o. </sentence><sentence id="453">In our place used to live a man, his name was Kohn, with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="454">Once I remember...it was the evening...I still remember my mother standing close...close to the window with Mr. Kohn and his wife, and discussing a letter. </sentence><sentence id="455">And I listen: "gassing people, gassing....". </sentence><sentence id="456">And my mother I remember saying, "It's impossible. </sentence><sentence id="457">It's a fantasy. </sentence><sentence id="458">Can't be." </sentence><sentence id="459">So a lot of time parents don't even realize how much children could listen in, pretending doing something else. </sentence><sentence id="460">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="461">What I understood, and later I find out more is Miss [Mrs.] Kohn, received a letter from her son in Ko_o, which was still in Ko_o, that in a place called Chelmno, they're gassing people. </sentence><sentence id="462">He wrote about this. </sentence><sentence id="463">But, as I said, it was dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="464">By the way, her son who wrote the letter survived and he lives in [Holland (ph)], in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="465">And I later talked to him when I went to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="466">And I was in the South, reminding him about this letter he wrote. </sentence><sentence id="467">Anyway, so this was a bad signal, but later quiet down. </sentence><sentence id="468">At least I didn't hear...at least I didn't hear anything. </sentence><sentence id="469">But once was some "Akcja." </sentence><sentence id="470">The SS arrived in the morning, did...uh...asked the Judenrat to deliver 2,000 people to the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="471">And the Judenrat did go home to home and delivered, but a lot of people already were afraid about the torture, about the beating, and hide. </sentence><sentence id="472">So the Nazis themselves start to look for them and collected them in the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="473">After such a "Aktion," after the...uh...the desired amount of Jews were concentrated in the marketplace, everybody else could go out and uh...town was like normal. </sentence><sentence id="474">The people were over there, then later they were taken to the station, there were already wagons for them loaded and taken away. </sentence><sentence id="475">Like they took them away before to labor camps close to Zamo _...was a labor...labor camp, [Mokre Zdanow (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="476">They left. </sentence><sentence id="477">But usual, in a case like this, they took away some family...family members, and the family  which was left usual...usually sent some Poles, Christian Pole, a friend, to go after the train to see the destination. </sentence><sentence id="478">And so after this transport left, some people...Polish people went after them with a bike or with...uh...either way, with another train tracing this train. </sentence><sentence id="479">The same night...uh...I...a day later, | remember I was at home and I heard some knocking in the window. </sentence><sentence id="480">It was already after the curfew...curfew time. </sentence><sentence id="481">But nevertheless, many times I did sneak out after curfew time. </sentence><sentence id="482">But I hear some knocking, and as I go to the window and...uh...there was a knock like I had...uh when I went to my friend [Jussik (ph)], I knock the same way...three times long and three times short it was. </sentence><sentence id="483">I recognize as my friend [Jussik (ph)] from...from Ko_o. </sentence><sentence id="484">So I opened the door, go out, sneak out, you know, because Jews are not allowed outside, and hidden behind this house I say...I noticed [Jussik (ph)] standing by. </sentence><sentence id="485">I said, "[Jussik (ph)], What's the urgency? </sentence><sentence id="486">What is so..." "Tom, I must tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="487">Tom, you remember [Ruza (ph)]?" </sentence><sentence id="488">I said, "Yes."

" </sentence><sentence id="1628">Herr Lippmann," so he immediately stood up and they told him, "Take your stuff and come with us. </sentence><sentence id="1629">Please take your stuff." </sentence><sentence id="1630">And so he took whatever he had with him and another look around and they asked Mr. Krewl (ph) ...

" </sentence><sentence id="3738">We rather...we'll kill him in the men's storeroom." </sentence><sentence id="3739">Then he told me to go over there, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the gate leading...connecting Lager | and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so- called four lagers, like 1, 2, 3 and 4. </sentence><sentence id="3740">In Lager 1 were the building where they used to sleep and these workshop. </sentence><sentence id="3741">Lager 2 we sorted, and Lager 3 we did burn, and Lager 4, we were building something over there. </sentence><sentence id="3742">So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this gate was very close to the storeroom I just seen them both coming in. </sentence><sentence id="3743">He was called in..in to try on a leather jacket, because it exactly his size. </sentence><sentence id="3744">And he did go in and suspected nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3745">While he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen. </sentence><sentence id="3746">This...the moment he was killed, he did come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming in, the Jewish prisoner said, "Achtung!" </sentence><sentence id="3747">immediately.

And later they called Beckman, and Beckman I remember he went to...to the door over the barrack and like whatever feeling he did turn around and went back and they killed him anyway in the office. </sentence><sentence id="3760">And to make a long story...and I...and I at that point, I remember there was a little train, like a miners train, for the miners. </sentence><sentence id="3761">Little wagons with a little electric engine. </sentence><sentence id="3762">And the German who was the head of this little train which connected all the Lagers with Lager 3, was already killed. </sentence><sentence id="3763">But inside I notice there's canned food. </sentence><sentence id="3764">So a few cans, put into my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="3765">And I remember I had friend, Linda Karoten (ph), Linda . </sentence><sentence id="3766">And she said, "Tom, you're preparing like for a picnic." </sentence><sentence id="3767">And I said, "If we will survive we will need it." </sentence><sentence id="3768">And later I...L..] eat. </sentence><sentence id="3769">I ran in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3770">I reminded him this, that he said I'm preparing like a picnic because we used it later. </sentence><sentence id="3771">We're so hungry and I had it. </sentence><sentence id="3772">Anyway, now I remember the foreman was a French Jew...Jacov Dunietz [NB: Joseph Dunietz], and the foreman from the  8 group did come to me, "Tom, maybe you have some money?" </sentence><sentence id="3773">Because many times when I did burn in my oven the soiled clothing...when the clothing was burned or books, some money did come through in the ashes. </sentence><sentence id="3774">And when I cleaned the ashes, I find some gold always. </sentence><sentence id="3775">It did lose the luster, but it was not....

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3977">Q: Stick with what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3979">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="3980">The original plan was to march out to the front gate, but we heard a shot and the plan was disregarded to march out to the front gate because probably the...the guard wouldn't know what's happened and we could go too close, very close maybe to them also. </sentence><sentence id="3981">But I heard a shot, Sasha jumping on the table and he start to talk, "Listen." </sentence><sentence id="3982">Something in this sense. " </sentence><sentence id="3983">Listen to me." </sentence><sentence id="3984">I remember only one sentence from the whole talk. </sentence><sentence id="3985">It was very short. </sentence><sentence id="3986">"The time did come that we will take revenge. </sentence><sentence id="3987">We killed practical all the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3988">Now let's stood up and fight our way out." </sentence><sentence id="3989">In this sense...but the sentence I remember exactly what he said was: "If someone, if you will survive, he should remember to told...to tell the world the story of Sobibor." </sentence><sentence id="3990">And that what I did never forget, and that what I am doing. </sentence><sentence id="3991">And suddenly...I don't know if this was arranged, prearranged or not, but while he was still talking somebody yelled, "Hoorah!" </sentence><sentence id="3992">from the people standing. </sentence><sentence id="3993">And another one picked up, "Hoorah!"; </sentence><sentence id="3994">and the third one, and suddenly everybody, "Hoorah, Hoorah," and start to run. </sentence><sentence id="3995">I  9 didn't want to carry an ax, so I picked up a knife. </sentence><sentence id="3996">I prepared a knife from before. </sentence><sentence id="3997">It was easy to hide a knife. </sentence><sentence id="3998">Was a knife somebody probably from some...somebody brought us...to Sobibor maybe a rabbi or so...or so, because had pearl handles and the on..on the handle was written Kusheshov Paisach (ph) [NB: Kosher for Pesach]. </sentence><sentence id="3999">It's some kind traditional knife. </sentence><sentence id="4000">Was big, so I took it. </sentence><sentence id="4001">My knife in the hand and start to run with it and biggest group to the gate leading up to Lager 1, and over there I remember one Ukrainian did come by accident...did start to drive in with his bike, and he was thrown immediately from his bike, and I remember the bell was cut immediately with the gun. </sentence><sentence id="4002">And while running through I know... remember and on the left side, a Ukrainian guard with his rifle standing like that...like a...like a fixiated and just turning around himself. </sentence><sentence id="4003">He could use the rifle and shot, but he was handling it like a stick, like somebody hold...hold a can...cane, and just turning around. </sentence><sentence id="4004">He didn't...he didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="4005">And I was running to go with the people to the front gate and half way I heard some whistles...shot was all the time, but I heard whistles like from bullets whistling and I noticed and I, on the left side behind a barrack is a German with a machine gun shotting at us. </sentence><sentence id="4006">And here two my friend fall down, another one third. </sentence><sentence id="4007">And I started to back up. </sentence><sentence id="4008">I did run back. </sentence><sentence id="4009">While everybody was running...running to the front, I did run back. </sentence><sentence id="4010">And...uh... some way I find my way to a little gate in a hallway for the guards, because between the fences guards were walking, this time empty. </sentence><sentence id="4011">Probably I went into that gate. </sentence><sentence id="4012">Luckily, I had behind myself...I left one barbed wire fence and another barbed wire fence. </sentence><sentence id="4013">Now | had only one barbed wire fence in minds. </sentence><sentence id="4014">Come to the fence, the last fence...the freedom is, only the fence. </sentence><sentence id="4015">I can't go through because I had a knife. </sentence><sentence id="4016">If I had a ax I would cut a hole. </sentence><sentence id="4017">Instead, I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="4018">And here close me was Sasha Pechersky and Shlomo Szmajzner [NB: Stanislaw Szmajzner; surname also spelled Sjmyzner]. </sentence><sentence id="4019">Now, Shlomo Szmajzner had a rifle, and I remember what...this a minute later. </sentence><sentence id="4020">And Sasha was with a knife only. </sentence><sentence id="4021">And sudden, and suddenly a man appeared with a...with a ax and start to cut. </sentence><sentence id="4022">He made a hole in...in the fence. </sentence><sentence id="4023">Now...but more and more people come and they don't wait in the line when machine guns are shotting at us to go through the hole. </sentence><sentence id="4024">They start to climb on top of the fence. </sentence><sentence id="4025">In that time exactly when I was halfway going through the hole, the fence collapsed from the heaviness of the...of the...from the weight of the people which actually I thought that time...and it was over me, and that time I thought this is the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="4026">But actually, this saved me. </sentence><sentence id="4027">Because the first few went through I could see why the people is depending on me. </sentence><sentence id="4028">The mines exploding and bodies flowing there. </sentence><sentence id="4029">And finally when...when everybody when through at least at that part of the fence and I can't go out...from ...from the fence because the barbed wire did go in in the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="4030">So I left my coat. </sentence><sentence id="4031">By the way, I had a leather coat from...I took it the last minute from the storeroom. </sentence><sentence id="4032">It was also maybe lucky because the...the barbed wire wasn't able to go in too deep to the...my shirt or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4033">Anyway, I just slid out from under my coat and start to run. </sentence><sentence id="4034">I fall down a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="4035">I thought I'm shot and I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="4036">I start to run until I reached the forest. </sentence><sentence id="4037">Now, I'll really speed up. </sentence><sentence id="4038">Come to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="4039">We are wandering about the day, the next day we come to a point and we under...I already understood that it's not good to run there. </sentence><sentence id="4040">We are about 50 people. </sentence><sentence id="4041">The next day we met another 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="4042">So, and I've seen  0 that we are too many and must...something must be done. </sentence><sentence id="4043">But...uh...we still kept together until one...until early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="4044">I remember we stopped out of the forest and Sasha said that we must go out to check where we are, and they need money. </sentence><sentence id="4045">So whoever had the money to give money to buy food. </sentence><sentence id="4046">And all the men with rifles did left. </sentence><sentence id="4047">Nine people with weapons left. </sentence><sentence id="4048">We were against it. </sentence><sentence id="4049">We understood that something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="4050">Only Shlomo Szmajzner was left, only because the rest of us surrounded him that we must have a guy with arifle left. </sentence><sentence id="4051">And he promised he will come back. </sentence><sentence id="4052">He did never come back. </sentence><sentence id="4053">I talked with him later after the war. </sentence><sentence id="4054">Or maybe I shouldn't go into this. </sentence><sentence id="4055">He said when I met him that this was his soldier duty to go back to...to the army. </sentence><sentence id="4056">Anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4057">So when he left there was real tragedies because groups start to form. </sentence><sentence id="4058">The weak people did want to go with the strong ones. </sentence><sentence id="4059">And it was unforgettable...unforgettable scenes, which I won't even to go in it. </sentence><sentence id="4060">Finally, I took two boys and we left. </sentence><sentence id="4061">Shmuel Wycen [NB: Samuel Weitzen], who used to work with me as a fireman, and his friend, Kostman, Fredrick. </sentence><sentence id="4062">We eluded the guards. </sentence><sentence id="4063">We eluded the...the Germans and we made it to mine hometown, Izbica. </sentence><sentence id="4064">Over there, I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will hide us. </sentence><sentence id="4065">The two boys didn't want to go into the town. </sentence><sentence id="4066">They were in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="4067">But I left to the town in the evening, hoping that nobody will recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="4068">It was sort of dark. </sentence><sentence id="4069">I come to the Polish lady. </sentence><sentence id="4070">She didn't want to hide me. </sentence><sentence id="4071">So I left back and told the guys, "Listen, it's no way. </sentence><sentence id="4072">We must look for another place. </sentence><sentence id="4073">But you know what? </sentence><sentence id="4074">Let go first eat. </sentence><sentence id="4075">We're hungry. </sentence><sentence id="4076">Come."
