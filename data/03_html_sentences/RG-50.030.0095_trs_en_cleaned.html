" </sentence><sentence id="7">Your's father's name, religion, profession. </sentence><sentence id="8">What do you manufacture?" " </sentence><sentence id="9">He manufactures matzahs." </sentence><sentence id="10">So it didn't last very long. </sentence><sentence id="11">And I got into trouble, and got into fights, through the old blood libel. </sentence><sentence id="12">"Your father kills Christian babies for Passover!" </sentence><sentence id="13">Right. </sentence><sentence id="14">I experienced that quite often. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Do you remember the first time that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: I think it might have been--I might be off about a year--the second or third year, the second or third grade, possibly. </sentence><sentence id="30">I must have been around 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years old; 10 years old, that period. </sentence><sentence id="31">So it was already before "33, because I think I was 12 years old in 1933 when Hitler came to power. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: Can you tell me about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: I cannot remember the distinct incident. </sentence><sentence id="42">All I know, the things usually happened during recess. </sentence><sentence id="43">The school was Gaudic (ph) School. </sentence><sentence id="44">Yes, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="45">Gaudic School was the name. </sentence><sentence id="46">And during recess, I was out with the other boys; and somebody starts the trouble, and starts calling you that. </sentence><sentence id="47">And I was very feisty. </sentence><sentence id="48">And as soon as somebody started calling me names, I was swinging. </sentence><sentence id="49">And there were bloody noses. </sentence><sentence id="50">The next thing happened, I was in the principal's office. </sentence><sentence id="51">Then my parents were called. </sentence><sentence id="52">That happened so often, I don't know anymore when the first time was. </sentence><sentence id="53">And my grades suffered. </sentence><sentence id="54">And I refused to do school work. </sentence><sentence id="55">And then my parents were called. </sentence><sentence id="56">And the teachers and the principal said, in German, (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="57">I cannot translate it. </sentence><sentence id="58">He is telling it; but lazy beyond, because I refused to work. </sentence><sentence id="59">I refused to. </sentence><sentence id="60">It became later, of course, even more pronounced after the Hitler period. </sentence><sentence id="61">When we had the assembly. </sentence><sentence id="62">We had to stand at attention and salute the flag and sing the Horst Wessel song. </sentence><sentence id="63">I tried not to raise my hand. </sentence><sentence id="64">And this led to complications and problems. </sentence><sentence id="65">Then I was forced to. </sentence><sentence id="66">It sometimes reminds me today, when I saw the conditions, when we are also forced to go through certain procedures. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: When you faced insults at school, did you try to bring the subject up with your parents or with your sister, for example? </sentence><sentence id="95">Did you ever talk to them about it? </sentence><sentence id="96">Or did you keep it to  yourself? </sentence><sentence id="97">How were these matters touched on at home or weren't they touched on at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: I think early on I must have mentioned something to my sister; but I learned early on that this was a part of growing up as a Jew and in a European country. </sentence><sentence id="103">In a country that has seen anti- Semitism forever. </sentence><sentence id="104">So it was all part of it, and you learn it, and I was not surprised by it anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Your father, I believe, was a World War I veteran. </sentence><sentence id="109">How did he feel about Germany and how did he feel about things like this? </sentence><sentence id="110">Did he ever talk about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: I don't remember talking to my father about it. </sentence><sentence id="115">No. </sentence><sentence id="116">I might have, but I don't remember it. </sentence><sentence id="117">You see, until very recently, until about a year ago, I had a total memory block. </sentence><sentence id="118">And I went to several psychiatrists and psychologists in my home town, in Indianapolis. </sentence><sentence id="119">I didn't...when we were negotiating with the Germany government for restitution, loss of property, loss of education, and all that, I could not fill in all the lengthy questionnaires that I was sent by the German government; because I didn't remember the name of the school I attended, I didn't remember the name of the street I lived on. </sentence><sentence id="120">And if it wouldn't have been followed by a brother, I wouldn't have got a penny. </sentence><sentence id="121">About a year ago, I started writing about it and things started coming back more and more, but there is still some, some blocks there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Can you remember the very first time you ever heard about Hitler, not necessarily 1933? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="132">What did he mean to you very early on as a child? </sentence><sentence id="133">Was it ever discussed at home or amongst your friends or other Jewish families that you knew? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: Well, all I can tell you is that--(cough) excuse me--I should proceed that by saying that I considered myself almost a German, foremost. </sentence><sentence id="135">I had heard about Zionism, and we negated it. </sentence><sentence id="136">I was a German of the Jewish faith. </sentence><sentence id="137">So were my parents. </sentence><sentence id="138">As you said, my father was a veteran of World War I. And when we heard about the Nazis, it was a passing political phenomena. </sentence><sentence id="139">Like many policies. </sentence><sentence id="140">I do remember once, I don't know when it was, some bloody street fights between a communist and the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="141">And I do remember as if it was some sort of pin (ph); and several of my friends, maybe my parents, belonged to the SDP (Social Democratic Party) , which was a majority party, sent . </sentence><sentence id="142">And others wore the Nazi emblem, the Communist emblem, and more than once, I saw the street flights that really were something to behold as far as violence is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="143">Nothing to compare with today, unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="144">But, it was just another party that came into power. </sentence><sentence id="145">I think the Jews by in large were perhaps divided into two camps - the pessimists and the optimists. </sentence><sentence id="146">There were some pessimists that picked up and left in the "30's. </sentence><sentence id="147">All our friends, my families, relatives, couldn't even conceive of leaving in the mid "30's. </sentence><sentence id="148">Why? </sentence><sentence id="149">Everybody lived in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="150">Your parents lived there. </sentence><sentence id="151">Your grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="152">Been there for generations who had a vital business. </sentence><sentence id="153">Why would anybody seriously consider leaving? </sentence><sentence id="154">And the Nazis developed their methods so slowly, very slowly, that at least from my perspective, whatever little I remember, there was no forewarning of what was to come. </sentence><sentence id="155">We look at it today with the perspective of hindsight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: When did it first impinge on you? </sentence><sentence id="179">When did you first yourself notice the Nazis or feel that  maybe the Nazis were affecting you. </sentence><sentence id="180">Not the street fights? </sentence><sentence id="181">But you yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: I think that was the outgrowth of the Nuremberg...the Nuremberg Laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: It would help me considerably, rather than just answering my question, if you could say something like, "I remember this for me started in Europe." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Okay, I think it was...[ remember it when I was told I could no longer do certain things. </sentence><sentence id="191">I could no longer participate in sports, contact sports. </sentence><sentence id="192">Uh, soccor. </sentence><sentence id="193">I could no longer participate, unless the ski team--I did considerable ski racing; slalom and long distance. </sentence><sentence id="194">I could... It really hit me I wanted to go to the opera. </sentence><sentence id="195">I was no longer permitted to go to the opera. </sentence><sentence id="196">I saw the sign "Jews are Forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="197">Prohibited to Jews." </sentence><sentence id="198">Wherever we went, we saw more and more of the signs. </sentence><sentence id="199">That is when it really hit me that I was not just a German of the Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="200">I was different. </sentence><sentence id="201">Which, until that period, it really hadn't sunk in. </sentence><sentence id="202">But then it did. </sentence><sentence id="203">So it was in the mid "30's that I realized that the vise had tightened a little bit, and we were made to stand out and we were different. </sentence><sentence id="204">And made to suffer for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Were you made to feel different in the street? </sentence><sentence id="221">You weren't allowed to go, how did people respond to you? </sentence><sentence id="222">Did you find it on a personal level that things were changing? </sentence><sentence id="223">Tell me something about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: Well, on a personal level, I felt it in school and in sports and when you wanted to participate in certain public events. </sentence><sentence id="229">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="230">So many areas were restricted. </sentence><sentence id="231">I think that is the only way I can remember it. </sentence><sentence id="232">I was still active in a very disciplined, highly disciplined, semi-militaristic youth organization, Jewish youth organization by the name of Scwartzefahnlein--Black Pennant [Ger: "Black Squad"). </sentence><sentence id="233">I joined it when I was about 8 and one half years old. </sentence><sentence id="234">And as I said, it was a rather militaristic pseudo-scouting organization. </sentence><sentence id="235">And this is when I had really my best times. </sentence><sentence id="236">I enjoyed life tremendously. </sentence><sentence id="237">And I have many, some fond memories. </sentence><sentence id="238">In retrospect, I am surprised that my parents let me go on a 6 weeks hike when I was 8 and one half years old. </sentence><sentence id="239">It was compared to scouting standards, very tough, just to get to scout. </sentence><sentence id="240">I believe I was let loose in the middle of of the woods at night, and find your way home. </sentence><sentence id="241">This sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="242">And we tramped...hiked all of the way from Breslau [Pol: Wroc_aw] north to the Baltic Sea, then took a freighter around to bypass a Polish corridor, to the lake area of east of Poland--as the Polish called it--and hiked to an island where we stayed for 4 weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: This was a Jewish youth organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends at this time. </sentence><sentence id="263">Did they change at the time of Nuremberg, or didn't you have any non-Jewish friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: Iam glad you asked that. </sentence><sentence id="267">I did have non-Jewish friends, up to about "35. </sentence><sentence id="268">After that, I was absolutely ostracized. </sentence><sentence id="269">I lost all friends I had. </sentence><sentence id="270">I did not exist anymore for my non-Jewish  friends. </sentence><sentence id="271">They wouldn't dare to be seen with a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Did they say anything to you at all? </sentence><sentence id="279">Did anybody ever apologize for the change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="283">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Did you try to make contact with them or did you retreat"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Well, I guess in the beginning you walked up to a boy and tried to talk to him like you always did. </sentence><sentence id="289">And you were left standing when he turned around and walked away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: After "35, were you still ? </sentence><sentence id="293">Did you have to give you name, and who you were, and what your father did? </sentence><sentence id="294">Was there any change in response then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="299">No. </sentence><sentence id="300">You see, German school was very disciplined as it was. </sentence><sentence id="301">and I don't when that incident happened. </sentence><sentence id="302">But to give an example, I don't know it was regular behavior, corporal punishment, I was very good in gym. </sentence><sentence id="303">As a gymnast. </sentence><sentence id="304">And we once did a formation in calisthenics. </sentence><sentence id="305">It was new to me. </sentence><sentence id="306">And I was bad to the kid next to me and watched what it was going to be when it was finished. </sentence><sentence id="307">And the teacher heard it, he walked up to me, and slapped my face and I wound up on the floor and I think that's when, perhaps, my hearing suffered somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="308">It is this sort of aggressive behavior by some teachers, was made perhaps more aggressive later than in the beginning, but quite frankly I don't remember exactly what happened where, when. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: When did you family start to talk about the changed situation after 1935? </sentence><sentence id="321">Or did they talk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="324">Was it an unmentioned subject? </sentence><sentence id="325">Did life just carry on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Life carried on. </sentence><sentence id="327">You have to carry on. </sentence><sentence id="328">And especially on adverse conditions, you carry on. </sentence><sentence id="329">We talked about it occasionally, yes; especially since we had the matzah factory, which was bolaba (ph). </sentence><sentence id="330">Now it was like many synagogues. </sentence><sentence id="331">Not visible on the street. </sentence><sentence id="332">Many synagogues in Europe were in the yard behind the building, which was closed off with a iron gate, you know. </sentence><sentence id="333">You had to have access to it. </sentence><sentence id="334">And then you go through the yard, and the building was behind it. </sentence><sentence id="335">So it was only those people that knew; but occasionally there was some vandalism. </sentence><sentence id="336">But not much more. </sentence><sentence id="337">Surprisingly, my father, as I said, was a very nice, easy-going, mild- mannered man, who helped a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="338">The factory workers that lived in the tenement houses, the apartment house that we owned in front of the factory, they adored him. </sentence><sentence id="339">They would do anything for him. </sentence><sentence id="340">He always helped them out. </sentence><sentence id="341">Give them money. </sentence><sentence id="342">So he never had any problems. </sentence><sentence id="343">Not even at Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: Do you think his German workers felt okay about him being Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="363">Or were most of the workers Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="364">Or were they Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: All Germans. </sentence><sentence id="369">But I guess it was perhaps their livelihoods that they perhaps protected. </sentence><sentence id="370">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Do you remember anything special about... Do you remember... You said you were interested in gym. </sentence><sentence id="372">Do you remember the Olympic games? </sentence><sentence id="373">Do you remember thinking anything about the Olympic games? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="375">No. </sentence><sentence id="376">No. [ </sentence><sentence id="377">heard about it from my wife cause she was a swimmer. </sentence><sentence id="378">And she is from Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="379">And they wanted...she also was not permitted anymore on a swim team. </sentence><sentence id="380">But they lived close to a Olympic stadium, and she told me about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: Let's move on now a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="389">Let's move on to just before Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="390">How were things changed from "35 to "38, as far as you were concerned? </sentence><sentence id="391">You were now a young man, 12 or 13? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="397">Well, it was about when I was 14 years old, things got very bad in school. </sentence><sentence id="398">I remember the principal coming in once and said, "We don't want the Jew Heppner in this school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="399">Out!" </sentence><sentence id="400">So I left school. </sentence><sentence id="401">When I was 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="402">Iam a kick-out. </sentence><sentence id="403">I took some classes in private school, whatever; and then my mother knew somebody who owned a machine yard--industrial machinery, locomotives, like all the steam equipment. </sentence><sentence id="404">And everybody at that time learned a practical craft, in preparation for possible immigration. </sentence><sentence id="405">And I was good with my hands. </sentence><sentence id="406">I am almost ambidextrous. </sentence><sentence id="407">Actually, when I was left handed, I was forced to learn my writing with my right hand. </sentence><sentence id="408">So I took several courses. </sentence><sentence id="409">I learned welding, I learned locksmithing, I learned out to pick locks, and then I became a volunteer, (ph), that is the name for it. </sentence><sentence id="410">Not an apprentice, but as an apprentice with minimal pay; because we didn't need the money. </sentence><sentence id="411">My parents knew the owner. </sentence><sentence id="412">So I was working there in the yard, welding and cutting and working in the office. </sentence><sentence id="413">I knew how to type. </sentence><sentence id="414">I maintained the petty cash. </sentence><sentence id="415">They had a gas station; pumped gas, and learned all kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="416">One interesting experience I remember, after I took the course in welding, it was a fairly warm August day, I was asked to cut, with a torch, heavy steam piping. </sentence><sentence id="417">And I took the torch and I didn't have my overhauls and I cut off the umbrella bags, put them around my waist, took a piece of wire and fastened it, and another fella helped me turn the heavy piping while I was cutting away. </sentence><sentence id="418">And I smelled some smoke and the flames started shooting up and ignited the umbrella bags. </sentence><sentence id="419">But I had learned what to do, and I hit the ground and rolled and just lost some of my sweater and shirt and eyebrows and hair. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: Were your fellow workers Jewish or German or German-Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: The foreman of the yard, the yard foreman, was an SA man, Brown Shirt. </sentence><sentence id="448">Was an everyday German. </sentence><sentence id="449">Very business-like. </sentence><sentence id="450">Around the yard. </sentence><sentence id="451">No problems. </sentence><sentence id="452">I never knew if he was one of those that were more or less voluntarily had entered the Brownshirts, or not. </sentence><sentence id="453">Incidentally, later, Kristallnacht, he did not... Well, I will get to that later, perhaps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: Let's maybe move forward to Kristallnacht itself and the staff report. </sentence><sentence id="462">Take me back and set the scene for me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: This is the period that I really vividly remember. </sentence><sentence id="464">Of course, it was before the time of the jet age, before the time of instant news. </sentence><sentence id="465">We had to go to the movies, if we could go to the movies, and see the weekly news. </sentence><sentence id="466">I do remember we had a radio at home, a Blaupunkt, with a loud speaker which was fairly new and there were antennas in the form of spools and you had to carefully tune them to get a station. </sentence><sentence id="467">So getting news was not as easy as it was today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="473">There was some rumors then, just about that time, after from Radnow (ph) or vom Rath! </sentence><sentence id="474">was assassinated, that the Nazis might look for a way to punish the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="475">Something was expected. </sentence><sentence id="476">We just didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="477">And I know the night before, or during the night perhaps, I don't know when it was, I heard later in the morning my father he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="478">He had received a call from one of the factory workers to come to the factory. </sentence><sentence id="479">There was trouble there. </sentence><sentence id="480">Come to the factory and close it up. </sentence><sentence id="481">And I was at home with the maid. </sentence><sentence id="482">My brother by that time was married and lived someplace else with his wife and a little baby. </sentence><sentence id="483">And I heard some noise out front. </sentence><sentence id="484">We lived in a residential area in one of these big apartment buildings. </sentence><sentence id="485">Most middle class people, even the affluent ones, didn't own homes unless they had a villa. </sentence><sentence id="486">Large apartment buildings. </sentence><sentence id="487">We lived on the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="488">And I looked out and I saw a truck come up the street with SS troops, stop at one house, and I was watching. </sentence><sentence id="489">Go in and come out a few minutes later with some of our Jewish neighbors and push them up in the truck. </sentence><sentence id="490">Next house. </sentence><sentence id="491">Same thing. </sentence><sentence id="492">Then they came across to my house. </sentence><sentence id="493">I didn't wait for them. </sentence><sentence id="494">I ran to the back room, jumped out the window, got on my bike, got away. </sentence><sentence id="495">Then I was running around aimlessly for awhile and I was afraid of the road block and I got on the train, on a steam car, want to see what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="496">Where am I going to go now, where am I going to hid?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="848">Yes, fortunately, he had some negotiations with, I believe, the consulate of Uruguay. </sentence><sentence id="849">I understand that many of the consulates took money under the table and sold visas. </sentence><sentence id="850">One of the problems was that our bank account were closed. </sentence><sentence id="851">It didn't matter how much money you owned, you could not get it out. </sentence><sentence id="852">The bank would give you sufficient money to live on, for daily necessities and for anything connected with emigration. </sentence><sentence id="853">I got, for instance, my ticket-- steamer tickets, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="854">Train tickets. </sentence><sentence id="855">But not sufficient money to buy a visa. </sentence><sentence id="856">But my sister-in-law, I believe, had a...what I would call a "letter of intent," saying that they're working on a visa, that most likely you would get the visa. </sentence><sentence id="857">So with that, she went to the Gestapo headquarters, and was told, "Um, yes, okay. </sentence><sentence id="858">We will investigate, and he will be set free." </sentence><sentence id="859">So I heard indirectly that one day, that he, like many others, a loud speaker... He was in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="860">A loud speaker said ...called out the name of the Jews there to come to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="861">And certain procedures were followed; and they were given even money and a train ticket, and they were sent home. </sentence><sentence id="862">Ironically, the town nearest to Buchenwald is Weimar, which I had I think had some connection with the...that's where the Weimar Republic was formed. </sentence><sentence id="863">So he came home. </sentence><sentence id="864">He had survived the winter, which was cold; but since he only reported next morning, he was dressed warmly. </sentence><sentence id="865">So he didn't suffer the same fate as some others, you know, that didn't survive the harsh German winter. </sentence><sentence id="866">He would never talk about his experience there. </sentence><sentence id="867">Never. </sentence><sentence id="868">He said he couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="869">All I know next was that we set around the table to decide what to do now. </sentence><sentence id="870">I understand there was a time limit. </sentence><sentence id="871">What my brother and sister tried to do, they took a course...had taken a course, at one time--or maybe only afterwards, I don't remember--as butler and maid. </sentence><sentence id="872">Because they tried to go to England. </sentence><sentence id="873">And I understand England needed domestic help. </sentence><sentence id="874">So my sister-in-law--which I believe has never been in a kitchen, because she didn't even know how to cook an egg, because we had servants, you know--and so I found out later on, they went out to England on some estate that was owned by Jews who very rapidly found out that my brother was no butler. </sentence><sentence id="875">He learned how to pour the white wine and red wine; but my sister-in-law couldn't cook. </sentence><sentence id="876">But they helped them along and got some other job for them; until, unfortunately, my brother was then interned by Great Britain for being a German. </sentence><sentence id="877">As you know, one of the other ironies of politics. </sentence><sentence id="878">But I think the main thing that happened then...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1187">A: Well, it was a mixture of cheerful... You know, you really couldn't worry much because, first of all, we had to pay out our ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I still have a copy of it. </sentence><sentence id="1189">We had to pay for a return trip, because we did not know we were permitted to land in Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1190">So you would try not to think of it. </sentence><sentence id="1191">We knew there was nobody there; we didn't know anybody in Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1192">We didn't know the language. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I did not know the difference between Y-E-S and N-O.

You could see the desolation, or ruins. </sentence><sentence id="1226">At that time, nobody had seen desolation of that type. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Burned out buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1228">We saw some wharfs that were sticking up. </sentence><sentence id="1229">For some reasons, the wharfs were there along the waterfront. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And then we came slowly to the Bund, the waterfront of the Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1231">And nobody even noticed the beautiful big buildings there and what's going to happen there. </sentence><sentence id="1232">We had thought of China--you know, typical Chinese buildings, upturned roofs, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Philippine buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1234">Office buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1235">Except for this section that we were seeing there. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And which was, I don't know what to call it. </sentence><sentence id="1237">It was very demoralizing perhaps, seeing that. </sentence><sentence id="1238">This was Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And we came; and the boat couldn't get to Jack (ph) Quay. </sentence><sentence id="1240">We were afraid to go over and the lighter in the launch. </sentence><sentence id="1241">When you get 3 in Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="1242"> 4 to Shanghai, the noise hits you. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And I can still smell the street vendors and the peanut oil. </sentence><sentence id="1244">And it wasn't...the heat hadn't started yet, because it was March...March "39. </sentence><sentence id="1245">So it wasn't...the heat wasn't so bad as it was later. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And then our suitcases came. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And what bothered...what struck us most was, there was some representatives of a committee there, greeting us. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1312">Q: What sort of committee? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1314">A: Well, one of the committees that had sprung up to assist the refugees that were arriving there. </sentence><sentence id="1315">It was formed by Shanghai --the Jews there, the Jews that had lived there already. </sentence><sentence id="1316">There was some Jews living there from the Bolshevik Revolution, and some Sephardic Jews from India--the Sassoons and the Hardoons--and some of the others, that had organized some committees to help the arriving Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And we were just through--no customs, no nothing, no visa, no passport control. </sentence><sentence id="1318">Nothing! </sentence><sentence id="1319">Just was, then. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And we were told we would be taken to a reception center. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And we came outside the jetty there; and we already got some quick warnings.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1390">Q: So what happened when you got to the reception center? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1392">A: Well, I got some soup. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And I was very spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="1394">You see, we had one cooks in the hotel; obviously, we had cooks. </sentence><sentence id="1395">I wanted a cook, I wanted this, and I don't like that. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And I was really a spoiled brat. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And I got a bowl of soup there that I couldn't get it down. </sentence><sentence id="1398">And I know I took something of the 75 cents and went and bought a candy bar. </sentence><sentence id="1399">I learned the hard way. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I had to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I learned it, but it wasn't easy for a spoiled brat like me. </sentence><sentence id="1402"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1416">A: Uh, well, we stayed there for about 2 weeks in this reception center. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And my mother is very resourceful, as I said earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1418">She met the director of the one of the youth committees that had sprung up. </sentence><sentence id="1419">And found a job, very rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="1420">They needed some help. </sentence><sentence id="1421">There were no social workers in Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So she said she can do this, she can do that. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And I guess I learned this from her. </sentence><sentence id="1424">I bluffed my way through everything. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And so she got a job. </sentence><sentence id="1426">In Shanghai, money...it doesn't take much. </sentence><sentence id="1427">You know, an American dollar would last you maybe months. </sentence><sentence id="1428">It doesn't take much. </sentence><sentence id="1429">So after two weeks, we found a room in a Japanese section of Hongkou, in which lived a Japanese family and a ship's captain and another refugee family. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And uh my mother started working; and I stayed home with a flyswatter and killed flies. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And my mother wrote a letter home to my father, complaining I am not doing anything all day long except catch flies. </sentence><sentence id="1432">All of those crazy things I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Because I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Where would I go? </sentence><sentence id="1435">I had no job. </sentence><sentence id="1436">I couldn't speak the language. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1500">A: Well, I guess um we were so concerned with surviving on a day-to-day basis, by that time it got summer. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And the summer in Shanghai is the greatest enemy. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Besides food, learning how to eat, learning how not to eat, that a drop of water...a drink of water can kill you. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Oh, incidentally, very early on I developed a double-sided pneumonia--pneumonia and pleurisy-- wound up in one of those makeshift uh hospitals, a converted house. </sentence><sentence id="1504">You know, like you see  6 in "Emperor in the Sun." </sentence><sentence id="1505">One of those things. </sentence><sentence id="1506">And I also had a very high fever and there was...my mother got me there in a rickshaw. </sentence><sentence id="1507">I almost jumped out of the rickshaw, somehow; and she must have told the coolie to keep the two legs high so I wouldn't jump out. </sentence><sentence id="1508">Because I was delirious by that time. </sentence><sentence id="1509">And the hospital was run by a committee. </sentence><sentence id="1510">I know I was delirious. </sentence><sentence id="1511">Because I remember one of the scenes where there was a room and there were all men lying around there, with practically nothing on; because you were lying, sweat was running down your body. </sentence><sentence id="1512">And summer, the humidity is about 90-95 percent, and the humid...temperature is about that. </sentence><sentence id="1513">So it is horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="1514">I remember... How much is real, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1515">I remember the doctor coming in with a syringe and a long needle, and giving what I found out later was a spinal--what you call a "spinal tap"--to another young man. </sentence><sentence id="1516">And not much later he was carried out. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And I remember the next day, the same thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1518">There was somebody else lying there and he was carried out. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And I remember...I remember only a doctor coming to my bed, and I thought he had a syringe in his hand. </sentence><sentence id="1520">And weak as I was, I remember I just about doubled up like this and kicked as hard as could right where it hurt most. </sentence><sentence id="1521">He was just reeling... And he never came back anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Well, I survived it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1546">Q: You were saying that your mother told the coolie to keep you. </sentence><sentence id="1547">How did the Chinese, the Japanese, react to the Jewish community? </sentence><sentence id="1548">Tell me about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1552">A: Well, the Chinese did not react at all. </sentence><sentence id="1553">You see, neither the Chinese nor the Japanese really ever had any contact with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Except uh they knew they were whites. </sentence><sentence id="1555">The whites usually were the powerful class. </sentence><sentence id="1556">Those colonial empires. </sentence><sentence id="1557">The International Settlement. </sentence><sentence id="1558">That is how we... That is the reason we didn't need a visa. </sentence><sentence id="1559">The British lived there for... since 1840, or whenever it was; and the French had the French Concession. </sentence><sentence id="1560">But they never had any contact with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1561">But what was strange that there was a group of whites that didn't have any money. </sentence><sentence id="1562">Well, they had something like it from the... After the Bolshevik Revolution, the White Russians had come to Shanghai, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1563">But still, we were poorer yet. </sentence><sentence id="1564">So the Chinese didn't react. </sentence><sentence id="1565">The Japanese, who were the real power in Shanghai, didn't react. </sentence><sentence id="1566">At least, at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1567">I lived with Japanese in one house, became very good friends, went bar hopping with them, did business with them later; and they were very correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1594">A: Great, great, great changes. </sentence><sentence id="1595">A lot had happened in between. </sentence><sentence id="1596">Pearl Harbor--I should say between that I joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, which was a subsidiary of the British Army. </sentence><sentence id="1597">It was founded, I believe, in 1847, after the Boxer Rebellion for the defense of Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1598">And I did not join during the Jewish Corps, which was primarily Russian Jews; but a transport company. </sentence><sentence id="1599">I was driving for armored vehicles-- lorries, things like this. </sentence><sentence id="1600">It was very advantageous, because I could get a good meal once in awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1601">I had a uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1602">So I joined that. </sentence><sentence id="1603">And I was very active in a scout group--British Boy Scout Association. </sentence><sentence id="1604">So then I did some work, my mother was working; so we got by. </sentence><sentence id="1605">And we knew the war would break out. </sentence><sentence id="1606">We read the papers. </sentence><sentence id="1607">We had English language papers. </sentence><sentence id="1608">We had all kind of papers. </sentence><sentence id="1609">The  7 Jewish community really developed out of the...moved into the slums, and we built this community; until it was later on known as "Little Vienna." </sentence><sentence id="1610">And we knew the war was coming. </sentence><sentence id="1611">But what could we do? </sentence><sentence id="1612">We couldn't prepare for it, except trying to get by and survive on a daily basis. </sentence><sentence id="1613">We were fortunate we were not among the 8,000 that were in a camp. </sentence><sentence id="1614">So we were at least in a room, and the room even had a WC--a water closet. </sentence><sentence id="1615">Which was very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2262">A: We heard before that there were some rumors coming through of what had happened in Europe, but then the first communication came from my brother to...from England. </sentence><sentence id="2263">His parents-in-law happened to live in Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2264">So they had contacted them. </sentence><sentence id="2265">We had contact. </sentence><sentence id="2266">And we heard there was no sign of life from my father, my sister, other relatives. </sentence><sentence id="2267">Later friends, after a little bit you started to think about other names and about people. </sentence><sentence id="2268">You couldn't even talk about it because everybody had the same problem. </sentence><sentence id="2269">Everybody was trying to search and what happened, when did it happen, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="2270">You lived with that for awhile until you just, I couldn't comprehend, you couldn't comprehend it. </sentence><sentence id="2271">I mean, who can comprehend it, you see, what really happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2286">Q: Let me take you back to the years in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2287">I believe you were subjected to some rather nasty bombing? </sentence><sentence id="2288">Tell me about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2292">A: Well, we felt very safe. </sentence><sentence id="2293">There were bombings going on all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2294">We could hear it in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="2295">We knew and heard that American forces, that the war had finally turned. </sentence><sentence id="2296">You see the first years, "42, "43, the war went bad for allies. </sentence><sentence id="2297">We were very worried. </sentence><sentence id="2298">Then it started to turn, and when we heard the American bombers and something you could see, our spirits rose. </sentence><sentence id="2299">And we felt safe because we knew that the Americans knew the location of our ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2300">And besides also in the ghetto was the largest jail in the world. </sentence><sentence id="2301">And there were some American prisoners of war in there. </sentence><sentence id="2302">So we were not concerned about the attacks. </sentence><sentence id="2303">Then on the 17th of July, I changed shifts. </sentence><sentence id="2304">The day supervisor asked me to take the day shift in the bakery. </sentence><sentence id="2305">Which was just around the corner where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And I came home for lunch, I bought my two breads home, and that's not very nourishing, but it's nice, fresh bread, so I made a meal. </sentence><sentence id="2307">And just finished that and I was ready to go to work, and we were just married in April, you know, newly married, and my wife said to me, "Do me a favor, I have bad feelings, I have a precaution alarm. </sentence><sentence id="2308">Stay, stay awhile longer, would you?" </sentence><sentence id="2309">So I was still, I said, "Okay, I'll stay." </sentence><sentence id="2310">And that moment, we heard the bombers approaching. </sentence><sentence id="2311">And as always before, I climbed out of the window to see better. </sentence><sentence id="2312">Some of them were low level flights and you could even see them. </sentence><sentence id="2313">So I hung onto the window sill and waved to them as they passed by, except this time we were the target. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2336">Q: These were American bombers you were waiving at? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2338">A: B-29's. </sentence><sentence id="2339">Later on, I met one of the bombers. </sentence><sentence id="2340">We became a secondary target because the Japanese had put fuel dumps in our area, ammunition dumps, and a transmitter that directed naval communications, and Americans had to knock it out. </sentence><sentence id="2341">So we got hit. </sentence><sentence id="2342">To this day, I don't know how we got down from the attic to the ground floor. </sentence><sentence id="2343">Everything collapsed around us. </sentence><sentence id="2344">The houses were very, very flimsy built. </sentence><sentence id="2345">We took fairly heavy casualties and the fire started in the lane there. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And I was not one of the guards that had to guard the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2347">I was the assistant fire chief, so have you ever stood on top of a burning building to get a fire brigade going? </sentence><sentence id="2348">It is impossible. </sentence><sentence id="2349">But then I went back to the bakery. </sentence><sentence id="2350">I want to see what happened there and when I got there, this was one of the worst hit lanes. </sentence><sentence id="2351">There was nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="2352">My office was on the second floor and as usual, the foreman had laid flat on my desk and fanned himself, and he was down under the boiler and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="2353">And I want to see if there is still anybody alive. </sentence><sentence id="2354">There must have hundreds and hundreds of casualties there. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And I made my way to see the store room. </sentence><sentence id="2356">We had just gotten a load of flour. </sentence><sentence id="2357">And I saw two Chinese trucks roll up with Chinese soldiers, puppet soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2358">So I hid to see what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="2359">They came into the store and loaded up the flour, loaded up the flours. </sentence><sentence id="2360">So as they were driving off, I ran up to the truck and jumped into the truck and hid among the flour. </sentence><sentence id="2361">So as we rolled down through the ghetto, I saw one of my friends there. </sentence><sentence id="2362">And I called out to him, from the rear of the truck, what was happening. " </sentence><sentence id="2363">Call Wallach"--the owner of the bakery, the Russian Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2364">So I didn't know where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="2365">We left the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2366">But anyhow I was  5 captured and arrested. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2396">Q: Why were you captured and arrested? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2398">A: Because they took the flour to the barracks, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2399">They found me among the flour at the rear of the truck. </sentence><sentence id="2400">But they didn't know what to do with me and tried to beat me up. </sentence><sentence id="2401">Not much happened and the next day I was released because Mr. Wallach paid $500,000 for me, in Chinese currency. </sentence><sentence id="2402">That must have been, maybe, $200 some dollars. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2408">Q: You were taken into a Chinese puppet barrack because you were in back of the lorrie which was stealing. </sentence><sentence id="2409">Then you were released. </sentence><sentence id="2410">Who paid the money to release you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2414">A: Mr. Wallach. </sentence><sentence id="2415">He wanted the flour back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2418">Q: The owner of the bakery? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2420">A: We got the flour, we got the flour back so we could at least furnish part of the bread for the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2421">See the camps were very badly off because the Joint had stopped sending money to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2422">The State Department, under the act of trading with the enemy act, you could not lawfully or legally transfer funds to the Japanese occupation in Shanghai and they didn't take a hint as I understand to route the money to other countries. </sentence><sentence id="2423">So these poor Jews in the camps had to get by on 3 cents per day per person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2428">Q: How did you get 3 cents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2430">A: I had a job. </sentence><sentence id="2431">I am talking about those 8,000, 9,000 that were in camps. </sentence><sentence id="2432">They were down to nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2433">Some of them didn't even have literally a shirt or trousers anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2434">They were walking along with burlap bags around them. </sentence><sentence id="2435">We lost about a total of 3,000 people out of 18,000 to the starvation, disease, heat prostration, some due to Japanese torture, malnutrition. </sentence><sentence id="2436">What bothers me in this whole period is that so many Jews could have left Germany, could have left the concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2444">Q: You said there was malnutrition. </sentence><sentence id="2445">Does that mean there was lawlessness as well? </sentence><sentence id="2446">How was the community cohering at this point? </sentence><sentence id="2447">Was there a sense of community still at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2452">A: Yes, very well disciplined as a whole. </sentence><sentence id="2453">I do remember, I heard about one case, a lawyer--a Austrian gentleman--was caught stealing a piece of bread from somebody else in the bunk next to him. </sentence><sentence id="2454">And he was so embarrassed he committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="2455">All in all, the discipline among the community was extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="2456">There was practically no criminality. </sentence><sentence id="2457">I think during the ten year period there were two murders. </sentence><sentence id="2458">We governed ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="2459">We had our own community organization, did our own arbitration court, the right to appeal. </sentence><sentence id="2460">So it was really well functioned. </sentence><sentence id="2461">What did not function so well was the various committees. </sentence><sentence id="2462">They didn't have experience, until the Joint--and Ms. [Laura] Margolies there from the Joint, who was a trained social worker. </sentence><sentence id="2463">She arrived sometime in 1941, and then she was interned as an enemy. </sentence><sentence id="2464"> 6 So she had only a few scant months to really do a job. </sentence><sentence id="2465">But whatever she did, she did extremely effectively. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2480">Q: How did most of the community that survived in Shanghai survive? </sentence><sentence id="2481">Was it because of the Joint? </sentence><sentence id="2482">Could that be true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2486">A: No, that wouldn't be fair. </sentence><sentence id="2487">Because the Joint, I think, sent until the war ended, I think maybe...I don't have the amount. </sentence><sentence id="2488">Maybe $2-1/2 million. </sentence><sentence id="2489">But, you see, that was before Israel, before the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2490">The Joint was in the business of raising money. </sentence><sentence id="2491">But there was no money. </sentence><sentence id="2492">They didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="2493">And, unfortunately, some Jews from the Shanghai Council tried to persuade and cabled back to Europe, "Do not send any more Jews here." </sentence><sentence id="2494">And the American government finally cabled to various other steamship agencies, tried to prevent more Jews from going to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2495">And Jewish organizations were involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="2496">To prevent more Jews from going to Shanghai, because there was no money there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2509">Q: New Jews in Shanghai would say the same thing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2511">A: These were the old time Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2512">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2515">Q: I believe you were arrested on one occasion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2517">A: Yes, it was just shortly before Pearl Harbor, fortunately. </sentence><sentence id="2518">We were on a scout trip on bicycles on a Sunday, came to an area outside Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2519">We had no green, we had no lawn, no trees. </sentence><sentence id="2520">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2521">And besides, I wanted to see what was going on around Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2522">So we had a fox hunt. </sentence><sentence id="2523">You know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="2524">Yah. </sentence><sentence id="2525">A fox hunt is one fellow on a bike would lead the way; and we didn't have paper. </sentence><sentence id="2526">Paper was very precious and hard to come by. </sentence><sentence id="2527">Had a handful of rice and scatter it, and the hounds would try to follow the fox and find it. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And we got to village where the chickens had already picked up the rice. </sentence><sentence id="2529">But, anyway, we finally find the fox. </sentence><sentence id="2530">He got into Japanese barracks area, military area. </sentence><sentence id="2531">And there is a Japanese guard. </sentence><sentence id="2532">And there is a foreigner on a bike scattering rice on the ground, which is a holy concept. </sentence><sentence id="2533">Symbolic. </sentence><sentence id="2534">Same as bread to us. </sentence><sentence id="2535">So he arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="2536">And one after another, we got in the trap until they had all of us. </sentence><sentence id="2537">And no communication. </sentence><sentence id="2538">And so we finally got on a truck, tossed on a truck; we were hustled on the truck, and driven to headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="2539">Behind the headquarters was a building. </sentence><sentence id="2540">One side was a building, and the other side was a rifle range. </sentence><sentence id="2541">Saw the targets there. </sentence><sentence id="2542">And there were several squads doing target practice; and they line us up there. </sentence><sentence id="2543">It was not a very comfortable feeling. </sentence><sentence id="2544">We didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2545">And knowing the Japanese, you see, you shoot first and ask questions later. </sentence><sentence id="2546">We are so used to seeing dead people, babies, every day in the street. </sentence><sentence id="2547">The life is absolutely nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="2548">I have seen people murdered point blank there. </sentence><sentence id="2549">So we started communicating, but they called some Japanese which was POWs camp. </sentence><sentence id="2550">Apparently from there, they came from a different area. </sentence><sentence id="2551">They couldn't understand our China....Chinese Kaishengka dialect. </sentence><sentence id="2552">So things didn't look good. </sentence><sentence id="2553">All ofa sudden, they tried to find out who we are and what we are doing. </sentence><sentence id="2554">So my friend--who is in Australia now--said, "Deutschka (ph)."--Deutsche, in Japanese. " </sentence><sentence id="2555">Deutschka? </sentence><sentence id="2556">Deutschka?" </sentence><sentence id="2557">So everything was on hold. </sentence><sentence id="2558">So sometime later, the staff car came up. </sentence><sentence id="2559">High  7 ranking officers jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="2560">And as you may know, Japanese officers are sent to Germany for training. </sentence><sentence id="2561">Out came two officers who spoke fair German. " </sentence><sentence id="2562">Who are you? </sentence><sentence id="2563">What are you?" </sentence><sentence id="2564">You try to explain fox hunt to them. </sentence><sentence id="2565">But we could at least tell them we are Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2566">We were stateless, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2567">As stateless, we have less right than a dog ina street. </sentence><sentence id="2568">They could shoot us, and nobody else would ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="2569">So we heard that he called an aide and talked to him; and the aide disappeared while he talked to us. </sentence><sentence id="2570">And the aide came back shaking his head. </sentence><sentence id="2571">And then he said...he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="2572">Promised to never come to this area again, and had to promise we would meet him and give him German lessons. </sentence><sentence id="2573">Later on, I found out through Pat--my British contact--he had called the German Embassy to verify who we were and nobody answered. </sentence><sentence id="2574">If he would have found out we are not Germans but Jews in a restricted area there... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2633">Q: What was the situation with your mother? </sentence><sentence id="2634">Did she leave with you in "47? </sentence><sentence id="2635">What happened to her during the war? </sentence><sentence id="2636">Did she keep her job all the time? </sentence><sentence id="2637">How did she...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2643">A: No, she kept her job until she... I had a letter from Miss Margolies of the Joint, as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="2644">She had to be discharged, because there were no more funds for her anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2645">So we had soup kitchens. </sentence><sentence id="2646">We lived in one part of the ghetto; and my wife lived in another part of the ghetto with her father. </sentence><sentence id="2647">And then I moved in there. </sentence><sentence id="2648">My mother also had a handcrafted fur coat, that she had done in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="2649">The Polish furriers were the best in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2650">And she had smuggled it across the border. </sentence><sentence id="2651">And she had this; and she sold this to the General Manager of Standard Oil of the Far East. </sentence><sentence id="2652">And we lived on that for, I think, about three years. </sentence><sentence id="2653">So we sold all our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="2654">A Parker fountain pen would become a symbol for Chinese businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="2655">Brought good money. </sentence><sentence id="2656">We sold everything down to what we just...the bare necessities, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2671">Q: What did it do to you? </sentence><sentence id="2672">You felt German when you left? </sentence><sentence id="2673">Did you feel more Jewish as a result of being there? </sentence><sentence id="2674">How did it actually affect you, Shanghai? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2679">A: Well, I must say, before we emigrated, we finally didn't eat kosher anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2680">It wasn't possible. </sentence><sentence id="2681">You said, you know, this is really not the intent of being a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2682">You wouldn't be any less of a Jew by not eating kosher. </sentence><sentence id="2683">So having solved that problem, I would say, as a whole the community became tighter knit. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And those Jews that were perhaps Agnostics or not religious at all--Atheists--became conscious Jews again. </sentence><sentence id="2685">Very much so. </sentence><sentence id="2686">We had holiday services with our own synagogues. </sentence><sentence id="2687">We had quite a few rabbis there, services, it was a very integrated Jewish life there. </sentence><sentence id="2688">Perhaps like a shtetl. </sentence><sentence id="2689">The foretaste of life in Israel in a way. </sentence><sentence id="2690">Very cohesive bible community; based on nothing, financially. </sentence><sentence id="2691">But it worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2705">Q: Why would religious feelings become stronger? </sentence><sentence id="2706">Europe was in wreckage, people were refuges, what was it that was pulling people back to Judaism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2709">A: Well, I think it was adversity, to try to survive on a daily basis. </sentence><sentence id="2710">I think that must be it. </sentence><sentence id="2711">People seemed religious. </sentence><sentence id="2712">I think when people are on dire straits, you know, perhaps they turn to God again. </sentence><sentence id="2713"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2719">Q: Those people that you knew there, tell me what actually happened to the community? </sentence><sentence id="2720">What became of the community? </sentence><sentence id="2721">You, yourself, got to America. </sentence><sentence id="2722">What about the rest of the community? </sentence><sentence id="2723">How may died? </sentence><sentence id="2724">What happened to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2731">A: Out of nearly 18,000, 3,000 died, and there was several thousand White Russians from the Bolshevick Revolutions. </sentence><sentence id="2732">Now the European refugee community lasted for 10 years ("38 to "48), completed disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2733">A few years ago, there was one Jew left. </sentence><sentence id="2734">He is no more. </sentence><sentence id="2735">It was a civilized community. </sentence><sentence id="2736">with a tremendous amount of culture. </sentence><sentence id="2737">We had operas, operettas, plays, dramas performed. </sentence><sentence id="2738">It is unbelievable what the Jewish community did there. </sentence><sentence id="2739">It's all gone. </sentence><sentence id="2740">Totally swallowed. </sentence><sentence id="2741">As you know, Mao Zedong took over in "48, "49. </sentence><sentence id="2742">I left in July 1947, with my mother and my wife and her father, on the troop transport. </sentence><sentence id="2743">And there are no traces of the Jewish community anymore, at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2757">Q: Where did the Jews go to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2759">A: Well, those that had relatives and an affidavit, of course, went to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2760">Quite a few went to Australia. </sentence><sentence id="2761">Those that couldn't get a visa from the United States or didn't pass the very stringent health requirements went to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2762">By that time Israel had gained its independence, and they went to Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2767">Q: If you had but one statement to say about this whole period from Kristallnacht to the end of the war that you would wish to leave with somebody as to what it mean, what it did to you, what would you say? </sentence><sentence id="2768">What is the thing that affected you most? </sentence><sentence id="2769">Was it Kristallnacht? </sentence><sentence id="2770">Was it being in Shanghai. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2775">A: Well, I think it was a conglomerate. </sentence><sentence id="2776">It was, of course, Kristallnacht, seeing the temple, and seeing the free world stand by. </sentence><sentence id="2777">In retrospect the free world knew what was happening and didn't move a finger. </sentence><sentence id="2778">I saw how anti-semitism really preceded the whole Hitler period. </sentence><sentence id="2779">The free world must share in the responsibility of what happened to 12 million people there, 6 out of the 12 million were 6 million Jews, and the lack of help originally by the Joint Distribution Commitee that was unable to raise money and send professionals there. </sentence><sentence id="2780">That was unfortunate. </sentence><sentence id="2781">Later on, the Joint really got money back, got communication again through neutral counties, to feed the thousands of Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="2782">The Joint did a tremendous job. </sentence><sentence id="2783">I don't want to take anything away from the Joint, but the beginning, it was a disaster. </sentence><sentence id="2784">So what it meant to me, I think it was a school. </sentence><sentence id="2785">A tough school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2797">Q: What would you say to people looking at this tape later on? </sentence><sentence id="2798">What would you, if you had the sum knowledge that this gives to you that you would wish to give youngsters who come to see it, what would you say to them? </sentence><sentence id="2799">Is there something you would want to say to them about what has happened to you and your family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2803">A: Well, I think it has a meaning. </sentence><sentence id="2804">It is definitely of importance for the younger generation, Jews and otherwise, to know what happened, because I think we have to involve ourselves in  9 Jewish life and in community life. </sentence><sentence id="2805">We have to make sure that we involve ourselves in a democratic process, especially here in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2806">Because if we don't, if we are apathetic as the whole population is and the Jewish community is, we may wake up one day under a dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="2807">Most of the people are turned out by politics and politicians. </sentence><sentence id="2808">And this is the danger that I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
