<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1163">Q: Was your husband a survivor? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1165">A: My husband came here at the age of 2. </sentence><sentence id="1166">He was brought over here by relatives from Pittsburgh, but -- and he was born in Germany, but he came here before the war actually started. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So even though technically by our museum standards he is a survivor, he doesn't feel that way because he really doesn't remember anything that happened prior. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1171">Q: How do you think all of your experiences as a child affected your subsequent life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1173">A: You know, I never thought about it very much, because it really wasn't the "in" thing when I was growing up. </sentence><sentence id="1174">People didn't talk about the war, and people didn't talk about the atrocities and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And I guess it was not until maybe the mid "70s when a friend of one of my friends with whom I worked was writing a book about children of the Holocaust, and my friend Joan said would you talk to Ina, Ina Friedman. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And the book is called Escape or Die. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And she said would you talk to her, because she's really interested in your background. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And I had to talk to my mother, because I couldn't really put my finger on things, and my mother didn't really want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1179">But I did remember, and so I talked to Ina, and Ina wrote the book. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And the tapes of that are at Yad Vashem, and then she sent me the book. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And I don't know if my story was all that interesting, but I was very organized, because the way she's written it is pretty much exactly what I said to her. </sentence><sentence id="1182">And then I continued working. </sentence><sentence id="1183">My children grew up, and my daughter is married. </sentence><sentence id="1184">She's a physician and she's married to a physician. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And my Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger 33 son is visiting me now, and he's in the music field. </sentence><sentence id="1186">I've been married for 36 years to the same man, which is kind of nice. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And in 1994 I retired from my job with Montgomery County. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Ihad been a therapist with emotionally disturbed children, and I went to work as a volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And it's very, very meaningful for me to work as a volunteer, because I feel I survived, and so I have to give back. </sentence><sentence id="1190">And I work in the Department of Collections, which I think is the best department in the whole museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1210">Q: Why do you think that's the best? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1212">A: Because the people are just the most giving, caring, talented people I have ever met, and they're so dedicated. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And my boss, Susie Goldstein, is just a gem. </sentence><sentence id="1214">She's a young woman, she's my daughter's age, but she's so brilliant in terms of what she knows. </sentence><sentence id="1215">And we collect artifacts, you know, we get them from people, and we catalog them. </sentence><sentence id="1216">Anda lot of the things are Polish documents and Polish postcards and Polish diaries, and I translate those because my Polish is still pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="1217">I speak well, and I read well, but my writing is atrocious, because, as I said, I only went through second grade. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And I think I'll work at the Holocaust Museum until they carry me out, because it's just a very, very nice thing to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1226">Q: How did you decide that you would like to work there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1228">A: I think once the museum opened and when I stopped working, I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do volunteer work, and this seemed to be just the right thing to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: And is most of your work there translating? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1237">Q: And how much time do you spend there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1239">A: At this point I'm going one day a week, but when it gets warmer I think I will go two days a week. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And now we survivor volunteers are going to be involved with the Kovno Exhibit. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1276">Q: Could you say something about the survivor volunteers as a group at the museum? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1278">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1279">We started meeting with Martin Goldman, who is a gem, and we're discussing issues, things that concern us and the things that we'd like to see happening in the museum. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I guess we'd like to have a little bit of a voice in what's going on, because once we go, you're not going to get any more survivor volunteers, we're it, we're the end. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And that's the other group that's so very dedicated, that I am so impressed with, is how dedicated the people are, and you know, we talk and we're kind of a support group to each other, which is kind of nice, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
