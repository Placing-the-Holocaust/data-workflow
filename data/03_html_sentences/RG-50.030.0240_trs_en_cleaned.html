<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: I come from a family, my parents, my father was a businessman, he was a cattle dealer, in the small community of Jacovce. </sentence><sentence id="18">We stayed in Jacovce until I became six years old. </sentence><sentence id="19">I had an older sister and a younger brother. </sentence><sentence id="20">We then moved to a larger community which is called Topol_any, T-O-P-O-L-C-A-N- Y.C witha umlaut [ha_ek]. </sentence><sentence id="21">And the reason for the move, because of schools. </sentence><sentence id="22">My father wanted to put us into a larger school, school which was in Topol_any. </sentence><sentence id="23">And we lived in Topol_any, we started, uh, Jewish schools, and soon after, two more children were born in our family. </sentence><sentence id="24">I can give you their names. </sentence><sentence id="25">My name used to be Moshe, which was, uh...they used to call me M - I - S - O, S with an umlat [Mio with a ha_ek]. </sentence><sentence id="26">My sister who was older than my, uh, than I am, was name was Rose, Ro_i--R - O - Z with an umlaut [ha_ek]- I. My younger brother, who was not quite two years younger than me, his name was Arpad, A - R - P- A - D; and I had a sister Marta, M- A- R- T- A; anda little brother, the baby brother, whose name was Maxmilian. </sentence><sentence id="27">We lived a fairly happy life in Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="28">Well, it was part of Czechoslovakia--this was the region of Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="29">It was Czechoslovakia, but our part was called Slovak. </sentence><sentence id="30">We were the Slovaks. </sentence><sentence id="31">Antisemitism was there, always there. </sentence><sentence id="32">I remember when we used to play soccer as kids, there was never boys against boys, it was always the Catholic against Jews. </sentence><sentence id="33">That was the kind of soccer games we used to play. </sentence><sentence id="34">But we got along as well as one could get along. </sentence><sentence id="35">We stuck to our ways and they stuck to theirs. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, we were quite religious, especially our mother. </sentence><sentence id="37">I even remember my bar mitzvah in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="38">Uh, my grandparents on my mother's side, my mother by the way came from another community, uh I would say sixty, seventy kilometers from Topol_any. </sentence><sentence id="39">Her maiden name was Feldman, and our grandparents, her parents, were there at my bar mitzvah, which we called the grosse shul--the big temple, the big shul. </sentence><sentence id="40">Our rabbi was a very famous guy. </sentence><sentence id="41">His name was Abraham Weiss. </sentence><sentence id="42">And we had to go to temple, to shul, every morning and especially before I became bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="43">And then of course after that, every morning. </sentence><sentence id="44">We all went to the Jewish schools, except my sister. </sentence><sentence id="45">My sister was sent to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="46">Now she was a pre-teener, pre-teenager, where my father's youngest sister lived; and she stayed with her a couple of years to go to school there. </sentence><sentence id="47">Uh, I would say from "35 to "37. </sentence><sentence id="48">And then she was sent back when Hitler started the rumbles. </sentence><sentence id="49">This was before the Anschluss in 1938 in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="50">We knew of problems in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="51">We knew of some problems but no one...no one paid much attention. </sentence><sentence id="52">Everyone felt ah nothing's going to happen to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="53">But we found out later that it did. </sentence><sentence id="54">Because in 1938 when Hitler marched into Austria, and annexed Austria so to speak  as part of Germany, he started to take the Jews on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="55">We heard on the radios, those of us who had radios, what was going on - the beatings of the Jews, the break-in of the shops and that type of hooliganism that was going on. </sentence><sentence id="56">And pretty soon we found the Austrian Jews were running away from Austria and came to our towns. </sentence><sentence id="57">And my mother took an Austrian lady in to us. </sentence><sentence id="58">We didn't have a huge home but the five children but we gave her a spot to stay. </sentence><sentence id="59">But most of all I remember is when the Czechoslovakia mobilized its armed forces. </sentence><sentence id="60">And the reason for the mobilization was because Hitler wanted to take part of Czechoslovakia which known to us as Sudetenland into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="61">He wanted to annex Sudetenland into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="62">That was a Germanic-speaking part of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="63">And I remember my father was also taken into service, and I still remember the narrow street as the five children and our mother walked with our father to the railroad station to wish him well, to say goodbye to him. </sentence><sentence id="64">And, of course, the famous Neville Chamberlain quote, "peace in our time." </sentence><sentence id="65">And peace in our time never came; because as soon as he [Chamberlain] probably closed the door of 10 Downing Street, Hitler marched not only into Sudetenland but he took over the Czechs, Bohemians, Moravians. </sentence><sentence id="66">But Slovakia, the region where I was born, didn't, never seen a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="67">Nazi soldiers never marched into Czechoslovakia, into Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="68">So what happened with us, the Hlinka Guard, Guard, Hlinka, which H - L - I - N - K - A, was formed, and then in March 15, 1939, is when Slovakia became the puppet government of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="69">The Hlinka Guards, these were people that were our neighbors, people that our parents did business with, that grew up, and lived with practically. </sentence><sentence id="70">They became the Guards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: O.K., the Guards did what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Guards? </sentence><sentence id="128">Their function was, this was the Nazi-type, almost like an SS-type guards. </sentence><sentence id="129">So what happened with the Jews in particular, of course, only to the Jews in Slovakia as a matter of fact, all Jews from the age of six had to wear a yellow Star of David, sewn on the left breast of their outer clothing, with the inscription, Jude, Jew in German. </sentence><sentence id="130">I remember we couldn't, couldn't walk the streets together. </sentence><sentence id="131">No more than three or four Jews could walk the streets together. </sentence><sentence id="132">And, of course, curfew. </sentence><sentence id="133">By eight o'clock all of us had to be in their homes. </sentence><sentence id="134">We couldn't shop, uh, uh, any time we wanted to, only designated hours. </sentence><sentence id="135">And since my father was, uh, a cattle dealer and horse dealer, while my father was, uh, gone, I became, I was the oldest boy, my sister was older than me of course, so I was sort of in charge of knowing some of the millers, some of the flour millers, and go to pick up flour for our family. </sentence><sentence id="136">And you couldn't do it during the day because if you got caught, the Hlinkas would get to you and of course you were punished. </sentence><sentence id="137">Midnights, uh, middle of the nights, was when my mother and I and a couple of other Jewish ladies would go, go to the miller and pick up flour so we could have bread. </sentence><sentence id="138">And it was all black market, and you always paid through the nose. ( </sentence><sentence id="139">Laughter) Everyday there was a new law read to us or posted on, on bulletin boards - they had these little round, uh, stalls where you would come and read the bulletin what happens next to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, we were harassed, beaten on the streets, and of course the businesses were taken away from all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="141">My father business, my father's business was given to the person who worked for him. </sentence><sentence id="142">And my father had to work there to show him how to do the business, to sell the cattle. </sentence><sentence id="143">And my father never believed that anything would happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="144">Almost to the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="145">He said no, he - the reason for that was because most, most of these people,  first of all, we were Slovaks, Czechs, we were born there. </sentence><sentence id="146">No one's going to bother us. </sentence><sentence id="147">And second, my father also dealt with the Czechoslovakian government. </sentence><sentence id="148">He sold cattle and horses to the government for, for the armies and that, uh, type of business. </sentence><sentence id="149">So he said no, nothing's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="150">This will, ah, this will pass. </sentence><sentence id="151">But it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="152">Because we were harassed, we were beaten, and in early 1942, end of 1941, early 1942, we heard that they are going to put us into camps. </sentence><sentence id="153">There was a rumor at one time, too--which was not even a rumor. </sentence><sentence id="154">Actually it was the truth, that the Jews will be shipped to Madagascar." </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, I was a kid, I never knew, I was a small young teenager. </sentence><sentence id="156">But it didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="157">Instead of Madagascar, myself, my older sister, and my next brother--Rose, myself and Arpad--were told to report to the Town Square. </sentence><sentence id="158">All young Jewish boys and girls. </sentence><sentence id="159">When they rounded us up, they told us that we're going back to our homes, pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're going to be relocated and your parents will join you. </sentence><sentence id="160">They took us about two hours from our home town to the first war camp. </sentence><sentence id="161">It was called Arbeitlager. </sentence><sentence id="162">And the camp, the name of the camp was Novaky, N -O- V - A-K - Y, manned by large group of SS, of, uh, Slovakian Hlinka Guards. </sentence><sentence id="163">Mind you, we have yet to see an SS officer. </sentence><sentence id="164">Let me, let me re-track back for a moment if I may. </sentence><sentence id="165">Uh, the first time that have seen German soldiers was when Germany was invading Poland, September Ist, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="166">And how we seen them, the German army was going through Slovakia to get to Poland, because we were first and then came Poland. </sentence><sentence id="167">But we felt them. </sentence><sentence id="168">My father had to take the cattle from his stalls, from his, and the horses, and deliver it to the Town Square for the German army. </sentence><sentence id="169">Beaten by these, uh, by the Hlinka Guards behind him, going fast, to give this for the Germans to take with them as, as food and and horses for, for carrying their materials, war materials. </sentence><sentence id="170">That was the first time that I'd seen a German soldier. </sentence><sentence id="171">And when we'd seen them on those little motorcycles with the side little car and, and, and trucks and horses pulling their, their - that's how we've seen - that's the first time we've seen the Nazi soldiers, the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="172">This was the Wehrmacht at the time. </sentence><sentence id="173">So, we never had anything to do with them as far as being our guards yet, because our guards were the people that spoke Slovak just like we did. </sentence><sentence id="174">And when we arrived to Novaky, they loaded us on to trains after we loaded, after we packed our belongings at home. </sentence><sentence id="175">They came with us to our homes so we wouldn't run, we wouldn't hide, and they had enough of these guards all over, all over the city. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Did you know any of your guards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Oh, absolutely, by names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Tell me about your conversation with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, they would come, first of all they became ruthless. </sentence><sentence id="232">O.K. The word ""_id" was common. </sentence><sentence id="233">"id" is a Jew. " </sentence><sentence id="234">We finally got you _ids," and that type of words, and beating. </sentence><sentence id="235">They all had clubs and rifles and canes. </sentence><sentence id="236">Whatever they had they would beat you. </sentence><sentence id="237">These were people, this one guy in particular, his name was Martin ek (ph), who was the barber, who was our barber. </sentence><sentence id="238">We used to go to the barbershop - he worked for a Jewish barber called Dezider (ph) " The Jews were never deported to Madagascar. </sentence><sentence id="239"> Banau, B - A - N - A- U. The poor guy perished in Auschwitz, but you know. </sentence><sentence id="240">And this Martin ek (ph) was my barber. </sentence><sentence id="241">He cut my hair, cut my family's hair, and he, you couldn't ask for a nicer guy during the time (laughter). </sentence><sentence id="242">He was also an alcoholic but most of them were. </sentence><sentence id="243">And when we arrived to this camp, we seen guards from our home town. </sentence><sentence id="244">You would go close to him and would ask him nicely, you know, please don't help or something. </sentence><sentence id="245">Boom, the first thing would happen you would get hit. </sentence><sentence id="246">When they took us to Novaky by train, by, by passenger train, and when we arrived there it was a huge complex. </sentence><sentence id="247">With wooden barracks. </sentence><sentence id="248">Girls on one side, boys on the other side of the barrack, camp. </sentence><sentence id="249">And we were assigned to our bunks, unloaded our belongings, and then we had to line up in front of our barracks and then the guards would read us the laws. </sentence><sentence id="250">And, by the way, food at the time was still plentiful in Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="251">Slovakia was a farm country, so the food was there. </sentence><sentence id="252">The cooks were our people. </sentence><sentence id="253">The Jews became, those who were appointed to be the cooks. </sentence><sentence id="254">We had meat, we had, we had potatoes, we had eggs, we, we still that. </sentence><sentence id="255">And we were also allowed at the time still to be receiving packages. </sentence><sentence id="256">So the parents would send some stuff to us. </sentence><sentence id="257">So that was still allowed because it was our, you know, still in our country. </sentence><sentence id="258">When the next morning when they woke us up and lined us up in front of our barracks, they told us after breakfast, you're going to report to work. </sentence><sentence id="259">What kind of work? </sentence><sentence id="260">Something which really, uh, none, nothing, uh, useful, just carrying bricks or stones and making piles. </sentence><sentence id="261">Because they didn't build anything. </sentence><sentence id="262">There was nothing to build. </sentence><sentence id="263">This was a camp, just a big grounds with holes where they were digging, some people were digging sand. </sentence><sentence id="264">My job, I was assigned to carrying stones in my bare hands and making a pile. </sentence><sentence id="265">And after we made that pile high, then we take that pile and make another pile. </sentence><sentence id="266">And this was the daily, daily routine. </sentence><sentence id="267">There was some people, there was even railroad tracks with small, small cars that ran on the railroad, that we pushed on the railroad. </sentence><sentence id="268">And we would just carry sand, dump it and carry more sand. </sentence><sentence id="269">No reason. </sentence><sentence id="270">There weren't homes built. </sentence><sentence id="271">There weren't roads built. </sentence><sentence id="272">There was just a camp, just a detention camp. </sentence><sentence id="273">And beating. </sentence><sentence id="274">Yea, we still had music and our singing groups. </sentence><sentence id="275">None of us believed what, what was waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="276">When in April 1942 the first transport, well actually it was the end of March, the first transport from Novaky was taken and my brother Arpad was there and so was my sister Ro_i, Rose. </sentence><sentence id="277">I stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="278">Of course, I didn't know, we didn't know where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="279">Neither did they. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I found out of course much later, my sister Rose ended up in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="281">My brother Arpad ended up in Lublin-Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="282">Couple of months later my turn came. </sentence><sentence id="283">I, I left with a bunch of people, Slovakian people from my home town also, and we, this is what they told us. </sentence><sentence id="284">This is how they did it. </sentence><sentence id="285">They lined us up in front of our barracks. </sentence><sentence id="286">They told us we're going to be relocated to the east. </sentence><sentence id="287">Pack whatever you owned, report back in front. </sentence><sentence id="288">We did that. </sentence><sentence id="289">They loaded us into trucks, and I will never forget, just as, just as the trucks started to move, in unison we all started to sing the Hatikvah. </sentence><sentence id="290">I'll never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="291">Just the trucks moving, and we singing the Hatikvah anyway. </sentence><sentence id="292">And when we finished the Hatikvah, still being Czechs and Slovaks, we sang the Czech national anthem. </sentence><sentence id="293">When we came, the trucks stopped at a railroad siding. </sentence><sentence id="294">Railroad siding is for the, load, uh, freight. </sentence><sentence id="295">We've seen, oh, I would say about twenty cattle cars lined up, on the railroad tracks, and each cattle car had a wooden plank, doors wide open, and the plank leading into the cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="296">They loaded us into the cattle car, between eighty and hundred of us, boys and girls together. </sentence><sentence id="297">A metal bucket was put on each end of the car which was used for bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="298">The cattle car's doors were locked and sealed. </sentence><sentence id="299">We could hear them locking it. </sentence><sentence id="300">This was the  last time that we have seen the Slovakian Hlinka guards. </sentence><sentence id="301">Some of the boys got friendlier with the guards, and they say, "Goodbye to you. </sentence><sentence id="302">You know, this is it, we won't [see] you no more." </sentence><sentence id="303">And the train started to move, and Novaky is approximately 24 hours distance from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="304">Of course, we didn't know we were going to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="305">They told us we were being relocated and our families will join you. </sentence><sentence id="306">Your families will soon join you. </sentence><sentence id="307">I would say approximately 24 hours later . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Tell me, before you go on, tell me about those 24 hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: That cattle car - first of all, it was jam packed, uncomfortable. </sentence><sentence id="389">People were fighting for places. </sentence><sentence id="390">You could not, not all of us could sit down. </sentence><sentence id="391">Hardly anyone could lay down. </sentence><sentence id="392">People were crushing each other. </sentence><sentence id="393">And of course they were fighting for the bathroom facilities. </sentence><sentence id="394">That was the worst part. </sentence><sentence id="395">Those people who couldn't hold, and then of course the buckets would be over-filled, and there was nothing else you could do, just relieve yourself as close to the comer of the car as you possibly could. </sentence><sentence id="396">We stopped once, on the cattle car, just the cattle car stopped once to relieve the buckets and they gave us some water, one, on one trip. </sentence><sentence id="397">I don't remember where - I was told it was in Jinna, that was the name of the town, but who could tell. </sentence><sentence id="398">And we got the buckets out and then they gave us some water. </sentence><sentence id="399">I would say next morning, now I would say next morning we arrived to our destination. </sentence><sentence id="400">The cattle cars stopped. </sentence><sentence id="401">The cattle cars were opened. </sentence><sentence id="402">And this was the first time that we have seen SS guards, SS soldiers, and SS officers. </sentence><sentence id="403">And every SS guard had a dog on a leash, either a German Shepherd or a Doberman Pincher. </sentence><sentence id="404">Mostly German Shepherds. </sentence><sentence id="405">Their rifles with bayonets sticking up, and either wooden walking cane, a bamboo cane or a whip in their hands. </sentence><sentence id="406">And of course, most of us, all of us in Slovakia I should say, spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="407">If you were Czechoslovakian, you spoke German, Hungarian and Slovak. </sentence><sentence id="408">That was our language. </sentence><sentence id="409">These were our languages. </sentence><sentence id="410">And they yelled, the Nazis would yell, "Juden raus schnell!"-- "All Jews out fast, fast!" </sentence><sentence id="411">With a beating. </sentence><sentence id="412">And we have seen, among the SS, people in striped uniforms, prisoner striped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="413">And these were the boys that worked the railroad track. </sentence><sentence id="414">Of course we didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="415">The Nazis, the SS would tell us to line up. </sentence><sentence id="416">And the boys, the prisoner boys, the people in prison uniform, would come to us and tell us either in German or in Czech or whatever language, line yourself up in rows of five. </sentence><sentence id="417">Of course, all done with beatings by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="418">When they separated the boys from the girls, when we were all lined up in rows of five, everything in Nazi concentration camp was five, because of easier count, and with the Nazis, with the dogs on the side of us, we started to march. </sentence><sentence id="419">I would say a mile and a half maybe. </sentence><sentence id="420">And we came to a gate of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="421">A gate with a half moon sign, that says "Arbeit Macht Frei," work makes you free, or gives you freedom. </sentence><sentence id="422">After we were in Auschwitz, I'm going to jump a little bit if | may, in Auschwitz for what, three, four months, and we used to march through this gate, in and out of this gate, with the orchestra playing. </sentence><sentence id="423">As we marched through this gate, we used to say among each other, "Arbeit Macht Frei, Krematorium drei"--"Work makes you free when you end up in crematorium three." </sentence><sentence id="424">And those of us we always looked who survived, who's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="425">As we marched through the gate, the girls on one side of the camp, the boys on the other. </sentence><sentence id="426">Auschwitz is built of solid brick. </sentence><sentence id="427">It's, everything is brick. </sentence><sentence id="428">Even the road, the streets are made of brick. </sentence><sentence id="429">The barracks, solid barracks. </sentence><sentence id="430">Before the Nazis invaded Poland, this part of Auschwitz used to be a Polish  Army camp. </sentence><sentence id="431">So they marched us through the gate with whips and beatings and dogs jumping at us. </sentence><sentence id="432">We came to a huge brick building. </sentence><sentence id="433">They shoved us into the huge brick building, and there were prisoners and SS telling us what to do next. </sentence><sentence id="434">There was tables, long tables. </sentence><sentence id="435">The first area we had to undress, strip our clothing. </sentence><sentence id="436">There were hooks behind us. </sentence><sentence id="437">You put the clothing through a piece of wire, hang the clothing up. </sentence><sentence id="438">Take our shoes off, put the shoes on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="439">Next table were the barbers, the camp barbers. </sentence><sentence id="440">Where they shaved our head, cut our hair, shaved the entire body. </sentence><sentence id="441">They said this for hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="442">Then we moved to another table where the tattooing was done. </sentence><sentence id="443">So the tatoo was done on left forearm. </sentence><sentence id="444">There was one person who rubbed the little piece of dirty alcohol on your arm, and the other one had the needle with the inkwell, and he would do the numbering. </sentence><sentence id="445">So my number is 65,316. </sentence><sentence id="446">That means there were 65,315 people numbered before me, tattooed before me. </sentence><sentence id="447">After the tattoo, tattooing was done, they put us, they gave us the clothing, but not what we came with. </sentence><sentence id="448">They gave us, issued us a striped brown cap, a jacket, a striped jacket, a pair of striped trousers, a pair of wooden clogs, and a shirt. </sentence><sentence id="449">No socks or underwear. </sentence><sentence id="450">Then the last area, when they gave us the uniform, they gave us two strips of cloth. </sentence><sentence id="451">The cloth I would say was about six inches long, maybe inch and a half wide. </sentence><sentence id="452">And it would star, starred with the Star of David, corresponding with the number on your left forearm, sewn on your left breast and on the right pant leg. </sentence><sentence id="453">And then the last item which was the most important item that we received was a round bowl. </sentence><sentence id="454">And this bowl was the life blood of your being. </sentence><sentence id="455">First of all, without it you couldn't get the meager rations that we got. </sentence><sentence id="456">And second, the bathroom facilities were almost non-existent. </sentence><sentence id="457">Uh, uh, even at Auschwitz, each barrack on the bottom had a washroom. </sentence><sentence id="458">But you couldn't use it. </sentence><sentence id="459">It was only for the privileged. </sentence><sentence id="460">You could use it special times if you were quick, because they only gave you like two, three minutes. </sentence><sentence id="461">But most of us couldn't use it. </sentence><sentence id="462">So, when they gave us the numbers and the bowl, you are now, we were recorded, also by prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="463">This was the, what they call today the Nazi documentation department. </sentence><sentence id="464">These were, they were the officers that did all the paper work. </sentence><sentence id="465">And these were prisoners that worked in the Nazi documentation department. </sentence><sentence id="466">Every transport, how many people arrived, and what their names, where they came from, where was the transport from, where it originated, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="467">These people were the ones to do that type of work. </sentence><sentence id="468">And most of these people were actually office workers from homes - bankers, uh, people that worked as accountants possibly. </sentence><sentence id="469">So after they documented all that, we no longer had names. </sentence><sentence id="470">The Nazis called us Haftlings, prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="471">I became Haftling , prisoner 65,316. </sentence><sentence id="472">Then they marched us to our homes, to our barracks. </sentence><sentence id="473">In Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps, all buildings where prisoners, Haftlings, were housed, were known as blocks. </sentence><sentence id="474">I was assigned to Block 16 in Auschwitz, and Auschwitz , our main camp Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="475">Each barrack, each block, had between three to five people that were in charge of the blocks, and their name, their, their ranks and names would be such. </sentence><sentence id="476">The head guy was called Blockaltester, block elder. </sentence><sentence id="477">Next to him would be a guy called Stubendienst; "Stube" means room, "Dienst," "assistant." </sentence><sentence id="478">He was the assistant of the Blockaltester and the third guy was the most important guy actually he was the Schreiber or the register and the reason for which he was so important because he would write people he had in each block, and how much artificial tea or artificial coffee was served, how many slices of bread, and how much potato peel, potato soup was served in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="479">That guy was the one responsible for that. </sentence><sentence id="480">And everything was done by number. </sentence><sentence id="481">One of the most cruelest things in any camp was called the  Appell, the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="482">The roll call in Auschwitz, I will, uh, so many people got killed during roll call, murdered. </sentence><sentence id="483">Many people ran to the wires just, just before roll call. </sentence><sentence id="484">Of course even that the Nazis didn't let you do, run to the electric wires and fry. </sentence><sentence id="485">But that was the most cruelest thing. </sentence><sentence id="486">I, I, that was so bad, they would wake you up with beatings anywhere between four and six o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="487">It depended on how early they got up. </sentence><sentence id="488">And then, you had to line up in rows of five. </sentence><sentence id="489">And the whole camp was counted with the main prisoner, who was called the Lageraltester, the Lager elder, who in most cases was either a, a German criminal or came from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="490">I also want to make one thing very strong, very clear. </sentence><sentence id="491">The people in charge of the barracks in most cases, and I would say 90% or better, were Germans or Poles, Germans or Poles. </sentence><sentence id="492">These were the ones with the green triangles - then the green triangles were, were the criminals. </sentence><sentence id="493">The red ones were the political prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="494">And we had some red ones also in charge of us. </sentence><sentence id="495">But these people had better way, better living, better uniforms, underwear, regular boots or shoes. </sentence><sentence id="496">They had little rooms in each barrack. </sentence><sentence id="497">Blockaltester had his room. </sentence><sentence id="498">Stubedeinst and Schreiber had a room, and they had food which was organized in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="499">These were the murderers, the murderers among us. </sentence><sentence id="500">They were prisoners, but these are the killers. </sentence><sentence id="501">And during roll call they would kill many of us. </sentence><sentence id="502">Kill us for the simple reason that someone did it in their pants. </sentence><sentence id="503">They, uh, soiled their pants, soiled their uniform. </sentence><sentence id="504">Poor guy couldn't hold it. </sentence><sentence id="505">Dysentery was, was something very, very common. </sentence><sentence id="506">After two weeks of Auschwitz your eyes would swell up from water. </sentence><sentence id="507">Your, your whole face would be blown up from water. </sentence><sentence id="508">Your legs would puff on you because of malnutrition and hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="509">And then you became a skeleton which was called Muselmann by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="510">After the roll call, and only after the whole camp was counted and the count was correct, only then we were able to go to the labor, slave labor work sites we were assigned to, labor Kommandos they were called. </sentence><sentence id="511">Every group in Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps was called Kommandos. </sentence><sentence id="512">I was assigned, well, let me give you the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="513">There were four people in each tier. </sentence><sentence id="514">There were three tiers. </sentence><sentence id="515">Two men to a blanket. </sentence><sentence id="516">No mattresses, no nothing, just one little blanket for two people. </sentence><sentence id="517">You never dared to take your uniform or shoes off, clogs off, because if you did the next morning you couldn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="518">Because during working hours when we were working, many of us lost our clogs in the mud and there, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="519">No shoes. </sentence><sentence id="520">You died sooner anyway. </sentence><sentence id="521">So after the roll call they gave us our first ration of the day which consisted of artificial tea, artificial coffee. </sentence><sentence id="522">The Nazis called it Ersatz tea, Ersatz cafe, Ersatz's tea, Ersatz's cafe. </sentence><sentence id="523">Then your Kapo Kommando, Kapo who was in charge of the Kommando, you would have to report to him to be assigned to slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="524">My first job in Auschwitz was in Buna, which was a munition factory. </sentence><sentence id="525">We did, uh, artificial tires, rubber, uh, synthetic tires. </sentence><sentence id="526">There were two main factories like that. </sentence><sentence id="527">One was the Krupp Werke and one was Buna. </sentence><sentence id="528">Krupp is well today in American because they sell the coffee makers here. </sentence><sentence id="529">I see every time I walk by the department store coffee makers I just cringe. </sentence><sentence id="530">I worked in Buna, I survived Buna I would say almost three months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="674">Q: Describe the work please. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="676">A: O.K. The Buna work, there were a lot of civilian workers which the Nazis brought from different European countries. </sentence><sentence id="677">The masters, the foremen, uh, the engineers. </sentence><sentence id="678">I want to make this very strong that a prisoner could not converse with these civilian workers. </sentence><sentence id="679">We could not  talk with them, although some of us snuck through and tried to, uh, they would throw us sometimes a piece of bread if they weren't afraid, because these, these people too, they had an arm band and the arm band would identify them as civilian workers. </sentence><sentence id="680">See. </sentence><sentence id="681">They knew what was going on, but, but they couldn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="682">A lot, there were some from Slovakia, those Yugoslavs, there were Poles, the Polish civilians. </sentence><sentence id="683">There were some people from France and Germany. </sentence><sentence id="684">These were the people that were building, that that did the work there. </sentence><sentence id="685">Actually these were the masters, we were the laborers. </sentence><sentence id="686">They would tell the SS how many people they need and what they want us to do. </sentence><sentence id="687">And it was hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="688">Most of the time you didn't work with tools. </sentence><sentence id="689">Everything was done with hands. </sentence><sentence id="690">There was a break for lunch right around noon. </sentence><sentence id="691">The factory whistle would blow and you'd go outside to lunch. </sentence><sentence id="692">And prisoners with wagons would bring our noon meal which consisted of the soup. </sentence><sentence id="693">The soup had mostly potato peels - no meat whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="694">Hardly none, no fat whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="695">Just a little margarine thrown into it. </sentence><sentence id="696">And by the time they brought it to us in, to different, you know, they had more groups to bring that. </sentence><sentence id="697">They brought it on a wagon what they pushed by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="698">They didn't come by cart or trucks or anything. </sentence><sentence id="699">Pushed by prisoners to the work sites. </sentence><sentence id="700">By the time we got it of course it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="701">It didn't, you know, and then we go back to work half an hour later. </sentence><sentence id="702">Back to the same. </sentence><sentence id="703">I will never forget when they lined us up in rows of five to march back to Auschwitz, to the camp, you would carry fifty, sixty of our comrades on our shoulders, either dead or dying. </sentence><sentence id="704">Back to Auschwitz, back to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="705">Because no one was allowed to die outside or be left outside. </sentence><sentence id="706">Because when we marched through the camp, the gates were open and they would count us there. </sentence><sentence id="707">Then we go to our own barracks. </sentence><sentence id="708">But not upstairs to your barrack where you could relax and sit down and lay down. </sentence><sentence id="709">You stayed in front of your barrack until the whistle blew, the horn blew, Appell. </sentence><sentence id="710">And the Appell was always yelled out from the first barrack and then like an echo, each barrack had a person that yelled Appell. </sentence><sentence id="711">There was an SS in charge and he would be in a tower. </sentence><sentence id="712">He would be the one who would initiate the Appell call. </sentence><sentence id="713">And like an echo, it would just go throughout Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="714">The Auschwitz itself, the Auschwitz camp itself was not that huge. </sentence><sentence id="715">So when everyone was lined up, then the Lageraltester, the main prisoner who was in charge of the whole camp, would, the SS hierarchy, the SS officers, they would count from one barrack to the next to the next and the next until all. </sentence><sentence id="716">And this is how we sound over the phone, over the echo: Block ; - Block seven, count correct. </sentence><sentence id="717">Eight, correct, and so on and so on, correct, until they came to a block where was not correct. </sentence><sentence id="718">You stood there until the person was found. </sentence><sentence id="719">In most cases, the person either was somewhere in dying under some, under something, under, under a bunk. </sentence><sentence id="720">Or he was so sick he didn't care one way or another whether he lives or dies. </sentence><sentence id="721">Or someone ran to the wires, to the electric wires. </sentence><sentence id="722">But only after everyone was counted, even those we brought on our shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="723">He was dropped in front of his barrack on the Appellplatz, on the roll call place. </sentence><sentence id="724">And that's where he was. </sentence><sentence id="725">And after the roll call, each barrack had to clean up their sick and, and the dead and carry them to a barrack which was a holding place. </sentence><sentence id="726">And then the dead ones would be picked up the Leichen (ph) Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="727">How would I translate leichen (ph) - as a dead, a Kommando that, this was a group of, of, of Jewish prisoners that worked with a wagon. </sentence><sentence id="728">They would go from barrack to barrack, from camp to camp, to pick up the people that died at work, and those who died over night. </sentence><sentence id="729">And then they would be taken to the Leichenhaller (ph), to the dead cell, where they were stacked up like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="730">And the next after that, they would be taken to the gas  chambers, or to the pits, whichever was available, and the body would be burned. </sentence><sentence id="731">I survived Buna...I would say, close to three months. </sentence><sentence id="732">Then one evening after roll call, a friend of mine from not too far from my home town whom I got to know, he told me that he just got a job, and he said if there's a way to survive Auschwitz, I think I got it. </sentence><sentence id="733">And there was a try out in front of Block Sixteen, our block. </sentence><sentence id="734">He was also in Block 16. </sentence><sentence id="735">He asked me, told me, try out and see if you can make it. </sentence><sentence id="736">So the try out was held by SS. </sentence><sentence id="737">They had suitcases there, and they put suitcases on the arm to see how fast you can run. </sentence><sentence id="738">Of course, we didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="739">I made it. </sentence><sentence id="740">And I was assigned to a group called the Canada Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="741">It's like the country of, it was named by the Nazis and the prisoners, the Polish prisoners named it Canada Kommando and the reason they named it Canada, because the final solution, of course I knew nothing about final solution in those days. </sentence><sentence id="742">I knew nothing about anything else far as, other than being in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="743">But the Canada Kommando was, or the organization was called Canada, because we unloaded all incoming Jews from every Nazi-occupied country, European country. </sentence><sentence id="744">By this time, this was still in 1942, this was like September 1942, this time they were bringing in entire families. </sentence><sentence id="745">Not just young people. </sentence><sentence id="746">Families from their homes, families from holding camps like Novaky, and from, uh, Vienna, from from France, from Belgium, from Holland. </sentence><sentence id="747">We had people coming in from every different, every country. </sentence><sentence id="748">And the Canada Kommando consisted of start out I would say about four hundred and fifty people. </sentence><sentence id="749">And we had two shifts, day shift and night shift. </sentence><sentence id="750">I was assigned to the day shift, and we would go to the railroad tracks. </sentence><sentence id="751">This is still Auschwitz I. And before we went to the railroad tracks, the Kapos would line us up, and the SS would tell us in no uncertain term, if there is anyone here that will talk to the people you are unloading other than what you are supposed to tell them. </sentence><sentence id="752">See they told us you will only tell them, leave you belongings behind in the language that you understand or they understand, that they speak. </sentence><sentence id="753">Anything else you can't talk to them about. </sentence><sentence id="754">You can't say anything to anyone else other than what you're supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="755">Anyone caught talking to the people that are arriving will be dealt with. </sentence><sentence id="756">And I've seen many that was being dealt with. </sentence><sentence id="757">Some of us found their families. </sentence><sentence id="758">Some of us found their brothers and sisters and parents. </sentence><sentence id="759">When they unloaded them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="844">Q: What happened when they tried to talk to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="846">A: They were killed. </sentence><sentence id="847">The Nazis would take them behind the cattle car after we unloaded the people and slowly torture and murder them. </sentence><sentence id="848">We carried a poor, a poor, poor soul back to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="849">Nothing stopped the transport. </sentence><sentence id="850">In many cases, an SS man depended where the transport came from. </sentence><sentence id="851">Western European countries for instance which people came from Holland and Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="852">Well dressed. </sentence><sentence id="853">When they came, an SS officer would get over a bull horn, and he would tell, ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize that you've been a little inconvenienced, but you know this is a war on, and we don't have the facilities for to better trains, but you will be soon taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="854">You are in Auschwitz, that's a work camp and if you work you will live. </sentence><sentence id="855">Just leave your belongings behind, and everything will be brought to you after you are cleaned, disinfected. </sentence><sentence id="856">You will get hot tea and so on. </sentence><sentence id="857">And of course we couldn't do anything about that type of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="858">Although many of us tried, tried by telling them, don't take, to a mother we'd tell, don't take a child with you because if you do, you're not going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="859">Excuse me. ( </sentence><sentence id="860">Pause) Some got caught, some people got caught doing  that. </sentence><sentence id="861">Didn't live until the transfer left. </sentence><sentence id="862">That's when they took care of them. </sentence><sentence id="863">After, I would say today, then I didn't know, really none of us knew, I would say that approximately 10% of the incoming people with the families were selected to be taken to slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="864">The rest were taken to the crematorias. </sentence><sentence id="865">There was, uh, one crematoria at the time only in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="866">This is 1942. </sentence><sentence id="867">And uh, they couldn't, they couldn't, uh, eliminate so many bodies in the one crematoria so they build trenches, ditches, and that's where they would pour gasoline or some kind of inflammable item on them and that's how they would burn them. </sentence><sentence id="868">And I want to make clear we didn't see it then. </sentence><sentence id="869">That we still didn't see, except we knew the boys that worked in Sonderkommando, and these boys, the kind of Kommandos on this Kommando were constantly tried to be, oh we will not, they was isolated. </sentence><sentence id="870">They lived in the barrack that you were not allowed to go to. </sentence><sentence id="871">But we already had enough Pole, old-time prisoners so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="872">Some of us knew how to get away from there and the Sonderkommando knew how to get away from their area, and by bribing certain officials, certain people, you were allowed to communicate between each other. </sentence><sentence id="873">It was an underground, uh, well, it was called Organizierung, organizing. </sentence><sentence id="874">The underground, uh, resistance group was always there, from day one. </sentence><sentence id="875">Some of, some of our boys were the leaders of the group. </sentence><sentence id="876">They, they, they knew how to organize well. </sentence><sentence id="877">I was a youngster myself, eighteen years old, ah, not quite. </sentence><sentence id="878">I was seventeen when J arrived there. </sentence><sentence id="879">I really, I was part of the group that brought the riches from Canada back to the camp, smuggled it in. </sentence><sentence id="880">I was the young smuggler. </sentence><sentence id="881">There was three of us that did that job. </sentence><sentence id="882">And we would bring it to our families, to our friends, those of us who had sisters and brothers in the camp or mothers in the women's camp. </sentence><sentence id="883">And there were those who, who knew how to get it to them by bribing some of the Nazi officials. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="935">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="936">The Canada Kommando, after we unloaded the people, after the Nazis made sure that we go to the tracks, and that we don't speak to no one, the main job was to tell the people and try to keep them calm. </sentence><sentence id="937">And when, the first thing that would happen after the people were unloaded, in those days there were trucks, dump trucks. </sentence><sentence id="938">The first people they would get rid of were women with children, the old, the sickly, the ill, uh, the people with, uh, cripples. </sentence><sentence id="939">These people would be loaded on to trucks, and taken away right away, and the last people that the Nazis would march were the people that were selected to go to slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="940">With the belongings, some of it on the ground, but most of it in the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="941">And when these people were taken, men to the men's camp, women to the women's camp, and the same process was dealt with them as it was done with us. </sentence><sentence id="942">Numbered and shaved and showered and so on. </sentence><sentence id="943">Assigned to the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="944">Only then we started to work on the mountains of luggage which was loaded in to trucks and it went to the Canada warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="945">It was a huge complex where girl Canada Kommandos, mostly Slovakian girl Canada Kommando, worked. </sentence><sentence id="946">And their job, they were, they were the only ones dressed up almost like, not a civilian but nice, a dress, and they all had babushkas [NB: kerchiefs] tied on their heads, because their heads were shaven. </sentence><sentence id="947">And these girls worked with the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="948">Disinfecting of the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="949">And when we, we, first we would do this. </sentence><sentence id="950">Load it into trucks. </sentence><sentence id="951">Unload it into Canada warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="952">And there were boxes in front of us, SS guards walking back and forth watching us, what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="953">And we would take first the valuables would we put into boxes. </sentence><sentence id="954">Monies in one area, gold and watches and rings and that type of stuff in another box. </sentence><sentence id="955">And everything had its place. </sentence><sentence id="956">Then we started to work with the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="957">Of course, we search the clothing - search the pockets, the shoulders, the shoulder pads were, were, were felt for any, any hard stuff or any soft clothing, or soft monies, and then we had to rip some of it off. </sentence><sentence id="958">Even shoe heels were opened, because the Nazis found out that the shoe heels the people saved. </sentence><sentence id="959">And toothpaste, in those days because the toothpaste in Europe was not the greatest, not like America, and they would squeeze and look for diamonds and gold, which was found there. </sentence><sentence id="960">Then we started to work with the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="961">Separate the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="962">Men's, women's and children's clothing separate. </sentence><sentence id="963">There was a blanket on the ground always where we dumped the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="964">After the blanket was full enough, you bundle, you put on your shoulder and took it to the girls. </sentence><sentence id="965">Now, let me make a very strong point. </sentence><sentence id="966">When these bundles of clothing were taken to the girls, many of us brought food to the girls, in the blankets. </sentence><sentence id="967">But, there was always an SS man standing by, he was watching of course the girls too. </sentence><sentence id="968">But the girls, he couldn't watch the girls doing that, because the girls wanted to, working with the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="969">They were watching what, as we were dumping, if there was any food. </sentence><sentence id="970">They knew we were bringing food there. </sentence><sentence id="971">In a way they let us, we played a cat and mouse game with these guys. </sentence><sentence id="972">If they caught you, you got beaten. </sentence><sentence id="973">Twenty-five on your behind. </sentence><sentence id="974">You bend down and then you get twenty-five. </sentence><sentence id="975">You had to count them, twenty-five. </sentence><sentence id="976">And you count twenty-five on your buttocks, and the Nazis  stop you. </sentence><sentence id="977">They say, how many did I give you. </sentence><sentence id="978">And you say, seventeen. </sentence><sentence id="979">Wrong. </sentence><sentence id="980">All over again. </sentence><sentence id="981">This was a sport. </sentence><sentence id="982">They called it sport. </sentence><sentence id="983">And that's how we used to bring the food to the girls. </sentence><sentence id="984">And, information to the girls from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="985">She had a brother there, or a father there, not working in Canada Kommando but working in Marashar (ph) which was uh, uh, people that work with the bricks and, and, and, mortar, that type of people. </sentence><sentence id="986">And they would say, your father told me to say this and that, they could keep up and so on, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="987">And then they would write, they would find pencils. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2308">A: Yes, uh, this was before Birkenau was built. </sentence><sentence id="2309">Actually, they were building Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2310">We didn't know it, I didn't know it at the time, what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2311">But Himmler came there, and before Himmler came to Auschwitz, the camp had to be cleaned from, from top to bottom. </sentence><sentence id="2312">The streets of the camp were swept. </sentence><sentence id="2313">They got rid of all the Muselmanns, all the skeleton-type people. </sentence><sentence id="2314">And we all went to be disinfected. </sentence><sentence id="2315">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="2316">We didn't know who Himmler, we didn't even know, we knew of Himmler from before, but we didn't know why he was coming or what was the reason. </sentence><sentence id="2317">The only thing we knew that it was a big, big Nazi officer coming and we were beaten by our Blockiltesters to get, get to the disinfectant area. </sentence><sentence id="2318">And this is the way they disinfected us. </sentence><sentence id="2319">They would take our clothes and put them, take them away from us and gave us new sets of striped uniforms with our numbers sewn back on the left breast and the right, right pant leg. </sentence><sentence id="2320">And we went to a disinfecting area. </sentence><sentence id="2321">Small shower, shower with hardly, hardly any water pressure, but they would swoosh (ph), swoosh (ph), swoosh (ph), spritz (ph) us, uh, with some sort of a disinfectant, and then they would dress up, and when the time came from, for Heinrich Himmler, for the big-wig Nazi, to come to Auschwitz, to the, right to the camp, we were all lined up in front of our barracks, in front of our blocks. </sentence><sentence id="2322">The Blockaltester made sure that we're standing straight, we're clean, and he found one Polish Jew, Jewish boy, one of the buttons was missing of his tunic, of his jacket. </sentence><sentence id="2323">And this Blockaltester, Mietek was his name, M - I - E- T - E- K. Mietek. </sentence><sentence id="2324">He was a murderer. </sentence><sentence id="2325">He was a Polish, uh, uh, murderer. </sentence><sentence id="2326">He was our Blockaltester, and he, he pride himself that he could kill one person with a blow to the proper area in his neck. </sentence><sentence id="2327">So he could lull him. </sentence><sentence id="2328">And this poor, poor Jewish prisoner, Jewish boy got murdered with one blow and taken away from there. </sentence><sentence id="2329">And the camp was standing still, holding for Heinrich Himmler to come and inspect the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2330">I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="2331">I, I, in my time in Auschwitz, Himmler came twice to Auschwitz, but I will never forget with this happening in my block, this, this murder in front of my block when Mietek, Mietek murdered him. </sentence><sentence id="2332">And there were number, there were more than one person like that. </sentence><sentence id="2333">There was one other, a German prisoner they used to call Monkey Tin (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2334">He was another one. </sentence><sentence id="2335">Mietek and Monkey Tin would have a bet who can kill more people with one blow. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And that's...this was Himmler's visit to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2337">That's how they cleaned up the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2338">First, they got rid of all the people that didn't look well enough. </sentence><sentence id="2339">The streets were swept, the barracks were cleaned. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Of course, Himmler never went into the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2341">The only thing, he came is just march with the Lageraltester whose name was Rudolph Hoess by the way." </sentence><sentence id="2342">Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2343">And this commandant of Auschwitz, Mr. Rudolph Hoess, would walk with Heinrich Himmler and other lieutenants, their... their lieutenants, and just go from barrack to barrack on the &gt; Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2344"> inspection. </sentence><sentence id="2345">Yes ma'am. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2385">Q: We would also be talking about Mengele and could you tell us about your meetings with Mengele? </sentence><sentence id="2386">I gather you did so often. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2389">A: Yes, well, Mengele arrived to Birkenau, not to Auschwitz, in May 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2390">I still remember when, uh, there too a big fuss was made about the doctors. </sentence><sentence id="2391">The doctors were the ones. </sentence><sentence id="2392">Because in all the Krankenbaus, all the, all the sick bays, where ever they put prisoners, there never doctors. </sentence><sentence id="2393">The only reason doctors came there is to make a selection in who was no longer was fit to be kept alive or selected to go to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="2394">And they had a holding, they was a 7, 11 block in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2395">Block 7 in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2396">And this is the block that they would take prisoners that were already on their way, on the to the gas chambers, gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="2397">And they would hold them there until they had enough, and then they would just walk them in Birkenau to, to the crematorias. </sentence><sentence id="2398">So, but mostly I remember Mengele, first about the Mengele selections in the camp, OK. </sentence><sentence id="2399">Of course, we didn't know when the selection would be. </sentence><sentence id="2400">But all of a sudden, in most cases on a Sundays, cause everyone was in, in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2401">The whole camp was taken out to Appellplatz, to roll call place, lined up in rows of five, stripped naked, and your clothing was dropped by you in front of your feet. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And Mengele, with the, with the Lager... Lageraltester, who was a prisoner, and the Lagerfihrer, and also the commandant; they would go from barrack to barrack, block to block. </sentence><sentence id="2403">And behind Mengele was a prisoner registrar--a Schreiber what they called--and as Mengele would, this is how, how it would be. </sentence><sentence id="2404">You in a row of five, always in rows of five. </sentence><sentence id="2405">The first five, step forward. </sentence><sentence id="2406">Mengele would walk in front and in back. </sentence><sentence id="2407">As he walked this way, left or right, left or right, and those who picked up their clothing were still staying alive, because, we didn't know, we found out later how it worked. </sentence><sentence id="2408">First, first time, second time, you didn't know which, what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2409">If you living or if you going to die now. </sentence><sentence id="2410">Those who left their clothing were taken into a holding block and Mengele's selections would last practically all day because by the time he completed - Birkenau was a huge camp - by the time he completed the whole camp, OK, after he finished the camp, those who of course the clothing stayed behind were taken into another block and waited until everybody was taken from all, the whole camp, then they were standing there. </sentence><sentence id="2411">You could hear them yell, scream, and beg for water, beg for, for help. </sentence><sentence id="2412">They knew where they were going see. </sentence><sentence id="2413">See, and those of us who stayed, we picked up our clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2414">Then with whips and sticks by the SS and by the Kapos and by the Blockaltester, by the Stubedienst, all the big-wigs of the prisoners and the SS, we were beaten into a, uh, shower area. </sentence><sentence id="2415">And we bundled our clothing with a piece of wire with the number outside and threw them in a huge gas chamber, in, in a room, where Zyklon B gas was put on the clothing to disinfect the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2416">They disinfected the clothing while they disinfected us. </sentence><sentence id="2417">Spray a little water and they sprayed us with some disinfecting, uh, water, some sort of a disinfecter. </sentence><sentence id="2418">And then they opened the gas chamber, the room where, where the clothing was, and you started looking for your clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2419">But the gas fumes were still there. </sentence><sentence id="2420">And I'll never forget, I got weak and dizzy from the gas fumes one time. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And, uh, I was fainting and my friend, Buchler and Fisher, which I mentioned before, grabbed me under their arms and took me outside and ran me back and forth, breathing for air. </sentence><sentence id="2422">And that's how they got me through. </sentence><sentence id="2423">That's how I came out of that. </sentence><sentence id="2424">I already had enough gas in me so  if, if those two boys weren't there I wouldn't be alive. </sentence><sentence id="2425">I would have died right there. </sentence><sentence id="2426">So we picked up our clothing, we put our clothing on, were taken back to the barracks, back to our own blocks. </sentence><sentence id="2427">The other thing I remember about Mengele very vividly is when the transports were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2428">He was the one who would be in charge at the railroad, at the siding, at, at what they, the Nazis called it the Rampe, the ramp. </sentence><sentence id="2429">When he came to the ramp, the first thing he would do when he, when he, he had the people lined up, the able-bodied ones, he would get rid of those first. </sentence><sentence id="2430">He would ask them, how old are you, what is your profession, what is your name, , what is your profession and how old are you. </sentence><sentence id="2431">And left, right, left, right and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2432">After he got rid of all these, of course, another thing he was looking, pregnant women and twins. </sentence><sentence id="2433">We really didn't know what he was doing with them at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2434">But he would, he called them "Schlingen" (ph) [Zwillingen?], </sentence><sentence id="2435">the twins. </sentence><sentence id="2436">He would take the twins into his area. </sentence><sentence id="2437">I would see Mengele every transport and especially in early May 1944 when the Hungarian Jews were brought in. </sentence><sentence id="2438">When the Hungarian Jews came, Mengele was there constantly. </sentence><sentence id="2439">He had a motorcycle, and he would ride in the camp, up and down the camp, just looking, on the motorcycle, looking for anything that he wanted to look at. </sentence><sentence id="2440">Of course, we didn't know what he was looking at. </sentence><sentence id="2441">Always afraid of this man. </sentence><sentence id="2442">I can still remember his, his piercing eyes and he'll, he'll, Mengele had dark hair and when he, when he, there were two people that we were deathly afraid of. </sentence><sentence id="2443">Actually three. </sentence><sentence id="2444">Palich (ph) was one. </sentence><sentence id="2445">Palich was another one who was. </sentence><sentence id="2446">He, Palich actually did this. </sentence><sentence id="2447">Palici's favorite thing was to do to line people up in Auschwitz--Auschwitz I-- against the wall to see how many he could kill with one bullet. </sentence><sentence id="2448">A friend of mine, close friend of mine, knew of Palish quite well. </sentence><sentence id="2449">I didn't know much about Palish except I knew who he was, that he was a murderer, and he also ride, rode a motorcycle. </sentence><sentence id="2450">He would line up people, two three people in a row, see how many he could kill with one bullet. </sentence><sentence id="2451">Lined them up together. </sentence><sentence id="2452">And the third person, who also came in "43, actually end of "43 I think, whose name was Hauptsturmfiihrer Moll, M - O - L - L. He became in charge of the crematorias. </sentence><sentence id="2453">And also, he also was the mentor of the pits, the pits that they were digging because the crematorias couldn't, couldn't hold enough people, burn and gas enough people fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="2454">So he used the pits to burn the people. </sentence><sentence id="2455">But the pits didn't work well. </sentence><sentence id="2456">Because I remember the Greek transports that came and and he, he took some of the Greek boys working the pits and with bare feet they were, they were stomping the hot ashes for after the people, the hot coals after the people were, were burned in there. </sentence><sentence id="2457">And the bodies just kept, kept coming back up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

because then there was Ryan, who was the main person, and Neal Sher was in command. </sentence><sentence id="2594">He got my name from some, some other Auschwitz survivors, and he asked me if I could come to Washington to identify this person. </sentence><sentence id="2595">I said, well I don't think I can get away you know, so fast, so he said I must travel to see some people, could I come to Indianapolis. </sentence><sentence id="2596">This is where I live. </sentence><sentence id="2597">Could you meet me at the airport. </sentence><sentence id="2598">So he came on a Saturday afternoon, and I met him at the airport, and he identified themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2599">He checked in, and then we went to his room, and in his room, he started to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="2600">Started to actually interrogate me like I was one of the prisoners, one of the Nazis, the way he was going about it. </sentence><sentence id="2601">And, uh, after, he wrote everything, whatever I told him, he, he had it down, he had a tape, and one of the last things that he did, in his briefcase, he had eight mug shots  of people. </sentence><sentence id="2602">And he told me, I want you to study these mug shot, mug shots, and if you can identify anyone, I want you to put your finger on it and hold it there and I'll let you know what to do next. </sentence><sentence id="2603">I looked at this mug shots, photo of eight, eight mug shots, and they were marked from one to eight. </sentence><sentence id="2604">And I looked, and I put my finger on number three. </sentence><sentence id="2605">And I said, here is your man. </sentence><sentence id="2606">And if I remember what I said to him, I said, and this is, this guy's name is Hans. </sentence><sentence id="2607">And he said to me, Mr. Vogel, I want you to sign your full name under this photo, and date it. </sentence><sentence id="2608">And all the other ones I want you to initial and date. </sentence><sentence id="2609">And after I completed the, the paper work, he says to me, you have identified Hans Lipsky who's going to be tried in Chicago on such and such and such a time and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2610">And the trial was due to be the day after Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="2611">And on my way to work I was listening to NPR, National Public Radio, and they mentioned that Hans Lipsky elected to be deported instead of going to trial. </sentence><sentence id="2612">He was deported to West Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2613">When I got to work I got a call from Neal Sher's office. </sentence><sentence id="2614">This Eli Rosenbaum was working for Sher and he gave me the call. </sentence><sentence id="2615">He says, there is no trial. </sentence><sentence id="2616">Hans Lipsky elected to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="2617">He is being deported to West Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2618">He's been by himself to West Germany but we do want you to know that if in case there is going to be a trial, would you be willing to go to West Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2619">And that is the last, last thing I heard about Hans Lipsky. </sentence><sentence id="2620">He is probably living, ah, a life of Riley in West Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2804">Q: You had said before about the misconceptions about Canada Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="2805">Did some people believe you? </sentence><sentence id="2806">Could you talk about that and talk about the woman that you mentioned? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2810">A: Well, uh, now, uh, you know, after thirty years not speaking about my experiences, finally, our youngest daughter Elaine, who practically made me do what I'm doing today, speaking on Holocaust, and the most important reason is because I want to bear witness because very soon there will not be an Auschwitz survivor or Dachau survivor and then Auschwitz will only be a legend. </sentence><sentence id="2811">But I must be very blunt. </sentence><sentence id="2812">I survived because of Canada Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="2813">Good, bad or indifferent, I survived because I was assigned to work in Canada Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="2814">But I must say that Canada Kommando was not just a group that worked unloading people. </sentence><sentence id="2815">We were told before we went to the transport what is expected of us. </sentence><sentence id="2816">If any one of us will ever dare to tell the people what is going on, will not live the day through. </sentence><sentence id="2817">So now that I talk about it and I tell them that I survived and the reason, everyone survived for a reason, because in Auschwitz the Nazi law said that was no one can survive longer than three months on the food, the hygiene, and the work and and the torturing that he gets longer than three months. </sentence><sentence id="2818">If you live longer than three months, you are doing something that is not according to the camp's rules. </sentence><sentence id="2819">You either get more food someplace. </sentence><sentence id="2820">You do get more food  someplace, or you have someone else helping you to to survive, see. </sentence><sentence id="2821">So when I tell some people about Canada, I told, 1 was Bloomington at the Indiana University a couple of years ago, and I'm speaking to graduate students, a class of graduate students. </sentence><sentence id="2822">They were learning Holocaust, teaching Holocaust there, and I told the group about Canada Kommando, and of course questions and answers are usually very strong, and I really am quite immune to the questions because I answer them exactly, right from the shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="2823">This young woman told me that her mother told her than the Canada Kommandos in her mind were murderers. </sentence><sentence id="2824">Murderers, because when she arrived to Auschwitz, it was the Canada Kommando who lined them up in rows of five and one of the Canada Kommando slapped her. </sentence><sentence id="2825">And I said, "It is possible, but a Canada Kommando person was only doing what he had to do. </sentence><sentence id="2826">If he didn't do it he was shot right on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="2827">He was murdered right on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="2828">And I give you another example, another little story. </sentence><sentence id="2829">I remember a transport came from Theresienstadt, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2830">Early spring of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2831">And we were unloading this transport, busy, this was the busiest night I ever seen at the railroad, uh, siding. </sentence><sentence id="2832">There was a young woman with a child with her. </sentence><sentence id="2833">And the child was restless and and crying, and the mother was trying to calm the baby, calm the child--six, seven-year-old child. </sentence><sentence id="2834">All of a sudden, the mother looks; and a Red Cross truck is moving towards us. </sentence><sentence id="2835">And she's telling the little girl, "Oh, Red Cross is already here. </sentence><sentence id="2836">Pretty soon we will be in our place." </sentence><sentence id="2837">And a young Jewish Slovakian boy ran by there; and he told them, "Lady, that's not Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="2838">Take a look behind. </sentence><sentence id="2839">You see the chimney. </sentence><sentence id="2840">In one hour's time, you're going to be gassed. </sentence><sentence id="2841">You're going to be burned." </sentence><sentence id="2842">And she went and sees an SS officer and tells him that, this woman. </sentence><sentence id="2843">She tells the SS officer about this man: "This man told us you're going to gas us, you're going to burn us." </sentence><sentence id="2844">He said, "Look, Lady, he's a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="2845">Don't...he's going to be dealt with." </sentence><sentence id="2846">And he dealt with he was; because after we had loaded everybody, we all went behind the cattle cars and slowly they murdered him. </sentence><sentence id="2847">Everyone of them just murdered the young boy slowly, just murdered the young boy slowly. </sentence><sentence id="2848">Carried him back to Auschwitz on our shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="2849">And the Red Cross truck. </sentence><sentence id="2850">You know what the Red Cross truck brought? </sentence><sentence id="2851">The Zyklon B gas cans. </sentence><sentence id="2852">That's how it was carried into Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2853">So that was the Red Cross truck. </sentence><sentence id="2854">And there are so many things, you know, that...the...as I'm talking to you, there's just, you know, for a survivor, every survivor has a story. </sentence><sentence id="2855">Is a story. </sentence><sentence id="2856">The end is always, always the same. </sentence><sentence id="2857">And every survivor survived because of something. </sentence><sentence id="2858">Not because he was strong; because the strong ones were falling just as easy as, as the weak ones. </sentence><sentence id="2859">And really, none of us believed you're going to survive that. </sentence><sentence id="2860">It...it was...I'd been in Auschwitz two and a half years; and I was in--between Sachsenhausen, Auschwitz, Dachau, I was over three years just in concentration camp, plus so many months in, in, in Arbeitlagers (ph), work camps. </sentence><sentence id="2861">So from 1939 to 1945, we all suffered and, uh, uh, because of the Nazi regime and you know, every survivor, we didn't believe that we're going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="2862">There is no survivor that will tell you I'm going to survive Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2863">They never talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="2864">You know what the main, the most important thing was, to go to sleep at night with a full stomach, so if you die, you don't die hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2865">Another thing was in Auschwitz, "Organizierung"-- organizing. </sentence><sentence id="2866">We all had to organize. </sentence><sentence id="2867">We all knew how to barter. </sentence><sentence id="2868">And of course, the resistance group, see. </sentence><sentence id="2869">People say the Jews, we the Jews walked into the gas chambers like lambs, like sheep. </sentence><sentence id="2870">Believe me, those of us who were there a long time, we had an underground organization, without radios, without anything. </sentence><sentence id="2871">Communications such as we all knew how to communicate from the other camps, somehow or other. </sentence><sentence id="2872">For instance, there  was a Leichen (ph) Kommando, which was the people that picked up the dead. </sentence><sentence id="2873">This man, he built a wagon, he had a wagon, and he built a false bottom. </sentence><sentence id="2874">This guy's name is Joe Newman (ph) and he lives in Skokie. </sentence><sentence id="2875">And he would carry things to the girls" camp, information. </sentence><sentence id="2876">Information to person...you had him here not long ago, Erich Kulka. </sentence><sentence id="2877">And Erich Kulka would carry it from camp to camp to camp, and to the resisters. </sentence><sentence id="2878">To the girls that worked in munitions factory. </sentence><sentence id="2879">Which was Kulka's job. </sentence><sentence id="2880">Kulka did that. </sentence><sentence id="2881">Kulka was the one who, uh, got the girls from the munition factory. </sentence><sentence id="2882">And they got enough gun powder so the Sonderkommando blew up one of the crematorias. </sentence><sentence id="2883">Of course, they were murdered unfortunately, they were killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
