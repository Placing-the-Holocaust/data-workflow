<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: My sister Julia was a. I would say, a woman with problems. </sentence><sentence id="124">I hate to say that. </sentence><sentence id="125">Basically she always had emotional problems from early date on. </sentence><sentence id="126">She was in a way, she was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="127">She was smart as all our kids and sometimes being smart doesn't make it easiest in life, and she suffered. </sentence><sentence id="128">I think somewhere by the fact that my father favored my younger sister at a later date. </sentence><sentence id="129">She was crazy about a young man who she met in the Zionist Movement, and they were engaged and they got married, and they shouldn't have gotten married because he was as nice and smart a man as he was, he was certainly not the right man for her and she never recognized that. </sentence><sentence id="130">They fortunately I would say, had no children. </sentence><sentence id="131">They were on the forefront of the Zionist Movement in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="132">Both he and she were good speakers. </sentence><sentence id="133">They taught Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="134">Her Hebrew was much better than mine. </sentence><sentence id="135">They were planning to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="136">I don't recall exactly how and where, but there is a book just out now about all the people who were in the Hav Shara movement in Holland and her name is mentioned in that book, which made me sure that she was really in the Hav Shara Movement before the war. </sentence><sentence id="137">She got married, I think, in 1938, and stayed in Amsterdam until July "deg43. </sentence><sentence id="138">They were sent in the same transport as I to Westerbork. </sentence><sentence id="139">They also were put on the Palestine list. </sentence><sentence id="140">With the Palestine list they came to Bergen Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="141">Of course being young they were not allowed to go with the Palestine transport. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Was she friendly, did she have a lot of friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: She was friendly, she had a lot of friends. </sentence><sentence id="199">Her friends circled around the same friends we had. </sentence><sentence id="200">Mostly of the Zionist groups. </sentence><sentence id="201">I really was more personally I was more geared to the non-Jewish friends I could get. </sentence><sentence id="202">Maybe at that time already I felt more I was a member of the basketball club, which had about twenty percent Jews. </sentence><sentence id="203">Or eighty percent non-Jews then. </sentence><sentence id="204">Not that it was ever mentioned to us or stated that it was twenty and eighty percent. </sentence><sentence id="205">Now I recall at a later date really, you know, I don't think she went out to the non-Jewish world as much as I did. </sentence><sentence id="206">Of course having worked at the Carlton Hotel in Amsterdam, it made me also better understand the importance of the non-Jewish world to the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="207">But she circled really around the life of completely Zionist life. </sentence><sentence id="208">That was ninety percent of her life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
