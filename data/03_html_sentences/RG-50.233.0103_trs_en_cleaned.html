<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: My sister Julia was a. I would say, a woman with problems. </sentence><sentence id="126">I hate to say that. </sentence><sentence id="127">Basically she always had emotional problems from early date on. </sentence><sentence id="128">She was in a way, she was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="129">She was smart as all our kids and sometimes being smart doesn't make it easiest in life, and she suffered. </sentence><sentence id="130">I think somewhere by the fact that my father favored my younger sister at a later date. </sentence><sentence id="131">She was crazy about a young man who she met in the Zionist Movement, and they were engaged and they got married, and they shouldn't have gotten married because he was as nice and smart a man as he was, he was certainly not the right man for her and she never recognized that. </sentence><sentence id="132">They fortunately I would say, had no children. </sentence><sentence id="133">They were on the forefront of the Zionist Movement in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="134">Both he and she were good speakers. </sentence><sentence id="135">They taught Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="136">Her Hebrew was much better than mine. </sentence><sentence id="137">They were planning to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="138">I don't recall exactly how and where, but there is a book just out now about all the people who were in the Hav Shara movement in Holland and her name is mentioned in that book, which made me sure that she was really in the Hav Shara Movement before the war. </sentence><sentence id="139">She got married, I think, in 1938, and stayed in Amsterdam until July "deg43. </sentence><sentence id="140">They were sent in the same transport as I to Westerbork. </sentence><sentence id="141">They also were put on the Palestine list. </sentence><sentence id="142">With the Palestine list they came to Bergen Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="143">Of course being young they were not allowed to go with the Palestine transport. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: What year was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: That was in July 1944. </sentence><sentence id="166">She has a terrible time in Bergen Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="167">She deteriorated fast, she looked terrible when I last saw her, which was, as I recall, only the beginning of April 1945 in Bergen Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="168">We didn't see each other too much because I worked in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="169">I do not know anything more than that they both went with the same train in those cattle cars in April 11, 1945 leaving Bergen Belsen and going to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="170">She was liberated together with me in Trovitz, near Leipzig and must have died two days after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="171">I learned that only, I would say, one week after I came out of a coma, they didn't tell me right away, and in fact I do recall that about one week after I came out of the coma they told me that Roosevelt had died and that my sister had died. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="172"> Q Can we go back maybe to, do you know, did she have any interests as a child? </sentence><sentence id="173">Did she play any instruments? </sentence><sentence id="174">Did you have any pets in the family? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: We never had. </sentence><sentence id="176">Yes, we must have had cats somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="177">I remember something about cats. </sentence><sentence id="178">But, basically we were never pet lovers, so I don't recall at all that we had pets. </sentence><sentence id="179">We all played an instrument. </sentence><sentence id="180">One of the things I do recall is notwithstanding the fact that we were poor, my   parents always teach us piano or violin, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="181">I had two years of piano lessons which was a complete waste. </sentence><sentence id="182">But, I do recall because somebody in a good family had to learn some instrument. </sentence><sentence id="183">I don't remember what my sisters learned, but I'm sure they did too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Was she friendly, did she have a lot of friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: She was friendly, she had a lot of friends. </sentence><sentence id="197">Her friends circled around the same friends we had. </sentence><sentence id="198">Mostly of the Zionist groups. </sentence><sentence id="199">I really was more personally I was more geared to the non-Jewish friends I could get. </sentence><sentence id="200">Maybe at that time already I felt more I was a member of the basketball club, which had about twenty percent Jews. </sentence><sentence id="201">Or eighty percent non-Jews then. </sentence><sentence id="202">Not that it was ever mentioned to us or stated that it was twenty and eighty percent. </sentence><sentence id="203">Now I recall at a later date really, you know, I don't think she went out to the non-Jewish world as much as I did. </sentence><sentence id="204">Of course having worked at the Carlton Hotel in Amsterdam, it made me also better understand the importance of the non-Jewish world to the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="205">But she circled really around the life of completely Zionist life. </sentence><sentence id="206">That was ninety percent of her life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Is there anything else you would like to mention about Julia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="221">The only thing I can say is that I do recall that in March 1945, she was very hungry and I had a little piece of bread and she asked me for that piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="222">I never gave it to her. </sentence><sentence id="223">Now, if the psychiatrist would examine me he would say you have tremendous guilt thinking about it, and would have the rest of your life. </sentence><sentence id="224">I must say in all honesty I felt at that moment that piece of bread could save my life and I didn't give it to my sister. </sentence><sentence id="225">But I still think about it. </sentence><sentence id="226">It wouldn't have saved her life anyway, but things like that, you know, stay for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="227">That was about the last time I saw her. </sentence><sentence id="228">One of the horrors of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Thank you very much for your time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
