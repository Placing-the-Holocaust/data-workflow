<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: Could you tell me something about your family, and growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I was very fortunate because we lived with my grandmother and grandfather in the same house. </sentence><sentence id="15">I was the only child. </sentence><sentence id="16">My mother had a child a year before me, but he died just before delivery. </sentence><sentence id="17">So I was the first grandchild in the family. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I...all my first memories are about my grandfather, and I feel very warmly about him. </sentence><sentence id="19">He died when L...three months before my third birthday. </sentence><sentence id="20">But nevertheless, all my memories are about my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="21">And we simply had a love affair. </sentence><sentence id="22">Uh he would watch me to go across the street to buy his cigars. </sentence><sentence id="23">His cigars were "Virginki," which means that they were tobacco from Virginia. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh we called them "Virginki." </sentence><sentence id="25">And he watched me to cross the street and give my little money on the counter, and bring him uh his cigars. </sentence><sentence id="26">And he very proudly looked after me, that I was able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="27">So at the very early childhood, he really pushed me to independence, to do things for myself. </sentence><sentence id="28">I remember he had a little wooden stool with a crack in it. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I loved peanuts, but I was very small to crack them. </sentence><sentence id="30">So I put the peanuts in that little crack, and he gave me a mallet; and I would push the peanuts and I could have to open it myself. </sentence><sentence id="31">And these are memories that nobody could have really told me that uh about my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="32">Or we went walking; and uh I even remember the streets where we went. </sentence><sentence id="33">And he would give me a little coin; and I would go inside and give my little penny on the counter, and uh--whatever it was--and buy, you know, a little piece of candy. </sentence><sentence id="34">And he waited for me outside. </sentence><sentence id="35">And uh his birthday was in March, and he died just shortly afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="36">And I came to him to give him my little poem. </sentence><sentence id="37">I had to learn little tiny poems for the family, for the members of the family. </sentence><sentence id="38">That was my gift for their birthdays--to learn a poem. </sentence><sentence id="39">And I went to tell it to him, and he already didn't respond. </sentence><sentence id="40">I think he had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="41">And I came out crying, because my grandmother...uh my grandfather didn't kiss me and he didn't say, "Thank you." </sentence><sentence id="42">That I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="43">That I was told. </sentence><sentence id="44">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="45">I don't remember the kind of a rejection, which I thought at that time. </sentence><sentence id="46">That I only remember loving things about him. </sentence><sentence id="47">And my grandmother was with us all my growing up. </sentence><sentence id="48">She had her birthday five days before mine; so we celebrated, more or less, birthday together. </sentence><sentence id="49">She always kept a piece of her cake for me. </sentence><sentence id="50">She was the one who told me stories. </sentence><sentence id="51">Uh I would crawl into her bed, and she would tell me a fairy tale I had heard about fifty-five times; but I wanted to hear it for the fifty-sixth time  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection from her. </sentence><sentence id="52">Uh when I started going to school, she would cross the big street to help me cross back again. </sentence><sentence id="53">And I was more concerned about her crossing safely, but she was concerned my crossing safely. </sentence><sentence id="54">So it got a little complicated there. </sentence><sentence id="55">But she was in many ways the mother on whom I patterned my life. </sentence><sentence id="56">And she had in her...she had a very orderly closet. </sentence><sentence id="57">And in the closet, she had a bag with her white shroud; and she knew according to the Jewish religion this is how she would want to be buried, and wanted to be buried with my grandfather in the same grave. </sentence><sentence id="58">She never had a chance to use that shroud even though we sent it with her to Theresienstadt [Czech: Terezin]. </sentence><sentence id="59">But I knew that["s] what she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh that was a sort of a thing to do every Sunday morning. </sentence><sentence id="61">We would go to Grandfather's grave, and we'd put little stones. </sentence><sentence id="62">That's a tradition--you put a little stone. </sentence><sentence id="63">And if she was not able to go, I always put a little stone for her on my grandfather's grave. </sentence><sentence id="64">And uh after the...after I returned I always...when I'm in Prague go, and go to my grandfather's grave. </sentence><sentence id="65">And since we were not able to put her there, we had her...1 had her name put on the same gravestone. </sentence><sentence id="66">And my relatives in Prague are maintaining the grave, even though many...even though so many are neglected. </sentence><sentence id="67">And uh so she is there, at least in memoriam, as she wished to be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: What, as you grew up, as you became a young woman, what was your schooling like? </sentence><sentence id="124">What were your friends like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: For the first five years I went to a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="128">It was more Zionistic Jewish school, not a religious school. </sentence><sentence id="129">We were twenty boys and ten girls. </sentence><sentence id="130">Out of the ten girls, we were five Hannas--because it was a very popular name. </sentence><sentence id="131">And out of the five girls, as far as...as far I can say, I'm the only one who survived. </sentence><sentence id="132">Out of the twenty boys, I know about five survived. </sentence><sentence id="133">I am in contact with one of them; and just recently, he sent me a picture of the second and the fourth grade, which was a real find for me. </sentence><sentence id="134">After that, I went to gymnasium--which was the academic level. </sentence><sentence id="135">And uh then I went into a business school, and I started working and be very... I was always very, very independent, very, very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="136">And my father led me to independence. </sentence><sentence id="137">Uh, I--as an eleven, twelve year old, I went to collect from his...from the builders money, so he would have for his payroll. </sentence><sentence id="138">And in the beginning they looked at this little girl who's coming to collect money, and would call my father: "Is that on the level?" </sentence><sentence id="139">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="140">And I gave them a receipt, signed it. </sentence><sentence id="141">He told them it's OK, because nobody had an idea that I was bringing payroll money. </sentence><sentence id="142">So he was leading me, again, pretty much to independence. </sentence><sentence id="143">Because my mother was uh a rather sickly woman who had frequent pneumonias, who have had at least uh five, six miscarriages after me. </sentence><sentence id="144">I was the only live birth uh child. </sentence><sentence id="145">So I was uh uh freely very much led to independence, almost compensating for her; because she was really very shy, very sickly and had enormously uh uh heavy thick glasses because she was so near-sighted. </sentence><sentence id="146">Uh I was...my character was much more like my aunt--my mother's sister--and my father, who was much more outgoing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

And so we slowly came together, looked at each other, winked at each other, and passed again. </sentence><sentence id="216">It...it was that sort of a situation. </sentence><sentence id="217">You had to think, "Wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="218">Is today Saturday? </sentence><sentence id="219">Saturday, I cannot go this place. </sentence><sentence id="220">Friday, I cannot get that place." </sentence><sentence id="221">Because the restrictions were getting tighter and tighter. </sentence><sentence id="222">So it was a difficult time under any circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="223">Uh, now Rudie--my husband--had a brother, Karel Schiff. </sentence><sentence id="224">who was finishing  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection said, a sister and a brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="225">None of them have returned. </sentence><sentence id="226">Uh, my father-in-law died in the transport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="227">He died uh on the way. </sentence><sentence id="228">And my mother-in- law, was a very energetic woman, and brother-in-law were in the familienlager [Ger: family camp]. </sentence><sentence id="229">And I was told how uh they knew what was going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="230">Uh, Rudla was with them; and uh I understood he was quite sick. </sentence><sentence id="231">And uh he died probably before he went to gas--in the familienlager, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="343"> grandmother lived with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="344">Uh my parents" maid--who was worked with us probably ten, eleven years, was my mother's age--uh was very helpful and undemanding. </sentence><sentence id="345">And she went shopping, and she did what she could. </sentence><sentence id="346">But of course, her ration tickets were regular ration tickets; but our ration tickets were marked with a "J," so we couldn't shop when there was food in the stores. </sentence><sentence id="347">We could shop only at certain hours for certain things, etc. </sentence><sentence id="348">But nevertheless, she was very instrumental in helping us. </sentence><sentence id="349">Uh my parents were...
