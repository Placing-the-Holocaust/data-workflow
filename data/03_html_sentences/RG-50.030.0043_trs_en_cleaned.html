<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: Could you tell me something about your family, and growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I was very fortunate because we lived with my grandmother and grandfather in the same house. </sentence><sentence id="15">I was the only child. </sentence><sentence id="16">My mother had a child a year before me, but he died just before delivery. </sentence><sentence id="17">So I was the first grandchild in the family. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I...all my first memories are about my grandfather, and I feel very warmly about him. </sentence><sentence id="19">He died when L...three months before my third birthday. </sentence><sentence id="20">But nevertheless, all my memories are about my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="21">And we simply had a love affair. </sentence><sentence id="22">Uh he would watch me to go across the street to buy his cigars. </sentence><sentence id="23">His cigars were "Virginki," which means that they were tobacco from Virginia. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh we called them "Virginki." </sentence><sentence id="25">And he watched me to cross the street and give my little money on the counter, and bring him uh his cigars. </sentence><sentence id="26">And he very proudly looked after me, that I was able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="27">So at the very early childhood, he really pushed me to independence, to do things for myself. </sentence><sentence id="28">I remember he had a little wooden stool with a crack in it. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I loved peanuts, but I was very small to crack them. </sentence><sentence id="30">So I put the peanuts in that little crack, and he gave me a mallet; and I would push the peanuts and I could have to open it myself. </sentence><sentence id="31">And these are memories that nobody could have really told me that uh about my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="32">Or we went walking; and uh I even remember the streets where we went. </sentence><sentence id="33">And he would give me a little coin; and I would go inside and give my little penny on the counter, and uh--whatever it was--and buy, you know, a little piece of candy. </sentence><sentence id="34">And he waited for me outside. </sentence><sentence id="35">And uh his birthday was in March, and he died just shortly afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="36">And I came to him to give him my little poem. </sentence><sentence id="37">I had to learn little tiny poems for the family, for the members of the family. </sentence><sentence id="38">That was my gift for their birthdays--to learn a poem. </sentence><sentence id="39">And I went to tell it to him, and he already didn't respond. </sentence><sentence id="40">I think he had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="41">And I came out crying, because my grandmother...uh my grandfather didn't kiss me and he didn't say, "Thank you." </sentence><sentence id="42">That I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="43">That I was told. </sentence><sentence id="44">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="45">I don't remember the kind of a rejection, which I thought at that time. </sentence><sentence id="46">That I only remember loving things about him. </sentence><sentence id="47">And my grandmother was with us all my growing up. </sentence><sentence id="48">She had her birthday five days before mine; so we celebrated, more or less, birthday together. </sentence><sentence id="49">She always kept a piece of her cake for me. </sentence><sentence id="50">She was the one who told me stories. </sentence><sentence id="51">Uh I would crawl into her bed, and she would tell me a fairy tale I had heard about fifty-five times; but I wanted to hear it for the fifty-sixth time  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection from her. </sentence><sentence id="52">Uh when I started going to school, she would cross the big street to help me cross back again. </sentence><sentence id="53">And I was more concerned about her crossing safely, but she was concerned my crossing safely. </sentence><sentence id="54">So it got a little complicated there. </sentence><sentence id="55">But she was in many ways the mother on whom I patterned my life. </sentence><sentence id="56">And she had in her...she had a very orderly closet. </sentence><sentence id="57">And in the closet, she had a bag with her white shroud; and she knew according to the Jewish religion this is how she would want to be buried, and wanted to be buried with my grandfather in the same grave. </sentence><sentence id="58">She never had a chance to use that shroud even though we sent it with her to Theresienstadt [Czech: Terezin]. </sentence><sentence id="59">But I knew that["s] what she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh that was a sort of a thing to do every Sunday morning. </sentence><sentence id="61">We would go to Grandfather's grave, and we'd put little stones. </sentence><sentence id="62">That's a tradition--you put a little stone. </sentence><sentence id="63">And if she was not able to go, I always put a little stone for her on my grandfather's grave. </sentence><sentence id="64">And uh after the...after I returned I always...when I'm in Prague go, and go to my grandfather's grave. </sentence><sentence id="65">And since we were not able to put her there, we had her...1 had her name put on the same gravestone. </sentence><sentence id="66">And my relatives in Prague are maintaining the grave, even though many...even though so many are neglected. </sentence><sentence id="67">And uh so she is there, at least in memoriam, as she wished to be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: What, as you grew up, as you became a young woman, what was your schooling like? </sentence><sentence id="124">What were your friends like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: For the first five years I went to a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="128">It was more Zionistic Jewish school, not a religious school. </sentence><sentence id="129">We were twenty boys and ten girls. </sentence><sentence id="130">Out of the ten girls, we were five Hannas--because it was a very popular name. </sentence><sentence id="131">And out of the five girls, as far as...as far I can say, I'm the only one who survived. </sentence><sentence id="132">Out of the twenty boys, I know about five survived. </sentence><sentence id="133">I am in contact with one of them; and just recently, he sent me a picture of the second and the fourth grade, which was a real find for me. </sentence><sentence id="134">After that, I went to gymnasium--which was the academic level. </sentence><sentence id="135">And uh then I went into a business school, and I started working and be very... I was always very, very independent, very, very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="136">And my father led me to independence. </sentence><sentence id="137">Uh, I--as an eleven, twelve year old, I went to collect from his...from the builders money, so he would have for his payroll. </sentence><sentence id="138">And in the beginning they looked at this little girl who's coming to collect money, and would call my father: "Is that on the level?" </sentence><sentence id="139">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="140">And I gave them a receipt, signed it. </sentence><sentence id="141">He told them it's OK, because nobody had an idea that I was bringing payroll money. </sentence><sentence id="142">So he was leading me, again, pretty much to independence. </sentence><sentence id="143">Because my mother was uh a rather sickly woman who had frequent pneumonias, who have had at least uh five, six miscarriages after me. </sentence><sentence id="144">I was the only live birth uh child. </sentence><sentence id="145">So I was uh uh freely very much led to independence, almost compensating for her; because she was really very shy, very sickly and had enormously uh uh heavy thick glasses because she was so near-sighted. </sentence><sentence id="146">Uh I was...my character was much more like my aunt--my mother's sister--and my father, who was much more outgoing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: As you grew older, um you began to become involved with the young men? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Uh I was...uh I was fortunate in my age we were still able to have some social life and go to dancing schools. </sentence><sentence id="170">It's all, you know, with the long dress and uh formalities. </sentence><sentence id="171">I was still about  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the last year that["s] where we were able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="172">And at that time, I was going with uh a student who was three years my age--so I was about sixteen, he was nineteen--by the name of Rudolph Schiff. </sentence><sentence id="173">We called him "Rudla." </sentence><sentence id="174">And uh when I was seventeen, and uh the gates were closing on us uh and uh...things were starting really getting bad, we got married November 14th, 1939, at the City Hall. </sentence><sentence id="175">Again, there was no housing for us. </sentence><sentence id="176">I went home. </sentence><sentence id="177">He went home in the evening, because there was no possibility. </sentence><sentence id="178">In his uh...his families lived a couple of blocks away from us, so that was no big problem. </sentence><sentence id="179">And uh as uh the Germans were closing in, we had to go into more and more cramped quarters. </sentence><sentence id="180">And his parents had a big apartment what had it sub-divided. </sentence><sentence id="181">And each bedroom was given to another family. </sentence><sentence id="182">And uh the uh...so there was really no where to go. </sentence><sentence id="183">Then one of the families were sent with transport to camp, so for couple of months we had one of the bedrooms. </sentence><sentence id="184">In the meantime, he got scarlet fever. </sentence><sentence id="185">And at that time, when you had scarlet fever uh you had to go for six weeks into a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="186">Today, somebody with scarlet fever--it's [like] a strep throat. </sentence><sentence id="187">A couple of days, and you are fine. </sentence><sentence id="188">They thought that you were infectious for six weeks, until your started to peel. </sentence><sentence id="189">I had scarlet fever when I was in the first grade, so I knew what it meant for six weeks to be in isolation--which I was. </sentence><sentence id="190">By the way, I was in that isolation at children["s] hospital; and the children["s] hospital was run by nuns. </sentence><sentence id="191">And the nuns said...came to us and uh said, "OK, children, get off your beds, kneel and pray." </sentence><sentence id="192">And I said to the nun, "I'm sorry, I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="193">I don't kneel." </sentence><sentence id="194">And so she said, "What are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="195">I said, "I'm going to pray in bed the way my grandmother taught me." </sentence><sentence id="196">And that was that. </sentence><sentence id="197">I did not follow the party line, and in many ways the nuns respected that. </sentence><sentence id="198">I was only seven--barely seven at that time, because I had my birthday in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="199">And uh so he had scarlet fever. </sentence><sentence id="200">He had to go to the hospital; and while he was in the hospital, they brought in his room a little four year old--little Frankie. </sentence><sentence id="201">Cute little Frankie. </sentence><sentence id="202">The parents were Polish uh emigres who came to Czechoslovakia; and while he was in the hospital, they had to go with a transport and leaving the child in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="203">They didn't allow them to wait until he was discharged. </sentence><sentence id="204">So my sister-in-law--my husband's sister, Margit--uh sort of adopted him and uh was to take him. </sentence><sentence id="205">He went to Theresienstadt, and while he was there she took care of him. </sentence><sentence id="206">But, of course, when she came with him to Auschwitz, she went to gas with him. </sentence><sentence id="207">But when he...we had really difficulty during that time of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="208">Uh during that time things were getting worse in terms of uh getting supplies, buying food, working, going places. </sentence><sentence id="209">I remember going on the street and meeting one of my school friends. </sentence><sentence id="210">Of course, by that time I had the star; and as we came closer to each other, we walked slower and slower, thinking, "Should I stop? </sentence><sentence id="211">Should I talk? </sentence><sentence id="212">Who was it worse for, her? </sentence><sentence id="213">Is it worse for me? </sentence><sentence id="214">What should we go and do?" </sentence><sentence id="215">So... And so we slowly came together, looked at each other, winked at each other, and passed again. </sentence><sentence id="216">It...it was that sort of a situation. </sentence><sentence id="217">You had to think, "Wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="218">Is today Saturday? </sentence><sentence id="219">Saturday, I cannot go this place. </sentence><sentence id="220">Friday, I cannot get that place." </sentence><sentence id="221">Because the restrictions were getting tighter and tighter. </sentence><sentence id="222">So it was a difficult time under any circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="223">Uh, now Rudie--my husband--had a brother, Karel Schiff, who was finishing his MD degree. </sentence><sentence id="224">By that time, Hitler came. </sentence><sentence id="225">And there were only two Jewish uh people who were supposed to get their degree. </sentence><sentence id="226">You know, that big day in Europe--it was a much bigger day to get your degree. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh they gave the degree to everybody; and they took the two Jewish fellows to the bathroom, and gave them their diploma in the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="228">And uh he had, as I  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection said, a sister and a brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="229">None of them have returned. </sentence><sentence id="230">Uh, my father-in-law died in the transport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="231">He died uh on the way. </sentence><sentence id="232">And my mother-in- law, was a very energetic woman, and brother-in-law were in the familienlager [Ger: family camp]. </sentence><sentence id="233">And I was told how uh they knew what was going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="234">Uh, Rudla was with them; and uh I understood he was quite sick. </sentence><sentence id="235">And uh he died probably before he went to gas--in the familienlager, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Let's go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="306">Can you tell us a little more about the early years, of the German invasion, what that meant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Uh, I remember the day they came. </sentence><sentence id="310">I remember the day I sto...1 remember the place, the street where I stood, and it was snowing. </sentence><sentence id="311">It was a cold day and they were pulling in - I was by myself. </sentence><sentence id="312">I just walked there. </sentence><sentence id="313">It was not far, maybe three-quarters of a mile from where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="314">And we were uh uh watching them on their wagons with their tanks, with their half- tracks, with guns pointing to the rooftops. </sentence><sentence id="315">And it was snowing. </sentence><sentence id="316">And we knew that the screw is going to become tighter and tighter. </sentence><sentence id="317">Uh we knew what was happening in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="318">But somehow we still had some foolish idea we are in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="319">Because, I remember so clearly, when I was about eleven or twelve, I read a book about the Marranos. </sentence><sentence id="320">These were the uh Jews in Spain who during the Inquisition had a choice either to give up their religion or be uh converted [to] Catholicism; and many of them became converted only in name, and still celebrated secretly all the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="321">And uh this was a very interesting story about the Inquisitor, etc. </sentence><sentence id="322">And I remember--you know, the kind of vignettes one remembers from childhood--I remember telling my grandmother, "Aren't we fortunate that we live in the 20th century in Czechoslovakia, that such a thing cannot happen to us!" </sentence><sentence id="323">Six short years, six short years [later, it] happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="324">Not only as to them, but much worse. </sentence><sentence id="325">Uh, kind of took away from us the protection that it happens to somebody else but not to us. </sentence><sentence id="326">One becomes and realizes how vulnerable one is. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Uh, I worked at that time what they used to call a Palestina Amt [Ger: Palestine Office].Uh, at that time there were still people able to move, uh emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="350">And of course, when you signed your paper for emigration, if I was Hanna Schiff at that time, I had to sign it as "Hanna Sarah Schiff." </sentence><sentence id="351">All the women had to put down "Sarah," and all the men had to put in "Israel" as a mid...as a middle name. </sentence><sentence id="352">And I was go...going to the Department of Treasury where I filled up some papers, and uh they had to pay that much of a... They had to give a list of all their property they were going to take with us in the suitcases, and they had to pay that much for this and that much for that. </sentence><sentence id="353">And so I was working on that. </sentence><sentence id="354">And therefore, I knew that the Jacob Edelstein was the head of the Palestina Amt, and knew some people there--which later became very important to me. </sentence><sentence id="355">Uh the...

My father for instance, he owned a workshop. </sentence><sentence id="356">That was taken away; and he had to start working again, because he didn't have such means. </sentence><sentence id="357">But fortunate my  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection grandmother lived with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="358">Uh my parents" maid--who was worked with us probably ten, eleven years, was my mother's age--uh was very helpful and undemanding. </sentence><sentence id="359">And she went shopping, and she did what she could. </sentence><sentence id="360">But of course, her ration tickets were regular ration tickets; but our ration tickets were marked with a "J," so we couldn't shop when there was food in the stores. </sentence><sentence id="361">We could shop only at certain hours for certain things, etc. </sentence><sentence id="362">But nevertheless, she was very instrumental in helping us. </sentence><sentence id="363">Uh my parents were... Oh, I should go back to one thing. </sentence><sentence id="364">At that time uh when the Germans came, of course, they went to the Jewish Kultusgemeinde--the religious and cultural community--and wanted the name(s] of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="365">And from there, they named...got the names of the transport. </sentence><sentence id="366">And we were so stupid, we went and we registered and we did what we could at that time. </sentence><sentence id="367">At that time, I had an infection in this finger, and uh it was following up my arm. </sentence><sentence id="368">And, of course, I couldn't go to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="369">By the way, at that point we were not allowed to use the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="370">Little bit later, there was one private hospital converted; and Jews were able to use that little private hospital, which was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="371">But at that time, there was nobody; and the infection was continuing. </sentence><sentence id="372">Uh the uh Aryan, non-Jewish, gentile uh fiancee of my brother-in- law--of Karel Schiff--uh took me without a star into the hospital, told them I am her cousin, had me operated, and took me by taxi home. </sentence><sentence id="373">By the way, we were not allowed to use taxis. </sentence><sentence id="374">So at great danger to her--because she had to tell them I am her cousin--I was operated in a regular hospital, and she took me home. </sentence><sentence id="375">Because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get help. </sentence><sentence id="376">I mean, these were the kind of things one doesn't even remember, because there were so many things that happened so often. </sentence><sentence id="377">But uh it was only because she had took me as her cousin, and she was a physician herself. </sentence><sentence id="378">Uh we were trying to hide a few things with some friends, and some friends were very cooperative and kept them. </sentence><sentence id="379">Uh some friends were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="380">And some friends decided if we don't come back, you know, they will keep it. </sentence><sentence id="381">It very much depended on which person. </sentence><sentence id="382">Uh I was just trying to think of something, and it just escaped me. </sentence><sentence id="383">Uh (SHORT PAUSE) that the... we helped by our listening to the orders to go and register people so they can be sent by transport. </sentence><sentence id="384">And it depended uh what you did, where you lived, how you went with it. </sentence><sentence id="385">So you were continuously threatened: "Am I going to be on the next transport?" </sentence><sentence id="386">Uh, of course, I'm not even talking about it that we had to give up uh jewelry, radio and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="387">Because if we listen to radio, it was dangerous, uh because all these restrictions were coming out. </sentence><sentence id="388">At one point, Heydrich--who was the protector of Czechoslovakia--uh was uh killed on one of the streets when two paratroopers who were sent from England were...threw a hand grenade under the car. </sentence><sentence id="389">And uh he was killed, and they were looking for them. </sentence><sentence id="390">And it was told that one was on a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="391">So they came around us and looking and confiscating bicycles and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="392">And we knew daily how many, we had uh lists of people. </sentence><sentence id="393">They were in the newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="394">They were posted lists of people who were shot, who were hung, etc. </sentence><sentence id="395">etc. </sentence><sentence id="396">Friend of mine was among them. </sentence><sentence id="397">Political reasons, or whatever reasons there were. </sentence><sentence id="398">It was like if you were in...
