<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Ivo, would you tell us your name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Ivo Herzer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Uh, I was born Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on February 5, 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="12">What is, tell us something about Zagreb and what it was like to grow up there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Zagreb is the capital of Croatia. </sentence><sentence id="16">It is one of the six republics in today's Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="17">Uh, it had a population, Jewish population of 10,000 out of 200,000. </sentence><sentence id="18">Uh, and uh, it was uh, it's a city that resembles Vienna to some extent in its atmosphere because it was in the Austro- Hungarian part for so many centuries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Tell me about, what was it like for you. </sentence><sentence id="24">How, where did your family live, in what part, and was it a Jewish quarter? </sentence><sentence id="25">What was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: There was no Jewish quarter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: OK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: There was no ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="34">There had never been any ghetto there. </sentence><sentence id="35">The Jews lived, uh, all over. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, we lived downtown in my grandfather's house. </sentence><sentence id="37">My parents were born in Yugoslavia already, but not my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="38">The Jews of Zagreb were strongly Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="39">And as far as the religious preference, they were...they practiced conservative Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="40">We were Ashkenazi, as opposed to the Sephardic Jews of eastern Yugoslavia--in Serbia, in Bosnia[- Hercegovina], in Montenegro. </sentence><sentence id="41">The total Jewish community of Yugoslavia before the war was about 70,000. </sentence><sentence id="42">As I said, with very strong ties to Eretz Israel at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: What about your family? </sentence><sentence id="54">Who made up your, your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: I have no brothers or sisters. </sentence><sentence id="58">And uh, I never met my, uh, grandparents, except one grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="59">So it was just my parents and I. My father was, uh, an employee in an insurance company. </sentence><sentence id="60">We were middle-class, comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="61">There were no signs of overt antisemitism there. </sentence><sentence id="62">There was antisemitism but it was kept more or less under the surface; and especially in the main part of Yugoslavia--in Serbia--there was no anti-semitism, because the Jews embraced the idea of Yugoslavia rather than separate nations. </sentence><sentence id="63">And so there was no government-sponsored antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="64">However, a Jew could not become a professor in the university, or get a government position or a high government position. </sentence><sentence id="65">This was  understood. </sentence><sentence id="66">Unless you're baptized himself or herself. </sentence><sentence id="67">But otherwise, we were left alone. </sentence><sentence id="68">There was inter-marriage, and there were friendships with the, uh, gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="69">It was quite a comfortable life for the middle-class. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: What kind of a schooling did you have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: I went to the Jewish elementary school. </sentence><sentence id="86">We had in those days four years of elementary education which was sectarian. </sentence><sentence id="87">So I went to the Jewish elementary school and then it was followed by eight years of high school, of European high school. </sentence><sentence id="88">I only finished six, because the war came. </sentence><sentence id="89">The Germans attacked when I was just finishing the sixth...uh, sixth year or sixth grade. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: What was that high school like? </sentence><sentence id="96">This was a secular high school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: This was a secular high school, which had a very strict, fixed curriculum embracing all fields of science, at least three languages, uh, including Latin. </sentence><sentence id="100">There was Latin, French and German were obligatory, besides Serbo-Croatian. </sentence><sentence id="101">Religion was taught in separate classes to the Jews, the Catholics, the Moslems, the Orthodox, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="102">So religion was actually the main subject; and if you didn't pass religion, you didn't pass that whole year. </sentence><sentence id="103">It was typical European, the educational system. </sentence><sentence id="104">No mercy, no promotion--unless you really passed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Did you enjoy it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Yes, I... enjoyed it; because I...I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was a good student, so it wasn't too difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="115">But this wasn't really a public education where everybody participated, like in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="116">Most of the population did not participate in this type of high school. </sentence><sentence id="117">Uh, there was a high rate of illiteracy, and, uh, education was not at all wide-spread in Yugoslavia of those days. </sentence><sentence id="118">So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of high school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: You talked about there not being official antisemitism but that antisemitism was sort of felt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="127">Did you encounter any such incidents when you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: I really didn't encounter any incident, except in sometimes perhaps a remark, uh, by a teacher who would meet us Jewish children going to our religion class, to another classroom. </sentence><sentence id="129">He would say something. " </sentence><sentence id="130">Here come the chosen people." </sentence><sentence id="131">It was sort of sarcastic, but it was...it was that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="132">Or, uh, if, uh, in the streets sometimes children would shout, "Jew, go to Palestine," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="133">But I personally did not encounter any strong antisemitic, uh, incident. </sentence><sentence id="134">However, there was at least one group, and it's the main group. </sentence><sentence id="135">There was a political party, underground, a fascist party which was antisemitic. </sentence><sentence id="136">And they did write graffiti and publish slogans, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="137">And they were the Croatian Nationalist Separatists, who didn't want Yugoslavia at all. </sentence><sentence id="138">They wanted independent Croatia, Catholic Croatia; and they were fiercely antisemitic. </sentence><sentence id="139">But they lived mostly in exile. </sentence><sentence id="140">In the inter-war years, they lived in Italy and Germany--which countries gave them asylum hoping that someday, as it happened, they could bring them back into Yugoslavia and install them in this Croatian state,  which would then be a satellite of the Axis powers. </sentence><sentence id="141">So there was always the underground; and it's a feeling of impending antisemitic, uh, doom. </sentence><sentence id="142">But in everyday life, it wasn't felt as much as it might have been in other parts of Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: What happened when the war broke out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: When the war broke out in 1939, Yugoslavia was neutral. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh, in 1940 Italy attacked Greece, and could not achieve a victory there. </sentence><sentence id="162">Germany wanted Greece out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="163">In fact, Germany wanted the Balkans secured; because Germany planned to attack the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="164">The Germans pressured the Yugoslav government of the time to let German troops go through Yugoslavia, so that they can then attack Greece. </sentence><sentence id="165">The Yugoslav government agreed, but there was a coup which overthrew that government. </sentence><sentence id="166">This was in Serbia. </sentence><sentence id="167">An anti- Fascist, anti-Nazi coup; and they installed a new government which was openly anti- German. </sentence><sentence id="168">It was in defiance, direct defiance of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="169">And in response to that, in April 1941, he ordered that Yugoslavia be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="170">Germany and Italy and Hungary and Bulgaria all attacked Yugoslavia, and defeated its army in about fourteen days. </sentence><sentence id="171">And that Croatian state was then established under the name the "Independent State of Croatia." </sentence><sentence id="172">And the exiled nationalists, antisemites, came back to govern that state. </sentence><sentence id="173">They called themselves "UstaSa." </sentence><sentence id="174">That means, uh, "Men of the Uprising." </sentence><sentence id="175">And immediately, within the first week, they began to introduce anti-Jewish legislation. </sentence><sentence id="176">Not only Jews, but also the Serbs. </sentence><sentence id="177">Orthodox Serbs were really on their list of destruction. </sentence><sentence id="178">And Gypsies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Tell us what was in that legislation and how did it affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: The legislation was sweeping. </sentence><sentence id="201">The Jews, there was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="202">The Jews had to wear a yellow, uh, piece of cloth on the shoulder and in the back with the, uh, word, with the initial for "Jew" in Yugoslav. </sentence><sentence id="203">They were, of course, thrown out of all jobs; and even out of apartments in a certain section of the city. </sentence><sentence id="204">They had to surrender cameras, radios, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="205">It was a preliminary, it was a set of measures to isolate the Jews and completely, uh, cow the Jewish population into numbness. </sentence><sentence id="206">Because it was very sudden. </sentence><sentence id="207">Almost upon arrival of these...of the UstaSa. </sentence><sentence id="208">And, selectively, they took certain groups--such as some lawyers--and executed them as being Communists. </sentence><sentence id="209">And they began some deportations. </sentence><sentence id="210">There...those were times, they were somewhat chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, it was a new state. </sentence><sentence id="212">There was chaos. </sentence><sentence id="213">The UstaSa were not that organized. </sentence><sentence id="214">There was a struggle between the Germans and Italians, diplomatic struggle, for the control of that state. </sentence><sentence id="215">And the Germans won that control. </sentence><sentence id="216">The Italians, who had banked on that, lost even though the Italians also got a piece of Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="217">In other words, it is important to understand that after the victory over Yugoslavia, the Axis powers dismembered Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="218">There was no more Yugoslavia as a state. </sentence><sentence id="219">There was the Independent State of Croatia; Serbia was occupied by Germany; western Yugoslavia--that is, Slovenia--was divided between the Germans and Italians. </sentence><sentence id="220">And most important, for my story, the Italians occupied that Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia and most of the islands. </sentence><sentence id="221">They also annexed part of that coast--the best part, the richest for tourism--Dalmatia, and made it part of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="222">So that was the situation. </sentence><sentence id="223">The Jews in Croatia [were] being slowly herded together, and taken to various camps. </sentence><sentence id="224">At one time, there were some thirteen or fourteen camps  operating in Croatia. </sentence><sentence id="225">The Germans were not in these camps. </sentence><sentence id="226">This was all...they were all run by the UstaSa. </sentence><sentence id="227">The, uh, savagerity that was practiced in these camps was such that even the Germans were horrified. </sentence><sentence id="228">In their internal memoranda, they called it the "Balkan bestiality." </sentence><sentence id="229">At one point--I don't remember the exact date, in July that same year--a transport was being formed. </sentence><sentence id="230">In other words, again Jews were being arrested, to be transported to an island where they all perished. </sentence><sentence id="231">I was arrested on a certain day. </sentence><sentence id="232">And I was then sixteen at the time. </sentence><sentence id="233">The agent detective who came to arrest me, the Croatian, had my name on his list and not my father's name. </sentence><sentence id="234">This was unusual. </sentence><sentence id="235">And my father protested and said that it must be a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="236">He wanted to substitute himself for me, saying that "You probably mean me, and not my son." </sentence><sentence id="237">The detective insisted, "No, it says Ivo Herzer and I have to take him." </sentence><sentence id="238">So my father said, "Well, I'll come with you." </sentence><sentence id="239">Of course, he couldn't go into that transitory camp; and so I was taken there. </sentence><sentence id="240">This was on the outskirts of the city of Zagreb, where fairs were held usually. </sentence><sentence id="241">And there were several hundred Jewish families with babies, complete families, pushed against the wall. </sentence><sentence id="242">And machine guns--heavy machine guns--were manned by the UstaSa, aimed at this mass of Jews who were...we had to respond to a roll call about every hour. </sentence><sentence id="243">We didn't know at all what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="244">Now we know what happened to that transport. </sentence><sentence id="245">As I said, they were taken to the island of Pag, P - A - G; and they all perished there under horrible circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="246">I was just lucky; because during the evening roll call, when my name came up, the UstaSa officer in charge said, "Are you here alone?" </sentence><sentence id="247">Since they had families. </sentence><sentence id="248">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="249">He said, "Take your things and go home." </sentence><sentence id="250">Just like that. </sentence><sentence id="251">He could have easily said, "Bring his family." </sentence><sentence id="252">He didn't. </sentence><sentence id="253">Now this was past curfew time. </sentence><sentence id="254">I had no paper in my hand to prove that I had a right to be anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="255">And so I ran home; and I wasn't...no patrol found me. </sentence><sentence id="256">I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="257">And my parents thought they had lost me already. </sentence><sentence id="258">And they couldn't believe their eyes when I just burst in upon them. </sentence><sentence id="259">It was then that my parents decided that we must do something. </sentence><sentence id="260">Try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="261">But escape where? </sentence><sentence id="262">The partisans were not yet active. </sentence><sentence id="263">Yugoslavia was surrounded by countries that were already under German domination. </sentence><sentence id="264">How could we, ordinary middle-class people, escape? </sentence><sentence id="265">And then the decision was made. </sentence><sentence id="266">Let us try to somehow escape to the Italian zone in Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="267">Maybe the Italians will let us in. </sentence><sentence id="268">Maybe they're not as bad as the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because we didn't really know anything about Fascist Italy. </sentence><sentence id="270">Since the Jewish community in Zagreb was oriented toward Austria and the German-speaking Europe, Italy was the place to go for a vacation maybe. </sentence><sentence id="271">But the fundamental difference between Fascism and Nazism, as far as Jews were concerned, was unknown to us. </sentence><sentence id="272">To us, this was a gamble. </sentence><sentence id="273">And my father obtained some sort of pass which could be gotten for some money. </sentence><sentence id="274">It was just a pass that said that we could be let out of Croatia, but didn't guarantee any entry anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="275">With this pass, without the yellow signs--which was a great risk--we left in July 1941 by train for the border. </sentence><sentence id="276">We wanted to go actually to the city of Split--Spalato, in Italian--which then was in Dalmatia, which then became Italy. </sentence><sentence id="277">And we thought if we reached that city somehow, as many Jews did, we would be safe--provided the Italians don't turn us back. </sentence><sentence id="278">On the way to Spalato, however, some troubles developed to the railroad. </sentence><sentence id="279">It seems that some guerillas must have blown up the tracks. </sentence><sentence id="280">The train was turned back; and we landed in a city which was the worst place to be. </sentence><sentence id="281">And this was the city of the Croatian Nationalists, where the UstaSa movement was born--the city of Gospi_--in a desolate part of the country with curfews, patrols, and a concentration camp for Jews just outside of Gospi_. </sentence><sentence id="282">We didn't know that, but there it was. </sentence><sentence id="283">The three of us,  plus perhaps six or seven other Jews whom we knew who tried to do the same thing, we coalesced into a small group, milling around at the station and then trying to go into town. </sentence><sentence id="284">It's a small town. </sentence><sentence id="285">On the way, we just knocked on a door--the first peasant house we saw. </sentence><sentence id="286">Fortunately, this was a house owned by an old Serb woman. </sentence><sentence id="287">And the Serbs were, at that time, again persecuted by the Croatians, just like the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="288">So she understood our plight. </sentence><sentence id="289">But she was afraid of harboring us. </sentence><sentence id="290">She said she could keep us only for so many hours. </sentence><sentence id="291">We sat there. </sentence><sentence id="292">We...we stayed in the house not knowing what to do. </sentence><sentence id="293">We couldn't go back to Zagreb. </sentence><sentence id="294">We couldn't go forward. </sentence><sentence id="295">We had false documents. </sentence><sentence id="296">We were lost. </sentence><sentence id="297">To all intents and purposes, it seemed a completely impossible situation. </sentence><sentence id="298">But again, we were lucky in that there was an Italian garrison in that town--as there were Italian garrisons all over the region which was not far from the sea, from the coast. </sentence><sentence id="299">At...we just ...we saw three Italian soldiers, or maybe four. </sentence><sentence id="300">I spoke a little Italian, almost nothing; and my father a little, because he took Italian in his high school days. </sentence><sentence id="301">We just approached these soldiers, just on the wild chance that they might help us. </sentence><sentence id="302">And we told them two words: "ebrei"--which means Jews, [and] "paura"--fear. </sentence><sentence id="303">They immediately understood, because they knew what was going on--as we now know. </sentence><sentence id="304">And they told us to quickly go back to the house, "calma"--calm, and they would bring their sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="305">Their sergeant came. </sentence><sentence id="306">He spoke some French, and uh, we...we knew French. </sentence><sentence id="307">It was easier to communicate. </sentence><sentence id="308">He said, "Stay here. </sentence><sentence id="309">I'll see if I can get maybe a pass for you, to get you into Italy." </sentence><sentence id="310">And he left. </sentence><sentence id="311">We didn't believe him. </sentence><sentence id="312">We thought he just said nice things. </sentence><sentence id="313">How would he, who is he, didn't want any money. </sentence><sentence id="314">He never knew us, but he came back. </sentence><sentence id="315">He said he couldn't get a pass for us; but at midnight he will come with a few soldiers and he will put us on an Italian military train. </sentence><sentence id="316">And there...and doing that would be enough to smuggle us into Italy proper. </sentence><sentence id="317">Again, we were quite skeptical. </sentence><sentence id="318">Why would he do that? </sentence><sentence id="319">But he did. </sentence><sentence id="320">And this was unforgettable. </sentence><sentence id="321">Uh, at night Italian soldiers carrying our bags and rucksacks, marching us--protectively--to the railroad station with this sergeant, waiting for an Italian military train. </sentence><sentence id="322">When the train came, he told us to get in; and he himself boarded the train. </sentence><sentence id="323">Now, the train was full of Italian soldiers who immediately gave room to the...to my mother and other ladies in the small group, offered us some food. </sentence><sentence id="324">And I think he just said, "These are refugees." </sentence><sentence id="325">And as soon as you heard the word...he said the word "refugee" to Italians, they immediately...their hearts melted. </sentence><sentence id="326">Whether it was an Italian refugee or a Jewish refugee, didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="327">They didn't protest. </sentence><sentence id="328">After all, we were civilians. </sentence><sentence id="329">We had no right to be on that train at all. </sentence><sentence id="330">Then, at the border, there were difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="331">Now, I'm talking about the border with Italy proper; because that whole scheme of getting to Split, in Dalmatia, had to be abandoned. </sentence><sentence id="332">He wanted us to go to the city of Fiume [Croatian: Rijeka], from where we could go Trieste--which was then Italy--and we would be safe. </sentence><sentence id="333">He got us across the border. </sentence><sentence id="334">They didn't know what to do with us, so they put us into the Customs House. </sentence><sentence id="335">He went to the authorities and said, "Here are these refugees; they haven't had anything to eat or drink. </sentence><sentence id="336">They've got to be given something." </sentence><sentence id="337">And some women's organization came, and they gave us orangeade and sandwiches to eat. </sentence><sentence id="338">And we stayed there almost a whole day. </sentence><sentence id="339">He left us, because he was assured by the authorities that we could stay. </sentence><sentence id="340">He shook hands with us and left. </sentence><sentence id="341">We never knew his name. </sentence><sentence id="342">However, at night, we were surprised. </sentence><sentence id="343">The authorities really did not allow us to stay. </sentence><sentence id="344">They put us back on a train and pushed us back into Croatia. </sentence><sentence id="345">We pleaded with the, uh, Italian military police, the Carabinieri, to give us back our documents, such as they were, so the UstaSa would not see that we are being pushed back as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="346"> Maybe that way we could escape, go back and try again. </sentence><sentence id="347">And the Carabinieri complied with our requests. </sentence><sentence id="348">So we made it back again, and we went all the way to Zagreb. </sentence><sentence id="349">We were totally exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="350">It was the most foolish thing to do, but we didn't really know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="351">And when we came to our apartment--this was only a few days later--it had already been taken. </sentence><sentence id="352">In the meantime, they came to search for us, to arrest all of us. </sentence><sentence id="353">Not having found us, they gave the apartment to a functionary of the UstaSa, who lived there. </sentence><sentence id="354">And the neighbors told us to just run away, because they were looking for us, as they were for other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="355">So we went again, and tried the same thing again. </sentence><sentence id="356">This time we made it across the border. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="516">A: We got off the train just before the border. </sentence><sentence id="517">We went to a village--again at random--and knocked on a door. </sentence><sentence id="518">And a peasant woman opened up. </sentence><sentence id="519">We actually told her who we were, that we were looking...we had money, we were looking for someone to smuggle us across the border. </sentence><sentence id="520">We knew that near the border, there were always smugglers. </sentence><sentence id="521">That is, there was always traffic from Italy into Yugoslavia and back; and that possibly the peasants would know some secret path. </sentence><sentence id="522">And it was true. </sentence><sentence id="523">Uh, this, uh, woman knew some people who took us across the border. </sentence><sentence id="524">We were not alone. </sentence><sentence id="525">We were also again in a group maybe of ten, twelve people. </sentence><sentence id="526">Not just the three of us. </sentence><sentence id="527">This time we made it. </sentence><sentence id="528">And we lived in a town near Fiume,| in Italy, for one month. </sentence><sentence id="529">Hiding. </sentence><sentence id="530">But the Italian police found us after one month. </sentence><sentence id="531">They arrested my father and myself, kept us in for one night. </sentence><sentence id="532">The Police Commissioner was very embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="533">And that was after the sergeant, the experience with the sergeant, which told us something about the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="534">Now the Commissioner of Police, when my father and I were brought to his office, he got up and he shook hands with us and asked us to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="535">This was not the Commissioner of Police that we expected to see. </sentence><sentence id="536">And he told us that he has no power to do anything, but he will leave our cell door open-- unlocked--as a symbol that we are not really prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="537">In the morning, we will be reunited with our wives and mothers. </sentence><sentence id="538">There were other Jews in that same town. </sentence><sentence id="539">They were all picked up. </sentence><sentence id="540">And so there was a sizable group of us. </sentence><sentence id="541">We were being marched to a bus. </sentence><sentence id="542">And we thought, "My God. </sentence><sentence id="543">Again they're going to push us back into Croatia." </sentence><sentence id="544">But they didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="545">By that time--and we know this now--their policy has changed ...had changed. </sentence><sentence id="546">The policy of returning Jews or not letting them stay lasted only in the very first weeks of the UstaSa regime. </sentence><sentence id="547">Once the Italians grasped...understood what was going on with the Jews and the Serbs, and the Gypsies, they did not push anybody anymore across the border. </sentence><sentence id="548">They engaged in intense activity as to what's to be done. </sentence><sentence id="549">But we have documents today that clearly show that neither the Governor of Dalmatia nor the Italian General [Vittorio] Ambrosio in charge of the Second Army on that territory had any intentions to return us into the Usta8a hands. </sentence><sentence id="550">So the bus took us to former resort town of Cirquenizza--C-I-R-Q-U-E-N-I-Z-Z-A [Croatian: Crikvenica]-- where, uh, we used to go for summer vacation, as many others. </sentence><sentence id="551">It was the headquarters of the Fifth Corps. </sentence><sentence id="552">By that time there were some fifty or sixty, a small group of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="553">We "In an article published in Midstream in June/July 1983, Mr. Herzer identified this town as SuSak, a suburb of Fiume. </sentence><sentence id="554"> settled there and we had, of course, representatives. </sentence><sentence id="555">My father was one of the oldest among the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="556">He spoke some Italian, so naturally he represented us. </sentence><sentence id="557">He went to the Major in charge of civilian affairs. </sentence><sentence id="558">He received him as if he were a friend. </sentence><sentence id="559">He said, "You are protected, and you are under Italian protection. </sentence><sentence id="560">Give us your names, your addresses. </sentence><sentence id="561">The UstaSa, who have the civil authority, won't be able to do you any physical harm." </sentence><sentence id="562">As an example, the UstaSa did not want to give us ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="563">The Italians forced them to give us ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="564">The UstaSa said we have to wear those signs--again, yellow signs. </sentence><sentence id="565">The Italians told us, "Well, let them have that. </sentence><sentence id="566">We must give in on some point. </sentence><sentence id="567">But physically, they will not be able to harm you, deport you, or put you in jail." </sentence><sentence id="568">Now, our numbers increased; because my experience roughly speaking was repeated in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="569">Between four and five thousand Croatian Jews--almost all that survived--found their way to the Italian occupation zone in Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="570">Either to the zone--we were in a zone, not yet in Italy--or to the annexed part of Yugoslavia, which was much safer. </sentence><sentence id="571">There were no Croatians there at all. </sentence><sentence id="572">But we were safe. </sentence><sentence id="573">All came and started a very extraordinary period in my life, because we developed close relations with the Italian army. </sentence><sentence id="574">Italian officers started dating Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="575">Uh, the Italian major came to play bridge with my parents and another Jewish lady. </sentence><sentence id="576">He brought me dictionaries. </sentence><sentence id="577">They brought us food. </sentence><sentence id="578">Uh, there were two things that stand out. </sentence><sentence id="579">One, that two weeks roughly I think after our arrival in Crikvenica was Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="580">And, uh, somehow the Italian major--whose name was Cipolla--learned this high holiday was at hand. </sentence><sentence id="581">He called my father, and told him that he had reserved a school room for the services. </sentence><sentence id="582">He abolished the curfew; because this was a war zone, due to guerrilla activity. </sentence><sentence id="583">He abolished the, uh, the ban on assembly which they had. </sentence><sentence id="584">You had to special permission if you had... As you normally have to have, in areas of martial law. </sentence><sentence id="585">And so we actually could celebrate Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="586">And he sent a lieutenant as his representative, who gave a little speech. </sentence><sentence id="587">It was incredible. </sentence></p></dialogue>

And I don't even know and remember who held the services, who actually led; but there is always somebody you can find, among thirty Jews, somebody who would be able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="675">We could read, after all, Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="676">We... somebody had, uh, the prayer books. </sentence><sentence id="677">And this was, of course, morally and psychologically, a tremendous boost. </sentence><sentence id="678">And shortly thereafter, we had another proof that they went--the Italians--beyond accepting us, or receiving us, or protecting us; when they invited all of us to a performance given for the Italian troops by an Italian military group of entertainers. </sentence><sentence id="679">And they gave us the place of honor, the first row. </sentence><sentence id="680">And, uh, it was really, I must say, uh, a...a moment that I can't forget. </sentence><sentence id="681">When, uh, we stood up. </sentence><sentence id="682">The Italian national anthem was played. </sentence><sentence id="683">The anthem of an Axis power, of the closest ally of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="684">And here are twenty, thirty Jews as their guests of honor. </sentence><sentence id="685">We couldn't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="686">It was just like a dream. </sentence><sentence id="687">This situation existed until November "42. </sentence><sentence id="688">Almost a year. </sentence><sentence id="689">We studied Italian. </sentence><sentence id="690">We felt safe. </sentence><sentence id="691">We, of course, wrote furiously to those who survived the initial deportations to come to the zone in...in whatever way possible. </sentence><sentence id="692">The connections established with the Italian officers--  that is, the connections we establish with them--were very productive. </sentence><sentence id="693">Because these officers were able to go, of course, anywhere in Croatia. </sentence><sentence id="694">Wherever they wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="695">And they would go by trucks and cars; and bring the parents, bring the sisters and bring the relatives of the Jews who were already in their zone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: And they did that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: And they did that. </sentence><sentence id="727">They even used armored cars, in a fake exercise, military exercise; and they did it at first on their own and spontaneously, without informing too much their very high authorities. </sentence><sentence id="728">So that the evidence is episodic, it's in anecdotes. </sentence><sentence id="729">But it is known that so many, that today there is no question that this was... It started from the lower ranks of the Army, just as our sergeant and many other such sergeants or lieutenants. </sentence><sentence id="730">But then it became a policy. </sentence><sentence id="731">It... it received complete approval by the highest levels of the Army and the Italian Foreign Ministry; which we, of course, did not know then. </sentence><sentence id="732">But we know today. </sentence><sentence id="733">Now, we could guess that the pressure on Italians that the Germans and Croatians exercised for our extradition was enormous. </sentence><sentence id="734">What right do they have to protect Jews who are not Italian citizens? </sentence><sentence id="735">Because we really had nothing whatsoever in common with Italy. </sentence><sentence id="736">And they fought back diplomatically until November "42, when they felt they have to do something-- otherwise, they would have to yield to the Germans or the Croatians. </sentence><sentence id="737">They decided to put all the Jews in the Yugoslav zones under the occupation into a camp. </sentence><sentence id="738">Plus several hotels, those regions that were very far from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="739">Tell the Germans we are in a camp. </sentence><sentence id="740">Tell the Germans that a census is being taken to see if any... any one of us might have some claims to Italian citizenship, because Italian citizens were protected. </sentence><sentence id="741">Jewish are not, all the time, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="742">There were even some Italian Jews living in Germany, and the Germans would not touch them. </sentence><sentence id="743">So the Italians used that as a pretext. </sentence><sentence id="744">This was part of a plan, of a consciously designed plan by a so-called rescue committee headed by the highest officials of the Italian Foreign Ministry--Pietromarchi," D'Ajeta,? </sentence><sentence id="745">Ducci, several other names, all known today, in the Foreign Ministry*--decided that the Jews would not be turned over to the Germans anywhere the Italians had control of the territory. </sentence><sentence id="746">The Italian Army cooperated with this whole-heartedly. </sentence><sentence id="747">In November "42, the Italians arrested all of us, put us on trucks, and we were taken to this camp--still Croatian Yugoslav territory, but under Italian flag. </sentence><sentence id="748">We didn't know again; we thought maybe this is just a stage before our being turned over to the Croatians. </sentence><sentence id="749">And, unfortunately, there were two people committed suicide; and the morale was very low. </sentence><sentence id="750">And the Italian commander of...of the Second Army, which is a very high official, he came personally to the camp to give us a speech to reassure us that we would be * Count Luca Pietromarchi was head of the Occupied Territories Department of the Italian Foreign Ministry. </sentence><sentence id="751">&gt; Count Blasco Lanzo d'Ajeta was Bureau Chief under Foreign Minister Ciano." </sentence><sentence id="752">Including Vittorio Castellani, who served as liaison officer between the Second Army and the Foreign Ministry. </sentence><sentence id="753"> protected.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="825">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="826">My father owned a third of the house where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="827">Two sisters and my father, and we sold the house about two weeks before the Germans attacked. </sentence><sentence id="828">And so we had some capital. </sentence><sentence id="829">My father was near 60, at the time; my mother, much younger. </sentence><sentence id="830">So there was no work. </sentence><sentence id="831">There was only...

On that island there were some British torpedo boats and Partisans; but at that time, the Partisans were Stalinists. </sentence><sentence id="994">Did not allow any contact with the British, so that we could not contact them. </sentence><sentence id="995">Fortunately, there were other refugees--not Jewish refugees, but just refugees. </sentence><sentence id="996">People from...running away from the horrible conditions of the multiple civil wars within Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="997">There were Quislings, the Partisans, the Chetniks and all the other groups fighting each other; and many people just couldn't stand it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="998">So that island was full of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="999">And all I can remember is that at one point all of us were picked up by a British ship military ship. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Actually, it was a passenger ship which they requisitioned. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And it brought us to Bari. </sentence><sentence id="1002">But the British would not let us off the ship in Bari. </sentence><sentence id="1003">They directed us to Taranto, all the way in the south of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And from there, we were taken to camps again. </sentence><sentence id="1005">The British had camps at the very heel of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And so we landed again in camps. </sentence><sentence id="1007">We were fed. </sentence><sentence id="1008">We were safe. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And the fate that the British ordained for us was to transfer us to Egypt, to some camps...tent camps outside Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="1010">The problem is...was that we were then surrounded by refugees; and among those refugees were also former UstaSa and elements. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Because the war  2 was coming to a close; and those days people would then run simply and cross and defect from one side to the winning side. </sentence><sentence id="1012">And we decided to get out of that camp in Italy now. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And that was possible. </sentence><sentence id="1014">We had to sign some papers; and then by train came to Bari, Italy--which was under the British Eighth Army. </sentence><sentence id="1015">So that this was really then the liberation, in a sense, for me. </sentence><sentence id="1016">We were then safe. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Yugoslavs would have been enemies of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1089">And they never were very friendly, because the two countries have always had a great deal of difficulty because of Dalmatia--coveted by Italy, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1090">And yet, on a personal level, I never experienced that. </sentence><sentence id="1091">I spoke very good Italian, which helped; because if you speak Italian, the Italians generally will feel this is quite an honor to them. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Somebody took the trouble to study the language. </sentence><sentence id="1093">So my difficulties were over. </sentence><sentence id="1094">But I didn't yet quite realize how rare the Italian gesture was, because the full impact of the Holocaust was not known. </sentence><sentence id="1095">I'm talking now about 1944, "45. </sentence><sentence id="1096">It wasn't known. </sentence><sentence id="1097">It came out differently and slowly; and gradually, one realized what...what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And what could have happened to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1137">Q: Bari. </sentence><sentence id="1138">You stayed in Bari for how long? </sentence><sentence id="1139"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1143">A: I stayed in Bari from January "44 "til 1946, somewhere "46. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1145">Q: Where did you live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1147">A: Lived in the middle of a city, in an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1148">The apartment was assigned to us by the British military authorities that assigned empty apartments to refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Because many Italians had fled. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Fled the bombing; or many Fascists fled, thinking that they would be punished if caught. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So there were many apartments free. </sentence><sentence id="1152">So we lived there in this assigned apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1153">I'm sure the rent was almost zero. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I worked, in the beginning; and this was enough to feed us, because I got rations plus money. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And I then got another job. </sentence><sentence id="1156">After the job with the Field Security, I got a job teaching English to Yugoslav partisans who were in hospitals all around Bari. </sentence><sentence id="1157">So I worked for the British Council, which is like the Voice of America. </sentence><sentence id="1158">It is a similar organization. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Uh, and they paid quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So L...we were able to really be independent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1175">Q: It sounds as if you lived really fairly comfortably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1177">A: Yes, I...I think we...we did. </sentence><sentence id="1178">Because with two of us working, and then three of us working, surely. </sentence><sentence id="1179">Then came the end of the war; and then the British Council closed its doors, and I went to Rome. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Someone told me go the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I went there, and it was early in the formation of the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="1182">I'm using the word "Joint" - it's the American Joint Distribution. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Was...and they said, "Yes, you can. </sentence><sentence id="1184">You'll work for us. </sentence><sentence id="1185">If you know these languages, fine." </sentence><sentence id="1186">So I moved to Rome; and my parents then moved later, a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee from "46 until "48. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I was an administrative secretary in the HaSharot Department. </sentence><sentence id="1189">We dealt with the refugees of the, of the Brichah, the...the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who sought to go to Palestine--later Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1190">They reached Italy from Poland or Russia, from all the other camps; but before that, they were housed in various places in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And then they would generally secretly embark and hope not to be intercepted by the British and taken to Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="1192">Well, I worked in that department, in an administrative capacity to somebody; and did translations and dictations and so on, visiting those HaSharot, listening to...to what they needed, their needs, their requests, making out requisitions and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1193">This was until 1948. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1211">Q: Tell me... Talk about the Joint during this period. </sentence><sentence id="1212">You were really in the middle of all this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1215">What was the organization itself like during this period and what kinds of things did you do? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1216">Let's talk about the organization first. </sentence><sentence id="1217">What it was like? </sentence><sentence id="1218">How big was it? </sentence><sentence id="1219">How active were the people who worked for it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1220">A: The upper management came from the United States; and, uh, the, uh, middle management and support staff was all recruited from refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1221">Not so much locally, not...not the Italians; but refugees, uh, who came from various countries of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1222">The Yugoslavs were very numerous, because obviously there were many Yugoslavs who found themselves in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1223">But there were Poles, and Germans and Austrians, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1224">There was a very mixed staff. </sentence><sentence id="1225">The activities that had to deal with the actual illegal immigration were not known to me. </sentence><sentence id="1226"> 4 They...I mean, they...they kept it well hidden. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I mean, I did not overtly have you know anything. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I...I only surmised that something was going on; when suddenly, two HaSharot were closed and nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="1229">But it had to be done this way, because the British of course didn't just want to intercept the immigrants or potential immigrants at sea. </sentence><sentence id="1230">But they pressured the Italian government to use their police surveillance to prevent the embarkation of Jews bent on...on breaking the blockade to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1231">So it had to be really kept very secret. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And I know it was because none...none of the co-workers that I remember knew anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1233">There were a few individuals, I remember, who were Sabras; and they were, I think, in charge of that. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And they did not have a clear job. </sentence><sentence id="1235">It was never clear to me what they were doing; but they spoke perfect Hebrew, and they looked to me like the kind of guys who could and would organize and had no fear. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Very decisive men, who could not only lead a meeting but also lead people at night through a mine field. </sentence><sentence id="1237">That much I...I still remember; but I didn't have direct, any direct work. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I didn't take part in that. ( </sentence><sentence id="1239">PAUSE) The question was for everyone, when the war ended, what do to, where to go. </sentence><sentence id="1240">We didn't want to go back to Yugoslavia--which was at that time not just Communist, but Stalinist Communist. </sentence><sentence id="1241">And we just couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Certainly my father would not go, and I would do whatever he said. </sentence><sentence id="1243">At that time, I wasn't on my own; and I never had any desire to go there. </sentence><sentence id="1244">The question was Palestine or Israel on one hand, or the New World. </sentence><sentence id="1245">But out of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Many people wanted out, just out. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And, uh, I received a Hillel B'nai B'rith scholarship in "48, which then decided. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And the decision was made then for me, obviously, that I could go and study, make up the lost time. </sentence><sentence id="1249">Because somehow, in the narrow vision, that's all I saw--that I lost these years, and I had to make them up. </sentence><sentence id="1250">That was the main thing. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Especially after the shock--which was a big shock to me--that now that I survived, I really couldn't go back. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Because I always wanted to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1253">I mean, in my dreams or in my feelings and hopes, that if I survive, the war is over, we're only a few miles from Zagreb, we will go back. </sentence><sentence id="1254">And I'll find some friends; and, uh, somehow you go back. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I never thought of really leaving while I was under the Italian control. </sentence><sentence id="1256">But then afterwards, it became clear that there was no back, that there were no friends. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Because Croatia, that independent state of Croatia we talked about, the UstaSa Croatia, contained about thirty thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1258">But no more than, uh, fifteen percent survived. </sentence><sentence id="1259">So really, even apart from the regime, there was no real going back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1300">Q: It must have been very hard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: This was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1303">It was very, uh...in a way it was, to realize that you're in exile, in a sense. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Because it is, after all, we couldn't go back. </sentence><sentence id="1305">We could have. </sentence><sentence id="1306">But in 1948, when Tito broke with Soviets and allowed the Jews to leave, practically all Yugoslav Jews left for Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Not all, but practically all. </sentence><sentence id="1308">They just weren't happy there. </sentence><sentence id="1309">But not because of any antisemitism, but just the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1310">After all, the conditions were just the way they are today in Poland or East Germany and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1320">Q: So you had this B'nai B'rith scholarship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1322">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1323"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1326">Q: To where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1328">A: To the University of Illinois. </sentence><sentence id="1329">I said I wanted to study engineering. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And, uh, then they gave scholarship to quite a few individuals who had to prove that they knew English, and so on and so on, and finished high school. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Which wasn't easy in Europe to achieve. </sentence><sentence id="1332">But they choose...they chose the school; and they sent me to the University of Illinois in 1948. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And I, uh, studied electrical engineering, and I graduated in 1951 because I had some courses. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I...I went to University in Bari and took some engineering courses also. </sentence><sentence id="1335">So they recognized that. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And I went summers, and speeded up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1346">Q: Did your parents come with you, and how? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1348">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1349">That was probably the worst thing, uh, in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="1350">That we were together during the war, and could not really be together afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Because they were...applied for, on a quota, for a visa to get to the United States; and, uh, there was a spot on my father's lungs. </sentence><sentence id="1352">And an American doctor said this is TB. </sentence><sentence id="1353">And from that moment on--no matter what other doctors said or what other tests were conducted showing that it's a dead process, not an active process, because my father was a heavy smoker--that original decision could not be rescinded. </sentence><sentence id="1354">But my mother was forced to come here so she would not loose her place. </sentence><sentence id="1355">She came in 1949 to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1356">Had to leave him there. </sentence><sentence id="1357">In 1949, he was already 66 years old; and he could never get this entry visa, even though later on he came as a visitor. </sentence><sentence id="1358">My mother went there from back to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1359">By that time, they had no more money. </sentence><sentence id="1360">They had no more way; you know, it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I was going to school here, and so they were getting some help from, uh, United Nations refugee organization, UNRRA. </sentence><sentence id="1362">But we had relatives in Israel, and they told them to come. </sentence><sentence id="1363">So they went to Israel in 1954. </sentence><sentence id="1364">And I became a citizen here in 1955, and so I was able to then leave and go and visit them. </sentence><sentence id="1365">But, uh, those were great efforts. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And I tried to... You know, the x-ray pictures were sent to me; and I showed them to doctors here, and they were all unanimous and said, "No, this is obviously not an open process. </sentence><sentence id="1367">And even if it were, so what? </sentence><sentence id="1368">I mean, the man can be put into a hospital in under observation." </sentence><sentence id="1369">But they wouldn't let him in. </sentence><sentence id="1370">This was part of a...at that time, of an effort to let as few Jews in as possible; which according to ...which is...which was true according to, uh, research that was done much later. </sentence><sentence id="1371">I myself came under the displaced persons law, because I came as a student. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Even that was not easy, because for me to come to the United States I had to have a student visa. </sentence><sentence id="1373">I couldn't get an immigrant's visa, because I...my...my number wasn't up. </sentence><sentence id="1374">To get a student's visa, you have to have a national passport. </sentence><sentence id="1375">So that if you commit a crime, the United States can send you back. </sentence><sentence id="1376">But I had no national passport. </sentence><sentence id="1377">I had to renounce my Yugoslav citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1378">I was stateless. </sentence><sentence id="1379">How can you then get a student visa? </sentence><sentence id="1380">So again, the Italians said, "Well, we'll give you a statement that we will let you into Italy if the Americans push you out." </sentence><sentence id="1381">And that should convince the Consul that he could give me the visa; which they did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1416">Q: So you came here. </sentence><sentence id="1417">You went to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1420">A: I went to school in Illinois; and stayed one more year to get a Master's. </sentence><sentence id="1421">I almost got it, but I  6 didn't quite get it. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And then I went to New York from, uh, Illinois and started working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1426">Q: As an engineer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1428">A: As an engineer. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And then got other degrees at night; which was for many years I got the Master's, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And then slowly thinking and rethinking all those events, I became more and more interested in--not only my past, but in this aspect of the...the rescue. </sentence><sentence id="1431">The...the Italian story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1436">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="1437">It's quite a story. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Ivo, I'd like to back up a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1439">The island-hopping you did in order to get to Bari, from the camp to Bari. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Can you describe it in a little more detail? </sentence><sentence id="1441">Uh, we don't uh... Did people take out sailboats? </sentence><sentence id="1442">Did you do this at night? </sentence><sentence id="1443">How was this done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1452">A: This was mostly...mostly small motor boats and sail boats. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Mostly. </sentence><sentence id="1454">It's all I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1455">There were maybe five or six islands, when I was island-hopping, before the big one. </sentence><sentence id="1456">I remember, on one island we were so...we were tired. </sentence><sentence id="1457">We somehow found our way to...to the local teachers--a married couple. </sentence><sentence id="1458">They gave us their bedroom to use for that night. </sentence><sentence id="1459">I don't know how, because I was not involved. </sentence><sentence id="1460">It was all, again, in the hands of, you know, my father. </sentence><sentence id="1461">There was always a leader in a group; because we were a part of a small group of people. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And then there was another group and they came to the same island, and so you have a group, so to say, travelling. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And the last big hop to the big island, where the British were, there we had a big boat--70-ton fishing boat. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And, uh, the sea was very bad, and there were too many of us. </sentence><sentence id="1465">It was awful. </sentence><sentence id="1466">What they did is, they left the older people in the hold; and us, the younger ones, they lashed us with ropes on the...uh on the deck, so we wouldn't be washed away by the waves. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And the sea was mined; but the mines were much deeper than this small boat, relatively small boat. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Seventy tons is not very big. </sentence><sentence id="1469">So we were also safe that way. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And I actually, again, profited by that; because being out in fresh air, even though there were waves and it was scary, but I didn't get so sick as the people down in the hold. </sentence><sentence id="1471">But I don't have any clear specific, you know, incident to relate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1492">Q: And you have no sense of how this was organized, or how it was done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1494">A: It was done... No, it was done on a day-by-day. </sentence><sentence id="1495">There was no...that we would line somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1496">So the man who, the local fisherman or someone, who brought us there would be paid; and we...we tried to sleep somewhere on the ground, or some house or school. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And then, maybe, find somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Again, we have some money or clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1499">I remember, we gave some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1500">In fact, my Bar Mitzvah blue suit was given away, I think, on one of these islands--as a contribution which was more important than money; because money really didn't mean much at that rate. </sentence><sentence id="1501">People, again, wanted clothes, gold, food and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1502">But I don't have any specifics; recollections of an interesting incident. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1512">Q: When the British interned you, as it were, uh, again... How... You never, in fact, got taken to Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="1513">You were...you were... what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="1514">You were under the British control. </sentence><sentence id="1515"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1520">A: We were in a camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1522">Q: What was that camp like? </sentence><sentence id="1523">The British camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1526">A: We were housed in hotels and abandoned villas. </sentence><sentence id="1527">We slept on the floor, stone floor. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Uh, it was typical refugee, refugee-type situation. </sentence><sentence id="1529">You know, if you can imagine the Red Cross... When people are evacuated--the disaster, you know, make-shift quarters. </sentence><sentence id="1530">But we were fed. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Uh, and I don't know how many people there were; but I think this was a pretty large camp. </sentence><sentence id="1532">It wasn't only Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1533">In fact, mostly non-Jewish refugees from Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Uh, we heard--but we were not told, we heard-- this is in rumors, that the camp was destined for El Saff. </sentence><sentence id="1535">That was the place somewhere outside Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="1536">And I remember my father said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="1537">Not one more camp. </sentence><sentence id="1538">If we can get out of here, let's get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1539">Somehow we will be able to live in Italy." </sentence><sentence id="1540">Because uh again, this wasn't something that we knew, but we felt it's...it's possible. </sentence><sentence id="1541">It will be possible to make a...to exist, rather than in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Only proved to be true. </sentence><sentence id="1543">But we had no contact with the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="1544">Although there was... I'm sure that many things were going on; and Jewish organizations might have been active, the Italian-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1545">I didn't know, I did not know that. </sentence><sentence id="1546">I was still a little dizzy. </sentence><sentence id="1547">I was... END OF VIDEOTAPE ... Well, the main thought is that I'm glad now that, uh, that the Italian contribution to the rescue is now becoming known. </sentence><sentence id="1548">Even though it involved few people, compared to the tremendous tragedy of the Jewish nation. </sentence><sentence id="1549">Still, there were so few positive episodes in the Holocaust that this one had to be recorded, made known. </sentence><sentence id="1550">And I'm glad now that I see that books are coming out and articles, research is being done; that this is finally, after 40 years, becoming known. </sentence></p></dialogue>
