<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: -- yeah, it was a happy household obviously, but it was not -- it was a Jewish household where you would have a fight and you would have some people screaming, and you have arguments. </sentence><sentence id="397">Was a whole hullabaloo, you know? </sentence><sentence id="398">I do remember arguments, too. </sentence><sentence id="399">I do remember my father getting upset and angry and you know, using strong words. </sentence><sentence id="400">He was a coyen and you know, the Kohanim are -- are traditionally seen as people who are easily irritable. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="478">A: For years, yes. </sentence><sentence id="479">So on the holidays we go to the synagogue, all of us, I remember -- like it was one year -- you know, holiday I could play with the other kids for the entire day in the big courtyard of the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="480">Coming in, when the Kohanim gave their blessing of -- for the congregation, something which doesn't happen here unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="481">It's the only thing I am disappointed because the Kohanim here are not -- except for very Orthodox synagogues are not called on high holidays to give their blessing you know, for the -- for the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="482">So at that moment th-the prayer, even when I was small child, five, six, seven I was called in and I s- strained to hear and recognize my father's voice because if you saw sometime the scene, the    Kohanim are the front, then they say to the back, to the congregation which is behind them, and at a certain point they all turn around but they have their heads covered by the big talit -- talitim. </sentence><sentence id="483">And their hands, which are -- are covered. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="503">Q: No -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="504">A: Not everybody can do it. </sentence><sentence id="505">But the Kohanim are trained to do that. </sentence><sentence id="506">Pll -- I can tell you how I was trained to do that. </sentence><sentence id="507">And he would then say the blessing and the long prayers, stay with the back of the congregation and when they have to say lvareh'ha adonai ve'ishmereha and so on, they turn around to the congregation and say that in loud voice. </sentence><sentence id="508">And this is when I was trained -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="509">Q: Hear it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="511">A: -- straining to recognize the voice of my father, and to tell you frankly, honestly, it still rings in my ears when I think of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: Yeah, is really -- he was really yelling, and I was able to recognize, among the chorus of the voices. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="517">Q: So did he teach you things at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="519">A: So, as a child before Bar Mitzvah you are not supposed to do that, but after Bar Mitzvah you are [indecipherable] you have to po -- so, as part of the -- when it came time to be prepare for the Bat Mitzvah, there were terrible times already in Romania, the war started, the -- there was a massacre, the pogrom of Iasi to -- in 41, and I was to be Bar Mitzvah'd in 44. </sentence><sentence id="520">So from deg42, in fact, they took -- he took -- and my mother [indecipherable] for me a Melamed to teach me at home because -- I believe we are jumping history, you know, again, but after the pogrom I couldn't go to the school so I stayed at home for a full year. </sentence><sentence id="521">The Melamed would come and teach me, and will teach me Hebrew and other things, but one of the things of those teaching was to keep my hand this way. </sentence><sentence id="522">And this was done very simple, anything body can do. </sentence><sentence id="523">Take a string and tie those two fingers together and those two fingers together -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: And you separate -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="525">A: -- and then separate them. </sentence><sentence id="526">And do that several times and you'll end up able to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="527">Q: Able to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: -- to do it. </sentence><sentence id="529">And most people when they try, they do it this way, and they cannot, th-they tremble, and -- try it, you'll s -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="530">Q: Right, it's not so easy. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: It's not easy, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="532">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="533">A: -- you -- you tend to think that you cannot do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="548">Q: Michael. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="550">A: Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="552">Q: What sort of friends did you have when you were a ki -- and I'm -- I'm really trying to distinguish if we can, before the war. </sentence><sentence id="553">Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends, did you live in a Jewish neighborhood? </sentence><sentence id="554">How do -- would you de-describe it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="558">A: Yeah, wi -- we live in several houses, my parents never owned a house, so we had to move every two, three years for rent purpose and for other things, so I remember some of our houses, and you know, you ca -- friendships depend on geographical location and on space patterns, so I -- [remember I had a very good friend, his name was Marcu Grunberg, in one house, which I terribly missed when we moved in another house and I kept looking for him years, and I found him again when I was in my 20's or so -- looked for him. </sentence><sentence id="559">So there were some friends th -- this way then, in the last house we lived in the year before we went on refu -- or became refugees, I had some kids in the same courtyard, which was basically a Jewish courtyard with one Romanian family, and I befriended -- befriended also the girl in that family, who was about my age. </sentence><sentence id="560">So basically I had a mixed group of friends, I think. </sentence><sentence id="561">Most of them were Jewish, and then when I was thrown out of school and I resumed ler -- schooling after a year in a community, Jewish community school, of course all my friends were Jews, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="562">That was my childhood, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: All right, e-explain something to me, because yo-you -- you used a nomenclature that seems very typical in Europe, but not necessarily here. </sentence><sentence id="569">You said there were Romanians, and there were Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="572">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="574">Q: But you are Romanian, so why the nomenclature -- do you think this way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: Because in Romanian -- rom -- in Romania we were identified as Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="578">Q: Not as Romanians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="580">A: Not as Romanian, Romanian was a second kind -- of course we were -- my father was Romanian citizens, we all were Romanian citizens, but we were the Jews of Romania. </sentence><sentence id="581">Here in the States, and you know, the American culture, you say always both, you know, Romanian Americans, or Jewish Americans, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="583">A: So -- but over there it was very distinct. </sentence><sentence id="584">So when I say Romanian, I mean non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="585">They could be Romanian or even Hungarian people, and others, all kinds of national -- it didn't matter to me at that time, the exact ethnic identification, but we knew who was Jewish and who was not Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="589">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="592">In fact, we were reminded very often that we are Jewish by those who were not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="595">Q: Did -- did you experience anti-Semitism as a kid before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="597">A: Yes, of course -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="598">Q: You did. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="599">A: -- yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: And -- and how did it manifest itself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: In all kinds of ways. </sentence><sentence id="604">In school you are known and remembered. </sentence><sentence id="605">We had the very clear identifier, the name. </sentence><sentence id="606">So being named Catz was from the very beginning a clear identifier to everybody, first the teachers, who knew that we are Jewish, and I'm Jewish, and many of the kids, who heard a lot of things about Jews and non-Jews in their families. </sentence><sentence id="607">It was -- no, yo-you need to understand also the background. </sentence><sentence id="608">Moldova, that part of Romania was heavily populated by Jews, and by the turn of the century, many townships in Romania and some bigger towns too, had -- a majority of their population was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="609">So the presence was massive, there was always an issue, and in Romania when I lived, it was the second town of Romania, and by that time it was almost half -- a little bit less than half of the population was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="610">I read documents which said at a certain point in time, the beginning, turn of the century or [indecipherable] before, the Jewish population exceeded a little bit, 50 percent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="620">Q: This is in Iasi? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="622">A: In Iasi, yes. </sentence><sentence id="623">So that made everybody conscious and clear who it is and who isn't. </sentence><sentence id="624">The heavily populated Jewish areas are almost homogeneously Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="625">Ours was not, we were a bit farther away from the massive Jewish concentration of Jasi. </sentence><sentence id="626">But our courtyard had still a majority of Jewish people, even though our house was very close to the most important chur -- cathedral in -- in Iasi, the Mitropolea, Mitropolea, which was a very important, the most important religious place, Christian religious place. </sentence><sentence id="627">So this explains my reference, Joan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: [inaudible]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="636">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="638">Q: But it must have been more comfortable in Iasi because there was such a complement of Jewish people, where it's almost 50 percent, if not more at certain times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: Well, you can reason this way -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="641">Q: Or maybe not? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="642">A: -- the question wa -- the question is whether that was real what happened. </sentence><sentence id="643">In fact, the presence of many Jews made it easier for the ideologically anti-Semites to build their entire propaganda and advocacy ag -- against Jews, that here is a population which is a parasitic population, which is oppressing us -- which was not true because they just didn't have the political power -- which absorbs our economic resources. </sentence><sentence id="644">Which again was false because the Jews being in economic activities were the -- in fact the engine of -- of many activities and facilitating. </sentence><sentence id="645">They were not land owners, or maybe large land owners never Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="646">But they facilitated the trade between agricultural sector and the urban consumers. </sentence><sentence id="647">And so -- so the number made it easy to mount a very strong chauvinistic, anti-Semite attitude for those who wanted to exploit that. </sentence><sentence id="648">Not everybody bought that on the Romanian side. </sentence><sentence id="649">Some did not buy. </sentence><sentence id="650">Not every single Romanian was anti-Semite, but there was a long tradition of anti-Semitism in Romania. </sentence><sentence id="651">The literature is replete with description of Jews in a very negative way. </sentence><sentence id="652">You know, the Jidan was the equivalent of Kike, and this was thrown very liberally to everybody. </sentence><sentence id="653">Not liberally in the positive sense, but very easily to everybody as an insult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="667">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: Is -- you know, go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="670">I mean, I know that -- the existence of Palestine I learned from the curses which were thrown at me as a child. </sentence><sentence id="671">When I came home and asked my mother, what is Palestine? </sentence><sentence id="672">So in that time there were boys who knew that and say you don't have a place here, and use that. </sentence><sentence id="673">So this accounts for the distinction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="679">Q: Was this hard on you as a kid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="681">A: I-It was something which was intended as a humiliation. </sentence><sentence id="682">And when you are a child and you are cursed, everything which is accepted as a curse is -- becomes a curse. </sentence><sentence id="683">So yes, you were -- you were -- you felt very bad, and insulted and all of a sudden kind of sad that's you are -- you are something totally different and base. </sentence><sentence id="684">That was, again, in the context of literature which described Jews often as -- as evil. </sentence><sentence id="685">There is now a book, a very interesting book, written by a -- somebody in Romania, a Sociologist who is Jewish [indecipherable], "The Image of the Jew in the Romanian Culture." </sentence><sentence id="686">The book is that thick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="693">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: Because there is a lot to write about the image of the Jew in the literature, in poetry, in -- in paintings, in design, in -- in all -- all the means of arts. </sentence><sentence id="696">The -- very unfortunately, the main poet of Romania, Mihail Eminescu was really a very great, romantic poet. </sentence><sentence id="697">In his political philosophy he was very reactionary on various grounds, including being an anti-Semit -- Semite. </sentence><sentence id="698">And he wrote -- well, his poetry is beautiful and everybody can enjoy it, and -- and really feel the emotion and identify with the poetry. </sentence><sentence id="699">His article, because he was also a j -- a journalist, were replete with base, evil reasoning, which are a shame. </sentence><sentence id="700">In fact for him, now as you look at him in retrospect, and for -- very unpleasant and uncomfortable for Romanian culture, but it's a fact. </sentence><sentence id="701">This is how -- so however the reputation of his poetry somehow gave more weight to -- to the evil political reasoning, and that captured too, a lot of minds. </sentence><sentence id="702">So anti-Semitism has been a -- a big problem in Romania, and Romania is not -- has not expurged even today, yet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="711">Q: When you were a -- when you before -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="712">A: Despite all the changes which Romania has gone -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: Gone through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: -- and all the progress -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="716">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: -- and now moving to a totally different pass, a democratic pass, anti-Semitism, paradoxically, despite the small number of Jews who are still there, is still visible, yes. </sentence><sentence id="718">Not so widespread, certainly not as of -- official pol -- policy or ideology, definitely not so, but still present. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="721">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="722">When -- when you were a kid, di -- there were special things in school that you liked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="725">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: You have to ask me what school, because -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="728">Q: Okay, which school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: -- yes. </sentence><sentence id="731">I started school in 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="734">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="735">And you were seven then? </sentence><sentence id="736">Six? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: Yeah, seven. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="742">Q: Seven, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: Seven, yes, seven, exactly seven. </sentence><sentence id="745">But two years later, in 1940, by decree of government, all Jewish children were expelled from state schools. </sentence><sentence id="746">And therefore I had to go to a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="747">The community had to create in a hurry, school for all this mass -- big mass of children who were suddenly all expelled. </sentence><sentence id="748">I -- so my first recollections are from the school where I went together with other children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1717">A: There were about even more, seven, eight meters I would say, which yes, exactly 25 feet length. </sentence><sentence id="1718">All standard cement, you know, some -- but those are the collective graves, which were set immediately after the war -- I mean, the -- the -- the slabs. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And historical -- historical paradox and irony, and the sociological paradox is that those -- the graves of those killed in those -- in the massacres, are in several cemeteries not far from another corner of the cemetery, which co- contained the graves of people who were killed during the first World War, and in some prior war, which was called the War of Independence, when some Jews were allowed to fight for -- in the army. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Still distinguished as Jews, but they're very willing to fight and proud to fight for the independence of Romania. </sentence><sentence id="1721">And then they were buried in the Jewish cemetery, where their remains were brought because they were Jews, in -- but the Jewish communities were very proud that part of their community gave their lives in the fight and in the war for Romania's independence. </sentence><sentence id="1722">It was a matter of honor, and the desire to make their contribution to the country and identify with the right cause of independence of the country they were living. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And that corner of cemetery, the heroes of the independence war, and of the first war is always treasured, and kind of honored specifically. </sentence><sentence id="1724">And next to it you can see the -- the Jews killed in Romania in a massacre, in a pogrom which was the -- the premonition of what was to happen in the next year on a even larger scale to so many other hundreds and thousands of Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1733">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1735">A: So this is -- it was -- later when we -- some of the people who remained alive, send messages where they are, and their families went and contacted, and tried to find out whether their own relatives were among the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1736">One arrived in some wha -- Calarasi. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And another, which was farther away, another was in Portleroi which was closer and easier from Iasi to travel there. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And you know, there was an unending waiting, and when people came back, family members, and were -- got the news that their father, or their brother, or their son didn't make it, was killed, and others was all right, no, you know, that -- you know, Sroul Abramovitch died. </sentence><sentence id="1739">I know for sure because he died in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="1740">And the other died, and I know when his body was -- was thrown down. </sentence><sentence id="1741">So they found -- they got the certainty of having lost those people forever. </sentence><sentence id="1742">So it was a continuous awareness of that pogrom. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3480">A: This document is something -- is a gift which I received from the Jewish community of Balti in 1994 where I returned to my birth -- town of birth, simply to see how it looked at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3481">I was on a World Bank mission to Moldova for developing programs which the bank was developing for Moldova, in my capacity the senior advisor at that time at the bank for social policies. </sentence><sentence id="3482">I also spoke the language of course, so I went on that mission, and I took a few days off from the work problem to be able to visit my town, Balti. </sentence><sentence id="3483">At that time I wanted to see the synagogue in which my -- my grandfather was praying in his time, but it had been destroyed long before by the war, and very little was left from Balti -- from past Balti. </sentence><sentence id="3484">So I was told however that the new synagogue was created in a home, which was built like a usual home, a dwelling, but in -- it's used as a synagogue and was taken there. </sentence><sentence id="3485">And then I saw there indeed, in "94, through the people who are living in Balti, the Jews living in Balti, in a -- in a Saturday morning, with a full service done as -- by usual service. </sentence><sentence id="3486">My leader, th-the person who brought me there was my cousin, first cousin, Zioma Faerstein, who was -- whom I mentioned before, who was living with his family still at that time in Balti, in 94. </sentence><sentence id="3487">He took me to the synagogue and explained to me -- I -- I wanted to have some kind of memory and I asked whether I can have something from that -- they say we cannot give you any sidur, because we have very little sidurim, there are not enough, we don't have any other items. </sentence><sentence id="3488">But I notice in that corner, some cardboards with some inscriptions. </sentence><sentence id="3489">I say, "What are these?" </sentence><sentence id="3490">They say, "Well, these are things which we had to write when we opened up -- came back from -- from the camps and there were a lot of people who died in the camps, and those who stayed alive wanted to say Kaddish after them, pray. </sentence><sentence id="3491">But they didn't know to the Kaddish, the Hebrew Kaddish words. </sentence><sentence id="3492">So we had to write the Hebrew Kaddish with Slavic -- with Cyrillic letters so they can pronounce, reading in Cyrillic letters, the -- the words of the Kaddish. </sentence><sentence id="3493">At that time we wrote -- we created the black -- the cardboards, and these are some of them." </sentence><sentence id="3494">On the right hand corner you can see the Hebrew word from Kaddish, the dollit is missing. </sentence><sentence id="3495">Only k-u then sheen. </sentence><sentence id="3496">On the left hand corner is Kaddish the same word with Cyrillic letters, and then the whole Kaddish is written in Cyrillic letter.
