<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="523">Q: Are you very politically conscious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="525">A: Yes, and I was fairly Croatian -- well, first | was very Yugoslav. </sentence><sentence id="526">And then I become quite Croatian because they -- mostly because, probably because the pressure from Belgrade was really quite bad. </sentence><sentence id="527">You felt it and everyday life. </sentence><sentence id="528">In fact, if you look at a certificate, school certificate from a public school in Zagreb, it was supposed to be in the two languages. </sentence><sentence id="529">So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Serbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin script. </sentence><sentence id="530">It went that far. </sentence><sentence id="531">There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. </sentence><sentence id="532">I guess you just become -- many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were mostly nice and decent and I don't think -- they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly not overtly so. </sentence><sentence id="533">I don't know, maybe some were. </sentence><sentence id="534">Some were, on the contrary, very less so. </sentence><sentence id="535">And both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very -- had friends of all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="536">During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul's regime and the various Serbian -- especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression, and one of the members of my extended family was a young man who was a communist. </sentence><sentence id="537">He was in the same jail as Mose Pijade, and he was killed in the war. </sentence><sentence id="538">There was a whole group of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had no idea what it really meant, and who sat in jail. </sentence><sentence id="539">And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was the one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="540">They were in very, very notorious political prisons. </sentence><sentence id="541">One of them is Lepoglava where they continued giving, you know, that was also later on in jail during the Ustashe regime and so on. </sentence><sentence id="542">So, there was a lot of that going on. </sentence><sentence id="543">I'm trying to think, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: If I can ask you a question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="565">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="567">Q: How would you characterize being very Yugoslavian Nationalist versus when you talk about becoming Croatian? </sentence><sentence id="568">How does one distinguish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="571">A: Well... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="573">Q: How would you distinguish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="575">A: For me, I think this happened when I was maybe I was eleven. </sentence><sentence id="576">I guess you suddenly became aware of that this was a repressive regime and that people's friends were being -- were being oppressed and also the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="577">At that time, Doctor Macek, who was sort of the leader of the Croatian peasant party and then later on became a member of the government, was in the opposition, and you lived in Croatia and not in Belgrade. </sentence><sentence id="578">You have -- a lot of taxes and -- not a lot, most, almost everything went to Belgrade. </sentence><sentence id="579">So, there it was [coughs], excuse me, there was a great deal of corruption of one kind or another. </sentence><sentence id="580">Money that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in Belgrade, and public works that were necessary in Croatia never took place. </sentence><sentence id="581">They were done in Belgrade. </sentence><sentence id="582">They weren't even done in Serbia. </sentence><sentence id="583">They were stalled along the way. </sentence><sentence id="584">And, later on, there was a political --I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which is convenio, but actually they -- the Croatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was repressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor Macek. </sentence><sentence id="585">And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you'd drive out in the countryside, you know, the peasants would yell, "Zivio Doktor Macek!" </sentence><sentence id="586">You also yelled, "Zivio Doktor Macek!", </sentence><sentence id="587">and so on - May he live long. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: And what does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: Doctor -- "May he live long," I mean, "Hail," or whatever you want to Doctor Macek. </sentence><sentence id="604">And this -- the Croatian consciousness, which had been really very, very repressed -- and maybe that was one reason why all those Ustashes were successful later on because, you know, of course, they via a Bulgarian assassin killed Alexander, and after that, there was a very repressive regime in Belgrade which repressed Croatia most of all. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: I didn't feel it, no. </sentence><sentence id="616">I did not feel it, but I mean, it was talked about a lot in school. </sentence><sentence id="617">Like, for instance, "God forbid, Croatia is not the Balkans. </sentence><sentence id="618">The Balkans stop at the Sava River." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="623">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="627">Q: So, who was Croatia, from that point of view, if not the Balkans? </sentence><sentence id="628">Just Croatia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="631">A: It was Croatia. </sentence><sentence id="632">And actually, geographically, it does stop there, and that's how far the Turks went. </sentence><sentence id="633">I mean, this is where they were stopped before going, getting into Vienna. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: Very much so. </sentence><sentence id="684">In the first place, we had, very soon after that, refugees coming in. </sentence><sentence id="685">Not under horrendous duress, but wanting to leave Austria, and we had very intimate friends there, which was a mixed marriage. </sentence><sentence id="686">The husband was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="687">The mother was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="688">They wanted to leave. </sentence><sentence id="689">They came, they stayed with us, and they finally left for Argentina. </sentence><sentence id="690">One of the men who were working in my father's factory. </sentence><sentence id="691">Actually, he was in charge of livestock. </sentence><sentence id="692">He was half German and half Argentine, and as you know, they had a big cattle industry in Argentina, and he was there for years on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="693">The farm was part of the factory, as I told you. </sentence><sentence id="694">This was all -- molasses were there and the cows were eating part of it, and so, this man, who had both German and Argentine citizenship, managed to get these friends, whose name was Polla (sp), visas to go to Argentina, and they stayed with us in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="695">And more and more Austrian Jews were coming, sitting in coffeehouses. </sentence><sentence id="696">That's when there started to be some unpleasant remarks were made, "Do we need these German speaking foreigners sitting here?" </sentence><sentence id="697">Then it became, "German speaking Jews." </sentence><sentence id="698">And obviously they were staying either in rooming houses or hotels or with friends, but they were -- everybody was --it was a coffeehouse society. </sentence><sentence id="699">I mean, my mother went to coffeehouse, my father -- not the same one mind you. </sentence><sentence id="700">The men played cards in one place, and the women had their bridge game someplace else or just went for coffee. </sentence><sentence id="701">So, it was a coffeehouse society like Vienna, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="702">You know, here they are talking German. </sentence><sentence id="703">At that point, nobody, none of the Croatian Jews spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="704">We were -- except to them. </sentence><sentence id="705">I mean, it was, "Please don't speak German." </sentence><sentence id="706">And we didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="732">Q: So, you, at that point, began to feel a certain kind of threat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="735">Absolutely, from that time on, and it was getting more and more. </sentence><sentence id="736">There was talk of Dachau, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="737">There were no killing camps. </sentence><sentence id="738">There were no extermination camps. </sentence><sentence id="739">There were concentration camps and political camps and so on, and we knew of them. </sentence><sentence id="740">We knew that things were starting to happen, and at that point, obviously, we were -- oh, and then for instance, we had a subscription to Neue Freie Presse, which then we didn't want to have anymore. </sentence><sentence id="741">Then, instead of the German papers, the Austrian papers, my father got Swiss papers, and everybody was listening to the radio to see what was happening, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="742">That was very -- that felt threatening already. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="778">Q: But you decide you will not talk German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: Not only I, and there were a lot of people for whom it was hard because their education had been Austro-Hungarian, and there -- and their literary language was not Croatian. </sentence><sentence id="781">Mine was. </sentence><sentence id="782">I spoke German, but I never - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="786">Q: Was it true for non-Jews as well as Jews the decision not to speak German, or was it mainly the Jewish population? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="788">A: I think mainly the Jewish population, yeah, because the upper-middle class, non-Jewish, probably continued. </sentence><sentence id="789">These were remnants of old Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy, aristocracy and so on, and they spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="790">And there were certain parts of Croatia where German was spoken almost as an everyday language. </sentence><sentence id="791">It never was with me, but for instance, Osijek, my great-grandmother, spoke Croatian, and very well and correctly, but she was more comfortable in German. </sentence><sentence id="792">But that was the town of Osijek where there was a great -- by the way, that was a very large Volksdeutsche population around there that had come in -- Slavians that had come in, I don't know, in the 17" century, 18" century, a whole batch of them who then became quislings of the worst sort. </sentence><sentence id="793">But, I mean, there were villages of nothing but German-speaking people in, mostly in Slavonia. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="812">Q: What is that they think is going to happen, or what...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="814">A: They are, I don't know, they were not comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="815">There was one and possibly, now that I think of it, these were mostly mixed marriages. </sentence><sentence id="816">There was another very well-off industrialist by the name of Alfred Braun, who was married to a non-Jewish Austrian woman, who took off for Kenya, and he was a business friend of my father's, and I remember them coming on business occasions previously, and then leaving for Kenya from Yugoslavia, as I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="820">Q: Do you remember young people your age, young teenagers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="822">A: One of them was -- with families only -- and another thing that happened is we all used to wear dirndls, you know Austrian -- not real dirndls because they were too expensive to wear -- but, you know, the little aprons and dresses with little puff sleeves. </sentence><sentence id="823">Everybody stopped wearing that. </sentence><sentence id="824">My brother had lederhosen. </sentence><sentence id="825">That was -- I still have a picture of him as a small child, and then all that disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="826">It was also worn in Slovenia, you know, on the border, but we all stopped wearing stuff like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="832">Q: Let me ask you something, does this stop because it's -- you're feeling anti-German? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="852">A: No, there would be a threat. </sentence><sentence id="853">And we, obviously -- I mean, then later on things started to develop and Croatia was entirely surrounded by countries to which you couldn't go in, either pro-Nazi or were actually overrun or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="854">So, it was sort of like a little island, especially when the Germans entered Greece, it was very threatening, but that's much later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1329">Q: So, he was perfectly comfortable? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1331">A: Oh yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1333">Q: So, you had a big social life during that summer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1335">A: Yes, because two days after we were there, or maybe three days after we arrived, four other people that we knew from Oxford arrived -- two young men. </sentence><sentence id="1336">Two were journalists, and two were people that I just knew who had just graduated, who were -- but not friends of Joe's. </sentence><sentence id="1337">They met there. </sentence><sentence id="1338">He was very jealous, as a matter of fact, but I had made these arrangements previously, and they came and they were going to go do a tour of the Balkans or Europe or whatever afterwards, and they stayed with us. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And then there was the invasion of Poland in September, and all of them immediately went to Zagreb to the British Consulate and immediately -- immediately reported, and the other four took off right away, almost immediately, to go to England, and Joe stayed maybe another week and went back. </sentence><sentence id="1340">That's the last time I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="1341">They put him on the train a week later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1349">Q: Did you try to convince him not to leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1355">Q: That must have been very sad time for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1357">A: It was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1358">I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="1359">It was on the railroad station, and of course at that time to embrace a man you weren't married to or whatever, kiss him on the railroad station, my parents averted their heads and went off, and it was so on. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Maybe I was here and they were 100 meters away. </sentence><sentence id="1361">Underneath there's way, there's a whole new...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1513">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1514">One of the things that's going on is you're listening to Radio Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1515">Paris Radio had a Yugoslav by the name of -- I can't remember, but I do have his name written down -- he was -- oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic. </sentence><sentence id="1516">He had one of these programs, like Voice of America had later on, where he was broadcasting to Yugoslavia and railing against the Germans, and then when France fell, he went on -- not to Vichy -- he ended up in the United States, but he followed the French government where he could -- where he was broadcasting, and he ended up in the United States, and I ended up doing translations for the censors here for him, and when he was sick doing his broadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav government, which was very funny, you were listening to that. </sentence><sentence id="1517">You were listening again on the radio to neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the table, and friends. </sentence><sentence id="1518">What's going to happen now that Hitler's about to get us all? </sentence><sentence id="1519">But, you didn't know where and how. </sentence><sentence id="1520">This was -- these were family councils going on among the members of the families -- dining rooms or another. </sentence><sentence id="1521">It was constant. </sentence><sentence id="1522">And people who had lived in the provinces, like the parents of these cousins that were in London, moved to Zagreb to be handy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1523">The major problem was that there were currency restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="1524">You couldn't send any money out. </sentence><sentence id="1525">The other problem was that my father was a reserve officer, a captain first class, and he would have had to have gotten permission from the army to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1526">They were sending mobilizations going on. </sentence><sentence id="1527">There wasn't mobilizing, but there was a -- there was a state of alert, let's say. </sentence><sentence id="1528">My father --not my father, anybody, this wasn't anything exclusive -- had to do every -- I don't remember when you, probably, at various intervals, but at that time, I think, every two years, you had to go and do some active duty as an officer. </sentence><sentence id="1529">He was a reserve officer in the Yugoslav army, and every once in a while, they would pull you for three months or six months or whatever to re- I don't know -- to get them up, you know, to whatever was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1530">To get them ready for necessary combat, and my father -- this was probably in 1940 -- was in Split for three months doing his military duty, and I had nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1531">So, I came to stay with him in Split, and that was very exciting, very nice first of all, nobody was supervising me. </sentence><sentence id="1532">I was living in a hotel, and I would see him in the evening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say. </sentence><sentence id="1533">One of the officers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the mountain is Bosnia, and there were number of recruits who were Muslim. </sentence><sentence id="1534">And I remember on one occasion how aware they were of Hitler and anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="1535">The Imam saying to my father, "Don't you worry about anything, Fredo. </sentence><sentence id="1536">If they come, I will say you're Muslim. </sentence><sentence id="1537">The main thing has been done already." </sentence><sentence id="1538">So, you know, this is -- this is what -- I think that's sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1626">Q: Do you talk together about -- is he telling you now that he's trying to figure out a way to get you all out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1628">A: Not at that particular moment, but yes, we talked, because this group was trained to withstand the Italian army, because, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1629">Okay, so, obviously, I mean, we know what they're getting to, you know, to face. </sentence><sentence id="1630">We did talk about it, sure. </sentence><sentence id="1631">Then, as I'm walking along in Split looking at shop windows or whatever, maybe palaces, maybe Diocletian's Palace, something more cultural, my high school class turns up on their high school graduation trip, and I joined them, and that was a rather amusing thing because I have all of these dressy clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1632">I was dressing in the evening in this hotel where they were staying. </sentence><sentence id="1633">So, I packed all of that up, and I left it with my father who then sent it to Zagreb, and my father was on duty and a soldier was supposed to escort me to this third- class bus that my class was riding in to go to Dubrovnik, and I made a little suitcase of some kind or other, and this was like five o'clock in the morning, five-thirty in the morning, and suddenly there's this knock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="1634">And I said, "Who is it?" </sentence><sentence id="1635">in Croatian, and the man says, "The army." </sentence><sentence id="1636">He was some kind of guy who was in -- who my father had sent to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="1637">So, this was the army that was getting me out of bed, and left me there, and I joined this whole group, and then we finally got back to Zagreb on some horrible third-class train, sleeping on the floor, as I was saying how they were doing in Dubrovnik on mattresses on the floor, and that's what we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="1758">Sorry, I've got to go." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1763">Q: Why would they have thought you would have been an activist? </sentence><sentence id="1764">Was that something that you gave inclinations of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1767">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1768">I think they knew where my heart was, and they knew, I mean, obviously I wasn't a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="1769">One of them may have been a member of the party at one time, but he did -- he served in the Croatian Ustashe army. </sentence><sentence id="1770">The other one, the other one, whose father was a very famous grammarian, we used his grammar, nowadays | think it's still probably used. </sentence><sentence id="1771">His name was Ivsic, became director in the Zagreb University, so, I mean the University of Zagreb during Ustashe time, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2029">Q: Excuse me, was there any doubt that your father would get permission? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2082">A: We had no other, no way to traverse. </sentence><sentence id="2083">I think, if I look in the passport, that all of this was obtained in Belgrade, the various consulate and embassies and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2084">So, when we came to Belgrade, first of all, we had the permission from the army, then they wrote in this delegation thing that he was going as a delegate of the Ministry. </sentence><sentence id="2085">Otherwise would have not been able to get there. </sentence><sentence id="2086">And we all got these official visas, because you didn't just get a visa. </sentence><sentence id="2087">You got an official visa. </sentence><sentence id="2088">I know that my uncle -- my uncle, I think had an affair with the prime minister's -- the prime minister's wife. </sentence><sentence id="2089">He was all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="2090">He was a very, a popular guy, and had generally all sorts of connections. </sentence><sentence id="2091">He was divorced first. </sentence><sentence id="2092">He was a likeable, nice guy who had connections, and I think he helped somehow hasten things. </sentence><sentence id="2093">We spent one horrendous night. </sentence><sentence id="2094">There were two other members of the family, one or two -- my aunt's husband was also a lawyer who was a businessman, who was there in Belgrade and I don't know why, and somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="2095">And at the very last minute, we found that there was an industrial or some kind of fair, either industrial fair or an agricultural fair or something like that in Budapest, and they were giving visas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2110">Q: To be able to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2112">A: To be able to go, and this was the only -- this was the only -- the only place, the only border you could cross. </sentence><sentence id="2113">You couldn't go anywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="2114">The Germans were in Greece already, couldn't go through Bulgaria, couldn't go through Italy, couldn't go through Austria via Slovenia. </sentence><sentence id="2115">This was the only way to go, and this was some kind of probably excursion visa, I'm not quite sure, but they were giving these visas because there was this fair. </sentence><sentence id="2116">We spent the night in Belgrade, and the next morning -- naturally Yugoslavia was completed mobilized by that time -- and decided that the chauffer would help us with the cars and go with us to the Hungarian border, and then be able to report back to the family whether we crossed or not. </sentence><sentence id="2117">And in the train, my father wrote out an affidavit or something and said to the chauffer, who clearly was a member of the family, "You will need to take care of your family. </sentence><sentence id="2118">Use this car as a taxi or whatever you want." </sentence><sentence id="2119">And he gave him all the papers, and the piece of paper and the letter in which he said that he should take this car, which he did. [ </sentence><sentence id="2120">laughs] And the very first week, Artukovic, the Croatian minister of the interior became, I mean, he became his driver. </sentence><sentence id="2121">The car was requisitioned and he became his driver, and stayed with him until the very last, and didn't tell him that he was fleeing, and this poor guy was caught by the British, and Artukovic took off to Argentina and finally ended up here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2132">Q: So, he - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2134">A: He gets us- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2148">Q: You mean in the train station, not in your train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2150">A: No, no, in the train station in Belgrade, this was total chaos, and there were recruits with peasants with their wives sitting on packages. </sentence><sentence id="2151">I mean, you could hardly make a step. </sentence><sentence id="2152">It was total complete chaos. </sentence><sentence id="2153">This was the mobilized peasantry that was going to be fighting the Germans, all over the Belgrade station. </sentence><sentence id="2154">No, he went -- he left us on the Hungarian border, when the train, just before the train crossed to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Now, there were German officers on the train already going -- I don't know where they were going -- but there were German officers in jackets and everything going up and down in the train, but the war had not been declared yet, and troop trains going in the other direction towards Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="2156">And we arrived in Budapest, got into a nice hotel, and phoned Belgrade and told them, "We're here." </sentence><sentence id="2157">Meanwhile, tried to find out where other members of the family were, the ones who were in Zagreb. </sentence><sentence id="2158">Some were getting ready to go to Dubrovnik, which they knew was going to be, if anything happened, it would be Italian, but they were not there yet. </sentence><sentence id="2159">Other members of the family stayed in Belgrade, and we talked to them when we got to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="2160">That night, maybe six hours later, they were bombed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2173">Q: But, they wouldn't listen to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
