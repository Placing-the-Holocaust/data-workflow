<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Uh do you have any recollections of the beginning of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="130">I do. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh I was four and the the the strongest recollection is when the Germans invaded because what happened was that we were told that they were going to bomb Breda and so all of us, and that was Jews, non-Jews, uh were told to leave Breda and my brother was hospitalized - he had a middle ear infection - and my mother was frantic because we were all told to leave. </sentence><sentence id="132">My mother was absolutely frantic, was trying to get him into a hospital and they were told that they had to keep the hospitals empty for the wounded that were expected, so all of us, uh all of us including my baby sister and my aunt - at that point my aunt, my mother's only sister and her daughter also lived with us, so it was a hugh family. </sentence><sentence id="133">My my grandfather who was oh 80 years, uh five small children - by that time my baby sister was born - five small children, uh the oldest of whom was seven, my parents, my aunt and her daughter, all had to leave Breda. </sentence><sentence id="134">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="135">We were, we had to walk - we walked about I would say between twenty and thirty kilometers along a road uh trying to find farms where we could stay and I remember being strafed --the bombs, the Germans would bomb us. </sentence><sentence id="136">And uh there were seventy people killed just along that road and I remember uh a woman still standing over her baby carriage, protecting her baby who was killed. </sentence><sentence id="137">And every time the the airplanes would come, my aunt, my mother's sister, would pull us aside and and she was particularly fond of me and she'd literally cover me with her body. </sentence><sentence id="138">And then when the airplanes left then we'd walk again, and I remember stopping at farms and the farms would be full and finally - I think it was about 28 kilometers - we had walked 28 kilometers - uh getting to a farm where they had some room and we spent about five days there, sleeping in the hay, until the all-clear was sounded and then walking back - the having to walk back we were not strafed - I don't remember being strafed or bombed during that walk back. </sentence><sentence id="139">Uh and half way through some buses came and so mothers with children were allowed to go on the buses and so we didn't we didn't have to walk all the way back. </sentence><sentence id="140">And coming back to our town and founding, finding the town unscathed basically - so that was the first memory of the war. </sentence><sentence id="141">Uh then ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: When you returned to the town, was it already occupied by the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="158">You see at that point the Germans - they they overrun, they overran Holland in five days, so I mean the the Dutch put up a strong resistance but you know, they were not prepared to deal with the masses and then of course the Germans bombed Rotterdam as punishment for German, for Dutch resistance. </sentence><sentence id="159">And uh so we were immediately occupied by the Germans and nothing much happened immediately but then my memories of those early years are pretty vague because they they started rounding up Jews - oh first from the coast. </sentence><sentence id="160">Now Breda is 50 kilometers north of Antwerp and 50 kilometers southeast of Rotterdam, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="161">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="162"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I gather they picked up Jews initially from the coastlines, so to prevent them from fleeing. </sentence><sentence id="163">That's why I think there were so many Dutch were murd... were massacred - they they just had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="164">They couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="165">Holland was immediately occupied and all exits were basically uh closed and so you were trapped in, we were trapped in our own country. </sentence><sentence id="166">And the first memories I have uh I have is of wearing a yellow, having to wear a yellow star and I was four, so I wasn't ready for school yet, but uh I remember that because we wore a yellow star, we weren't allowed to ride the buses. </sentence><sentence id="167">I remember we weren't allowed to have radios. </sentence><sentence id="168">Uh and then we were told that when I was ready to go to school in 1942, well really it was 1941, uh we couldn't go to school anymore and so for a while there was a little Jewish school that they had in a - I remember it was on the second floor of a of a building down town Breda, and going there and sitting in a classroom with who knows - twenty other Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="169">And the children just disappearing. </sentence><sentence id="170">I mean one after the other these children just disappeared until that school closed and then my father tried to teach us at home and I think that was in 1942 because Jewish children were not allowed to go to school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="171">And and then you know, getting strong messages that that something very bad was going to happen and it was scary and my parents being scared and just fear, fear enveloping the family pretty much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: When you mentioned the children disappearing from the school, were were families at that point being deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="192">That's when they started. </sentence><sentence id="193">They started deporting the Dutch Jews, as I said they uh they started first deporting them from the coasts. </sentence><sentence id="194">They didn't - the reason we we survived is because they didn't get to us until 1942 uh so we lived in Breda until 19...until the fall of 1942 uh but had they come had they come to us earlier we would have we would have disappeared too. </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh see I have a memory still and this this was how close that it was. </sentence><sentence id="196">My aunt lived in the same town we did but in a suburb of it, and they picked her up oh I think a couple of months before they came to us, and I can remember, I mean I have a clear memory of standing in our doorway in the house that we lived in and waving goodbye to her and her daughter, and they were off to a Polish war camp. </sentence><sentence id="197">That's what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="198">And they went with a baby carriage to the train station where they were sent to Auschwitz and of course never came back. </sentence><sentence id="199">And that was the aunt who was very very close to me, my mother's only sister and her daughter. </sentence><sentence id="200">So uh, so they were sent to Auschwitz uh where we would have gone too uh but - oh yeah, because we lived in Breda so we were just far enough from the border that we were to be picked up later. </sentence><sentence id="201">And uh it just, and these children you know, may have lived on the on the outlying areas of Breda, the children, and then of course the schools closed because there were no children really left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: During this period of the of the occupation, uh how did your parents tell you how to behave when you left the house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Uh, to be very very careful. </sentence><sentence id="216">I mean we wore yellow stars and and the yellow...the way it worked in Holland is that everybody had to have an ausweiss. </sentence><sentence id="217">That was like a passport, and - including us children - and uh in order for us in order for one to have rationing cards you had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="218">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="219"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to have an ausweiss, and Jews had a big J on their ausweiss. </sentence><sentence id="220">And, of course, we had to wear the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="221">So you could be stopped at any time and asked for your ausweiss, and if you if you didn't have your ausweiss with you or and you wore a yellow star, you were shot almost you were shot immediately. </sentence><sentence id="222">So what basically happened is we, they didn't let us uh - we were young anyway - but they didn't, they they became extremely protective of us and they didn't let us be out on the street by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="223">And when we would go out, it was with my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="224">My grandmother had died in "39 but my grandfather would take us for walks. </sentence><sentence id="225">As a matter of fact that's one of the reasons we were saved. </sentence><sentence id="226">It's just incredible, incredible uh circumstance. </sentence><sentence id="227">When I ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Shoot. </sentence><sentence id="244">Why don't you go ahead and talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="245">We can go back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="250">The uh uh so that that - what happened was that life became totally family-oriented, that uh they first picked up the Jewish men and I - that's another extraordinary situation - that my my mother's father uh had been very very wealthy, and lived in Zempelburg [Pol: S_polno, or S_pdlno Krai_skie] in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="251">And after the Ist World War, during the 1st World War, had contributed a lot of money to the German war effort, and after World War I when that part of Germany where he lived uh became Polish, and he opted to remain German and he moved to Berlin, and he got a Cross of Merit from the German Kaiser. </sentence><sentence id="252">Uh they picked up Dutch men first. </sentence><sentence id="253">They took them, Jewish men first and they took them to slave labor camps and my father had sort of been excused a couple of times one because he was head of the Jewish Council, or he was not perhaps not head but he was a member of the Jewish Council, because he had five children, uh and so on, but he had to, he was to report and I can remember it - my mother just being in tears. </sentence><sentence id="254">Well, the day before, the day before my father was to report, my mother, and she is an incredible woman really - she took that Cross of Merit to the Nazi commander of our town, and everybody said don't be ridiculous - it's not going to do you any good, and she said look at what my father did for you know the fatherland, and he actually acc...he actually excused my father, thanks to her. </sentence><sentence id="255">And again, that saved our lives because without my father we would not have been saved. </sentence><sentence id="256">And the next week, it turned out that was about a week before the rest of the family was going to be called out - we disappeared within that week. </sentence><sentence id="257">And the reason we survived is because a man who worked for City Hall, uh and I don't know - this this is what I was told - I mean that's not a memory I have. </sentence><sentence id="258">I remember walking with my with my grandfather of course, but what happened uh he would take us for walks and a man who worked for City Hall knew what was knew what was happening to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="259">By 1942 by the way everybody knew what was happening to Jews, so the the idea that people didn't know and America didn't know, and England didn't know is garbage. </sentence><sentence id="260">Because we knew and we had no radio. </sentence><sentence id="261">And everybody knew. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh and uh this man had seen us because he worked for City Hall. </sentence><sentence id="263">He was familiar with what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="264">He had seen my father take us four children for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="265">My baby sister was too little. </sentence><sentence id="266">And he felt so sorry for us because he knew what was going to happen to us, that one day he came to our house, he came to my father's house and he basically said do you want to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="267">My father said no. </sentence><sentence id="268">He said well, why don't you do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="269">My father said what can I do - I've got five small children and an elderly father-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="270">And he said if I, if I promise to help you, will you try and get out, and within a week - and I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="271">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="272"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection remember a significant part of that - uh other friends, Dutch friends had given us names of people who were willing to take in Jewish children, and within a week we disappeared, and it turned out to be just in time, just before the whole family would have been deported to Auschwitz, because most Jews went to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="273">Uh and what he did is he gave us false passports so the false ausweiss, so as our name was in Dutch "Magnus," uh he gave us authentic passports--because he had access to the blanks--and with new names. </sentence><sentence id="274">And our new name became "Wachness." </sentence><sentence id="275">Of course, Magnus is spelled M - A - G- N- U-S. Wachness was spelled - it sounds the same. </sentence><sentence id="276">So if we would make a mistake, it wouldn't be as noticeable. </sentence><sentence id="277">But the spelling was totally different - it was W- A- C- H-N-E-S-S. And uh and I remember one day we were playing outside and my mother calling us in and saying, children, we want you all to pick a new name. </sentence><sentence id="278">And we had, because Anita is not a common Dutch name - uh we had always pretended we had different names, and I still feel bad about this because my sister Ingrid, the young...one just below me, her her play name had been Leesha (ph), but that's the one I had coveted, and mine had been Lanie (ph) and so when we got to pick new names, I said I want to be Leesha, and I remember Ingrid saying that's my name and I said well I got to be first again. </sentence><sentence id="279">You know, I was the older girl so I got to pick so that's how we picked the new name. </sentence><sentence id="280">My brother's name was Norman. </sentence><sentence id="281">He became Jan.

and because they ran a school, they took in other children who were not Jewish and so for them to have other children there was not as obvious as it would have been for you know for an ordinary family. </sentence><sentence id="308">So that was a very safe place for us to be. </sentence><sentence id="309">Now we were told never ever ever to tell anybody we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="310">That nobody knew and that we were never to let it be known, and so that was a horrendous burden on us. </sentence><sentence id="311">On me particularly and it's interesting that when my brother's much older, well three years older than I am, I think I was much more conscious of the whole situation than he was and uh and my earliest memory - I think when we we went to Bilthoven in in October - no in September of 1942, and again what surprises me in retrospect is that there was no questioning - it was it was real acceptance and real understanding of what was going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="312">There was no question about the fact that if we were discovered we would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="313">I mean that, we lived with that throughout the war, and I also - you know, now when I think about the horror of it, it blows me away. </sentence><sentence id="314">But I'm so grateful we were children because we accepted it - there was none of the the fear of the neurosis, or the neurosis or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="315">There was none of the pathology that that could have induced really uh because we just knew it was going to happen - that that was the way, you know, being very concrete still uh we just accepted that's the way it was and it was scary. </sentence><sentence id="316">Uh my father came to visit us in October;

it turned out there were lots of times when my parents were very close to being discovered - and the reason we survived is because the Dutch that, who encountered us didn't betray us. </sentence><sentence id="537">It was just the unbelievable luck that all the Dutch who discovered our Jewishness were good were good people. </sentence><sentence id="538">And that included the Dutch police. </sentence><sentence id="539">And you know again most Jews were not that fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="540">But the most dangerous time for us came in 1943 when uh my sister stayed with some teachers at that school and one of them was caught with some communist books, and when she was asked who else lived in that house, uh she said well, two little girls. </sentence><sentence id="541">And they said immediately now that those are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="542">I mean they they assumed that any children who who weren't, who didn't live with their parents were Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="543">So that was the first time that we were going to go and visit our parents so we, the first time that I must have visited them was in the summer of "40..."43. </sentence><sentence id="544">Uh and the Germans uh we were told were going to accompany us on the train and they were going to interrogate us on the train and that would have been the end of us because there is no way that we were sophisticated enough to to make up enough of a story uh particularly my younger sisters wouldn't have. </sentence><sentence id="545">They, who are one and two years younger than I am, but German thoroughness of course demanded that they could look at these Jewish children and it so happened that my younger sister and I were standing in front of the house. </sentence><sentence id="546">Now uh I was quite, much lighter and I have blue eyes and you know, I don't, I'm not typically Jewish - I don't have a semit...I don't have Semitic features and my sister, my younger sister has blonde curly hair, blue eyed. </sentence><sentence id="547">I mean, and they looked at us and said, . </sentence><sentence id="548">You know, "They can't be Jews." </sentence><sentence id="549">So...because we didn't look  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 quote "typically" whatever typically Jewish is. </sentence><sentence id="550">Of course we didn't look typically Jewish - uh that's how come we survived. </sentence><sentence id="551">And again we didn't fit the German stereotype of you know typical Jews. </sentence><sentence id="552">So again we were miraculously saved. </sentence><sentence id="553">Uh I mean we miraculously not not trapped. </sentence><sentence id="554">Uh my parents had, I gather, they told me they had razor blades ready. </sentence><sentence id="555">They were not going to be caught alive. </sentence><sentence id="556">They were not. </sentence><sentence id="557">They knew what was going to happen to them and they weren't uh...and they also, they would have killed themselves because they also knew if they were caught they would betray us and so again you know there were all all these very conscious decisions were made as to trying to have as many of us survive as possible. </sentence><sentence id="558">And we were able to visit them in in the summer. </sentence><sentence id="559">I spent I think a week with them and then we visited them again in the following Christmas and there we had an accident happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="560">We were standing at a, they were they were sledding down a slope, a snowy slope, and mother and my sister and I were standing too close and a sled ran over us. </sentence><sentence id="561">My mother had high boots on but I didn't and I got a deep wound which became severely infected and I got boils all over my body. </sentence><sentence id="562">And that was on two of my legs and which which didn't heal for months until until the following spring. </sentence><sentence id="563">Again lucky that I was strong enough, we survived - you know, there wasn't any penicillin and uh so on. </sentence><sentence id="564">But basically in 19...for two years we lived as school children and we lived without our parents and we lived with fear and I can remember saying to one of the other girls, the daughter of the family, I said I have a very big secret but I can't tell you until the war is over. ( </sentence><sentence id="565">Laughter) I, it was like, you know, I was like I knew the war one day would be over, so I must have a lot of hope uh and a lot a lot of optimism. </sentence><sentence id="566">I guess I must have felt that we would live. </sentence><sentence id="567">Uh and at the same time I remember my major mission was not to do anything that would betray us. </sentence><sentence id="568">And my middle, my younger sisters would sometimes really do dumb things like well, dumb things, what do you expect of a - I was six, so they were four and five. </sentence><sentence id="569">I remember Ingrid at one point, we were walking and she said oh she said oh Leesha - I was Leesha - Leesha, you know I met a I met a girl whose name was Ingrid and I told her that used to be my name. </sentence><sentence id="570">And I said don't ever say that (laughter) - I remember having to remind her that she was not to not to ever ever uh uh you know remind anyone or tell anybody that that Lanie wasn't her real name. </sentence><sentence id="571">But what's remarkable is that we played we the game right on until the very end. </sentence><sentence id="572">Uh and again turned out that the only people knew we were Jewish was the family itself. </sentence><sentence id="573">Their children didn't know we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="574">And, but we made friends and we saw our parents every once in a while and uh again unbelievable fortune fell our way because uh at in 1944 my, when after the Normandy landing uh things became very tight and that's when the Germans became more vicious towards the Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="575">We had gone with the family to a farm in and there was a lot of bombing, a lot of strafing, and the family told my parents they  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 throughout the war continued to help us make up stories supporting my parents! </sentence><sentence id="576">stories and so on so that if we had had one NSB--which was the Nazi...which was the Nazi support group in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="577">If we had had one real Nazi supporter, we would never have made it. </sentence><sentence id="578">But uh somehow, again, we...we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="579">But in 1944, my mother came to get us. </sentence><sentence id="580">She got my brother and me; and my two younger sisters already were with her. </sentence><sentence id="581">And incredibly, in September of 1944, we were liberated by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="582">Uh they came up, they had landed in Normandy, and they came up through Belgium and just through a tiny part of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="583">And they were supposed to meet up with the British at Arnhem. </sentence><sentence id="584">They made a movie, "The bridge...", "A Bridge Too Far." </sentence><sentence id="585">And, of course, there was a German panzer division at Armbhem; and the British were defeated there." </sentence><sentence id="586">So instead of liberating the rest of Holland, they went into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="587">Had we stayed in the middle of Holland we would not have been liberated until May of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="588">But we were liberated uh uh - as I said we we went back to Limburg in August. </sentence><sentence id="589">And in September, I'll never forget that in September of 1944, lots of bombing, lots of explosions. </sentence><sentence id="590">Was a Sunday and my mother came - we were sleeping on the attic, and we slept, we stayed in a house but my parents had rented the front room and a couple of bedrooms of a very nasty, ugly woman uh who turned out... She said, "If I had known you were Jews, you would never have lived." </sentence><sentence id="591">horrible woman. </sentence><sentence id="592">Her name was Bilders (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="593">Anyway, we, my, there was so much bombing that my parents, my mother came to get us and we were standing in the in the front living room, and my mother was combing my hair, and there was a table here - my mother was standing here and I was standing right there - and there was the window. </sentence><sentence id="594">And a grenade exploded. </sentence><sentence id="595">And a big piece of the grenade flew right between my mother and me and scorched her nose. </sentence><sentence id="596">And it bounced against the wall, and it bounced back on the table and a pair of pajamas and the pajamas burst burst into flames, but again you know death was so close. </sentence><sentence id="597">Uh it's it's just miraculous - a few inches either direction would have killed either my mother or me. </sentence><sentence id="598">Uh so we got out of the living room and we spent the day in the cellar, and we heard all the shooting. </sentence><sentence id="599">My mother again was very brave. </sentence><sentence id="600">She would go upstairs and I'm I'll never forget at four o'clock, it was about four o'clock and she would go upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="601">At four o'clock she screamed - she said the Americans are here. </sentence><sentence id="602">And I, if there's anything that stands out in my memory it's it's those words - the Americans, the Americans were here. </sentence><sentence id="603">And the Americans coming up on the hill - uh we lived sort of on a hill, and the Amer...the Germans were retreating up the hill, and they were shooting down at the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="604">Of course we were dying to go upstairs, and uh see what was happening, uh and we were allowed to, after a while we were allowed to go up, and I cannot tell you what that meant. </sentence><sentence id="605">I, it's a memory that you know will never cease in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="606">As, I think America has always had such a close place in my heart because it meant it meant life for us, and in all sorts of ways, and that was before we had any idea we would ever come here. </sentence><sentence id="607">Uh but there were the American soldiers and they were being shot at by the Germans but it didn't seem to bother them very much. </sentence><sentence id="608">They were ducking the bullets. </sentence><sentence id="609">And then after a few days when we were allowed to go - perhaps two days I think - we were not allowed to go out because there was so much shooting going on, but after a few days we were allowed to go out - one of the best sights I remember seeing was Germans with their  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 arms, you know, over their head and the feeling that they no longer present the threat to us and that we no longer were in danger was just a relief and an over-whelming sense that, you know, it's hard to describe. </sentence><sentence id="610">I mean talking about freedom and I was then eight years old and I'll never forget that immense relief. </sentence><sentence id="611">What was amazing was that uh in December of course we had the Battle of the Bulge, and at that point everybody knew we were Jewish - some, everybody knew - that little town that we lived in was uh , a little town near  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 we did. </sentence><sentence id="612">But uh right smack after the war you see, I mean not even after the war because the rest of Holland wasn't liberated, some very bad things started to happen. </sentence><sentence id="613">Uh the part of Holland that we lived in was all Catholic - one hundred percent Catholic - and so as soon as it became known that we were Jewish, we got things like Christ killers, dirty Jews, uh - Holland which really had not known anti-Semitism before the war, the horror of of World War II is that it awakened in Holland I think an awful lot of anti-Semitism, a tremendous amount. </sentence><sentence id="614">And we started encountering that - I mean in retrospect it just blows me away to think that uh there was no debriefing. </sentence><sentence id="615">Nobody ever ever talked to us about what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="616">There was no counseling. </sentence><sentence id="617">There was no support. </sentence><sentence id="618">It was as if we now were, we had to enter a new but it was a foreign society -
