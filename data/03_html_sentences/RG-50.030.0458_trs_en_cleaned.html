<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Good morning, Joan, and thank you for coming and doing this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Thank you, thank you for having us here -- thank you for having me, I'm not an us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Can you first just tell us when and where you were born? </sentence><sentence id="12">Let's stop -- we -- I just heard the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="14">Q: Right, Ginetta, te -- can you give us your official date of birth, and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="16">Yes, I was born in -- near Milan, in a little place called San Columbano Olumbro, little f-fatsioni of Milan, now it's a little village, on June first, 1923. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="18">Q: And can you tell us something about the life that you led before you got into the Resistance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="20">Yo -- I know that it was a rather complicated and interesting time for you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: It was complicated, and at some level, it was also a good life. </sentence><sentence id="22">And one of our circle of frien -- the circle of friend, the most important thing was the circle of friends we had, all anti-Fascist, and all active in assisting people who had been persecuted by the Fascist party. </sentence><sentence id="23">Yes, Jewish, but the Fascist party was also persecuting people who were anti-Fascist. </sentence><sentence id="24">It just happened that many of the anti-Fascist were also intellectual, and intellectual are more likely to be critical. </sentence><sentence id="25">Until 1938, it wasn't too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="26">Then, when the Nazi law were adopted by Mussolini, in Italy, there was a great deal of criticism about Mussolini doing that. </sentence><sentence id="27">And yet, the discussion I vaguely remember, in our circle of friends, particularly when we went to the mountains, climbed everythi -- if it was a day, that it was not very clear, they talked, they talked, they talked about political issues, social issues, anti-Fascist persecution. </sentence><sentence id="28">The general atmosphere was that even some intellectual had signed some paper approving of Mussolini adopting the Nazi racial law, and that was 1938, so I was pretty young, and to be very honest with you, there were times when I were -- yes, I was interested, but I wanted to climb, I wanted to hike, I wanted to sing, I wanted to have a good time. </sentence><sentence id="29">I was touched by it. </sentence><sentence id="30">At the same time, I also wanted to have a good time, going to look for ackenberry, for example, in August, and have ackenberry pies, and for -- in the refuge, and -- or rather, I have never forgotten that the criticism of the Nazi law was not only done by educated people, but there were also a farmer who taught i-il pladoni, Mussolini didn't have much hair, so they called him il pladoni, he is crazy. </sentence><sentence id="31">He is doing -- you know, why is he doing this, why is he going after the Jews, wh-why is he doing that? </sentence><sentence id="32">And then, in the discussions, and as I said, I heard not only within my family, but also in my -- the circle of friends, who were personal friends, all interested in mountain climbing, all interested in going to refugi for hikes. </sentence><sentence id="33">Near the lake of Como, there were mountains called Laigreenai, and there were refuges where we went, and we had to carry our food in the back. </sentence><sentence id="34">Ex -- there were some supplies left there, brought by donkey, like polenta, rice, potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="35">But -- and the farmer would have milk, a -- etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="36">And then we would hike, and then the discussions. </sentence><sentence id="37">Yes, there was discussion of movies, there was discussion of theater, there was discussion of opera. </sentence><sentence id="38">There were discussion of work in the factories. </sentence><sentence id="39">There -- but also, there were always political discussions, and invariably, we found -- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to work. </sentence><sentence id="40">Tha -- they were very few who would disagree, and -- and there were big discussions. </sentence><sentence id="41">"Hey, you stupido, cretino, that you believe in these idiotesa, that is -- we don't like the German." </sentence><sentence id="42">Well, I didn't like when they said, "I don't like the German," generally. </sentence><sentence id="43">I made -- and my parents taught me, and my friend taught me, then -- there has to be a distinction between the pro-Nazi and the German. </sentence><sentence id="44">And, there was a discussions, very early, about the fact that some German people, yes, they were Communist, and Socialist, but they were also member of the upper class. </sentence><sentence id="45">And some bishops, who, when Hitler began the persecution of the Jewish -- the anti- Fascist -- anti -- there were Communists, Socialists, and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="46">And it just happened that many intellectual were also Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="47">At that time -- I was very young, but I remember the heated discussions about Hitler, as announced in the press, that he has opened a concentration camp, to put those people in. </sentence><sentence id="48">It was very difficult for young people to understand what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="49">The -- some of the friends that I had, who were older, mature, and who -- and my parents, they were aware of the Fascist party having a special tribunal, i-i -- where the Fascist didn't have courts of law for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in Italy, was anti-Fascist, but you understand, then, they were against both. </sentence><sentence id="50">And instead of a court of law, with judges, which of course many of the f -- the Fascist had nominated those people, but nevertheless, the special tribunal could condemned anyone, that when that person -- and there were women, too, became quote, suspect, the special tribunal had the special Italian Secret Police, called Ovra, O-v-r-a, to investigate the suspect. </sentence><sentence id="51">And I remember one particular day, when they were discussing this, we couldn't go up climbing, we couldn't go hiking, it was raining, and -- and they were discussing all this -- I mean, it sounds s-strange thing, that this suspect could be man or the woman, and then the Ovra could pull in, for interrogation, the baker, the priest, the butcher, friends, associates of the work, whether they were engineer, or doctor, or [indecipherable] and, I remember that they were talking about some people were killed, executed. </sentence><sentence id="52">Some people were sent to what was known -- oh, some people to San Vittory prison, something, somebody sent to remote area in Italy, where these people who were intellectual, writer, artist, doctor or lawyer, could not see the family, except maybe once a year, twice a year, I can't remember correctly. </sentence><sentence id="53">But they were deprived of the mail, very rarely they could have the mail. </sentence><sentence id="54">They could only receive visits from the family very rarely. </sentence><sentence id="55">In other word, they were denied everything, and whether they were imprisoned in San Vittory, or sent to these remote area, there was the attempt to isolate them from society, deprive them of their professional life, their French -- their family, their friends. </sentence><sentence id="56">And the special tribunal had the power to do that, in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="57">But the German, apparently, were doing the same, and again I didn't understand very clearly, except in Dachau was a place, after 1933, where priest, Socialists, Communists, intellectual, could be sent, and the judicial system -- and they talk about the judicial system being damaged. </sentence><sentence id="58">The SS, and the Gestapo took over the function. </sentence><sentence id="59">That meant that it became very arbitrary, also. </sentence><sentence id="60">And I also remember that both in Italy, and I mention, in Germany, if some big Fascist liked a woman, sometime they had the man investigated, so -- you know, in other word, an arbitrary, unjust, terribly painful process for the fellow. </sentence><sentence id="61">Now, that picture of the special tribunal, those memory of San Vittory, the exiled, it remained with me forever, for as long as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="62">But at the same time, we -- there was a great deal of joy. </sentence><sentence id="63">There was country, the -- the hikes in the mountains, seldom we went to the sea. </sentence><sentence id="64">Occasionally we went to a place called Paylee, and I learned how to watch the farm -- the fisherman to bring in the fresh fish, and -- and have a meal with them, they made the mayonnaise with the garlic, and the parsley, and I wasn't cooking at that time, but I watched them there, enjoyed the French eating, but mountains were the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="65">Short weekend was [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="66">And, in addition to climbing, and we met -- we knew the Pastore, who had this wonderful bitar and then the cow, and they made the fresh cheese, and there was be -- song, in spite of the difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="67">Now, the people -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: It was what? </sentence><sentence id="119">I didn't -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Difficulties, in spite of the difficulties -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: There was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: -- there was joy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Joy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: And the mountain club, the Italian mountain club, was a social equalizer. </sentence><sentence id="128">There were intellectual, very wealthy people. </sentence><sentence id="129">Papa Bolla was the president of the Italian mountain club, the whole family, Leala, Rico. </sentence><sentence id="130">He was a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="131">The Sturani -- nobility, Count and Countess Sturani, and then the worker from the factories. </sentence><sentence id="132">There were engineer, there were geometry impligati clerks. </sentence><sentence id="133">And, of course, we met th-the wifes, and the children participate. </sentence><sentence id="134">In fact, in one particular refuge Pialeral, we built it. </sentence><sentence id="135">And we had to maintain it, and you had to walk, after you arrived with funicular above Como, you had to walk for four hours carrying your knapsack, and as I said, in summer they had donkey that they brought durable goods. </sentence><sentence id="136">But otherwise, y -- and then you just roam around, and in winter it was skiing, but not the skiing of today, where you go up and down, up and down, can't stand that. </sentence><sentence id="137">Th -- the skiing was for sightseeing, for enjoy -- now, non-vacation was different. </sentence><sentence id="138">Then, we went to -- went to Nash, we went to Cherbania, and there was one funicular at that time, and we went up to anolder tel colostum becko, and that again was a reunion place. </sentence><sentence id="139">Summer was hiking all over, climbing. </sentence><sentence id="140">And I began climbing with my parents and guides. </sentence><sentence id="141">They were very strict about guides. </sentence><sentence id="142">You don't go up in the mountains unprepared, because the mountains, like the sea is very harsh, can be very difficult, so you have to be prepared. </sentence><sentence id="143">And then we refuge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: What does that -- what does that mean, refuge? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Refuge -- refuge? </sentence><sentence id="164">Well, huts where you bring your supply. </sentence><sentence id="165">You melt the snow with Sterno, to make [inaudible], and you bring dry fruits, and a pinyotta. </sentence><sentence id="166">Pinyotta are dry cracker, but very hard on your teeth, you better have good teeth, or else you are in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="167">And, of course, the first day or so, you have fresh fruit also, but -- and, for the first day or two, you have slice of rosto polarose, but then you drive everything, and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="168">It was fun, it was climbing, it was hiki -- i-1 -- picotsa, if there was a snow, you use the ice pick, as -- la picotsa, I think. </sentence><sentence id="169">You had the scarponi, and so you go to refuge -- let's take an example, from Shamoni, this was not -- this was Shamoni, you go to -- by train to Ajohntierre. </sentence><sentence id="170">Ajohntierre you start hiking, I remember cutting it, sta -- to your refuge, le refuge de Ajohntierre, and you spend the night there, and the -- often the refuge can offer polenta, or zupa -- soup, or polenta, occasionally risotto, but really polenta is more [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="171">Also, they made, f-fontina [indecipherable], fontina toma. </sentence><sentence id="172">So polenta was fontina toma, all fresh, goat cheese, or fresh whatever there was. </sentence><sentence id="173">And you spent the night. </sentence><sentence id="174">And it's wonderful because there is a camaraderie, | think is the word. </sentence><sentence id="175">Easy. </sentence><sentence id="176">Young people talk, talk about theaters and movie, talk about the love, talk about this, talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="177">The serious people talk about -- yes, some politics, or is -- Italian are very yeah, yeah, yeah, talk politics great deal. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="178">But, also talk about traveling, talk about culture, talking about booksa, talking about history, talking about the meaning of some opera, for example. </sentence><sentence id="179">And I remember in -- in Ajohntierre, we're talking about a performance in Paris of Don Carlos, and how Verdi had a -- really used opera to express the essence of repression, a religious repression. </sentence><sentence id="180">The burning, the -- and then there were discussion over -- on religion, for example, because at that time, Voltaire was a prohibited author by the church. </sentence><sentence id="181">So needless to say, we talk about Voltaire, and -- and also, the press was controlled. </sentence><sentence id="182">I must confess that at that time, I was far more interested in boys and girls, I was far more interested in the mountains, far more interested in having fun, and I had a good </sentence></p><p><sentence id="183"> friend at that time, that I knew when I was seven, and he was 11, and he -- I heard all this, and I paid some attentions, but I must confess that my attention at that time, when I was so young, was in the mountains, in the fu -- wildflower. </sentence><sentence id="184">I was crazy about wildflower, I -- I -- we went, as family and friends, to do le narche zarta, which meant we went to the refuge, and then we picked, very carefully, a bouquet of -- it's daffodil-like, but white with a little red, little eye, and very perfume, not cheesy. </sentence><sentence id="185">And you are taught conservation from day one. </sentence><sentence id="186">And again, in the mountains you talk about planning. </sentence><sentence id="187">Let's go for a narche zarta in Como next spring. </sentence><sentence id="188">We take the picnic, we go. </sentence><sentence id="189">Some people work for Las meerbiscoza for factories. </sentence><sentence id="190">What we discovered -- and while we were talking about fun in mountain, there was a great deal of politics all the time. </sentence><sentence id="191">Now, the best, active people, at the political level, were Socialist, and Communist. </sentence><sentence id="192">Anti-Fascist, many of them. </sentence><sentence id="193">And being Communist, but after having been in the prison of Mussolini with the Communists, they changed. </sentence><sentence id="194">They followed the lead of two people, that I didn't know, and I be -- who started a movement called jostitsia en liberta, the Rosselli brother. </sentence><sentence id="195">And they were talking about the Rosselli brother as having taught them how common -- hard line Communism of the Stalinist-Leninist type was as dangerous as Nazi Fascist, and therefore they wanted, yes, Socialism, yes, a just society, due process of law. </sentence><sentence id="196">That was taught by lawyer, like Enrico Enpigi all the time, Contamessa -- Rainso Contamessa. </sentence><sentence id="197">Due process of law, fair trial, and then -- and no military judges, like the special tribunal. </sentence><sentence id="198">So there was this combination of hat -- la -- Ajohntierre was one. </sentence><sentence id="199">And then we went home sometime for two weeks, from refuge to refuge, refuge to refuge, and guides, always guides. </sentence><sentence id="200">But you have the leisure of enjoying something very much, with a diversified company, from student, and young children, to factory worker, engineer, lawyer, professor, doctors, a-academic, some very serious were very angry about the academician who had signed the Nazi manifesto for 1938 duration of Mussolini. </sentence><sentence id="201">And all in good </sentence></p><p><sentence id="202"> humor, even those who were accused of being -- you are a damn fa -- you are an Fascist stonase, c'est une cretino, c'est qui -- the next day we climbed together, we ate together, we -- you know, it was not vindictive, it was not nasty -- yes, there were bursts of recrimination, but it didn't become so sickening that hate, a -- hate -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Wh-Why do you think that was so? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: I don't know, to these days. </sentence><sentence id="205">Perhaps that question should be given to psychiatrists, or other. </sentence><sentence id="206">I believe then the Italian culture, with so many occupation, for centuries, by so many countries -- you know, remember in Sicily, the Swedes were there. </sentence><sentence id="207">In fact, there was a beautiful poem called, "Curradino dis vetsia." </sentence><sentence id="208">And I have never forgotten a small part of that poem. </sentence><sentence id="209">The poem referred to a mother, in switzer -- in -- in swede -- in sw -- in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="210">You see, in springtime, a swallow return, and the mother ask the swallow what coming -- was coming from ita -- from the south, "Dimi iveesto il filio meo," Tell me, have you seen my son, who was sent to fight in Sicily? </sentence><sentence id="211">And the swallow answered, "Si, no veesto, erabuendo, erabianco, sotolarko diontempio era saipporto." </sentence><sentence id="212">Yes, I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="213">He was blonde, he was white, under the arch of a temple he was buried. </sentence><sentence id="214">And I remember the discussions around that poem, and I've always remembered that poem because it emphasized the commonality of human being, but here it was from Sweden invading Sicily, and then of course, we had the Berber invading, and the French, and the Austrian invasions. </sentence><sentence id="215">And each invader brought destructions, pain, suffering, but also the need for some people to get together and help each other. </sentence><sentence id="216">And I have a feeling that that common bondage of seeing so much suffering, and [indecipherable] destruction the pope's rector, in Italy one must -- I mean, there were powers, and corrupt, and -- so ou -- in one sense you were devout Catholic, went to church, you practice. </sentence><sentence id="217">You had also many skeptics, and the selling of the images, and all those things, were discussed, I mean, they talked about everything. </sentence><sentence id="218">The mountains was a teaching place, because of the situation that here you are up in a refuge, and you're having your time, but I don't [indecipherable] leisure to talk and think. </sentence><sentence id="219">Not that I understood very well everything, far from it. </sentence><sentence id="220">But it's amazing how later things seems to connect. </sentence><sentence id="221">And I remember when they were talking about the special tribunal, the prisoner in San Vittory, the persecution of the family. </sentence><sentence id="222">The injustice of having a judicial system with three military judges who had the power to bring in everybody to 1 -- to interrogate, intimidate, frighten friends, family, butcher, maid, you name it. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I thought, how can they do that? </sentence><sentence id="224">And yet, there was the other side of helper all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Helper? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Helpers, all the time in San Vittory, which was a prison for criminal, and for political prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="250">And the political prisoner, I think Grandshe may have also been there, they had a great deal of help from the suaray. </sentence><sentence id="251">First of all, the sister were there, the doctors. </sentence><sentence id="252">And the suaray play, a -- were nurses at the time. </sentence><sentence id="253">And inside -- and these were people hired by the Fascist party, but we always found people -- the bakers, God bless the bakers -- we always found people who could help. </sentence><sentence id="254">I have the feeling, listening from the discussion, from my parents, from Enrico [indecipherable], all those people, that in Italy, it was easier to help than it was possible to do in aust -- in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="255">In -- i-in Nazi Germany, they in fact, destroyed all of the antique -- Nazi -- much more easily than they could in Italy, and I think it may have to do something -- but again, I'm not a historian, I'm a re -- an ordinary woman. </sentence><sentence id="256">My feeling, listening to the other, was that the German were cultured, music, but also disciplinarian. </sentence><sentence id="257">And they treated children with il maganello, with a stick, as they grew up. </sentence><sentence id="258">And therefore, that could have had an influence in the rigidity of behavior of that particular -- of -- of the German, that although there was resistance by some in the church, by intellectual, like Bunoffer, but, in the resistance had networks, mostly of    Communists, and Socialists. </sentence><sentence id="259">They were wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="260">They didn't have the support than their counterpart in Italy had from the general population. </sentence><sentence id="261">And we split, within the church. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Could -- could you just give -- give me a sense of your education beyond the more -- somewhat more formal education, because I think it's very interesting that you had such a wide and cultured education at a very young age, and it seems to me it must have influenced you as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Well, first I had to work very hard, and studying. </sentence><sentence id="279">It's okay to have fun, but you study. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I had a -- oh, for two years, when we lived in this place, which was called Santangelo de Jarno, I had -- and I lived with a family -- my family, but als -- came very often, but I also had this wonderful family who was Istytotwiss. </sentence><sentence id="281">And yes, I went to school in the elementary year, and I had marvelous teacher. </sentence><sentence id="282">Her name was Bentivania Lucia, and then she married a man whose name was Negrini. </sentence><sentence id="283">And I think they were anti-Fascist, but in school, the subject, history, writing, reading, she was very good, and just marvelous. </sentence><sentence id="284">She would inspire her student to do the best. </sentence><sentence id="285">Still, when we had to do the essay, we had to praise Mussolini, and -- and she did that with a wooden face. </sentence><sentence id="286">So we had to write our essay, how wonderful Mussolini was, and then in, I believe was "35, but you should check, when he went to Ethiopia, there was a horror in my -- all our circle about Mussolini invading Abyssinia, was called at that time, dropping poison. </sentence><sentence id="287">And the Duca da Oustar, a family wi -- a -- being there too, I mean, there was a tremendous dispute. </sentence><sentence id="288">Mussolini, of course, wanted an empair -- em-em-em-empire. </sentence><sentence id="289">The king went along with it, that idiot -- excuse the expression. </sentence><sentence id="290">If I understood correctly, the queen -- the wife was absolutely opposed to Mussolini, to his enterprise. </sentence><sentence id="291">She was born in Montenegro, Elena, and was a -- from what I've heard -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Tape one, side B. I'm sorry Ginetta. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: That's okay. </sentence><sentence id="310">Now, in [indecipherable] circle of friends, the rutsini -- the rutsini [indecipherable] rutsini were the parents of Mary Mullisanno. </sentence><sentence id="311">Mary Mullisanno was married to Enrico Mullisanno. </sentence><sentence id="312">Enrico Mullisanno's brother was Pigi Mullisanno, who was married to a wonderful woman called Marcella. </sentence><sentence id="313">Now, the rutsini were from monarchy, the Mullisanno were anti-Fascist, anti-king, is an idiot. </sentence><sentence id="314">But also they were praising his wife for her intelligence, for training her children to be useful in society, and not just idiots. </sentence><sentence id="315">In other word, they felt very strongly that -- the Mullisanno -- that the king was not worth anything. </sentence><sentence id="316">I mean, yeah -- yeah, he was -- he went along with Mussolini, and critical, went along with signing the law, went along going to Abyssinia, went along with everything, and eventually went along with Mussolini becoming allies of the German, and al -- went along when Mussolini invaded France in 1940, and throughout that, while the rutsini always defended the king, and bi -- praising the queen, of course, and the children, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="317">The Mullisanno said, the king goes along with Mussolini, so he's equally responsible, and -- and ya -- that -- that kind of --_ so, it was a fairment of ideas. </sentence><sentence id="318">The essay we did in school had to reflect acceptance of Mussolini party line. </sentence><sentence id="319">And it was obvious that the teacher was very skeptical, but she had to do it.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: Can you describe that -- that change in some way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: Well, the first thing was that you have to be very careful never to say anything, and it's kind of hiding, without hiding. </sentence><sentence id="384">And you know, you have to be careful only with your friend, don't say anything to anybody else, don't discuss politics, don't discuss the racial law, don't discuss anything about the fact that the Jewish people now are discriminated against, they cannot go to the library, they cannot go to -- t-to -- in certain profession they are removed from the profession. </sentence><sentence id="385">People could not practice medicine or law, and -- and the Jewish children could not go to the library, or to the regular school. </sentence><sentence id="386">Can you imagine if you are going to a regular school in this country, and you are told sometime very nicely, sometime by people who felt pain in saying that, and sometime not so nicely, but you cannot come back? </sentence><sentence id="387">And then children taunt -- tau -- te -- you know, mock other children, who are Jewish, but not as many as I learned was happening in France, or other country, and that I learned it from other people. </sentence><sentence id="388">Because in Italy, there was this mockery, but not mean, mean, mean, except by the Fascist, and there were not so bi -- so many which are vehement about the issue. </sentence><sentence id="389">So Italy had a -- had had an integration of the Jewish people with Italian, lots of intermarriage. </sentence><sentence id="390">Nobody thought about that until Mussolini did that in 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: But Mussolini was in power in 1922. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: 22. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: So "38 changed something quite radically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: Oh, absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: And was that the racial laws that made the change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="409">A: The racial law, yes, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="410">I think when Mussolini adopted the racial law, it was a turmoil within the society, and also the special tribunal, the political pers-persecution. </sentence><sentence id="411">In the jail, in San Vittory, and in the confini -- confini are those people -- those places where people were sent, and I remember my parents, my friends saying, imagine if you're a doctor, a lawyer, a philosopher, a sociolo -- an intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="412">Also well as a worker who is organizing for the Communist party, or the Socialist party. </sentence><sentence id="413">They didn't persecute the [indecipherable] party, not very much. </sentence><sentence id="414">But those people are deprived of all contact, family, friends, reading. </sentence><sentence id="415">I mean, those people read newspaper, republication, often they w -- spoke other language, like English, and French, and others. </sentence><sentence id="416">Imagine being deprived of everything? </sentence><sentence id="417">And be isolated, and you haven't done anything wrong, you're innocent. </sentence><sentence id="418">And then when the special tribunal even sentenced people to death. </sentence><sentence id="419">And there were women, also, who had been condemned to that. </sentence><sentence id="420">Now, some women, I understood -- and again, one should do research on that -- I understood that some women were sent south, a-and they -- sometime they were hired by well-to-do family, as maid. </sentence><sentence id="421">But they were separated from their family, their children, their husband, who say, if you didn't -- if you stayed at home and you took care of me and the children, you did not have to worry about that. </sentence><sentence id="422">And some were kind. </sentence><sentence id="423">There are some cases where I heard that the woman who gave them the job, was very sympathetic, very supportive, very helpful, particularly when during the visit, the ha -- she saw the husband treating the wife, because -- if you stayed at home, you wouldn't have had this, and you have th -- you caused me so much grief. </sentence><sentence id="424">I have to cook, you caused your children so much pain, and blah, blah, blah, and she became very supportive of this exiled woman. </sentence><sentence id="425">Now, I don't know about the [indecipherable] cases, you know, one should look into -- into that, but it struck me once again human being are capable of great love, human being are capable of great caring, concern, and there are some who're not. </sentence><sentence id="426">And my feeling at the time, when I learned from my parents, from my friends, from the people I was surrounded with, was that it makes a difference if you're persecuted, and there are people who cares about you. </sentence><sentence id="427">And that began with a basket of roasted chicken, and thing that -- fruits -- and other -- than my parents, and other, brought to San Vittory at the prison, and -- and also to people who are very poor, because there was a great deal of poverty at that time, and Mussolini was encouraging women to have a lot of children -- a lot of children to provide sons to go to war, essentially, cause he was always in t -- trying that, and -- and things were bad, but then, when Mussolini met Hitler someplace, I think it was the Brenner Pass, and must have been close to the beginning of the war, maybe a couple of years earlier, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="428">Again, the propaganda was all in the hand of the Fascist [indecipherable] and the radio, there was no television. </sentence><sentence id="429">Osana about the alliance between Mussolini, and -- and at that time, the open hostility and contempt for the Jews, the propaganda began, to the point when Jewish people began really to es -- try to escape, to get abroad, to -- but what struck me was, when we went [indecipherable] within smuggles, and friends, and the biter, the Pastore, you know, the enormous compassion, and the enormous anger at wik Fascistoni -- there was -- were Fascistoni means big Fascist. </sentence><sentence id="430">Because before, many people had accepted -- they were against the alliance with Germany from day one, because of the memory of World War One, because when German and Austrian soldier were captured as prisoner, farmer family treated them well. </sentence><sentence id="431">Apparently, when the Italian prisoner of the German came back, they had horrible story to tell. </sentence><sentence id="432">I was too young, but I have heard from -- from -- one we thing that happened at that time, that has remained with me very vividly, about wars, the occupation, that I mention so many French, Austrian, Berber, Swedish, that si -- that the memory of the occupation by the Austrian was very vivid when I was a child, because after all, Milan was occupied by them. </sentence><sentence id="433">The Aousta family, Piedmont -- regained Piedmont, the Aousta family, in 1849. </sentence><sentence id="434">Then, in 1859, is when finally    Lombardy was freed. </sentence><sentence id="435">You know, if -- andre dios is nothing in human history, but my parents took me to see a little chapel in Lombardy not very far from Milan, in the countryside, and there are many of such chapel throughout Lombardy and Piedmont. </sentence><sentence id="436">And these little chapel, plain, there is usually an image of some saint or something [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="437">Then there is a grate, and inside the grate, there are bones. </sentence><sentence id="438">And the bones are the bones then the farmer founds, either in Piedmont, or Lombardy, people who died in the war in 1848, in 1858 - deg59. </sentence><sentence id="439">And the farmer found so many, then they erected this little chapel as a memorial to the people who died, but that memorial is a reminder that war is a horrible thing, and -- and people sometime bring matsolini di furey. </sentence><sentence id="440">If you pick up some poppy, and bachelor button, and -- you know, and it's a ca -- and then there is a -- a charo, there is a -- a candle, you know, those -- and then they put, and -- and this is done spontaneously, nobody is in charge. </sentence><sentence id="441">But my parents reminded me then, this was a way to remember those horror, and hopefully it doesn't happen again, but they also talk about Hitler, and Mussolini, but they also talk about Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="442">They felt that Stalin, and Hitler, but like this, Mussolini was considered a buffoon, less ideological, although he did put nula osta to the deportation. </sentence><sentence id="443">And it was not until after the war, when I met Angela Dinati, then we talk about the role of Italian Army of occupation in Greece, in Yugoslavia, and [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="444">Now, already were -- throughout the world, there were letter coming from soldier Italian, in Albania, in Yugoslavia, and they crying the horror of the Nazi death camp, through letters, which, although there was censorship, nevertheless, it was brought out, and everybody talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="445">It was like one of those telegram -- verbal telegram tree, then everybody -- no. </sentence><sentence id="446">Admittedly, the retay may have been difficult. </sentence><sentence id="447">An interesting thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="448">Italy had censorship, but many Italian censor made a point of passing some of the material to the anti-Fascist groups, and probably also to the church, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="449">I only know the anti-Fascist leadership, Communist, or Socialist, parti [indecipherable], were recipient of those letters from Italian soldier who decried the horror of Italian being associated with the German in this horrib -- horrendous enterprise. </sentence><sentence id="450">It's against all the Italian history, culture, ence religious figure [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="451">And that's where the split in the religious community took place. </sentence><sentence id="452">And the ambiguity, and the lack of clarity, with the exception of some priests, who actually gave their lives. </sentence><sentence id="453">Norman Zofti, I think was his name. </sentence><sentence id="454">One priest in Milan, I know that he was shot in a -- in a place in Milan, that's a-another -- another period, but it was during the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="455">But again, there was this divisions, and of course there were many skeptics, although they were Catholic, and there were many Catholic who did everything to help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="456">But they couldn't give back the jobs, the jobs were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="457">You know, the professor of the university were removed, and doctor were -- yes, they practiced, but i-in official universe medical school, etcetera, it was the Catholic doctor who took over, and some of them were wonderful, and some of them found even way to send patients to this Jewish doctor, so then they could make some money. </sentence><sentence id="458">But above all, it was a time to begin looking for safe places. </sentence><sentence id="459">I'm going to take a break, because I have to go to the bathroom, but I also want to show you that little red book, because two years ago, three years ago, when I went back to the -- to Milan, and I went to the archive with the cardinal -- we [indecipherable] then I ask Julianna, would she please take me to see some of the conven -- the churches, and the farm in -- where we used to hide people, and also the confessional, where -- the place where we could exchange message with sympathetic priest. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1186">A: They were very stupid. </sentence><sentence id="1187">Well, in general, you know, they were -- they were very -- they were expert in the art of interrogation, at -- at one level, because, instead of being selective, every suspect was tortured. </sentence><sentence id="1188">They missed opportunity for getting information, because people died, or people simply decided no way, I'm going to die anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And one of the thing that must be said about the stupidity is, and for the first time, the SS and the Gestapo brought torture, not as an isolated incident, as the Ovra had used, or the police had used [indecipherable] any time, any place, anywhere, that is a systematic system of interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1190">And it -- torturing people to obtain information which could be useful, became routine, and that was stupid, because they really tortured many people who didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And then they were hanging people publicly, in the gallows, shooting them. </sentence><sentence id="1192">The other stupidity that they did, horrendous stupidity was -- not in Milan, but abatsaboto, they caught -- there were something like 50 -- appro -- 50 - 54 partisan, including a pregnant woman, and they made that group travel from village to village, and then they executed them all. </sentence><sentence id="1193">In Liguria, near Genoa spitsa, there is another place where they took something like 40 or 50 young men, and publicly th-they executed them all. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And now, when I'm using the word stupidity, is because far from frightening -- yes, people were frightened, people are terrorized, but also people said, what? </sentence><sentence id="1195">Even many Fascists said, I don't want to be associated with this. </sentence><sentence id="1196">This is not Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And true, with the Nazi, there were the Italian Fascist, SS, the libreen, rigatinari, the mouti, the dechamamas, who as volunteer, joined the SS unit, and they were the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1198"> one who knew Italian, they were the one who knew the addresses to take these people, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I use the word stupidity because it really increased our ranks. </sentence><sentence id="1200">People who had said, ""No, I can't help you, I'm too frightened, not for me, but for my family -- what can I do to help?" </sentence><sentence id="1201">And I suspect that in any underground movement, but I -- I only know Italy, when there is this kind of naked brutality, people will emerge, who will take far higher risk to help the victim than they had been willing to risk before. </sentence><sentence id="1202">And the reason I felt strongly about the underground press, although I'm not a journalist, but of course the Ritsini was a journalist family, pro-monarchy, I suspect possibly pro-Fascist in the early period, but certainly against this kind of brutality, and they were a great help in understanding that some conservative, from monarchy, etcetera, maybe proconserva -- they don't accept such brutality, and -- and had to -- had to the paper -- now, our workers -- thousand of people was to paste notices, and -- and oo -- at that time, we had to make -- to mix flour with water, and pinello, and go -- and that was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And then distribute the clandestine press every place we could, in the fabrica factory, office, buildings, school. </sentence><sentence id="1204">Now the university, the student had their own newspaper, but we have to remember then, most of the professor had been forced to flee, to hide, and so we, as a student hiding, had some time became captive audience to professor who cou-couldn't teach, and if we were hiding someplace for few days, let me tell you, we did have good professor. </sentence><sentence id="1205">I mean, discussions were marvelous, and unforgettable. </sentence><sentence id="1206">You may forget something that you do in the regular school, you don't forget something that you learn under the circumstances, debates, pro and con, and sometime deliberately, they chose one or the other to take the opposite point of view for arguing a case, for arguing a point, for arguing an essay, for arguing a book. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And between that, and assessing the press, evaluate it, analyzing it, and then come up with a synthesis that reflected the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1208"> truth in very short space. </sentence><sentence id="1209">I believe it helps to consolidate your thinking in a way that nothing else since has ever helped me to consolidate ideas, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1210">Q: Do you have a recollection of any particular debate, or -- during this time? </sentence><sentence id="1211">Was there any -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1212">A: Yeah, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="1213">The debate, at one point, centered around the role of people who had been part of the great concit of the Fascists, and then in July, turned against Mussolini, which caused, of course, the fall of Mussolini. </sentence><sentence id="1214">The role of the king, accepting to be emperor, accepting Fascism all those year, in spite of the terrible cost to Italy, to the Italian people, and what should be the post- war or -- of those people who had been Fascist, which of course, I believe that as soon as the Nazi came to power, tried to erase them, and executed some, like Galliazo Channo, and -- and other, or the king, for post war. </sentence><sentence id="1215">There were pro and con, and then debate about, so -- th-th-those were political discussion, and I have not been used to, and listen to people who had been professors and -- and student. </sentence><sentence id="1216">It was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1217">It was a learning lesson in politics, for when -- I made up my mind that I would have never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I would have to do something with protecting human right, and freedom of expression. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And then the other discussion was about the slogan of the Communist, from the Ural to the Atlantic. </sentence><sentence id="1219">Is that what we want for Europe?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1292">A: Well I realized that here were people that I loved, intelligent, dedicated, who truly believed that in the future, when the war was over, to obey the order of Stalin, for the good of the Italian, was essentialed to reveal our society in amoda, which would be different than Fascism. </sentence><sentence id="1293">I was unable to accept that. </sentence><sentence id="1294">The other was that there were some member of the Communist party began worrying about this kind of thing, and discussed this openly, and felt that the Roselli brother for just a salivita, and understood the danger that Marxist, Lenin, and Stalinism presented for society, we still wanted to change the socio-economic situation. </sentence><sentence id="1295">That was freedom, and not freedom of expression suppressed in order to achieve the other. </sentence><sentence id="1296">In fact, we felt at that time that Fascism was far more modern that Leninism -- Stalinist Leninism, and look what it has done. </sentence><sentence id="1297">We didn't know about many other things than Stalin had done, and we knew what the Nazi had done. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And analyzed, discussed, studied, compared, and all -- all the others were going to become part of political parties. </sentence><sentence id="1299">All of them became political leaders. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And it's okay, it's just that I felt there has to be voices outside of the political system, that you can say, I disagree with that. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And I remember -- I can't remember who said this, and then later on I heard it after the war many times. </sentence><sentence id="1302">I think it was Voltaire. </sentence><sentence id="1303">I disagree with you, but I'm ready to die for your right to disagree with me. </sentence><sentence id="1304">I'm not certain it was Voltaire, but that's what I thought at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1305">That's what we thought at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1306">I disagree with you, but I'm ready to die for your right to disagree. </sentence><sentence id="1307">And we felt that post-war Italy had to be respectful of ideas. </sentence><sentence id="1308">That there has to be a government which respect the right of citizen, and not imprison them, not torture them, not have mock trial, not have the special tribunal. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Special tribunal was the tribunal than [indecipherable] Mussolini -- Ovra installed during the Fascist period where there were three milary -- military judges, no legal defense, no -- entrapment was the -- the word for any suspect. </sentence><sentence id="1310">So, those are the idea that really consumed us, while we were all so activist in helping, in hiding, in pasting notices, or change slogan of the -- we knew then people were deported in railway tracks. </sentence><sentence id="1311">We were told that they were sent to Germany to work. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And somebody wrote [indecipherable] Tedeschi, W.

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1345">That you were -- that there was something about human life that you wanted to protect, whatever the political system was. </sentence><sentence id="1346">So you weren't interested in power, and accumulation of power. </sentence><sentence id="1347">I du -- I'm trying to figure out what it is that was pulling you away from pul -- politics, into another world. </sentence><sentence id="1348">I don't know whether -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1349">A: We have to say we, because I was not the only one. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1357">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1359">A: And then we also learned that sometime funds coming in from the allies, and distributed to the church, was distributed to every group, but we also learned that the Communists were also keeping money for the post-war re-organization of the Communist party. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And at the time when you have such horror going on, and you need every penny to help everybody, I felt, my God, I am no different than the Fascist. </sentence><sentence id="1361">They are already beginning to accumulate money for power, for their control after. </sentence><sentence id="1362">And the slogan, from the Ural to Atlantic really made us uneasy. </sentence><sentence id="1363">Not just me, but Enrico Mullisanno, Pigi Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa. </sentence><sentence id="1364">They were Communists who were queasy about it, but they still felt that they owed obedience. </sentence><sentence id="1365">So my response was -- and this was my response, obideerai -- craderai obideerai combaterai. </sentence><sentence id="1366">To believe -- to believe craderai. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Obideera, obey, combaterai, fight. </sentence><sentence id="1368">And I said, what is the difference when with the slogan of Stalin, and the slogan of Mussolini, and the slogan of the church, the Catholic church. </sentence><sentence id="1369">Craderai, obideerai, combaterai. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And I said, we want a force [indecipherable] of Italy, which hopefully will reflect the freedom that every person is entitled to. </sentence><sentence id="1371">The respect, the dignity. </sentence><sentence id="1372">If you want to be a Communist, you should be a Communist, but if I want to be something else -- I respect your right, but you have to respect mine. </sentence><sentence id="1373">You don't imprison me if you are in power because I happen to have different view, political or religious, because we remember also the Inquisition. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And Italian history is replete with it. </sentence><sentence id="1375">One discussion we had in the underground about torture was then the -- actually the Empress of Austria, not herself, but on the advice of counsel, Austria had abolished the use of torture to extract information, and I believe it was the end of the previous century, and yet, it was reinstated when the Nazi came, eliminating the judicial system, taking over the judicial system, and -- and using torture. </sentence><sentence id="1376">So, the discussion also centered about what the -- the Austrian had done at the -- the end of the previous century -- not that Maria Theresa was necessarily enthusiastic, but she accepted the advice of her counsel to eliminate tr -- torture, and then, as Hitler comes to power, the court lose juridical prerogative, due to the court, and the judicial system, for political reason. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And then they bring it to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And while cases of torture had always occurred, but this was systematic torture, and it was horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="1379">I mean, people -- the scream were heard in -- whether it was in Milan, in Biapaolocelli, in Torino, La Camradeebeeasti, Aroust, every place. </sentence><sentence id="1380">It became an epidemic. </sentence><sentence id="1381">But we thought about the possibility of that under a dictatorial regime. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And we felt a dictatorship can use this method, as the Nazi, the Fascists are doing, any place, any time. </sentence><sentence id="1383">So in a post-war Italy, what we want is guarantee, and that will never happen again. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And we're thinking about Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1420">A: No, I didn't see -- I couldn't see them. </sentence><sentence id="1421">So I -- the underground had a assistance program, and I was actually handling three apartments, in Viama Kerajoya, "41. </sentence><sentence id="1422">The concierge, Mrs. Columbo, was our friend. </sentence><sentence id="1423">Her brother-in-law was executed, was one of the partisan who, in the railway, who was helping to give us the correct bill of lading, instead of the bill of lading when the Germans said on the train coming in, whate -- instea -- they would put clothes in, but e -- as, in fact they were armament. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And that was very important to the allies, to know what kind of material the German were bringing in for the war

executed. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Now, there were three apartment derain prepared by the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1428">Don't ask me, except that my little apartment was quickly -- an arch -- furnitch -- an architect came and fixed the cupboard, and it was very well arranged. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Then there was a third floor apartment, that I was handling for a courier who came back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And then there was one on the fifth floor that I never saw, except that when somebody came, was a special password, it was the fifth floor. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And only later, after the war, we realized then that was probably the OSS people. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And they kept everything compartmen -- compartmentalized. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Then, in addition to these three apartment, we were in the -- another apartment in [indecipherable] few block further down, and a network of places where people could spend a night. </sentence><sentence id="1434">And it was all integrated with the work done by the Committee of National Liberation, and by the churches, by political party, by groups. </sentence><sentence id="1435">And each group was very independent of the other, so that -- for example, since I'm looking at Lydia, one little church in Drunago, the priest was wonderful, and he hid people in the belfry. </sentence><sentence id="1436">But, it was a network of people. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Of course, once in awhile we were caught, once in awhile it was broken, and we lost people. </sentence><sentence id="1438">There were deportation, and -- or a book this thick has name of Italian who were deported, and many of them didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="1439">And some were Jewish, and the other were Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And they came from all walk of life, and if you look at -- I -- I think I -- I may have given it to Stan for those -- but if you look at the ages, you can see, it was truly a popular movement, had all ages, classes, education, or lack of education. </sentence><sentence id="1441">Along the river Po, the -- the river, there are boats, and -- there are boats, and the network of people who knew the woods, in Pavia, in Bijaivino, in Mortara, Novara, it was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1442">But again, the churches were very important, and the confessional were very important. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And the people went to the confession, who had never gone to confession before. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And they were certainly not confessing sin. </sentence><sentence id="1445">It was a mean of communication, improvised very often, but what struck me was how people can sum up the courage to do things when they haven't thought about doing, or they would ever to, or -- or regret, and of course, many of them were deported. </sentence><sentence id="1446">I remember one woman, a -- a peasant who hid in her farm some people, and -- and when her husband was taken -- the reason I went to see her, with another member -- another student, was to bring some money, and to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1855">A: Well, one of the difficulty we had in the underground was that we always had to be careful about infiltrator into our group of assistance to the prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And we have to remember that we assisted family and prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1857">There were people who were working, helping the war effort, for the allies, for the Committee of National Liberation in Milan, and elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1858">Torino, Valdosta, val -- everyplace. </sentence><sentence id="1859">And one of the difficulty we had was when a person was taken, the interrogation in depth, which meant torture, led to picking up other people. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And I would never blame anyone for speaking under torture, because it's unbelievable the horror than they can perpetrate on human being. </sentence><sentence id="1861">One of the places in Milan where the prisoner were taken was San Vittory, and there was a special section which was controlled by the SS, and the moti. </sentence><sentence id="1862">The SS had control of the prisoner brought there. </sentence><sentence id="1863">Usually their major interest was in information, people who are work -- working to gather information useful to the allies in the war effort. </sentence><sentence id="1864">One of the key people in that accession of the SS, was named Hugo Osteria. </sentence><sentence id="1865">Hugo Osteria had been a policeman -- political policeman for the Ovra, the secret police of Mussolini, or the Fascists, throughout that period. </sentence><sentence id="1866">And when, after September eight, the -- he began working for the SS, and the Gestapo in San Vittory, in the section specialized in -- in interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Besides Hugo Osteria, there was a -- a man, whose name was Franz, and he had huge dogs that he didn't mind unleashing on the prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1868">And another, Sawecki, something like that, s -- li -- Sawecki -- s -- I can't remember the spelling, Sawecki. </sentence><sentence id="1869">He was an SS captain. </sentence><sentence id="1870">Hugo Osteria was the interpreter for the SS, for the Gestapo in that particular area. </sentence><sentence id="1871">So, he approached the committee of National Liberation, and said, "I want to help you." </sentence><sentence id="1872">So he would give us the name of the people detained in the particular area if he could, and also to let us know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1873">Needless to say, we had other sources, mostly the suarai, the nun, the doctor, being careful, but was one. </sentence><sentence id="1874">The baker was another one who was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And -- but Hugo Osteria became important. </sentence><sentence id="1876">So, what he did was sometime he let people be tortured, deported to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1877">Among them was Jainjo Bamphi, the brother of Senator Arialdo Bamphi, a-and the husband of Mrs. Bamphi, whom I met, and she described that it was Hugo Osteria who arrested Jainjo Bamphi in their home. </sentence><sentence id="1878">So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game, because he helps them, and he help usually important people, of the Committee of National Liberation, like Ferucho Parai, then later on, at the end of the war, would testify on his behalf. </sentence><sentence id="1879">But many other people, like Jako Perdenti, Cheenira Scapolla, and Jainjo Bamphi were not only tortured, but then deported to Mauthausen, where they died. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And this was typical of this man, and other working for the Nazi and the Fascist. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Then they would give the Committee of National Liberation, and the church, information about certain prisoner, or arrange for money to be paid to somebody by some family desperate to get help for their prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1882">But essentially, you never knew. </sentence><sentence id="1883">Certainly she never trusted them, and eventually the allies decided that this man was so unreliable that he had to be shipped in the southern part of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And Bustelli told me how he -- he was a S-Swiss Intelligent Services, how he, personally felt for a long time than this man was a prototype of politsiato, political politsiato, never to be trusted, that he would give some help when it was possibly beneficial for him in the future, in the political settlement after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1885">But helped to arrest people, did a lot of damage, used informer, and unfortunately, because of the double game, managed to gain the trust of some people in the underground, which led to disastrous results. </sentence><sentence id="1886">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1960">Q: What i -- what is luss -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1961">A: Lushapasari means those papers, official paper that allowed people to travel after curfew was implemented. </sentence><sentence id="1962">But then it happen -- Joe Bacigalupi, and the team of forgerer, when they had this, then it was their job to duplicate, raticate, etcetera, and make it available, and there was some for the doctor, some for the people of assistance, and many -- false, of course, but the German caught on of that. </sentence><sentence id="1963">So every once in awhile, every two or three months, and they would change the papers. </sentence><sentence id="1964">So here we go, the cleaning lady, the cleaning ti -- di -- or boys, or whatever, and -- and we had to take some more, or sometime we worked as cleaning lady from some Fascist and onners, and get some more, but Joe Bacigalupi, and with the cooperation of the cristori, the policeman, whoever, he managed to get the list of all the forgerer. </sentence><sentence id="1965">He was best forgerer in -- in Milan, and for other paper. </sentence><sentence id="1966">We were told at that time, that the allied in Switzerland had botched a job of duplicating false paper, which caused immediately the arrest of the two people who were carrying this false paper into Italy from Switzerland, so Joe Bacigalupi said, "Damn it, how stupid. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Those allies my have much money and all that, but they don't know how to do things." </sentence><sentence id="1968">And he was right. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Eventually he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Eventually, with the help of the inside guard, a key was left unattended, so that he could walk out at lunchtime when everybody was busy eating. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1981">So this is some of my recollection. </sentence><sentence id="1982">And then of course, his paper were very important for people to bring to Switzerland, and all people were sent from Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1983">But then, in Switzerland too, we had a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1984">On one point, an infiltrator, I believe his name was Cherasa, but I'm not certain. </sentence><sentence id="1985">I believe so. </sentence><sentence id="1986">He managed to go into one of these camps for Italian military, where he learned about plans by the allies, and -- to get people out, and he managed to get out and report to the -- San Vittory, to Hugo, and to the other group, what this Italian prisoner in the Swiss camp were planning, how they were selecting specialists, be the kind of job then that Aurora did in bringing back into Italy these people to help in the underground, cause the ally needed help with specialists in demolition, for railway, for bridges, and so some Italian were very happy to get out of the camp, and help the allies to -- to do these kind of jobs. </sentence><sentence id="1987">So you needed people to be very careful in the camps because of infiltrator, like this Cherasa, who they managed to get out, and go to report to Hugo, and to these people. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And you needed specialists in demolition, se -- others. </sentence><sentence id="1989">But the reason I think about Aurora was that here was a young woman in her 20, who gave her life to help. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2121">A: And all this area was patrolled at first, from -- by old Austria. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2123">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2125">A: Then, when Lydia, and cohorts, began organizing dinner with food, drink, women, helped by little Katoria along the way -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2126">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2127">A: -- while the churches were sheltering the people to be passed. </sentence><sentence id="2128">So Lydia was organizing the dinners. </sentence><sentence id="2129">And at first the Austrian were very easy. </sentence><sentence id="2130">Then, the German realized that -- what was happening, and instead of sending all the -- Austria, and they began sending SS. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And true, they were SS who may have been f -- wounded on other fronts, but they were SS. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And then they began to patrol with the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="2133">And then it became more and more difficult, but we had the help of Bustelli and all the Swiss. </sentence><sentence id="2134">Bustelli realized that his office had been infiltrated, it was </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2135"> somebody, ba -- so he began talking to the -- not only to Lydia, but all to the smuggler in the dialect of the Teecheeno, which is incomprehensible to many people. </sentence><sentence id="2136">And the day Leonard and I visited him, he -- he wrote a poem which I have in dialect, in my file. </sentence><sentence id="2137">But he ro -- the whole area, the churches, the smuggler, the farmer, the pe -- everybody was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2138">Q: It was hilar -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2139">A: -- helping, and on the other side, there were the Swiss. </sentence><sentence id="2140">So I am aware then the Swiss kept money from the Jewish people, but I want to thank the Swiss people, who helped so much, not only with the border crossing, but also in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="2141">I mean, there were some good people, and they deserve recognition for their courage. </sentence><sentence id="2142">Now the dogs became a problem, and I want to mention what Lydia said, pass the words that we had to carry precious little ground meat. </sentence><sentence id="2143">Inside there was a pill for the dogs, and above all, not to show fear. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Lie down, pretend to sleep, leave the meat available right next to you, and as soon as the dog gulps that down, then the dog goes to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Again, these are thing that we had no idea, but she and the network working with her, and the network with erking in Milan, all together, taught us. </sentence><sentence id="2146">We were really greens on this matter. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2147">But the farmer, and the Pastore deser -- an-and then there was the guardida finansa, who were the Italian treasuries. </sentence><sentence id="2148">Some of them remained faithful to Fascist, but few of them. </sentence><sentence id="2149">The others all helped. </sentence><sentence id="2150">So that when passages had to be done, organized by a, the network of the smart lerrer, and both Lydia from the Italian point, and Bustelli from the Swiss point, but there were a thousand of people working in the whole network. </sentence><sentence id="2151">Then, it was very important in the guardida finansa, the Italian one, would turn their back so that we could do it. </sentence><sentence id="2152">One of our job was to patch the holes. </sentence><sentence id="2153">Now, the arrangement for passing between Bustelli, and Lydia, and their network, because obviously, was big network, was done by arrangement with special bell put on the collar of the goats. </sentence><sentence id="2154">And the signal of the bell suggested the place of passing. </sentence><sentence id="2155">It was an organization, but </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2156"> the -- of course, we have to remember, the smuggler have been there for thousand of years. </sentence><sentence id="2157">After the war, they became restaurant owner, bar owner, and we had the joy of meeting, my husband and I, and my son, actually, as well, and dot -- and granddaughter, we went to meet one of them in the Easala comatchina, on the Lake of Como, where there is a marvelous restaurant, and is run by s -- former smuggler, and their children, and their sa -- children now of course in their 40 and 50. </sentence><sentence id="2158">So it's really an homage to ordinary people once again, but this woman deserve special recognition for -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2159">Q: You mean Lydia. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2160">A: Lydia. </sentence><sentence id="2161">She -- I believe she never went beyond the third grade, but her capacity for organizing was incredible. </sentence><sentence id="2162">Also her courage, and there are stories that we don't have time to go into it, but one brief one was that on one occasion, a man than she taught was with us, sent by the Committee of National Liberation in Milan. </sentence><sentence id="2163">Turned out that he -- she helped him to go to the military camp. </sentence><sentence id="2164">From there he learned a great deal, then he -- and then he came back and started her home, and she realized that he was a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="2165">At this point, two partisan came at her home, with guns. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And this man, of course, also could do something. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And Lydia said to the two partisan, "Please, please, I have two small daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2168">If you kill him, then the whole village will be burned. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2169">Everything will be burned, and we will lose everything. </sentence><sentence id="2170">So please go away, go away." </sentence><sentence id="2171">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="2172">So this Nazi man took Lydia to Milan, probably to the SS, she doesn't know where they took her. </sentence><sentence id="2173">They sat her in a room where they gave her a big meal, and she thought this was her last supper. </sentence><sentence id="2174">Then somebody came, took her by train back to Ronaggo, to the train station, gave her a note. </sentence><sentence id="2175">Inside there was two gold coins, one for each of her daughter, and a little note. " </sentence><sentence id="2176">You saved my life, I am now saved yours. </sentence><sentence id="2177">But there will be no next time." </sentence><sentence id="2178">So Lydia was so terrified by this experience, that she went to the home in the Swiss side of a friend and very active </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2179"> member of the underground, and she went to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2180">And when she woke up -- these man had the penchant for putting mask with colored lights all over around the room. </sentence><sentence id="2181">So when she woke up, she saw all these mask with all these lights, and she screamed, "Ayuto, ayuto, ayuto." </sentence><sentence id="2182">And -- and all of a sudden, a -- several young men in trunk, because it was hot, arrived, beautiful young men who were waiting to pass through the Italian-Swiss border, to come to Italy to work. </sentence><sentence id="2183">And she said to me, "Well, when I saw all those beautiful young men, I thought, if this is hell," because she thought she was in hell, ayuto, "if this is hell, I will stay." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2184">Q: And what is -- what is ayuto? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2185">A: Ayuto means help, help. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2187">Q: Aha. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2189">A: So Shirley Dondrea came with me, and we went with -- you know, with Lydia, we saw this beautiful villa. </sentence><sentence id="2190">The owner was working with the underground, but he was also a major entrepreneur, traffic dinart, the Swiss knew it. </sentence><sentence id="2191">But when he died, he left everything to Lydia, and -- because she helped, saved his life many times. </sentence><sentence id="2192">But anyway, this Shirley and I -- I think Shirley took a -- pictures of this room with all the mask, with the colored light, and so we had a jolly good laugh at that time, and realized that the war was really over, we could talk about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2197">Q: Did you see Lydia much during the -- during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2376">A: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Because our friend -- well, first of all, I was sent in Valdosta. </sentence><sentence id="2378">Now this is important. </sentence><sentence id="2379">I have written about it. </sentence><sentence id="2380">One of the underground activity was to organize people, sometime to go and evaluate the disaster made by certain destroy policy, by the Nazi in the valley, where we had so many partisan. </sentence><sentence id="2381">And in Valdosta, in particularly Valtoonage, there was a very important group led by Usmiani, called the U16, Usmiani. </sentence><sentence id="2382">And Buerkio. </sentence><sentence id="2383">Buerkio was the professor at the University of Pavia. </sentence><sentence id="2384">And he had access to my apartment, in fact, he personally often came on emergency, for instruction, also for training, for other people involved, into valdo -- Valdosta, and other, where the eevrie adeeoli veti company. </sentence><sentence id="2385">The people at the high level, chief executive officer, and others, all these people had homes in -- in Cherveenia for skiing, in the valleys. </sentence><sentence id="2386">That was normal. </sentence><sentence id="2387">But was also a center, in Valtoonage, for transmitting to the allies, informations via </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2388"> these whom -- I didn't know who it was. </sentence><sentence id="2389">However, I was told that after the Rustellimenti, there was this page, then -- there is one page that you can copy, there was a frantic telephone call -- not telephono, some me -- some message, radio, whatever, I don't know exactly, to the Committee of National Liberation saying why the Germans -- the Nazi are negotiating in oursta with the church, and the representative of the partisan bands, or the truvalai, bartonunch, valdayass, dressonai. </sentence><sentence id="2390">They are actually already starting towns to go, and people dressed in camouflage, including some very cruel troops, already starting to catch the partisan on their back -- clean up the valley. </sentence><sentence id="2391">So here they were negotiating in oursta. </sentence><sentence id="2392">The church in good faith. </sentence><sentence id="2393">Tito, or ever, who is the commander of the Valtoonage did not go personally, as he was asked to do, but send somebody, because he sensed -- he smelled somebody. </sentence><sentence id="2394">So there was this frantic call, or communication from Valdosta to Milan, to the Committee of National Liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2395">The information had come from -- I was told, from somebody who went to a beauty parlor from our side, who heard either a Fascist or a Nazi woman, or mistress, or somebody saying, "Oh yeah, they are negotiating with the church, but they are going to clean up. </sentence><sentence id="2396">The German are already started." </sentence><sentence id="2397">Something like that. </sentence><sentence id="2398">So, immediately, there was this one page, frantic communication to Valdosta, it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="2399">We lost a lot of people, it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="2400">Many people were killed, and there was a traitor who was working right next to Tito. </sentence><sentence id="2401">And when the time came for this person to go and give the meecha, the fire to the bridge, so then the tank couldn't go, he killed the other person with it. </sentence><sentence id="2402">So -- and he had been with -- with us for three months and nobody realized that he was a double. </sentence><sentence id="2403">But this I confirmed with Monsieur Tiba, when I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="2404">And I spoke to Tito a few years ago about all this. </sentence><sentence id="2405">So, after this disaster, we lost a lot of people, including young people that we had send up, because they didn't want to go to Switzerland, they wanted to participate in the active Resistance movement, so we send them up to the banns. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And among </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2407"> them a young man, Hoos Franco from either Maltarra, or Pavia, very close by, but actually, we were involved, our group was involved. </sentence><sentence id="2408">Soon after all this disaster occurred, I was told by a friend, member of our group, the Benedetti, who was a mountain climber, and his son was working with us, he wife was working with us, that it was very important to go up to Valtoonage, and assess the damage, but more importantly, it was very important to go to the house of pierovono, one of the guide, one of the Alpinist, and only since last dega -- August, I knew -- I learned that he was part of this special group, like Lashincross, I didn't know before. </sentence><sentence id="2409">As far as we knew, we were all in the underground, working. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And these gentlemen, these architect, would come and pick me up at -- sometime early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="2411">He had all the permit, and he had a house, he owned a home in Chervinia. </sentence><sentence id="2412">His name was architect Molino. </sentence><sentence id="2413">Never met him in my life, but I was supposed to be his mistress. </sentence><sentence id="2414">And, "But he's a gentleman, Ginetta, you don't have to worry, but we need somebody to go up with him, he own a house, and he has a perfect reason to see if damage was done, to fix it for the winter, and he has his mistress with him." </sentence><sentence id="2415">And the mistress was me. </sentence><sentence id="2416">And so jus -- lo and behold, here, in November come this gentleman, and kiss my hand, and I go with him, he had all the passes, everything. </sentence><sentence id="2417">And we arrived, traveling to a place called Shationne. </sentence><sentence id="2418">Shationne is right at the entrance of the Valtoonage. </sentence><sentence id="2419">And we stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2420">He was going to place his car someplace in Shantionne, and we had to carry the knapsack. </sentence><sentence id="2421">I ask my ri -- Lask him if I could take a little suitcase, he said, "Yeah, if you feel like carrying that plus your knapsack, go ahead," but, you know, I didn't bring, I put everything in the knapsack. </sentence><sentence id="2422">But we had to bring up some medicine, and we arrive in Shantionne, we go to this little bric and brac little store. </sentence><sentence id="2423">This wonderful woman, Delphina was her name, and we chatted amiably, and then this architect said to me, "Go ahead, because I will catch up with you." </sentence><sentence id="2424">Remember, I was in my teen, and he was probably 60, but he was much stronger. </sentence><sentence id="2425">So it was obvious that he -- well, I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2426"> didn't think much, but it was obvious that he wanted to talk to her. </sentence><sentence id="2427">Only in retrospect I figured all that out, but I didn't at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2428">And we went, and we arrived in Valtoomage, and -- at the house of this family, and it was a -- all of the women were in black, they were -- well, they broke down crying, because of the horror. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And one of them described to me how Franco died. </sentence><sentence id="2430">They killed several people. </sentence><sentence id="2431">In fact, about 10 years ago, I took a picture of the monument to those people, and we went, and then I realized that we -- we wanted to stay in val -- I wanted to stay in Valtoomage, and he, no, no, we have to go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="2432">We went to Chervinia, and at the passage, at the block passage, there was Italian young Fascist. </sentence><sentence id="2433">Very energetic, very ideologically committed people, but he had passes, and they were passes from the Gestapo, the SS, or some authority, and immediately everybody was, oh, please let me help you, blah, blah, blah, and all kind, and -- and I thought, oh my God, you know, I -- I trust Benedetti, no -- no -- but at the same time, you are startled. </sentence><sentence id="2434">I never met this person, but he was kind. </sentence><sentence id="2435">We arrived at his house, I was so tired. </sentence><sentence id="2436">He helped me to take off my shoes, made a fire, and gave me something to drink, and -- and then I lied down and I slept for awhile, and then he woke me up, and he said, "We have to go." </sentence><sentence id="2437">And we went to the home -- house owned by Pierovona in the same village. </sentence><sentence id="2438">And we ha -- w-we had to retrieve some material, which we did, and I had to put them in my chest. </sentence><sentence id="2439">Then, next day -- then I went back to bed -- next day, I s -- had to say to the Fascist that were mocking me for being with such an old man, etcetera, etcetera, that the altitude was not good for me, I had to go back, and say, "Oh yeah, this old man is no good, but we are good, come with us," blah, blah, blah all that suns -- kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2440">But they were very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And I was going to walk down, but then they drove me down. </sentence><sentence id="2442">And at the val -- at the end, th -- at Shationne, there was a little hotel where I was supposed to stay. </sentence><sentence id="2443">When the hotel keeper saw me arrive with this Fascist, he was as cold as one can be, he said he -- yes, he had a room, but no food, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2444">So, well, I went to -- to the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2445"> bedroom, and about one or two in the morning, there were shots fired in my room, the glass fu -- so I went under the bed. </sentence><sentence id="2446">Until the day before, the -- somebody from the Fascist or the Nazi used this place. </sentence><sentence id="2447">So the partisan thought then they were still there, but I was there, so I went under the thing. </sentence><sentence id="2448">And about oh, few minutes later, some partisan came in with the red ankle chafe, and the machine gun is -- "Where is she, where is she? </sentence><sentence id="2449">Oh my God, what we have done?" </sentence><sentence id="2450">They knew, they learned that I was there. </sentence><sentence id="2451">So, the face of hotel keeper changed completely. </sentence><sentence id="2452">He b -- the partisan actually, they said, libber, please give her some -- anything. </sentence><sentence id="2453">So he brought out cheese and wine and bread, and -- and apologized. </sentence><sentence id="2454">And then he put some coal in a scarbaletto. </sentence><sentence id="2455">Is a gadget with a long handle, and inside put the coals, so that his wife warmed up the bed for me. </sentence><sentence id="2456">I mean, it was such a change. </sentence><sentence id="2457">And we -- next morning, I came down and he gave me -- I realized he put something in my knapsack which was very good, cheese and a piece of meat. </sentence><sentence id="2458">I arrived home, and the apartment up above was where those two friends, and it was clear that something had happened, the food was left. </sentence><sentence id="2459">And so I quickly got out, as well as bring the material to Viabeeli, and I was told then they were caught. </sentence><sentence id="2460">So I began working with Dom Bickuli. </sentence><sentence id="2461">And this Pierro, that I still don't know, who was an elegant man, working with the cardinal, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="2462">And the idea came, then I had to go and try to find hostages for exchange. </sentence><sentence id="2463">That's little field that I have, is one example. </sentence><sentence id="2464">And the son of Corvul sent me, because he knew then I had -- we were doing this. </sentence><sentence id="2465">And I went north, all the way to another place, to another valley, up to Borneo. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2466">Borneo Livino. </sentence><sentence id="2467">From Banktband with a password at each place, and -- and in Livino, I was told than [indecipherable] for exchange with our friends in Milan. </sentence><sentence id="2468">Well, that was February, beginning of February. </sentence><sentence id="2469">I took the bus, because I couldn't walk any more, my feet were so swollen. </sentence><sentence id="2470">And I arrived in a place called Tiranno. </sentence><sentence id="2471">And in Tiranno, the bus was surrounded, and -- and so that's how I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2472">And from Tiranno few days later, that was the brigatanari, to Sondrio. </sentence><sentence id="2473">And </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2474"> to Sondrio, a very important story, because I saw someone died, and all sorts of thing. </sentence><sentence id="2475">And then I was really -- I brought Milan to the mouti, and I was told by a man whose name was Crome that I didn't speak, but they had the means to make me speak. </sentence><sentence id="2476">I didn't doubt it, but I -- but then they released me because somebody said then, oh no, no, I was not involved. </sentence><sentence id="2477">Two hours -- I was still black and blue. </sentence><sentence id="2478">Two hours later, one of the people from Sondrio, who had accompanied me to the bi -- mouti in Milan, arrived. </sentence><sentence id="2479">And he said, "You are not working, so you have to come to Sondrio to work for us." </sentence><sentence id="2480">And I said, "Well, I have an appointment with my doctor, because I have some problem with my lungs." </sentence><sentence id="2481">And, "Well, you go and see your doctor and then you come back with us." </sentence><sentence id="2482">So I went to the doctor, who was one of us, and the doctor meanwhile, had arranged for my friend, Enrico Mullisanno to arrive, and they said, "If you have the courage to do it, we would like you to -- to do it, to go back." </sentence><sentence id="2483">Well, once they arrived back, it was clear that it was a ruse, too. </sentence><sentence id="2484">And it was -- it's a long story, but the women of the Black Brigade were as bad as the men, and all of us remaining -- one was Bruno Bianci, whom I saw, and his wife was killed, the order came from Mussolini headquarter, from -- that all the people who may have been involved in Intelligence gathering -- and evidently they sus -- suspected that I was -- actually turnous, probably they were right, but I -- I didn't know -- they should be executed. </sentence><sentence id="2485">And what they did was to make a sign that you were there voluntarily. </sentence><sentence id="2486">They received a tremendous amount of brand new money from someplace, and they made a sign than they had given us all this money, when it was in fact they kept it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And they wanted to interrogate me once again, which was, you know, it was the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2488">But there was something really cruel about -- not all of them, at the point they were ready to be bad, but not all of them. </sentence><sentence id="2489">Still holding on to this -- what they were talk about? </sentence><sentence id="2490">The special weapon that the German would use, and would win the war after all, except after April thir -- 23". </sentence><sentence id="2491">And they were talking about them, and </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2492"> I was on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2493">They didn't want to leave witnesses to what they had done. </sentence><sentence id="2494">It was very important that I give the name of all our people, it was -- so, they were trying once again. </sentence><sentence id="2495">When the telephone rung, and somebody said than the German wanted to talk to me again. </sentence><sentence id="2496">Well, everything was falling apart, but still they couldn't get it. </sentence><sentence id="2497">And they were very angry that they didn't dare to say no to the German, they still had an inferiority complex vis a vis of the German, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2498">That's my personal impression. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And -- and two people dressed in German uniform came in, and made jokes about these Italian sissy, that they fall down on the floor, and f -- you -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="2500">So the Italian dragged me up, but the German hold -- held me, and they took me out to the car. </sentence><sentence id="2501">And from there they took me to the hospital where the nun received me and helped me. </sentence><sentence id="2502">But I only learned later there were a number of people involved, not only for me, but for others, and German deserter was -- were asked to help. </sentence><sentence id="2503">To intercept the communication in case the brigatanari, the mouti, would check to see whether it was true, that you still -- no, they didn't trust anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2504">And so these people were risking their lives to -- to help us, to -- to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2505">And it was from Bustelli, and -- and Lydia that they were part of the organizing with the help, with the guardiri publicani. </sentence><sentence id="2506">The guardiri publicani were Italian who were called to serve. </sentence><sentence id="2507">If they didn't, their father, their mother, would be beaten up, so they served, but they were our allies. </sentence><sentence id="2508">So there was a number of people involved in rescuing last minute people in the interrogation cells, because they knew that we would all be executed. </sentence><sentence id="2509">And so, for a couple of days, in the hospital, oh everything, you know, little broth, wonderful care. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And -- but for two days, I was hidden, and then one of the people from the underground in that area -- that's another story, it's too complicated, but apparently I saved his life, and, "Torpelino, Torpelino," and then he came, and - - so then they brought me upstair and I was in a bed. </sentence><sentence id="2511">I was ca -- I had been cleaned up, and I was being treated, and I had wonderful care. </sentence><sentence id="2512">And then, I have to say, the Italian government did </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2513"> something that every government today should do for the people who are caught in such circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="2514">They took care of all the care, and I was in Sondolo, it is a place, used to be for TB only, but we were rec -- put there. </sentence><sentence id="2515">And then, from there f -- until September, and then to another place called San Martino di Castrotsa, in the mountains, for winter, and -- and then in Baratsai, f -- at the sea for a few months of treatment, and then I went to Scotland, and Paris, and -- and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2516">Q: Ginetta, see -- you were captured in February?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2538">A: Well, because one of the point of the SS, the Gestapo, and [indecipherable] other police, everywhere, the point is to make the prisoner believe, that no one knows where he or she is, nobody care, the -- you are in their hands, period. </sentence><sentence id="2539">And there is a consistent effort to make the prisoner believe that you are in their hands, nobody knows where you are, nobody cares. </sentence><sentence id="2540">And one night, one of the guard shouting really bad words for a woman, you know, kicked the door open, and send this panino, that Italian bread, which is empty inside, you know, if you go to Milan, you'll see it. </sentence><sentence id="2541">And I pick it up, and it was dark, but I -- we left the door open, but -- so I saw what it was, and -- and then I started eat, I was so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2542">I was also afraid that there may be some poison inside. </sentence><sentence id="2543">But there was a matchbox, a tiny cherino. </sentence><sentence id="2544">They are called cherini, I've never seen one so small in the country. </sentence><sentence id="2545">They are cherini, and I lit it, and there was this little piece of paper, coracho. </sentence><sentence id="2546">So I knew. </sentence><sentence id="2547">No matter how many time they told me that nobody knows where I was, and I was. </sentence><sentence id="2548">But I think it was important because I -- psychologically you feel like giving up. </sentence><sentence id="2549">The other thing than they repeat to you day after day, that if you tell what happened to you to anybody, we will find you to the end of the earth, you will pay. </sentence><sentence id="2550">And it seems to be a deliberate conditioning for the prisoner, because they did it on both places, in the tirano and the other. </sentence><sentence id="2551">And a, nobody knows you are here. </sentence><sentence id="2552">You are in our hand, we can do what we want, and b, if you tell anybody, you -- we'll find you to the end of the earth, you know, tha -- so, and -- working with prisoner later on in Chile, and re -- same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2553">Former prisoner, former victim of torture would tell me time after time the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2554">And if it was in Greece or Chile, or Brazil, or Italy at that time, or Prague, or the soviet -- the same. </sentence><sentence id="2555">So it -- it's -- there is an institution which is not necessarily taught, but developed by each one, by -- in each country. </sentence><sentence id="2556">And I think most important thing is to educate the public everywhere, then there was a meaning to the universal declaration of human rights, to make sure that see will never happen again to the Jewish people, to the anti- Fascist, to the anti-Stalin, to everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And so I am glad I survived all these years. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2581">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2582">I've had the friendship of so many wonderful -- I discovered after the war that I was working with all the top people of the Committee of National Liberation, who, in their turn, were so helpful to our work for Amnesty International development. </sentence><sentence id="2583">So that's really another story, than it's incredible how, because of the friendship of that period, you learn something, but above all, they helped to develop organization to help other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
