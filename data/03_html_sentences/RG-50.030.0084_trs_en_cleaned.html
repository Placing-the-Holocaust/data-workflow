<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="32">A: Quite a bit from my youth. </sentence><sentence id="33">Now the early years, as I say, the infant years and the toddler years, naturally who can remember those years, which means the first four years one doesn't remember anything or hardly anything. </sentence><sentence id="34">So my remembrance starts roughly in 1933 I suppose which is also the beginning, as chance would have it, of the Third Reich and uh so that's when my uh thinking starts, and as I think back on 1933 and 1934, I cannot think of anything unpleasant that happened to me in those early years. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: Do you remember any incidents that... you say it became less pleasant... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Well, there were a few times when I was hit. </sentence><sentence id="69">OK. </sentence><sentence id="70">But uh it wasn't assault and battery exactly. </sentence><sentence id="71">I mean I was dealt with in a rude, crude sort of fashion but I wasn't actually uh beaten to the ground or anything like that, but there uh were some very curt, unpleasant behavior. </sentence><sentence id="72">My parents decided to take me out of public school and put me in a private school, which they did, and I spent uh 1937 to "38...anyway in 1937 I was in private school. </sentence><sentence id="73">I never got a chance to really attend gymnasium which I qualified for, the German college prep school, because in 1938 all Jews were driven from the schools...be they faculty, teachers, administrative personnel, students, pupils, young, old...all Jewish people in in the school system was removed so that ended my official schooling in in in Germany, in the Third Reich. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: Did...how...how about during this period...can you tell us a little about your family life, your father, your mother... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: My father was a wholesale salesman, textile salesman. </sentence><sentence id="83">Did a lot of traveling in the province of Saringia and the province of Hefner (ph), which adjoins it to the west. </sentence><sentence id="84">He was gone a lot of the time, so I was really...it was my mother really that was in charge ninety percent of the time, as I remember, because he was gone on his uh business, and so she was running the home and she was running me and very nicely I might say. </sentence><sentence id="85">I had no complaints. </sentence><sentence id="86">I was an only child and I would say I was spoiled, at least the landlady in in in my building, who's still alive, she considered me very much a spoiled child. </sentence><sentence id="87">Spoiled brat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Do you remember any of your friends or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: I remember a few, very very slim few little children of which I was one of them and uh these were friends. </sentence><sentence id="97">In fact in my in my family album there are some photos of myself and a few of my childhood friends. </sentence><sentence id="98">My mother took photos and uh so they survive in pictures to this day. </sentence><sentence id="99">But uh I can't remember a hell of a lot. </sentence><sentence id="100">It uh...what I remember wasn't... my home life was not unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="101">I I can't say...I1, in my memoir | pointed out that I had a...my my my mother and my father both tried as much as possible within within their human means to insulate me from the increasingly unpleasant situation for the Jewish people in Germany in the Third Reich which became with, year to year, came in a descending spiral and they insulated me as much as possible and gave me a fairly normal home life and fairly decent life and so I, until 1938, things really were not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="102">I do remember quite vividly though on a number of occasions going to school, still to the old public school. </sentence><sentence id="103">There were the Hitler youth, uniformed Hitler youth, and these were of course the advance, the advance guard of youthful Hilterites and they were were just only too anxious, to willing to beat up on a youngster who was not in uniform, because a youngster not in uniform of a Hitler youth or a Young Pioneer meant one of two things. </sentence><sentence id="104">Either he belonged to a family that was anti-Hitlerean (ph) and didn't want their child to be a Hitler youth, or he was a Jew or gypsy, and if they say a child who was not uniformed, he immediately was to be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="105">So I remember as much as possible of keeping clear of the Hitler youth (laughter), even seeing them a block away would usually mean that I would walk in the opposite direction and so I I managed quite well uh to keep out of their, out of their uh clutches as much as possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: You mentioned this wasn't until 1938... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Until 1938. </sentence><sentence id="119">By 1938 of course I no longer was in school, since all Jews were out of the school, German school, and by then also, early 1938, my father died. </sentence><sentence id="120">Heart condition, very ill for his final six months and so on. </sentence><sentence id="121">Luckily he died because he never would have survived the trip to uh Buchenwald concentration camp and so on. </sentence><sentence id="122">So he died and uh my mother and I then moved shortly thereafter, not immediately, shortly thereafter we moved to Berlin, which as things proved to be a very sensible move. </sentence><sentence id="123">Had we remained in Erfurt neither she or I would have survived the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="124">By moving to Berlin we moved into a milleure (ph) that enabled her to make contact which enabled enabled her eventually to place me with a children's transport for France, and enabled her as a widow eventually to get to England and so we both survived by probably for two reasons, moving to Berlin, number one, and her incessant efforts to get us out of that. </sentence><sentence id="125">You see, my father, as I remember him, always was like many other German Jews...he felt that these these uh wild elements, these Nazi elements, would never be able to capture the whole power. </sentence><sentence id="126">They would never be able to descent to what they descended into. </sentence><sentence id="127">And so he always had this optimistic view, and he couldn't get himself to leave Germany. </sentence><sentence id="128">To him Germany was his home and he had no intention of leaving. </sentence><sentence id="129">My mother would have left Germany in 1935 if he had been willing. </sentence><sentence id="130">But anyway, we remained in Germany, and finally she was a widow in "38. </sentence><sentence id="131">We were in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="132">Her incessant work finally enabled me to get to France with a transport of kids and she, as a widow, eventually to England and thus she saved both our lives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: So then in 1938 you were separated from your mother, is that when it happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: In 1938 we moved to Berlin from Erfurt. </sentence><sentence id="151">I was not separated. </sentence><sentence id="152">In 1939, in 1939 I was separated from my mother, when I was associated with this transport of children. </sentence><sentence id="153">All the children said goodbye on the train platform. </sentence><sentence id="154">For many, for all the children in fact, it was the last time they saw their their parents, because all these married uh folks, these married couples, they couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="155">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="156">Most of these children saw...for most of these kids on this transport, around thirty-nine children, thirty-eight of them said goodbye for the final time to their parents on that train platform, taking us to France. </sentence><sentence id="157">By mother being a widow managed to get to England. </sentence><sentence id="158">She survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="169">Now let's go back to 1938. </sentence><sentence id="170">You moved to Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="175">We moved to Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: Now...once you're in Berlin...let's, let's go over what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="179">I'm a little little unclear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: In Berlin my mother had me placed for those months...I don't know whether it was at the very beginning, but I know I was there for a number of months to the end in Berlin, she placed me with an orphanage called the Awerbuch (ph) Orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="183">Awerbuch. </sentence><sentence id="184">OK. </sentence><sentence id="185">And uh </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Was it basically a Jewish orphanage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Oh it was a Jewish orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="193">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="194">In in "38, Jews were not permitted to associate with Aryans. </sentence><sentence id="195">Oh no. </sentence><sentence id="196">That would have been abso...oh disaster for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="197">And uh so uh this was a Jewish children's home. </sentence><sentence id="198">I can't say that all the children there were orphans. </sentence><sentence id="199">I wasn't an orphan, yet I was accepted by Awerbuch and there were other children who had families...uh par...parents, both parents alive and they were accepted by Awerbuch. </sentence><sentence id="200">In other words, I think this Awerbuch home accepted children whether they were orphans or not, because it was felt that in this orphanage they had some kind of a refuge from what was happening on the streets of Berlin to Jews who were being beaten and trampled on and kicked upon, and with the police looking the other way if they happened to be there. </sentence><sentence id="201">The situation by 1938 was getting out of hand. </sentence><sentence id="202">And late "38 you had this infamous Night of the Breaking Kristall (ph), Kristallnacht it was called in German, and uh that's when they really went went amuck, ran amuck, the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="203">When they attacked the synagogues and set uh fire to the synagogues, smashed the Jewish shops, vandalized everything they could lay their hands on, beat adults and children when whenever they found someone because by that time adults and children above the age of ten I think or twelve, I'm not sure, had to have a Jewish star so you immediately could identify who was Jewish and who wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="204">So you were living in in a terrible uh nightmare by 1938, but us being in that home, around the clock, we were spared these outrages on Kristall...Kristallnight, which was right in late November...uh, not not...early November, early November 1938. </sentence><sentence id="205">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Shortly after that you were put on a train... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Well, uh then it was 1939. </sentence><sentence id="223">Another month more passed. </sentence><sentence id="224">Months more passed, and again I was in this Awerbuch home, with lots of other kids, Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="225">And as I say, Nazis did not invade this Awerbuch home. </sentence><sentence id="226">We found ourselves sort of living like in a, like on a plantation, sort of immunized from the outside, with the outside being a jungle, a developing jungle and we were in this Awerbuch home and uh so we were there during the early months of "39. </sentence><sentence id="227">Things uh like I've read about the pa...you know, looking back upon things, things got from bad to worse and from worse to even worse and but in the Awerbuch home things were relatively quiet and safe because we stayed in that home. </sentence><sentence id="228">We didn't set foot outside for very sensible reasons. </sentence><sentence id="229">And uh finally in the summer of "39, the transport was formed. </sentence><sentence id="230">My mother had succeeded in getting me admitted to this transport and uh that's how I, along with thirty-eight other children, one fine summer day left on this train ride to France. </sentence><sentence id="231">I should also point out that in the year 1938 to "39, my mother lived with a Jewish lady as her uh sub-tenant. </sentence><sentence id="232">In other words, she lived with a Jewish lady on Hector Strasa (ph) in Berlin, West Berlin, un the western part of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="233">At that time, of course, Berlin was a unified city and on Hector Strasa 21 my mother lived with a Jewish lady whose sub-tenant she was. </sentence><sentence id="234">I can't really tell you what work she did. </sentence><sentence id="235">I really can't tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="251">Then you were put on the transport... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="255">The kids went on the transport, said goodbye to their parents on the platform and for all of them except one, my mother, was the last time they saw their parents, because they all died in the Holocaust, these these parents. </sentence><sentence id="256">Children left for France and then we arrived in a place called Cassie (ph) , maybe fifteen to twenty miles southeast of Paris, where a French nobleman, Count formed a uh children's home for us thirty-nine children. </sentence><sentence id="257">He had previously formed a home for probably an equivalent number of Spanish girls from Republican Spain. </sentence><sentence id="258">Spanish Republican refugee girls were also quartered, not in the same building but in a near-by building, also one of "s charitable enterprises. </sentence><sentence id="259">And so this is where we lived and it seemed at the time that this was our refuge, our port in a developing storm. </sentence><sentence id="260">Of course, like history tells us, things didn't remain so quiet and the port in the storm wasn't a port for very long. </sentence><sentence id="261">For for less than a year it was a port uh a port ina storm. </sentence><sentence id="262">While I was at uh this this home of Monsieur in Cassie, just a few weeks later I got a letter suddenly from England. </sentence><sentence id="263">I didn't know a soul in England. </sentence><sentence id="264">I, but I recognized the handwriting. </sentence><sentence id="265">A letter from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="266">She told me she had arrived in in in England and and was working for a family in Leatherhead (ph) in the outskirts of London and and so I knew at that point that she was out, I was out and things looked pretty good at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your life in this French place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Well, was...we were all Jewish children, but it wasn't a Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="284">Uh our counselors and teachers were not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="285">Our benefactor wasn't Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="286">Uh we were not...we had no kosher cuisine. </sentence><sentence id="287">We had no Jewish rules and regulations. </sentence><sentence id="288">There was no Jewish instruction or anything. </sentence><sentence id="289">We led a uh totally non-Jewish assimilationist (ph) type of life. </sentence><sentence id="290">Uh and I, like I state in my memoir, my guess is that most of the kids in the transport to this home came from assimilationist uh German-Jewish homes. </sentence><sentence id="291">There were no religious people that I can remember there among the kids. </sentence><sentence id="292">We all seemed to take to this secular type of life at Cassie rather easily. </sentence><sentence id="293">We seemed to fit in very very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="294">I should also mention in in retrospect that my own parents did not have a very uh...did not run a religious home. </sentence><sentence id="295">My father came from very deeply religious parents, but he himself did not follow a deeply religi...religious life although he did go to schule (ph) on the religious holidays and participated in the services. </sentence><sentence id="296">My mother not at all, and so I remember not living in a in a really Jewish type of home. </sentence><sentence id="297">We were living a assimilationist type of secular home... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: What activities did you have there? </sentence><sentence id="314">Did you have classes? </sentence><sentence id="315">Did you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Now we we are back again now in Cassie...our activities were...we had uh French class. </sentence><sentence id="320">We learned French. </sentence><sentence id="321">I remember very well one of our teachers was a White Russian who pounded us (laughter)...verbs and syntax. </sentence><sentence id="322">I remember very well... Madame Richter, R - 1- C -H-T-E-R, a Russian uh emigre from St. Petersburg for all I know. </sentence><sentence id="323">Maybe even a member of the uh royal courts for all I know. </sentence><sentence id="324">Uh anyway uh maybe an instructress to some of the uh Russian uh noblemen, one-time noblemen in St. Petersburg, and uh anyway Madame Richter, she really pounded French into us. </sentence><sentence id="325">I remember that to this to this day and uh we had other French teachers and uh emigre teachers and uh...how shall I put it...uh teachers and uh counselors...that's the word I'm looking for, counselors...and none of them Jewish and so, as I say, it was a secular atmosphere and we played and we had our instruction. </sentence><sentence id="326">We had our three meals a day. </sentence><sentence id="327">If there was anything lacking it was parental love. </sentence><sentence id="328">That that was missing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="340">That's an important ingredient... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="344">That's one of the tragedies of my life...at this key period of my life, suddenly in 1939 my parental link was cut off, because receiving an occasional letter from my mother in England is hardly a substitute for really living in one's home with one's parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: Now how long were you in this area, in this camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: In this children's home...it wasn't a camp...children's home? </sentence><sentence id="350">From uh summer of "39 until the fall of France in the summer of "40. </sentence><sentence id="351">Roughly a year I was in this Cassie , children's home of Monsieur...the Count of F </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: Tell me what happened after the fall of France? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Well, he was a high French officer. </sentence><sentence id="358">Was taken prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="359">The last we heard was that uh he was somewhere in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="360">The finances of the home went from mediocre to bad, from bad to worse. </sentence><sentence id="361">It became obvious that the home had to be closed, and that's when the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants of France, this Jewish welfare organization for children, entered the picture. </sentence><sentence id="362">As the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants...well that's... translate that as the Child's Welfare Organization...Children's Welfare Aid Society...there are any number of ways you can translate that name. </sentence><sentence id="363">In French it's O -E- U- V -R -E, that's one word...D * E, is another word...S -E-C-O-U-R-S, is another word...uh A - U - X, still another word, and the final word, enfants, E - N - F- A- N - T - S, which by the way means children. </sentence><sentence id="364">OK. </sentence><sentence id="365">So this uh...oh, by by the way...it was always called for short by it's acronym of OSE, OSE, by it's initials...O-S-E. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: So OSE took over at that time... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: OSE took over as this uh enterprise failed, went... mean went bankrupt. </sentence><sentence id="378">Uh prior to its bankruptcy of course, we tried to flee south, and we fled south with thousands of other people...we were on the road...as the German armies approached Paris from the northeast, we were on our way to the southeast, by coal barge and then on foot traveling south, trying to go south. </sentence><sentence id="379">Everybody, lots of Jews on the roads I would imagine, but also other Frenchmen, all, everybody heading south to evade the approaching uh Teutonic hoard. </sentence><sentence id="380">Uh in other words they had broken through the marginal (ph) line, the so-called impregnable marginal line which held on for months and months in the so-called . </sentence><sentence id="381">They had broken through and were rapidly approaching Paris, and that's when you had this helter skelter rush to the south. </sentence><sentence id="382">And we joined the rush. </sentence><sentence id="383">Our teachers and counselors told us we'll go south and hopefully we'll get there. </sentence><sentence id="384">Well, we didn't get there. </sentence><sentence id="385">We were (laughter)... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: Do you remember something about that trip...what happened... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Everything down to the last detail... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: Well, tell us, tell us more about that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: One night we spent on a coal barge going up the Seine, not down the Seine, but up the Seine. </sentence><sentence id="402">And if you know the Seine, it meanders like that and going up it is not only slow, it was painfully slow, extremely slow. </sentence><sentence id="403">We made very little progress and and finally during uh one fine morning, the fine morning after a night on the barge...the barge was empty and we and the other people were on that barge sleeping, or trying to sleep...and one fine morning, uh the fine morning afterwards, after having boarded it, the barge, came upon thousands or hundreds at least other barges all stuck in the sand. </sentence><sentence id="404">They were barring each other's way. </sentence><sentence id="405">There were barges and barges and barges, so we simply got out of our barge and continued the trip south on foot, carrying our our belongings like thousands of other people. </sentence><sentence id="406">Traveling on foot the road south. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: With your teachers and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Everybody along, on foot, carrying belongings, our belongings...suitcases, knapsacks, you name it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: All day long. </sentence><sentence id="420">When we got off the barge in the morning to to...it was evening time. </sentence><sentence id="421">We got to this farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="422">We uh on on this...I call it the famous road that where I came face to face with the face (ph) of , because uh we were on on the road between the town of Corbeil, C - O- R- B- E-1- Lon the north, and the town of Melun (ph) in which direction we were moving or walking, M - E- L- U-N, between Corbeil and Melun on this on this third-rate country road, maybe second-rate country road...it certainly wasn't a first-rate highway...walking south and we came to this farmhouse and we decided, or our counselors decided...we didn't, kids didn't decide anything... teachers and counselors decided we were going to spend the night at the farmhouse and that's where we spent, in the barn, in the straw, we spent the night in the farmhouse and I remember vividly all night long there was pounding of cannon fire in the forest of Fountainbleu (ph), in the well-know forest of Fountainbleu, cannons were firing and bang, bang, bang...all night long. </sentence><sentence id="423">It was very difficult to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="424">I got very little shut-eye. </sentence><sentence id="425">And so in the morning it finally got silent. </sentence><sentence id="426">Suddenly the the the firing stopped and and uh things got very silent. </sentence><sentence id="427">Also I should mention some French troops, maybe a platoon of Frenchmen, uh joined us in the hay in that uh in that French farmhouse and slept there or tried to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="428">Early in the morning they packed up and left to the south I guess. ( </sentence><sentence id="429">laughter) We stayed on for breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="430">As I said, in the morning it had gotten very quiet, eerily quiet, eerily still, and so as we finished breakfast some of us went out to the road, to the shoulder of the road and there were some, some farmers, French peasants standing there talking. </sentence><sentence id="431">The big crowd of people, the masses of people that had been the previous day walking, cluttering the road up, walking with their belongings down the road...all gone. </sentence><sentence id="432">The road was empty. </sentence><sentence id="433">Nothing moved on the road. </sentence><sentence id="434">Just a few farmers on the side of the road and a few children finishing breakfast early, moving to the shoulder of the road, and I heard one French farmer yelling into the tiny village down the road, north, uh what's going on now, what's what's happening? </sentence><sentence id="435">Words to that effect. </sentence><sentence id="436">And then the answer was shouted back, . </sentence><sentence id="437">Translation...the Krauts have arrived. </sentence><sentence id="438">And that's what, that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="439">Well, you can see already the tension was was rising among us. </sentence><sentence id="440">We didn't know what to expect. </sentence><sentence id="441">Anyway, the farmers stayed there on the shoulder of the road. </sentence><sentence id="442">The kids stayed on the shoulder of the road. </sentence><sentence id="443">A few minutes later, noise. </sentence><sentence id="444">Motorized troops of the German Wehrmacht were coming down the road, zooming right by us. </sentence><sentence id="445">As they zoomed by us, our hearts once again grew lighter and we began to breath again. </sentence><sentence id="446">We had no idea what would face us because there were rumors from the east, that is eastern Europe, that the German Wehrmacht could be brutal as they were in the east, but in France, in the west of Europe, at this stage of the war, they weren't so brutal. </sentence><sentence id="447">They simply zoomed down the road and left us people standing there. </sentence><sentence id="448">They had no idea who was standing there...kids, some French adults, farmers...zoomed right along down the road and we were once again within the confines of the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="449">Our flight to the south had ended, so what we do our counselor decided, counselors decided to move right back where we came from, back to our home at Cassie and so slowly we mar...walked back on the roads (laughter), the way we came, only this time not by barge, simply on foot and we mar...uh walked and the whole place...as I remember France at that time was in a state of total discombobulation...you didn't know what was going on. ( </sentence><sentence id="450">Laughter) I mean everything was in a state of uh suspended animation. </sentence><sentence id="451">So we walked home. </sentence><sentence id="452">Nothing befell us. </sentence><sentence id="453">I mean we saw Germans along the road, supply, supply troops. </sentence><sentence id="454">Nobody bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="455">To them we were just some French kids walking along. </sentence><sentence id="456">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="457">No problem. </sentence><sentence id="458">French civilians. </sentence><sentence id="459">Nobody bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="460">We just walked back to our home and uh and that's the way our flight to the south ended, exactly nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="461">We were right back where we came from...at at Cassie and the home was, as I say, going from bad to worse financially and then, as I also pointed out previously, the OSE stepped in and then there were about thirty-nine kids and then they moved a number of kids here and a number of kids there, a number of kids there. </sentence><sentence id="462">We were divided all over the place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="507">Q: You were disbursed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="509">A: Disbursed. </sentence><sentence id="510">Precisely. </sentence><sentence id="511">OK. </sentence><sentence id="512">And with three other kids, with three other kids, four of us, were disbursed to the Rothschild Orphanage in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="513">Four of us wound up in the Rothschild Orphanage in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="514">Others wound up in Charbon (ph) at that time. </sentence><sentence id="515">Others wound up in , which were at that time Vichy France, the unoccupied zone, and uh various other places. </sentence><sentence id="516">I have no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: So then you ended up in... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: I ended up with three kids at the orp...Rothschild Orphanage for nine months, a period which I remember very clearly. </sentence><sentence id="529">I got older by this time. ( </sentence><sentence id="530">laughter) And uh I found myself in a French Jewish orphanage, run by the Rothschild organization. </sentence><sentence id="531">OSE took us there but they weren't involved at that time. </sentence><sentence id="532">It was the Rothschild people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Tell us what happened while you were there, at the Rothschild home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="540">A: Well, at the Rothschild home, once again we were learning French uh because the Rothschild orphans, French orphans, had uh French instruction by counselors there, by teachers, and uh so once again I found myself getting school instruction, which had been kind of spotty because of these events that were taking place, the flight and the collapse of the home and so on. </sentence><sentence id="541">Uh our instruction was beginning to get kind of uh sparse, so once again at the Rothschild orphanage I was in a regular schoolroom, classroom atmosphere again learning French again. </sentence><sentence id="542">And uh that's what took place there. </sentence><sentence id="543">We...I remember that our food was regular, three meals a day, but very sparse. </sentence><sentence id="544">I must say that I never could say after getting up from a meal at the Rothschild Orphanage that I was satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="545">I was counting the hours, the minutes, to the next meal. </sentence><sentence id="546">From meal to meal, you lived from meal to meal and neither meal, not one single meal left us really full. </sentence><sentence id="547">It was always hungry before the meal, still hungry after the meal, looking forward to the next meal, but everything otherwise went perfectly normal, stable. </sentence><sentence id="548">Nobody bothered us at the orphanage and we were cut off from the outside developments and uh I can't really say that I had any uh unpleasant uh experiences at the orphanage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="559">Q: What about your other activities, uh other than school at the orphanage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: At the orphanage...kids played in the yard and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="562">Among themselves the kids played and had school. </sentence><sentence id="563">That's about all we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="567">Q: Come back to the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: Occasionally the counselor or teacher would take us to the near-by uh , that's the uh wood. </sentence><sentence id="570">In other words that's a city park if you will, city forest, city park and uh it's a very well-known uh park in Paris... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="574">Q: You mentioned that this was a Jewish orphanage... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: This was a Jewish orphanage... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="578">Q: Were you treated differently than in previous Cassie... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="580">A: Not not really. </sentence><sentence id="581">Not really. </sentence><sentence id="582">Although our teachers at the uh orphanage, there must have been some Jewish teachers there. </sentence><sentence id="583">I couldn't say who was Jewish and who wasn't, but again it was not kosher. </sentence><sentence id="584">It wasn't that there was no religious services and this was a Rothschild home. </sentence><sentence id="585">A Rothschild orphanage, which had existed for who knows how many years. </sentence><sentence id="586">It was not a...I did not it a a religious Jewish atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="594">Q: Chronologically we're now in 1940... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="596">A: We are now in "40 and uh "40, right. </sentence><sentence id="597">We are now in in summer of "40 when I wound up at this...with three others from our home in Cassie...wound up uh in Paris at the Rothschild Orphanage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: How many people, how many children were, would you say were at this Rothschild home at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="602">A: How many? </sentence><sentence id="603">I couldn't say for sure, but I would guess that maybe...well, sixty at most. </sentence><sentence id="604">I couldn't say whether there were more more than sixty. </sentence><sentence id="605">I didn't have the impression there were more than sixty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="610">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="611">And you weren't bothered in any way by the authorities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="614">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="615">I couldn't say that either. </sentence><sentence id="616">While I was at the orphanage, one fine day a gentlemen appeared and wanted some questions from me. </sentence><sentence id="617">And so I answered him whatever I could and he identified himself as working for the International Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="618">What had happened was that my mother had gotten very worried about what happened to her son during the fall of France, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="619">And she had gotten in contact with the International Red Cross in Geneva and tried to find by hook or crook what happened to her little Werner. </sentence><sentence id="620">And so uh this gentleman finally found his way to the Rothschild Orphanage in the summer of 1940, or maybe it was by that time autumn of 1940, and he asked me questions about myself and so forth and I answered and at this point my mother once again had for her own incessant activity found out what had happened to me, where I was and that I had found a safe port in a storm, once again, so once again she she knew where I was. </sentence><sentence id="621">But of course there was no way of writing to her because France was occupied, most of France was occupied except for Vichy France, allied to the rest of the Nazis and and so England at war and so there was no correspondence between us. </sentence><sentence id="622">But at least she knew that I had safely survived the fall of France and that I was at the Rothschild Orphanage in Paris on the Rue La in southeast Paris. </sentence><sentence id="623">That's where I was. </sentence><sentence id="624">Four of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: Let's go from there...what happened to you subsequently? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: That's when the OSE, thankfully, entered the picture again. </sentence><sentence id="639">In uh...sometime in the summer or maybe it was spring...I would say late spring of 1941, the four of us, these four German- Jewish refugees among the rest of the French Jewish orphans who were not, not affected by this move of the OSE...the OSE entered the picture once again and pulled us out of the Rothschild Orphanage, after having...us having spent nine months there. </sentence><sentence id="640">Suddenly the OSE entered the picture and pulled us out of there and moved us to southern France, to Vichy France... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="644">Q: This was just the four Germans... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="646">A: Just the four German-Jewish refugee kids. </sentence><sentence id="647">You see, we were the ones most at risk. </sentence><sentence id="648">The German, that is the French Jewish orphans were not at this point most at risk. </sentence><sentence id="649">Their turn came later, as we shall soon see, but we were at most risk and the OSE took us four out of there and moved us to unoccupied Vichy France. </sentence><sentence id="650">Two of us four went to Marseilles (ph), one of the OSE homes there and the other two went to Charbon (ph), another one of the uh OSE homes, and so that's uh what happened to us in the spring of "41. </sentence><sentence id="651">At that time I had no idea why we were being moved, what really was the significance of that move, nothing of the kind. </sentence><sentence id="652">All I knew is we were moved. </sentence><sentence id="653">In 1952, finally, long after the war, seven years after the war, I found out on my own...I was stationed with the U.S. Army in West Germany and I took a three-day pass to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="654">I wanted to find out...wanted to make a visit to the orphanage, find out what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="655">I made my way to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="656">I made my way along the Rue . </sentence><sentence id="657">I found the grey walls (crying ?), </sentence><sentence id="658">the iron gate, the concierge opening, the little portal (crying?) </sentence><sentence id="659">and I identified myself. </sentence><sentence id="660">She told me that the orphanage was closed, no one here, just the walls, the grounds and so I identified myself that I had been there seven years...no, more than seven years...back in 1941, uh eleven years earlier I had been one of the children there for a while, so she told me that uh in 1941 when the , in the summer of "42 took place, about a year after we had been removed from the orphanage, the , when the French police under the urging of the Gestapo, descended upon any Jewish child, especially orphans and and refugees and others too, descended upon them on the 16th and 17th of July of "42...they descended upon the Rothschild Orphanage and the old concierge lady there, the gatekeeper, building keeper, grounds keeper...told me that during that summer of "42 the entire orphanage, children, staff, you name it from Monsieur Cohan (ph), the director, on down, deported to Drancy, the holding camp and the only destination after Drancy by cattle car was to the extermination camps in eastern Europe, so what had happened was that the children left, the French Jewish orphans left at the Rothschild orphanage, were deported in 1942, the summer of...July of "42. </sentence><sentence id="661">Had the four of us stayed another year, little over a year in the Rothschild Orphanage, I wouldn't be sitting in this chair here. </sentence><sentence id="662">We would have been...who knows...gas chambers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="682">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="683">Let's come back, let's come back... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="686">A: I left that Rue really shaken because at that point I knew how close I had gotten to being exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="687">Anyway that was 1952. </sentence><sentence id="688">That's getting ahead of our story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: Uh I want to pull you back to 1942, so you you left the Rothschild home and you were taken to... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A: Yeah, two of us to Marseille (ph), where once again we found ourselves in in a large home of of kids, Jewish kids, refugee kids, orphan kids, maybe some French Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="695">I have no...I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="696">I was too young to make a a survey at that time. </sentence><sentence id="697">This kind of thing I can do easily in retrospect but at the time I was a youngster and this is not the kind of thing that uh I could do at the time, or did do. </sentence><sentence id="698">And other, two other kids, the other two from the orphanage wound up in Charbon (ph). </sentence><sentence id="699">They too subsequently survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="700">But I can report that the other fellow from the orphanage and myself who went to Marseille, both of us survived the war in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="701">Uh that same year we arrived in Marseille, we were both lucky enough to be assigned to a transport destined ultimately for immigration to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="702">Why? </sentence><sentence id="703">Because we had relatives living in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="704">This was the decision that got us into the transport for the U.S. Had I not had relatives living in the U.S. I wouldn't be sitting here perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="705">No guarantee that I wouldn't have come here ultimately uh because the other two kids at Charbon, the other two from the original four, didn't have relatives in the U.S., and they also survived the war, one of who is in the U.S., the other one in Canada, so I can't say that if I had not made that transport to the U.S. in 1941, once again with OSE taking an important...playing an important role in that, uh I can't say that I wouldn't have survived the war, but chances are fifty-fifty, but this way my my problems were soon to be over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: Did you know you had relatives in the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: Oh yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="721">Vaguely. </sentence><sentence id="722">I mean I I didn't have the details but L... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="726">Q: Did you know who they were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="728">A: I didn't have addresses, but I knew that I had some relatives. </sentence><sentence id="729">I knew I had an uncle there and and so on and as a...also a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="730">I also had a cousin who was a physician uh living in in New York, and so I knew vaguely about their presence but uh it wasn't a close relationship uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="734">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="735">You...so this is 1942. </sentence><sentence id="736">Now you said... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: No, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="741">In "42 I was in the U.S. safe and sound. ( </sentence><sentence id="742">laughter) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: You, you...how did you...you got on a transport and who put you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: Well, this OSE home and the two of us at this OSE home in Marseille at this time still unoccupied Vichy France which within a year was also occupied by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="749">In November "42 they occupied the rest of France. </sentence><sentence id="750">And anyway, so in 1941, that is summer of "41, we, we two, the two of us...Zomie (ph) was his name and myself, Werner Goldschmidt, , to give our full names, we found ourselves added to this transport of kids, many of them refugees from Germany, with relatives in the U.S. I can't say that we all were refugees from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="751">There may have been some refugees from Austria, from Holland, who knows. </sentence><sentence id="752">I couldn't say. </sentence><sentence id="753">Anyway, once again it was a transport. </sentence><sentence id="754">I I couldn't tell you how many...maybe twenty-five, thirty children... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="763">Q: When you say transport, you're talking about ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: A group of children. </sentence><sentence id="766">A group of children being taken under guided escort uh guided escort to Marseille where we waited for quite a number of days to get our emergency uh uh visas to the U.S. We waited there in Marseille uh and finally we got them from the American Consulate General in Marseille..-uh we got our immigration, non-quota immigration visas, all of us kids got them, and then our journey continued by train. </sentence><sentence id="767">Once again guided, escorted by train and finally through the Pyrenees and under the Pyrenees, the tunnels, and we got to Spain which was just shortly after the civil war had ended and I remember a very down-trodden, down-beat uh poor Spain. </sentence><sentence id="768">We got to and there we changed trains in and took the train to Madrid and uh then we spent one night in Madrid and the next day we continued on to Portugal, and then we got to finally to Lisbon. </sentence><sentence id="769">Lisboi (ph) to the Portuguese... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="776">Q: On, on the train you had counselors or somebody... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: Always guided by people in charge. </sentence><sentence id="779">These kids, I mean us kids...we were kids. </sentence><sentence id="780">You didn't put these kids, you know, alone on a train. </sentence><sentence id="781">There was always someone, adult, in charge. </sentence><sentence id="782">I couldn't give you the names and addresses but there were also, always throughout from the time I was at Cassie to the time I got to Lisbon, always adults, be they teachers, be they counselors, be they people temporarily put in charge, always guided, people guiding this group of children, in charge. </sentence><sentence id="783">We were never on our own. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="790">Q: Werner, can you tell us a little bit more about the train and the trip itself... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="792">A: Well, we traveled through , the famous medieval city with the Roman wall around it, and we traveled to andin__I think we changed trains and then from we went by train...now we are really in the deep south of France, southwest of France and from the city of we took the train underneath and through the Pyrenees, partially through tunnels, partially winding through uh narrow passageways, went through and to this poverty-stricken Spain which really looks like a like a disaster area just shortly after the civil war was ended there, and this was just two years after the Spanish civil war... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="794">Q: How how were the other children reacting with you on the train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
