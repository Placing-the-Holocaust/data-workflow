<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Well, there were a few times when I was hit. </sentence><sentence id="73">OK. </sentence><sentence id="74">But uh it wasn't assault and battery exactly. </sentence><sentence id="75">I mean I was dealt with in a rude, crude sort of fashion but I wasn't actually uh beaten to the ground or anything like that, but there uh were some very curt, unpleasant behavior. </sentence><sentence id="76">My parents decided to take me out of public school and put me in a private school, which they did, and I spent uh 1937 to "38...anyway in 1937 I was in private school. </sentence><sentence id="77">I never got a chance to really attend gymnasium which I qualified for, the German college prep school, because in 1938 all Jews were driven from the schools...be they faculty, teachers, administrative personnel, students, pupils, young, old...all Jewish people in in the school system was removed so that ended my official schooling in in in Germany, in the Third Reich. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Did...how...how about during this period...can you tell us a little about your family life, your father, your mother... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: My father was a wholesale salesman, textile salesman. </sentence><sentence id="87">Did a lot of traveling in the province of Saringia and the province of Hefner (ph), which adjoins it to the west. </sentence><sentence id="88">He was gone a lot of the time, so I was really...it was my mother really that was in charge ninety percent of the time, as I remember, because he was gone on his uh business, and so she was running the home and she was running me and very nicely I might say. </sentence><sentence id="89">I had no complaints. </sentence><sentence id="90">I was an only child and I would say I was spoiled, at least the landlady in in in my building, who's still alive, she considered me very much a spoiled child. </sentence><sentence id="91">Spoiled brat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: Do you remember any of your friends or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: I remember a few, very very slim few little children of which I was one of them and uh these were friends. </sentence><sentence id="101">In fact in my in my family album there are some photos of myself and a few of my childhood friends. </sentence><sentence id="102">My mother took photos and uh so they survive in pictures to this day. </sentence><sentence id="103">But uh I can't remember a hell of a lot. </sentence><sentence id="104">It uh...what I remember wasn't... my home life was not unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="105">I I can't say...I1, in my memoir | pointed out that I had a...my my my mother and my father both tried as much as possible within within their human means to insulate me from the increasingly unpleasant situation for the Jewish people in Germany in the Third Reich which became with, year to year, came in a descending spiral and they insulated me as much as possible and gave me a fairly normal home life and fairly decent life and so I, until 1938, things really were not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="106">I do remember quite vividly though on a number of occasions going to school, still to the old public school. </sentence><sentence id="107">There were the Hitler youth, uniformed Hitler youth, and these were of course the advance, the advance guard of youthful Hilterites and they were were just only too anxious, to willing to beat up on a youngster who was not in uniform, because a youngster not in uniform of a Hitler youth or a Young Pioneer meant one of two things. </sentence><sentence id="108">Either he belonged to a family that was anti-Hitlerean (ph) and didn't want their child to be a Hitler youth, or he was a Jew or gypsy, and if they say a child who was not uniformed, he immediately was to be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="109">So I remember as much as possible of keeping clear of the Hitler youth (laughter), even seeing them a block away would usually mean that I would walk in the opposite direction and so I I managed quite well uh to keep out of their, out of their uh clutches as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="110">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="111">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="112"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: You mentioned this wasn't until 1938... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Until 1938. </sentence><sentence id="129">By 1938 of course I no longer was in school, since all Jews were out of the school, German school, and by then also, early 1938, my father died. </sentence><sentence id="130">Heart condition, very ill for his final six months and so on. </sentence><sentence id="131">Luckily he died because he never would have survived the trip to uh Buchenwald concentration camp and so on. </sentence><sentence id="132">So he died and uh my mother and I then moved shortly thereafter, not immediately, shortly thereafter we moved to Berlin, which as things proved to be a very sensible move. </sentence><sentence id="133">Had we remained in Erfurt neither she or I would have survived the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="134">By moving to Berlin we moved into a milleure (ph) that enabled her to make contact which enabled enabled her eventually to place me with a children's transport for France, and enabled her as a widow eventually to get to England and so we both survived by probably for two reasons, moving to Berlin, number one, and her incessant efforts to get us out of that. </sentence><sentence id="135">You see, my father, as I remember him, always was like many other German Jews...he felt that these these uh wild elements, these Nazi elements, would never be able to capture the whole power. </sentence><sentence id="136">They would never be able to descent to what they descended into. </sentence><sentence id="137">And so he always had this optimistic view, and he couldn't get himself to leave Germany. </sentence><sentence id="138">To him Germany was his home and he had no intention of leaving. </sentence><sentence id="139">My mother would have left Germany in 1935 if he had been willing. </sentence><sentence id="140">But anyway, we remained in Germany, and finally she was a widow in "38. </sentence><sentence id="141">We were in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="142">Her incessant work finally enabled me to get to France with a transport of kids and she, as a widow, eventually to England and thus she saved both our lives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: So then in 1938 you were separated from your mother, is that when it happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: In 1938 we moved to Berlin from Erfurt. </sentence><sentence id="161">I was not separated. </sentence><sentence id="162">In 1939, in 1939 I was separated from my mother, when I was associated with this transport of children. </sentence><sentence id="163">All the children said goodbye on the train platform. </sentence><sentence id="164">For many, for all the children in fact, it was the last time they saw their their parents, because all these married uh folks, these married couples, they couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="165">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="166">Most of these children saw...for most of these kids on this transport, around thirty-nine children, thirty-eight of them said goodbye for the final time to their parents on that train platform, taking us to France. </sentence><sentence id="167">By mother being a widow managed to get to England. </sentence><sentence id="168">She survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="179">Now let's go back to 1938. </sentence><sentence id="180">You moved to Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="185">We moved to Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Now...once you're in Berlin...let's, let's go over what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="189">I'm a little little unclear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: In Berlin my mother had me placed for those months...I don't know whether it was at the very beginning, but I know I was there for a number of months to the end in Berlin, she placed me with an orphanage called the Awerbuch (ph) Orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="193">Awerbuch. </sentence><sentence id="194">OK. </sentence><sentence id="195">And uh This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="196">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="197"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Was it basically a Jewish orphanage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Oh it was a Jewish orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="208">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="209">In in "38, Jews were not permitted to associate with Aryans. </sentence><sentence id="210">Oh no. </sentence><sentence id="211">That would have been abso...oh disaster for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="212">And uh so uh this was a Jewish children's home. </sentence><sentence id="213">I can't say that all the children there were orphans. </sentence><sentence id="214">I wasn't an orphan, yet I was accepted by Awerbuch and there were other children who had families...uh par...parents, both parents alive and they were accepted by Awerbuch. </sentence><sentence id="215">In other words, I think this Awerbuch home accepted children whether they were orphans or not, because it was felt that in this orphanage they had some kind of a refuge from what was happening on the streets of Berlin to Jews who were being beaten and trampled on and kicked upon, and with the police looking the other way if they happened to be there. </sentence><sentence id="216">The situation by 1938 was getting out of hand. </sentence><sentence id="217">And late "38 you had this infamous Night of the Breaking Kristall (ph), Kristallnacht it was called in German, and uh that's when they really went went amuck, ran amuck, the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="218">When they attacked the synagogues and set uh fire to the synagogues, smashed the Jewish shops, vandalized everything they could lay their hands on, beat adults and children when whenever they found someone because by that time adults and children above the age of ten I think or twelve, I'm not sure, had to have a Jewish star so you immediately could identify who was Jewish and who wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="219">So you were living in in a terrible uh nightmare by 1938, but us being in that home, around the clock, we were spared these outrages on Kristall...Kristallnight, which was right in late November...uh, not not...early November, early November 1938. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Shortly after that you were put on a train... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Well, uh then it was 1939. </sentence><sentence id="238">Another month more passed. </sentence><sentence id="239">Months more passed, and again I was in this Awerbuch home, with lots of other kids, Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="240">And as I say, Nazis did not invade this Awerbuch home. </sentence><sentence id="241">We found ourselves sort of living like in a, like on a plantation, sort of immunized from the outside, with the outside being a jungle, a developing jungle and we were in this Awerbuch home and uh so we were there during the early months of "39. </sentence><sentence id="242">Things uh like I've read about the pa...you know, looking back upon things, things got from bad to worse and from worse to even worse and but in the Awerbuch home things were relatively quiet and safe because we stayed in that home. </sentence><sentence id="243">We didn't set foot outside for very sensible reasons. </sentence><sentence id="244">And uh finally in the summer of "39, the transport was formed. </sentence><sentence id="245">My mother had succeeded in getting me admitted to this transport and uh that's how I, along with thirty-eight other children, one fine summer day left on this train ride to France. </sentence><sentence id="246">I should also point out that in the year 1938 to "39, my mother lived with a Jewish lady as her uh sub-tenant. </sentence><sentence id="247">In other words, she lived with a Jewish lady on Hector Strasa (ph) in Berlin, West Berlin, un the western part of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="248">At that time, of course, Berlin was a unified city and on Hector Strasa 21 my mother lived with a Jewish lady whose sub-tenant she was. </sentence><sentence id="249">I can't really tell you what work she did. </sentence><sentence id="250">I really can't tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="266">Then you were put on the transport... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="270">The kids went on the transport, said goodbye to their parents on the platform and for all of them except one, my mother, was the last time they saw their parents, because they all died in the Holocaust, these these parents. </sentence><sentence id="271">Children left for France and then we arrived in a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="272">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="273"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection place called Cassie (ph) , maybe fifteen to twenty miles southeast of Paris, where a French nobleman, Count formed a uh children's home for us thirty-nine children. </sentence><sentence id="274">He had previously formed a home for probably an equivalent number of Spanish girls from Republican Spain. </sentence><sentence id="275">Spanish Republican refugee girls were also quartered, not in the same building but in a near-by building, also one of "s charitable enterprises. </sentence><sentence id="276">And so this is where we lived and it seemed at the time that this was our refuge, our port in a developing storm. </sentence><sentence id="277">Of course, like history tells us, things didn't remain so quiet and the port in the storm wasn't a port for very long. </sentence><sentence id="278">For for less than a year it was a port uh a port ina storm. </sentence><sentence id="279">While I was at uh this this home of Monsieur in Cassie, just a few weeks later I got a letter suddenly from England. </sentence><sentence id="280">I didn't know a soul in England. </sentence><sentence id="281">I, but I recognized the handwriting. </sentence><sentence id="282">A letter from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="283">She told me she had arrived in in in England and and was working for a family in Leatherhead (ph) in the outskirts of London and and so I knew at that point that she was out, I was out and things looked pretty good at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your life in this French place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Well, was...we were all Jewish children, but it wasn't a Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="304">Uh our counselors and teachers were not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="305">Our benefactor wasn't Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="306">Uh we were not...we had no kosher cuisine. </sentence><sentence id="307">We had no Jewish rules and regulations. </sentence><sentence id="308">There was no Jewish instruction or anything. </sentence><sentence id="309">We led a uh totally non-Jewish assimilationist (ph) type of life. </sentence><sentence id="310">Uh and I, like I state in my memoir, my guess is that most of the kids in the transport to this home came from assimilationist uh German-Jewish homes. </sentence><sentence id="311">There were no religious people that I can remember there among the kids. </sentence><sentence id="312">We all seemed to take to this secular type of life at Cassie rather easily. </sentence><sentence id="313">We seemed to fit in very very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="314">I should also mention in in retrospect that my own parents did not have a very uh...did not run a religious home. </sentence><sentence id="315">My father came from very deeply religious parents, but he himself did not follow a deeply religi...religious life although he did go to schule (ph) on the religious holidays and participated in the services. </sentence><sentence id="316">My mother not at all, and so I remember not living in a in a really Jewish type of home. </sentence><sentence id="317">We were living a assimilationist type of secular home... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: What activities did you have there? </sentence><sentence id="334">Did you have classes? </sentence><sentence id="335">Did you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: Now we we are back again now in Cassie...our activities were...we had uh French class. </sentence><sentence id="340">We learned French. </sentence><sentence id="341">I remember very well one of our teachers was a White Russian who pounded us (laughter)...verbs and syntax. </sentence><sentence id="342">I remember very well... Madame Richter, R - 1- C -H-T-E-R, a Russian uh emigre from St. Petersburg for all I know. </sentence><sentence id="343">Maybe even a member of the uh royal courts for all I know. </sentence><sentence id="344">Uh anyway uh maybe an instructress to some of the uh Russian uh noblemen, one-time noblemen in St. Petersburg, and uh anyway Madame Richter, she really pounded French into us. </sentence><sentence id="345">I remember that to this to this day and uh we had other French teachers and uh emigre teachers and uh...how shall I put it...uh teachers and uh counselors...that's the word I'm looking for, counselors...and none of them Jewish and so, as I say, it was a secular atmosphere and we played and we had our instruction. </sentence><sentence id="346">We had our three meals a day. </sentence><sentence id="347">If there was anything lacking it was parental love. </sentence><sentence id="348">That that was missing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="360">That's an important ingredient... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Now how long were you in this area, in this camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: In this children's home...it wasn't a camp...children's home? </sentence><sentence id="373">From uh summer of "39 until the fall of France in the summer of "40. </sentence><sentence id="374">Roughly a year I was in this Cassie , children's home of Monsieur...the Count of F </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: OSE took over as this uh enterprise failed, went... mean went bankrupt. </sentence><sentence id="401">Uh prior to its bankruptcy of course, we tried to flee south, and we fled south with thousands of other people...we were on the road...as the German armies approached Paris from the northeast, we were on our way to the southeast, by coal barge and then on foot traveling south, trying to go south. </sentence><sentence id="402">Everybody, lots of Jews on the roads I would imagine, but also other Frenchmen, all, everybody heading south to evade the approaching uh Teutonic hoard. </sentence><sentence id="403">Uh in other words they had broken through the marginal (ph) line, the so-called impregnable marginal line which held on for months and months in the so-called . </sentence><sentence id="404">They had broken through and were rapidly approaching Paris, and that's when you had this helter skelter rush to the south. </sentence><sentence id="405">And we joined the rush. </sentence><sentence id="406">Our teachers and counselors told us we'll go south and hopefully we'll get there. </sentence><sentence id="407">Well, we didn't get there. </sentence><sentence id="408">We were (laughter)... </sentence></p></dialogue>
