<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="179">Now let's go back to 1938. </sentence><sentence id="180">You moved to Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Now...once you're in Berlin...let's, let's go over what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="189">I'm a little little unclear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: In Berlin my mother had me placed for those months...I don't know whether it was at the very beginning, but I know I was there for a number of months to the end in Berlin, she placed me with an orphanage called the Awerbuch (ph) Orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="193">Awerbuch. </sentence><sentence id="194">OK. </sentence><sentence id="195">And uh This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="196">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="197"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Was it basically a Jewish orphanage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Oh it was a Jewish orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="208">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="209">In in "38, Jews were not permitted to associate with Aryans. </sentence><sentence id="210">Oh no. </sentence><sentence id="211">That would have been abso...oh disaster for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="212">And uh so uh this was a Jewish children's home. </sentence><sentence id="213">I can't say that all the children there were orphans. </sentence><sentence id="214">I wasn't an orphan, yet I was accepted by Awerbuch and there were other children who had families...uh par...parents, both parents alive and they were accepted by Awerbuch. </sentence><sentence id="215">In other words, I think this Awerbuch home accepted children whether they were orphans or not, because it was felt that in this orphanage they had some kind of a refuge from what was happening on the streets of Berlin to Jews who were being beaten and trampled on and kicked upon, and with the police looking the other way if they happened to be there. </sentence><sentence id="216">The situation by 1938 was getting out of hand. </sentence><sentence id="217">And late "38 you had this infamous Night of the Breaking Kristall (ph), Kristallnacht it was called in German, and uh that's when they really went went amuck, ran amuck, the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="218">When they attacked the synagogues and set uh fire to the synagogues, smashed the Jewish shops, vandalized everything they could lay their hands on, beat adults and children when whenever they found someone because by that time adults and children above the age of ten I think or twelve, I'm not sure, had to have a Jewish star so you immediately could identify who was Jewish and who wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="219">So you were living in in a terrible uh nightmare by 1938, but us being in that home, around the clock, we were spared these outrages on Kristall...Kristallnight, which was right in late November...uh, not not...early November, early November 1938. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Shortly after that you were put on a train... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Well, uh then it was 1939. </sentence><sentence id="238">Another month more passed. </sentence><sentence id="239">Months more passed, and again I was in this Awerbuch home, with lots of other kids, Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="240">And as I say, Nazis did not invade this Awerbuch home. </sentence><sentence id="241">We found ourselves sort of living like in a, like on a plantation, sort of immunized from the outside, with the outside being a jungle, a developing jungle and we were in this Awerbuch home and uh so we were there during the early months of "39. </sentence><sentence id="242">Things uh like I've read about the pa...you know, looking back upon things, things got from bad to worse and from worse to even worse and but in the Awerbuch home things were relatively quiet and safe because we stayed in that home. </sentence><sentence id="243">We didn't set foot outside for very sensible reasons. </sentence><sentence id="244">And uh finally in the summer of "39, the transport was formed. </sentence><sentence id="245">My mother had succeeded in getting me admitted to this transport and uh that's how I, along with thirty-eight other children, one fine summer day left on this train ride to France. </sentence><sentence id="246">I should also point out that in the year 1938 to "39, my mother lived with a Jewish lady as her uh sub-tenant. </sentence><sentence id="247">In other words, she lived with a Jewish lady on Hector Strasa (ph) in Berlin, West Berlin, un the western part of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="248">At that time, of course, Berlin was a unified city and on Hector Strasa 21 my mother lived with a Jewish lady whose sub-tenant she was. </sentence><sentence id="249">I can't really tell you what work she did. </sentence><sentence id="250">I really can't tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="266">Then you were put on the transport... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="270">The kids went on the transport, said goodbye to their parents on the platform and for all of them except one, my mother, was the last time they saw their parents, because they all died in the Holocaust, these these parents. </sentence><sentence id="271">Children left for France and then we arrived in a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="272"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="273">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="274"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="275"> place called Cassie (ph) , maybe fifteen to twenty miles southeast of Paris,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="277">That's one of the tragedies of my life...at this key period of my life, suddenly in 1939 my parental link was cut off, because receiving an occasional letter from my mother in England is hardly a substitute for really living in one's home with one's parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Now how long were you in this area, in this camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: In this children's home...it wasn't a camp...children's home? </sentence><sentence id="283">From uh summer of "39 until the fall of France in the summer of "40. </sentence><sentence id="284">Roughly a year I was in this Cassie , children's home of Monsieur...the Count of . </sentence><sentence id="285"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: One night we spent on a coal barge going up the Seine, not down the Seine, but up the Seine. </sentence><sentence id="287">And if you know the Seine, it meanders like that and going up it is not only slow, it was painfully slow, extremely slow. </sentence><sentence id="288">We made very little progress and and finally during uh one fine morning, the fine morning after a night on the barge...the barge was empty and we and the other people were on that barge sleeping, or trying to sleep...and one fine morning, uh the fine morning afterwards, after having boarded it, the barge, came upon thousands or hundreds at least other barges all stuck in the sand. </sentence><sentence id="289">They were barring each other's way. </sentence><sentence id="290">There were barges and barges and barges, so we simply got out of our barge and continued the trip south on foot, carrying our our belongings like thousands of other people. </sentence><sentence id="291">Traveling on foot the road south. </sentence></p></dialogue>
