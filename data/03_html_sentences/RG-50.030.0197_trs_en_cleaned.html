<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: What do you remember about what happened to you and your family and friends when the war broke out? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Can you describe the life in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: The life in the ghetto I can better describe than other things. </sentence><sentence id="148">You know in the ghetto, there were schools for children. </sentence><sentence id="149">What we did, we didn't learn much in the schools, we were, we learned how to sing. </sentence><sentence id="150">I know all the Yiddish songs from the Vilna ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="151">I sang them. </sentence><sentence id="152">I have a record with all those songs. </sentence><sentence id="153">I have done it in London. </sentence><sentence id="154">So I knew all the songs. </sentence><sentence id="155">But you have to understand that the Jewish children did not have the right to live, so a few times in the week they came to take out the children, so the schools had bunkers, and we were given brown paper and pencils to keep quiet. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, if you can call it a school, I wouldn't call it, but it was a place where the children came, and every day less and less children came because the children were taken out of the ghetto and put in, and killed. </sentence><sentence id="157">So </sentence></p><p><sentence id="158"> less and less children were in those classrooms, if you call them classrooms. </sentence><sentence id="159">But I was  lucky, and I stayed until the end, and during some days, my mother did not send me because we had to eat and there was, and horse meat was very expensive. </sentence><sentence id="160">There was no other meat, so she would send me to sell cigarettes and matches on the street. </sentence><sentence id="161">And as I was a good looking child, people had pity on me so they bought matches and cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="162">I came home with the money. </sentence><sentence id="163">One day I remember, I got beaten up by mother because I gave the money to two children that were helping me and they were they said, they told me that they are hungry and they will help me sell the cigarettes and they were screaming, "Buy from her, the cigarettes, and not from somebody else," so we sold everything and I had money, so I gave them money. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I came home and my mamma, mother gave me on my tushie (ph) because she said, "Well, now with what will be buy the horse meat?" </sentence><sentence id="165">And the horse meat was very good. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was a delikatesse, this horse meat, and she always said if he don't have the money, we won't eat meat. </sentence><sentence id="167">So, days in the ghetto, look, it was different in the ghetto than it was in the concentration camp, (a) Because we were still stronger. </sentence><sentence id="168">We had more food, but we lived a frightened life, a very frightened life. </sentence><sentence id="169">I don't remember much laughter, much smiling. </sentence><sentence id="170">First of all, my mother was already a widow. </sentence><sentence id="171">My sister, who married in the ghetto, Zunder Leizersohn, who was one of the first partisans in Vilna ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="172">He was smuggling out the people to the outside of the chetto for the. </sentence><sentence id="173">how do vou sav. </sentence><sentence id="174">woods. </sentence><sentence id="175">and on the last trin of his he </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Can you sing one of the songs for us? </sentence><sentence id="177">One you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: I remember many songs, but I am not comfortable to sing a song which has to do like a song which I have sang Polish (ph). </sentence><sentence id="179">If I translate it: "Buy from me the cigarettes, only from me because they are not wet from rain. </sentence><sentence id="180">Buy from me and have pity on me. </sentence><sentence id="181">Polish (ph). </sentence><sentence id="182">Buy from me because I am an orphan." </sentence><sentence id="183">Those were very said songs. </sentence><sentence id="184">The songs that were, the majority of the songs of the Holocaust were written in Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="185">Vilna had the theatre, and the majority of the songs were written there, and I know them from that, and I hope that one day you will come to Israel, and there is a record which I have done when I was in London, His Master's Voice. </sentence><sentence id="186">But then, you know, I was 19 years old and I wanted to do that to remember. </sentence><sentence id="187">So I had this song and another song which I sang, and the record was____ level and _____, which was also very famous song of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="188">which was also written for the Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="189"> wash. </sentence><sentence id="190">They gave us soap. </sentence><sentence id="191">We had to wash, and we got our establishing dresses, those clothes with, how do you call them, in German stripe. </sentence><sentence id="192">That what I remember, and then the hell started. </sentence><sentence id="193">We were deported from there to Dinenwerke, and from Dinenwerke we were deported to Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="194">As I understand now by being in Washington that Stutthof was a 100,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="195">I never realized that it was such a big concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="196">And there I was with my mother and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="197">What did we do in Stutthof? </sentence><sentence id="198">There was no work in Stutthof, but they let us work. </sentence><sentence id="199">They took us from, you had to carry stones from one side to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="200">You had to fill bags of cement and carry them on your shoulder to the other corner of the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="201">Very little food, very little food. </sentence><sentence id="202">And slowly, slowly, my mother was dying from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="203">She was not even a human being anymore. </sentence><sentence id="204">She was such a skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="205">Had big eyes and such blue under her eyes. </sentence><sentence id="206">No hair. </sentence><sentence id="207">If I loved her, no. </sentence><sentence id="208">Because she was not a mother anymore. </sentence><sentence id="209">She was a skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="210">And then one day when we were lying on the floor and somebody came to say that your mother died, go and say to her goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="211">And I turned my head and I saw they slapped her to this corner where all the dead were and I said this is not my mother, and I didn't even want to say goodbye to her. </sentence><sentence id="212">And I was left with my sister. </sentence><sentence id="213">And still I had my sister. </sentence><sentence id="214">It wasn't so bad, because she was young and she warmed me up and I don't know if I missed my mother so much because now that I reason to myself, there was no much love that a child felt and I myself am a mother, and I understand in this circumstances, where you see your own children dying from hunger and crying, "Mother, I am hungry," and she couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="215">So what kind of love. </sentence><sentence id="216">Everybody was to himself, and her thoughts I don't know, but I am intelligent enough to understand today that she was suffering, seeing her two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="217">If she gave us a piece of bread, I don't even remember if she gave us her piece of bread, because the piece of bread that we got was very little. </sentence><sentence id="218">And how unselfish can a person be when he is dying from hunger to give the last piece of bread? </sentence><sentence id="219">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="220">I don't remember if I got from her a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="221">The fact is that she died from hunger and I didn't, so she might probably have given sometimes to me her piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="222">And from then on it was just slowly dying because I had typhoid, there were hours we were both sitting and taking the lice, that we all had lice all over, and the scratching all night long, the scratching that what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="223">You scratched yourself. </sentence><sentence id="224">They were biting you and you took it like this. </sentence><sentence id="225">I must saw sometimes I did get sandwich from a German. </sentence><sentence id="226">I must say that sometimes I did get a sandwich from a German. </sentence><sentence id="227">Sometime, they did have pity on me. </sentence><sentence id="228">Sometimes I got beaten up because I couldn't pick up cement, you know, but I must say to the world today, and this is what I always say and this is what I continue to say, "I don't trust the Christian world anymore." </sentence><sentence id="229">For me, I cannot separate the Germans and the Polacks and the Bulgarians from the Christian world. </sentence><sentence id="230">I cannot separate. </sentence><sentence id="231">I am Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="232">They were not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="233">It maybe will take another 50 years that I will trust the non-Jewish people, because where were they? </sentence><sentence id="234">Do you know how many times in the Warsaw ghetto I was spit on me, there were spitting because I had the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="235">Has nothing to do with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="236">How many time did I hear the word in Poland, Jude, which means Jew. </sentence><sentence id="237">And I was asked by your media people sometimes, "How do I feel to the Christians?" </sentence><sentence id="238">And I would say always, "Yah, today I am 57 years old, 58. </sentence><sentence id="239">I know that there are good people and bad people, but I will never forgive them. </sentence><sentence id="240">I'll never forgive them that they didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="241">That the world did not do anything to save us. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I don't know why  the hatred for the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="243">I have never done anything wrong in my life. </sentence><sentence id="244">Not before and not now! </sentence><sentence id="245">I feel I am the same as them. </sentence><sentence id="246">I'll never forgive that, the world. </sentence><sentence id="247">Never forgive the Americans for not doing anything and never forgive the world for standing by and seeing that I was dying. </sentence><sentence id="248">No, and my sitting here is because I do want that the people should know. </sentence><sentence id="249">I do want that the people should know that although the world is beautiful and although today they try sometimes to fight against prejudice, I as Dora Roth will never forgive the Christian world for not doing enough and not doing so that I should have not had to suffer 6 years. </sentence><sentence id="250">This is why I live therefore in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="251">I have chosen to live in Israel as a 13 year old child. </sentence><sentence id="252">When I went into the orphan home and they asked me where do you want to go, which orphan home do you want to go, to a Zionistic one or to an orphan home which stays in Poland, and I didn't understand what Zionism was, but I said I want to go to Palestine because I want to be surrounded by Jewish people and not by Christians because I did not trust them. </sentence><sentence id="253">Until today, I fight my own feelings. </sentence><sentence id="254">That's true, because I have seen good Christian people. </sentence><sentence id="255">In Israel, we have a Righteous Avenue for all the Christians that have saved the Jews, but I myself I fight this feeling because it is not good to generalize. </sentence><sentence id="256">But I suffered so much, looked to stand in front of the gas chamber and I was the third one to stand and my sister was put there and two Germans looked at me and said, "Look at this beautiful Jewish child. </sentence><sentence id="257">Rotten Jewish Child. </sentence><sentence id="258">Ferfluchte (ph) is rotten in German. </sentence><sentence id="259">She has such beautiful eyes. </sentence><sentence id="260">She shouldn't die yet. </sentence><sentence id="261">Took me out and said, "Roth, get out." </sentence><sentence id="262">And my sister, knowing where she was going, made with her hands so I shouldn't follow her. </sentence><sentence id="263">She died. </sentence><sentence id="264">And you know what, how can you even today, when you go back to that moment, how can you believe that someone has the right to save me because of my beautiful eyes. </sentence><sentence id="265">This is only what I had? </sentence><sentence id="266">Only beautiful eyes? </sentence><sentence id="267">I was a human being, a child. </sentence><sentence id="268">Hadn't done anything wrong!? </sentence><sentence id="269">So my feelings to the Christian world is not, is not the best, and probably I'll die that way. </sentence><sentence id="270">Is not that I would do any harm to anyone, and if a child would be hungry on the street, I certainly wouldn't ask him, "Are you Jewish or non-Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="271">That's not with me. </sentence><sentence id="272">I would give the child, whoever the child is. </sentence><sentence id="273">But we are speaking here, you are speaking to me because you want my feelings to, and my story to tell to people that will live after me. </sentence><sentence id="274">So this is my feelings and I am not ashamed to say it. </sentence><sentence id="275">This is how I feel. </sentence><sentence id="276">I don't have anyone except my brother who is not ready to talk about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="277">I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="278">He is just closed up to this topic. </sentence><sentence id="279">You can never ask my brother about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="280">It is taboo in his home. </sentence><sentence id="281">He doesn't even ask me how my mother died. </sentence><sentence id="282">So it's me that talks about it. </sentence><sentence id="283">My life afterwards was very good. </sentence><sentence id="284">Although I was shot by a German in the last day in Stutthof, before the war finished they got an order to go into the bararacks and to shoot everybody that is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="285">It was in the morning I got 2 bullets in my back with machine gun, but the Russians came a few hours later and saved me. </sentence><sentence id="286">I was operated four times. </sentence><sentence id="287">They couldn't find the second bullet, but they did afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="288">And I went to Palestine but in Germany, Nuremberg, I got high fever and I developed double tuberculosis, and I, all the children went, and I had to be sent to Marano, first to Grupino to a sanitorium which the Nuns had and then to a Jewish hospital and I stayed 3 years. </sentence><sentence id="289">I had a pneumothorax of my left side, to push the lungs so that it shouldn't breath on its own. </sentence><sentence id="290">And, in 1952, I came to Israel, and married a wonderful man. </sentence><sentence id="291">Unfortunately, my husband died from cancer 11 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="292">We have two  children, Alreet, she is 33, a criminologist; Donny, 27, he is, he finished the Army, he finished the studies, cinematography, communication and media. </sentence><sentence id="293">And I have 2 grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="294">I have a 7 year old grandchild and a 2 year old grandchild, and my son-in- law is a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="295">We live very nicely in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="296">I love my life. </sentence><sentence id="297">I became a fund raiser. </sentence><sentence id="298">I fund raise for the United Jewish Appeal. </sentence><sentence id="299">I am a fund raiser in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="300">I dedicated my life to the Jewish people and I do it already since 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="301">I enjoy my life. </sentence><sentence id="302">I enjoy very much living. </sentence><sentence id="303">And just to tell you that I don't hate, there was a program in Israel, they asked people that speak German to invite German children to their home. </sentence><sentence id="304">I put my name on it, and I had 2 German children in my home because I have 2 children. </sentence><sentence id="305">So, I can tell you that they week that they have been was not easy because every time we talked I thought to myself maybe their grandfather was the one to put my sister in the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="306">Yet, I have done it because I felt that with hatred, and I really mean it, you will not go far. </sentence><sentence id="307">I remember so many times hurting from the non-Jewish people, You are feshtunken Jude (ph), you stinking Jew. </sentence><sentence id="308">So when those two German children were in my home, as I ama very, very, very clean person to the extent my children were suffering, I always said, "Well, did you, did you have a shower." </sentence><sentence id="309">And they said to me, "Oh, Dora, you don't have to have a shower every day." </sentence><sentence id="310">The German children, and I said, "No, you don't" Oh, I think you do." </sentence><sentence id="311">And then I didn't want to let them know that I felt they have to understand that I am very peculiar on that, so I said to them, "But, you know, there was a time that the German people said that we stink, we Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="312">Now smell, Donny and Alreet. </sentence><sentence id="313">Do we smell differently than you?" </sentence><sentence id="314">Then I was sorry that I said it because it is not the children's fault what happened and I was very happy that they went to Germany and I am sure they were talking to their parents or if they had still grandparents that this was a normal family with normal children with no stinking and no smelling. </sentence><sentence id="315">We laughed together. </sentence><sentence id="316">We played together. </sentence><sentence id="317">I showed them Israel, and it was my way of saying, "I don't hate. </sentence><sentence id="318">I really don't." </sentence><sentence id="319">My way of saying maybe if everybody would do that in the world, there wouldn't be the hatred. </sentence><sentence id="320">That's true. </sentence><sentence id="321">But I myself am not a normal person as all of you. </sentence><sentence id="322">I look at life differently. </sentence><sentence id="323">With all that, I had a wonderful life, a wonderful 26 year marriage, I have started, I have never been in a classroom. </sentence><sentence id="324">I have 2 new university degrees. </sentence><sentence id="325">I have achieved really the maximum one can achieve in such circumstances that I have been left when I was only 17. </sentence><sentence id="326">I entered the ghetto, was 7; I came out to the free world, I was over 17 because I was also 3 years in a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="327">So I really achieved the maximum one can achieve. </sentence><sentence id="328">But in my, deep in my heart, I do, when I walk on the streets and see the smiling people, sometimes I say to myself, "Where were you?" </sentence><sentence id="329">And I carry that and my days today I enjoy things much more powerful than others. </sentence><sentence id="330">I enjoy to open the window in my garden, in my home in Israel and see the blue sky. </sentence><sentence id="331">I live in a very nice house with lots of flowers. </sentence><sentence id="332">I enjoy everything around me. </sentence><sentence id="333">I enjoy tremendously the beautiful things in life. </sentence><sentence id="334">I enjoy theatre. </sentence><sentence id="335">I go to concerts. </sentence><sentence id="336">Maybe I enjoy too much because I just want to have it, what I didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="337">People ask me what kind of a mother was I.Over protective? </sentence><sentence id="338">No. </sentence><sentence id="339">No. </sentence><sentence id="340">I said often the children said, "Mother, show a little bit more love." </sentence><sentence id="341">Because I said well, if they said I have a headache or I have temperature, I would say, "Uh, that's nothing. </sentence><sentence id="342">It will go away." </sentence><sentence id="343">I feel that I was a very good mother, but not over protective. </sentence><sentence id="344">I have never told my children my life. </sentence><sentence id="345">They didn't want to hear it. </sentence><sentence id="346">My children don't want to hear about the Holocaust, and I try to not to talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="347">I do  speak to high school children in Israel and here. </sentence><sentence id="348">But my own children would like to see a normal mother and the Israeli children don't think that the Holocaust was such a great heroism. </sentence><sentence id="349">I always thought that I was a great hero, but in Israel, no, they don't
