<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you state your name and birth date please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in Switzerland, near the city of Zurich, where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic, semi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and harmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life. </sentence><sentence id="7">My father will tell his own story. </sentence><sentence id="8">My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a long time to find this justice between people. </sentence><sentence id="9">As I said, I was born in a little farm there which they had rented. </sentence><sentence id="10">And while they were living in community there, they got to...into contact with another community which started in Germany 1920. </sentence><sentence id="11">I want to give a brief history of this community because it's important. </sentence><sentence id="12">Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in Africa, sent there by the Amold family from North America had also had this great longing in his heart to find what the way of Jesus is, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the Tennah speak all about all the time. </sentence><sentence id="13">And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat) passing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were one heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love and peace. </sentence><sentence id="14">He started in Germany 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett Arnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings. </sentence><sentence id="15">So he got into contact with my parents on the little community in Switzerland near Zurich. </sentence><sentence id="16">My father (clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in Switzerland, but rejected it. </sentence><sentence id="17">He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility for higher paid work. </sentence><sentence id="18">And on this farm they were milking cows, working in a cooperative and so on. </sentence><sentence id="19">The community in Germany called Bruderhof heard about his stand of non- violence, his refusal of military service, his going to prison for this in Switzerland, and Everett visited my father in prison and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not to give up community. </sentence><sentence id="20">The problem was that in a socialist agnostic community like my parents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and unless you find unity in community it will break apart. </sentence><sentence id="21">The tensions are too great. </sentence><sentence id="22">So in this Swiss community, they didn't find unity. </sentence><sentence id="23">The question of education, how to spend the money, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the members. </sentence><sentence id="24">Whereas in the Bruderhof, the community in Germany, there was a unity which was possible. </sentence><sentence id="25">You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity as preached by the big world churches, the Catholics and the Protestants. </sentence><sentence id="26">Well, when I was 10 months old, my parents...this community in Switzerland didn't dissolve exactly, but one couple after the other went..uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that community and joined the Bruderhof in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="27">And my parents joined that community in 1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="28">Right from the beginning...now this is what my parents tell me. </sentence><sentence id="29">Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole community, to the members, "Hitler has come to power. </sentence><sentence id="30">Now we have to decide will we reject that nationalistic spirit? </sentence><sentence id="31">Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not?And on this question, some left. </sentence><sentence id="32">My parents stayed. </sentence><sentence id="33">On...L...] had three other brothers born to  my family in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="34">Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel Meier. </sentence><sentence id="35">I do not remember any kind of persecution in Germany itself, but I remember fear. </sentence><sentence id="36">Just fear. </sentence><sentence id="37">And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that already in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the community. </sentence><sentence id="38">Later on, in 1933, there was a referendum in Germany about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German people support his policies. </sentence><sentence id="39">The members of the Bruderhof put little slips on the...on the voting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, "We respect the government, but we have a leader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him." </sentence><sentence id="40">When the...5 days after this referendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of Gestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the community. </sentence><sentence id="41">They took away books with red covers, proving that we were communists. </sentence><sentence id="42">They took away minutes of our meetings and...uh...so this went on. </sentence><sentence id="43">My father then was sent to take important documents to Switzerland out of the reach of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="44">My father was then sent with another Swiss man to the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin to find out what they had in mind with us. </sentence><sentence id="45">Everett Arnold always felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth echelon in the power structure. </sentence><sentence id="46">In Berlin, my father went to the headquarters and they got in there which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough reason to dissolve the Bruderhof right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that the Nazi state shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the beast of the -- which accordins to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the  said, "Leave right away." </sentence><sentence id="47">But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was bad. </sentence><sentence id="48">There was some sick people. </sentence><sentence id="49">So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit better and we...so they let us stay there | day longer. </sentence><sentence id="50">And then I remember how with a bundle on the shoulder, we all got...they took us into buses and they took us to a train...I believe in Fulda. </sentence><sentence id="51">I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which city. </sentence><sentence id="52">I think it was Fulda. </sentence><sentence id="53">And on the train, then they took us to the Dutch boundary and pushed us over the border. </sentence><sentence id="54">I've often wondered why my father went to the...to prison in Fulda for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the community as because they figured we were enemies of the state. </sentence><sentence id="55">But when they found out there were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from North America, they changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us. </sentence><sentence id="56">Now I remember these two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="57">And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the 60th Century in Austria, Switzerland, Moravia, which is today Czechoslovakia, began a life in community like we live it today. </sentence><sentence id="58">And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death. </sentence><sentence id="59">By the Catholics, the Protestants, the churches and the governments. </sentence><sentence id="60">They found refuge in Moravia because hundred vears before this. _ </sentence><sentence id="61">there was a sniritual awakine and  any point with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="62">We did not raise an arm in salute. </sentence><sentence id="63">We did not go along with his politics. </sentence><sentence id="64">We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends. </sentence><sentence id="65">We all...not I. | was a child. </sentence><sentence id="66">But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: How...how did it affect you at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: As I said, I was 5 years old. </sentence><sentence id="133">I was just afraid. </sentence><sentence id="134">That's all I know, and from...from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="135">At certain times, I was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="136">And other times, I was a child growing up in this community very much cared and loved for. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Do you have any memories of what was going on in the community to your community that caused this fear in you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Uh...L...I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on. </sentence><sentence id="145">And my father was away often for the community in Switzerland finding refuge for the children. </sentence><sentence id="146">Later on in 35, when the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people. </sentence><sentence id="147">His absence I feel I must have felt that as a child. </sentence><sentence id="148">This is...this is what I can say. </sentence><sentence id="149">But apart from...from this fear I'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was in...within the community, it was protected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: How did the community protect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: I...bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see this thing through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: How did your community live at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Our community lived on a farm. </sentence><sentence id="165">I'm not quite sure how many acres. </sentence><sentence id="166">They were farming. </sentence><sentence id="167">They were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all city people, professors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="168">The land was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a farm. </sentence><sentence id="169">We lived in community houses like the kibbutz do today. </sentence><sentence id="170">We had our own school and preschool and kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="171">Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community. </sentence><sentence id="172">So the influence from the outside was very low or nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Was the community self sufficient? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: It was self sufficient up to a point. </sentence><sentence id="185">We took...the community took in any kind of wayfarer...overnight gave him food and lodging. </sentence><sentence id="186">Asking them to work, which they did mostly rejected. </sentence><sentence id="187">We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad. </sentence><sentence id="188">Not because...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government tried to strangle us economically. </sentence><sentence id="189">How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at one point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products. </sentence><sentence id="190">We farmed. </sentence><sentence id="191">We had wood tannery, and we printed books. </sentence><sentence id="192">And the sale of books and tannery was part of  the cash income, where as the farm was the food. </sentence><sentence id="193">We...we never sold food. </sentence><sentence id="194">We always just grew food for our own use. </sentence><sentence id="195">And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then this took away cash and that made it difficult. </sentence><sentence id="196">There was a time in Germany when we had friends outside Germany who gave us money, which was stuck in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="197">I forget what the term is. </sentence><sentence id="198">They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of Germany, so friends gave us that money and the banks in Germany would not give us the money. </sentence><sentence id="199">So they made our life more and more diffuclt. </sentence><sentence id="200">We took in children from broken homes and needy situations, which the German government of the Weimer republic had paid for. </sentence><sentence id="201">They gave a certain amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="202">Well, this was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="203">And so here we were with the children and not getting an help either. </sentence><sentence id="204">So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and more and more so. </sentence><sentence id="205">They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to. </sentence><sentence id="206">We didn't accept that. </sentence><sentence id="207">And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came to Holland, and my personal story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: How old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: I was then 5 years. </sentence><sentence id="235">And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother of 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back and left. </sentence><sentence id="236">I'm very thankful that we could leave. </sentence><sentence id="237">Many, many others could not leave or did not leave in time. </sentence><sentence id="238">In Holland, the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly. </sentence><sentence id="239">The Mennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called anti-baptist movement, and they started in Switzerland if I remember correctly, but fled to Holland whereas the Hutterians went to Moravia and Czechoslovakia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: How many of you did they take in in Holland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: I think we were about 50 people. </sentence><sentence id="249">Let me say something. </sentence><sentence id="250">In 1933, we were about 120, but when the children had to be... had to leave Germany, we started a new community in Lichenstein. </sentence><sentence id="251">And members of the German community had to move over to Lichenstein to support this group of children. </sentence><sentence id="252">So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to hold...to maintain two communities is much more difficult than one. </sentence><sentence id="253">So when the Nazis confiscated the place, I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups. </sentence><sentence id="254">Some when to the Lichenstein community called __ Bruderhof, and the others went to England where we had already started a community because of the tense political situation in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="255">The young men who received military service in Germany escaped illegally across the boundary and went to Lichenstein. </sentence><sentence id="256">And in Lichenstein the government was very friendly to us, and gave us refuge. </sentence><sentence id="257">And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in Lichenstein, they let us know about it, and they said, "Get out of here fast. </sentence><sentence id="258">Hitler is asking about...not Hitler personally, but the German government." </sentence><sentence id="259">So when this happened we needed to find a place somewhere else to go to. </sentence><sentence id="260">And this place we found in German...in England. </sentence><sentence id="261">So as we left Germany in 1937, there was already a community in England. </sentence><sentence id="262">We tried to get into England, but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British government. </sentence><sentence id="263">So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their church buildings, in their homes. </sentence><sentence id="264">They gave us toys. </sentence><sentence id="265">They made collection amongst themselves for  toys, for blankets, for food. </sentence><sentence id="266">Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months. </sentence><sentence id="267">I remember very well we never had any roller scooters if...if that's what you call two wheels on a board and a handle. </sentence><sentence id="268">In Germany, we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but in Holland, there were nice, black topped paths and roads and we got these roller scooters with rubber tires. </sentence><sentence id="269">Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around. </sentence><sentence id="270">That was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="271">Now (clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from Holland to my father who was in prison with the Nazis in Fulda, and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother saying, "If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to come with the whole...and knock the prison down." </sentence><sentence id="272">My father received this letter in prison and everybody laughed about it. </sentence><sentence id="273">And then I remember when we traveled to England, we crossed the channel on a boat. </sentence><sentence id="274">And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly children and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from England came over to help us. </sentence><sentence id="275">And one of them was called Adolph Brown. </sentence><sentence id="276">He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite a...quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="277">And I remember crossing the Channel on a boat. </sentence><sentence id="278">Then we came to England. </sentence><sentence id="279">And in Enoland. </sentence><sentence id="280">we had started this communitv called the Bruderhof. </sentence><sentence id="281">near --T'm not  also I felt as a child living in England. </sentence><sentence id="282">We had many air raid practices, living in the 3rd floors of the manor house getting into the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="283">I remember nackages of dried banana and  student union down here in Washington for 3 months and from there traveled with another brother to Canada, South Dakota, trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="284">The government was very much in favor. </sentence><sentence id="285">My father breakfasted with Eleanor Roosevelt. </sentence><sentence id="286">She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the decision. </sentence><sentence id="287">There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a _ election campaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point. </sentence><sentence id="288">Wait til January or February after the inauguration. </sentence><sentence id="289">As I think about this, the question comes why? </sentence><sentence id="290">Well, we all have clothing like I have it now. </sentence><sentence id="291">Black clothing, beards, which in those days were very rare. </sentence><sentence id="292">We don't salute the flag. </sentence><sentence id="293">I don't salute the flag. </sentence><sentence id="294">I have respect for the government, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance. </sentence><sentence id="295">It goes against my conscience. </sentence><sentence id="296">And so all these things made the government aware that it might not be a good moment to come in. </sentence><sentence id="297">And then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there. </sentence><sentence id="298">It didn't work out. </sentence><sentence id="299">And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a place in Paraguay, South America, which is in the heart of South America. </sentence><sentence id="300">We didn't know where this place was. </sentence><sentence id="301">We looked it up on the map. </sentence><sentence id="302">Now, my father was in America. </sentence><sentence id="303">I was still in England in the community. </sentence><sentence id="304">And when we heard we could travel to South America, Paraguay, we started reading books about the place because we'd never even heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="305">And we read about snakes and jungles and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="306">And then the British government made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it possible for us to take everything we needed out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="307">And I and my family with...together with, I think, 70 of the community, we were on the first group. </sentence><sentence id="308">We left England in 1940 I think. </sentence><sentence id="309">39 or 40, I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="310">We went...traveled in buses to Burn, to Liverpool, spent the night there in a hotel which I remember from...went to the third floor. </sentence><sentence id="311">There was big beds and everything, but there was always the danger of bombers, of course, in the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the stairs and into the shelters. </sentence><sentence id="312">Nothing hannened that nicht. </sentence><sentence id="313">and I remember getting on to this shin called -- which the  from the oceanliner to the river boat, so that nobody could run away and get into Argentina. </sentence><sentence id="314">So we traveled up this river, Paraguay Parana, 4, 5 days at least. </sentence><sentence id="315">Third class. </sentence><sentence id="316">It got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter. </sentence><sentence id="317">We ended up in Ascunion, Paraguay, I think at Christmas time, which is south of the equator; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year. </sentence><sentence id="318">And then we transferred to another boat and went up the Paraguay River another 4 or 5 days til we came to --~ which is verv close to northern...to Brazil in the northern nart of Parasuav. </sentence><sentence id="319">There  0 Chaco part is all brackish water, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a rare thing. </sentence><sentence id="320">The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that the whole Chaco is a military area under the...under the government of the military institution, which we also didn't like too much. </sentence><sentence id="321">Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="322">When we were there, my...let me think. </sentence><sentence id="323">I have three brothers...four brothers live in Germany, and in England a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the third sister was born in the Chaco right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites. </sentence><sentence id="324">They had a hospital there. </sentence><sentence id="325">Our communities had brought 3 doctors who had joined the community in England, and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my mother in...in the time of delivering. </sentence><sentence id="326">Other children were born there. </sentence><sentence id="327">So I would like to say that in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to consider. </sentence><sentence id="328">Pregnant mothers, little babies. </sentence><sentence id="329">These things. </sentence><sentence id="330">I remember meeting Indians in the Chaco. </sentence><sentence id="331">They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in their hair, but they were all very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="332">And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of community life. </sentence><sentence id="333">They...if somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in the tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed. </sentence><sentence id="334">They cared for each other and helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="335">And for this reason, we felt quite close to them. </sentence><sentence id="336">My father tells me that he met some of the...of the leaders of the , of the Indian tribe, and they gave us some land. </sentence><sentence id="337">And my father asked him, "How much do we pay?" </sentence><sentence id="338">And the Indian said, "One dollar." </sentence><sentence id="339">And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="340">Shake hands on this. </sentence><sentence id="341">That's enough. </sentence><sentence id="342">We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require any legal documents." </sentence><sentence id="343">In the end, we decided not to stay in the Chaco. </sentence><sentence id="344">It was too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="345">The agriculture ___ was too bad. </sentence><sentence id="346">It was too hot, and then this military question played also into it. </sentence><sentence id="347">So then the brothers went to what is called East...east Paraguay, _ Paraguay, and there along side some other Mennonite colonies, we found a big...not an estate, a big...uh...cattle ranch. </sentence><sentence id="348">I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="349">And the man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this. </sentence><sentence id="350">And we called it...it was called Priwara, which means Spring. </sentence><sentence id="351">So when this became clear, we all got on a truck and they drove us out on the truck to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="352">We got back to kilometer 144, drove to Kasaro, got on a boat, and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a place called Protorosario, which means Rosario Port, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their horse wagons. </sentence><sentence id="353">We drove 60 kilometers inland to this new place which we had acquired. </sentence><sentence id="354">There were no buildings on this place. </sentence><sentence id="355">It was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="356">It was just wild woods...uh...plains, swamp, and while the members of the...the men of the community start to build houses, we children stayed with the Mennonites in their schools, in their homes...I think again for at least 1 or 2 months. </sentence><sentence id="357">And then finally we could all move up to the Primiwara, and start our community life again. </sentence><sentence id="358">As I think about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just about every 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="359">In Switzerland were scrapped and they went to Germany, they started from with nothing, with the Bruderhof, and the left that, went to England. </sentence><sentence id="360">So and that is a difficult thing, to start with nothing, everything 10 years is quite something. </sentence><sentence id="361">Now in Primawara, we started building houses. </sentence><sentence id="362">Uh...In that country, there is a lot of timber, so we had to get timber. </sentence><sentence id="363">You cut the trees yourself. </sentence><sentence id="364">You can't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="365">You cut the trees in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="366">You brine them out what thev call -- which is a contrantion consisting of two  1 30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the wood and then you cut it up by hand. </sentence><sentence id="367">You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="368">We built four big halls, a roof, no walls, no interior walls, and with just curtains separating the different families and there we stayed until we could build better housing. </sentence><sentence id="369">We started right away with agriculture, which is basically all we knew. </sentence><sentence id="370">We start with tannery, wooden tannery. </sentence><sentence id="371">In Paraguay, there's some wonderful woods, exotic woods, which make beautiful vases, sugar bowls, candle holders, things like that which people buy. </sentence><sentence id="372">So we went into tannery and agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="373">We started our own school there, and I remember that there were 3 woods. </sentence><sentence id="374">It's hot in Paraguay. </sentence><sentence id="375">It's sub-tropical country, and...uh...summer it goes up to 100, very humid. </sentence><sentence id="376">Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit. </sentence><sentence id="377">There was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot weather all the time...to this cold weather. </sentence><sentence id="378">So in this place called Priawara, there were three wood islands. </sentence><sentence id="379">The first one...the first one we cleared and built a dining room, communal kitchen and a store house. </sentence><sentence id="380">And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200 yards away, was the preschool and the

all the children were educated. </sentence><sentence id="381">We had our own teachers which we always wanted. </sentence><sentence id="382">We...we feel that in this community life, we want to have certain values. </sentence><sentence id="383">Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we know that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a school to be...uh....wholeheartedly going in one direction. </sentence><sentence id="384">So this we had our own school with our own teachers. </sentence><sentence id="385">It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a great...a great thing already. </sentence><sentence id="386">In Paraguay we stayed til 1960. </sentence><sentence id="387">I lived there for 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="388">I also lived part of my life in Uruguay, and also a country in South America, Montediveo.(Clearing throat) While we were in Paraguay, there were some revolutions. </sentence><sentence id="389">There're always revolutions somewhere going on. </sentence><sentence id="390">And we were on the...on the battle line...uh...different parties winning and losing. </sentence><sentence id="391">They always asked us to help them supply wagons with horses to carry the ammunition and the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="392">We always refused this. </sentence><sentence id="393">If a soldier's hungry, we give him food. </sentence><sentence id="394">If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military objectives in any way. </sentence><sentence id="395">And this was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="396">My father, again, was...he had to meet these officers and they threatened to kill him more than once by

( </sentence><sentence id="603">Laughing) Even in the State-run schools, they hardly had any...any...uh...notebooks. </sentence><sentence id="604">No textbooks, so the teacher dictated. </sentence><sentence id="605">I remember writing everything down as fast I could. </sentence><sentence id="606">They speak very fast, and then I went home. </sentence><sentence id="607">He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the community who was studying to be a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="608">He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it later. </sentence><sentence id="609">And I stayed in this community in the...the Bruderhof house as we call it for quite a number of years trying to get this education. </sentence><sentence id="610">This Bruderhof served a number of functions. </sentence><sentence id="611">In Paraguay you can't just.. uh...order something and UPS brings it. </sentence><sentence id="612">It doesn't work like that. </sentence><sentence id="613">It doesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the capitol and then you had to organize transport from the capitol to the colony. </sentence><sentence id="614">And especially in the beginning years, we had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat. </sentence><sentence id="615">Everything had to be bought in the capitol and then transported to the colony. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: So this house which we had in..uh...in Ascunion, the capitol, was a building which we rented and later bought. </sentence><sentence id="685">And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or going to secondary school, high school and maybe could be compared to high school. </sentence><sentence id="686">We also had some people there. </sentence><sentence id="687">We had a...store, where we sold tanned goods from the...from the community in the country. </sentence><sentence id="688">And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood. </sentence><sentence id="689">Mainly tourists, Americans who came through brought these. </sentence><sentence id="690">We also made there orange juice, concentrated orange juice and sold it there. </sentence><sentence id="691">And this capitol also, all the business was transacted. </sentence><sentence id="692">As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="693">Cloth. </sentence><sentence id="694">All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then transported up to this colony which we had. </sentence><sentence id="695">To get from Ascunion to the colony took about 2 days...a day, a night and a day. </sentence><sentence id="696">One night traveling with a little river boat, maybe...yeah..to and then a dav""s travel with a horse wagon from the nort to the colonv...to the  5 the country, and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own salvation. </sentence><sentence id="697">That is not our purpose. </sentence><sentence id="698">Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in peace and justice and harmony together. </sentence><sentence id="699">That this is possible right now. </sentence><sentence id="700">And we are... am not better than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="701">I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the question is where do I call it...where do I say stop? </sentence><sentence id="702">And living in community, having this goal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps. </sentence><sentence id="703">This kind of love is what actually every human being longs for. </sentence><sentence id="704">And so we did never wanted to live for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="705">We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and brotherhood is possible. </sentence><sentence id="706">To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to Atheists, it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="707">To bums to rich men. </sentence><sentence id="708">And so when these people came from North America, they asked many questions. </sentence><sentence id="709">Why you do this? </sentence><sentence id="710">Why you this? </sentence><sentence id="711">And this is good for us. </sentence><sentence id="712">We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are still true to what we want to do. </sentence><sentence id="713">And so this was good. </sentence><sentence id="714">In 1954, I think, well we had people then in the States traveling all the time, meeting with interested people. </sentence><sentence id="715">There was an intentional community movement in the United States in the 50s, and so we visited these people and some wanted to join and some said, "You're too far away in Paraguay. </sentence><sentence id="716">Why don't you start a community up here?" </sentence><sentence id="717">So in 1954, we started a community in New York State near...between Kingston and Poughkeepsie. </sentence><sentence id="718">There's a little town called Roseton, near Newport, and there we bought some land and some houses and started Hutterian Bruderhof where people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so this was very good. ( </sentence><sentence id="719">Clearing throat) Now back to Paraguay. </sentence><sentence id="720">I went to school and then I went to University. </sentence><sentence id="721">I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician. </sentence><sentence id="722">And as I said, there were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine, there was a big upheaval in the university and South American altogether and also in Paraguay. </sentence><sentence id="723">The students are active social movement. </sentence><sentence id="724">They...the young people protest injustice, the political oppression. </sentence><sentence id="725">And so the students were always in a... in a revolt, you know, ina stir, in a commotion, asking for justice. </sentence><sentence id="726">But one day the police came and closed the university down because the government didn't like this social upheaval. </sentence><sentence id="727">They called it communists. </sentence><sentence id="728">And...uh...so the closed the university down and the Brother decided that I should go to Montediveo in Uruguay to continue with the studies. </sentence><sentence id="729">And so I went down there and finished up later on. </sentence><sentence id="730">And it was in Uruguay, the little community called there called Eldorado, about 10 miles out of Montediveo, where the...where we started another little community. </sentence><sentence id="731">It started just with a few people working in a dairy farm and then we felt it's better not to be employed, but really start a community so we did that. </sentence><sentence id="732">We bought, I think, maybe 20, 30 acres with some housing on it. </sentence><sentence id="733">We sent families down there. </sentence><sentence id="734">Because we wanted to be near..near a place where people...where we could talk to people and meet people. </sentence><sentence id="735">We didn't want to live for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="736">And also in Ascunion, we didn't find enough places for the young people to be educated in different things, and so this community in Elarado, near Montediveo, Uruguay was supposed to be another center for young people to go to and train. </sentence><sentence id="737">Maybe I should say at this point that in our community we, the children born into the community are not members. </sentence><sentence id="738">There's no automatic birthright membership. </sentence><sentence id="739">The young people they are born there. </sentence><sentence id="740">They grow up and we try to give them as good education as we can which varies. </sentence><sentence id="741">In Paraguay it was very limited. </sentence><sentence id="742">Here in the States, we're very grateful for the education into high school which is free of charge. </sentence><sentence id="743">But this wasn't so in  6 Paraguay, so...so these children as they grow up, they...they get educated. </sentence><sentence id="744">They get to know what this community life is all about, but then we're very interested to let them experience how other people live so they can come to a decision seeing both sides of the picture, so to say, and come to a personal decision. </sentence><sentence id="745">If you want to join in the Bruderhof, it cannot be for..for the parents" sake. </sentence><sentence id="746">It cannot be for brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="747">It can't be for a good life which we now have. </sentence><sentence id="748">We have a good life now. </sentence><sentence id="749">It can't be for any kind of...uh...comfort. </sentence><sentence id="750">It can only be for the sake to show the people can live together. </sentence><sentence id="751">And we found that if we do what Jesus said, it happens. </sentence><sentence id="752">Now, I want to go back to the time in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="753">When my father and I and a group of others visited Israel in 1985, we knew that the question of the Holocaust wold come up and there our Jewish friends asked, "What do you think of the Holocaust?" </sentence><sentence id="754">And my father answered after a moment of silence...I was there. </sentence><sentence id="755">I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="756">He said, "The Holocaust is a judgment on the Christians. </sentence><sentence id="757">Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing were nominal Christians. </sentence><sentence id="758">Catholics and Protestants. </sentence><sentence id="759">And I know that Jesus did not say kill your enemy. </sentence><sentence id="760">He didn't even say kill the handicapped. </sentence><sentence id="761">He didn't say kill the imbecile, the mentally handicapped. </sentence><sentence id="762">He said love your fellowman which is told in the Tennah by God himself. </sentence><sentence id="763">So this...this love is what we need, and so therefore we said in Israel and kibbutz Hasara in 85, "It is a judgment on the Christians because they did not do what they said they were." ( </sentence><sentence id="764">Clearing throat) And then my father went on to say, "But if we Christians and you Jews don't take a lesson, don't learn from this Holocaust experience, the Holocaust will come that takes all of us." </sentence><sentence id="765">And I think the present day world situation is just about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="851">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="852">I went back in 88 once. </sentence><sentence id="853">We had gone again to Israel, invited by the kibbutz movement to visit them. </sentence><sentence id="854">We stayed there 3 weeks and then back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="855">And I remember going to the train station there and I had all these memories coming back from 1937. ( </sentence><sentence id="856">Crying) So I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="857">We have a little...I hope it doesn't matter if I skip around a bit. </sentence><sentence id="858">So this was the answer my father gave about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="859">Now for the last few...since | year we have started a communitv in Germany again in Bernba. </sentence><sentence id="860">near Frankfort. </sentence><sentence id="861">in the _ And we went  7 life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
