<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="36">A: In 1925, June 16th. </sentence><sentence id="37">It was a very good time of the year. </sentence><sentence id="38">I like it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: Where were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: In Vienna, right in the middle of town we lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: So what was your childhood like? </sentence><sentence id="47">Tell me your earliest memories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Well, there was my father and my mother and my older brother who was five years older. </sentence><sentence id="51">And then a stepbrother, Paul, who was much order, 17 years older, who really didn't live with us, but he was part of the family. </sentence><sentence id="52">And my father was much older than my mother. </sentence><sentence id="53">My father was 18 years older than my mother, and so he always seemed more like my grandfather to me. </sentence><sentence id="54">And my mother was 35 when I was born, so compared to how I felt at 35 or see other people being 35 now, she seemed much older, too. </sentence><sentence id="55">And we lived in an apartment right in the middle of the city. </sentence><sentence id="56">And so my father was a lawyer, an attorney, and he had his office -- I think we were on the fourth floor or sixth floor -- I'm not sure -- of this building. </sentence><sentence id="57">And he had an office on the mezzanine of that same floor, so he would always come home for lunch at 1:00 o'clock, around the time that I came home from school. </sentence><sentence id="58">And that was our main meal at that time. </sentence><sentence id="59">And in those days, children did not go out of the apartment by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="60">There was always somebody with me, a Fraulein type. </sentence><sentence id="61">And I was taken everywhere, to the park and ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="62">My father took me ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="63">And there was no such thing as really playing in the neighborhood on the street. </sentence><sentence id="64">But we did take summer vacations, lengthy summer vacations to either a different part of Austria or to the beach in northern Italy. </sentence><sentence id="65">And so then I think we were able to play freely. </sentence><sentence id="66">But during the year, we were pretty constricted. </sentence><sentence id="67">My brother and I were not too close. </sentence><sentence id="68">The ideas in those days made a lot of difference. </sentence><sentence id="69">And he was an ardent boy scout and he thought all of my interests were silly and superficial. </sentence><sentence id="70">But whenever I was sick -- and I seemed to have been sick a good deal in those days with colds and flu and so forth - - he would play games and especially chess with me. </sentence><sentence id="71">And I just recently picked it up again. </sentence><sentence id="72">So that's been fun. </sentence><sentence id="73">And so I went to elementary school. </sentence><sentence id="74">And I don't remember much about it except for a gym teacher who was very -- who looked more like a snowman or a snowwoman. </sentence><sentence id="75">She was built that way. </sentence><sentence id="76">And I never liked gym. </sentence><sentence id="77">So I think that was four grades or five grades. </sentence><sentence id="78">And then I went to another school, a private school. </sentence><sentence id="79">I believe it was a private school called Luithlen, L-U-I-T-H-L-E-N. And somehow, even though Jewish children were not allowed to go to school after awhile when Hitler came, I think I remained in school there somehow until I could leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: So the schools that you attended, were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="114">Definitely. </sentence><sentence id="115">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="116">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="117">And then in this middle school we had religion classes, and they were done with release time. </sentence><sentence id="118">In other words, the Protestant children would go one place for instruction and the Catholic children to another and the Jewish children to another. </sentence><sentence id="119">And that's when I began to go to synagogue a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="120">My parents really didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="121">They would go to their parents or my father's parents in Czechoslovakia occasionally over the -- the Yom Kippur, over the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="122">But otherwise, no, there wasn't much celebration of holidays. </sentence><sentence id="123">And in fact, we had a Christmas tree for many years until I made my mother buy a menorah when I was old enough to go to synagogue. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="124">And then when I was a tween or an early teenager, we would go to children's services, the young people's services at the main synagogue in Vienn </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: But I must have went -- I think I went mostly for the boys who also attended and then we could all go skating afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="126">So I didn't take all that very seriously at that time. </sentence><sentence id="127">My earliest memory of there being something wrong politically or worrying about what's going to happen to Jewish people was I think in 1934 when I remember going on vacation by car with my parents to a place called Bad Gastein, a resort-type thing. </sentence><sentence id="128">And we got there the evening, at night when it was dark. </sentence><sentence id="129">And the village was in the valley, and we came down from the mountain or hill or something. </sentence><sentence id="130">And all the windows in the town, in the village, were lit up and there were candles in the window. </sentence><sentence id="131">And apparently a chancellor from Austria, and his name was Dollfuss, had died. </sentence><sentence id="132">I don't know whether he died or was killed. </sentence><sentence id="133">But he was known to be very sympathetic to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="134">And so it was eerie that he was so mourned or so celebrated. </sentence><sentence id="135">And I guess those lights are something I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="136">And also because my father was older he would always worry about whether he'd die before my mother and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="137">And he worried a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="138">My mother was a worrywart, too. </sentence><sentence id="139">And I've become a worrywart as well. </sentence><sentence id="140">And I married one. </sentence><sentence id="141">I married one, too. </sentence><sentence id="142">But my father was always worried about the times or money or clients or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="143">And he was very serious. </sentence><sentence id="144">He was quite an intellectual person. </sentence><sentence id="145">He was always reading. </sentence><sentence id="146">So there was really very little game playing in our house except occasionally my brother and I. And the only sport was ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="147">And then I went to gymnastic classes as a little girl next door. </sentence><sentence id="148">And swimming, I think. </sentence><sentence id="149">So somehow when Hitler came to Austria and was practically invited into Austria, somehow it wasn't a surprise because we had always lived with that kind of fear. </sentence><sentence id="150">So I don't know what else I can tell you. </sentence><sentence id="151">I had a few good friends, but the friends I had went to the same school, but they lived other places. </sentence><sentence id="152">So it wasn't like you could get together after school. </sentence><sentence id="153">You had to make a play date or something. </sentence><sentence id="154">A little older than a play date. </sentence><sentence id="155">And one friend, Francie, did come to New York and I did see her once or twice in New York. </sentence><sentence id="156">Oh, and another friend, Eva Schiffer. </sentence><sentence id="157">She was a real intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="158">My father adored her. </sentence><sentence id="159">And she lived around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="160">And my grades were always compared to hers. </sentence><sentence id="161">And I think she's a retired professor at Amherst or Andover now, and we are out of touch, although we were back in touch in New York. </sentence><sentence id="162">And then one friend went to South America, to Argentina, and we completely lost touch. </sentence><sentence id="163">And a boy I liked whet to Uruguay. </sentence><sentence id="164">So everybody was spread out. </sentence><sentence id="165">There was no cohesiveness. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I think even now I envy some of my friends who grew up in one town and had their high school crowd and go to reunions and all these memories. </sentence><sentence id="167">So I don't have that. </sentence><sentence id="168">So I don't know what else should I tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: So do you remember feeling -- you didn't -- did you recognize or celebrate any Jewish holidays in your home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Well, we then eventually bought a menorah. </sentence><sentence id="217">I don't remember celebrating Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="218">No, really, I don't think we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Were a lot of your friends Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Yeah, they were all Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: So growing up did you experience any anti-Semitism in your -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Not immediately. </sentence><sentence id="228">Not among my friends, I didn't, because I guess I just didn't -- wasn't open to that because there was nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="229">And we had non-Jewish help, Frauleins and so forth, a housekeeper. </sentence><sentence id="230">But I didn't experience anything from them. </sentence><sentence id="231">And </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="237"> of course, they had to leave as soon as Hitler came. </sentence><sentence id="238">Other people in my life, my gym teacher, my aunt was my piano teacher. </sentence><sentence id="239">And they were all Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="240">But we talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="241">And my father would talk about the things that Hitler did. </sentence><sentence id="242">And we would -- this is before concentration camps, but we were aware of the Nuremburg laws and of what happens, and you know, and how you have to -- how you can't work any more and you can't have any non-Jewish help. </sentence><sentence id="243">My father had to get rid of his secretary. </sentence><sentence id="244">He had one secretary who was with him for 30 years or something. </sentence><sentence id="245">But personally, I can't say I experienced it. </sentence><sentence id="246">My main experience was years later when I visited Vienna the first time, I think, in "69. </sentence><sentence id="247">Do you want to hear that story? </sentence><sentence id="248">Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Uh-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: With my husband. </sentence><sentence id="264">And since he didn't speak German, we couldn't go to the theater, but we went to a lot of operas. </sentence><sentence id="265">And so one night we went to the oper </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: And we also stayed at a hotel right across from the oper </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: We didn't have time to eat beforehand, so we went to a restaurant nearby there afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I think generally in there when a place is crowded, they don't have you necessarily wait. </sentence><sentence id="269">They seat you with somebody. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="270">And so we were seated with this man who was a bit older than I am, maybe 10, 15 years older than I was at the time. </sentence><sentence id="271">Started talking somehow. </sentence><sentence id="272">And I spoke a little broken German. </sentence><sentence id="273">And he said, "Oh, how come your German is so good?" </sentence><sentence id="274">or something. </sentence><sentence id="275">And I said, "Well, I'm glad you think it's good." </sentence><sentence id="276">I said, "I used to live here." </sentence><sentence id="277">And he said, "Oh?" </sentence><sentence id="278">And I said, "Well, I left in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="279">I had to leave when Hitler came to Austri </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A:" And so he said, "Oh," and then he fell silent. </sentence><sentence id="281">Oh, and he had been some kind of movie producer or something. </sentence><sentence id="282">Anyway, he became silent and five minutes later he got up. </sentence><sentence id="283">And it felt very chilly. </sentence><sentence id="284">The Austrians were never overly friendly, and they were more Nazis than the Germans were, I think. </sentence><sentence id="285">So again, it was not surprising, but at the same time it was extremely uncomfortable. </sentence><sentence id="286">And just such a tiny little incident that I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="287">So I think if I had experienced more incidents and more graphic incidents, I would have remembered. </sentence><sentence id="288">But I just did not happen to be with people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: How did the Nuremburg laws or I guess the Nazi rise to power, how did it affect you and your family at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Well, my father I think not being able to have anybody working for you who is even partially Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="301">So that was the big thing. </sentence><sentence id="302">And that meant that -- you know, we had household help, a maid. </sentence><sentence id="303">And everybody was very loyal and friendly and they suddenly had to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="304">For my father, no help in the office, and the office was shrinking. </sentence><sentence id="305">He was upset about that. </sentence><sentence id="306">And so there wasn't anybody in my family, whether -- we were just Jewish, so that wasn't in question, whether we had a grandfather or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="307">So I think that was the main thing. </sentence><sentence id="308">What else was in there? </sentence><sentence id="309">I forgot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: You said that your father talked about the things that Hitler was doing. </sentence><sentence id="321">Were you aware of the Naziism and what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Yeah, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="325">As I look back, we were very politically aware as children or teenagers. </sentence><sentence id="326">Much more so than I later found kids either in England or America being. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="327">Yeah, we were. </sentence><sentence id="328">And then, of course, when the annexation started. </sentence><sentence id="329">And my mother's half-sister lived, in Prague, her husband, and he was -- I mean, they were very well- situated. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was the president of a bank. </sentence><sentence id="331">And they refused to leave. </sentence><sentence id="332">I mean, this whole business over what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="333">In fact, I had an uncle and an aunt in Vienn </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: And he was a government employee. </sentence><sentence id="335">And I guess he was half Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="336">He thought it would never happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="337">And they didn't leave, and they perished in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="338">My aunt and uncle in Czechoslovakia left in time. </sentence><sentence id="339">Their children made them leave just in time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Do you recall -- What are your memories of Hitler coming to power in Austria? </sentence><sentence id="347">Do you recall when the change happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="351">I remember that something -- he immediately took over the radio station, the one means of communication. </sentence><sentence id="352">And I remember -- of course there were a lot of Nazi soldiers around town, and they were marching in the Ringstrasse. </sentence><sentence id="353">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="354">And then real fear settled in because we then -- well, it was after Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="355">And I guess I heard about Kristallnacht later. </sentence><sentence id="356">I didn't see any of those terrible things happening on the street. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="357">But then we began to be really afraid. </sentence><sentence id="358">The person in power was the superintendent of the apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="359">And it was a question of whether he was going to be our friend or foe. </sentence><sentence id="360">And everything depended on him. </sentence><sentence id="361">And so I think we were all in fear that he would say yes, such and such, the Grosses living there, Jewish, and go take them. </sentence><sentence id="362">But fortunately that never happened. </sentence><sentence id="363">My brother actually left the year before. </sentence><sentence id="364">He left soon after Hitler came to power, and he went tom Germany and then to Denmark and later on to South America, to Bolivi </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: So I was the only one left at home. </sentence><sentence id="366">And my stepbrother had married. </sentence><sentence id="367">And he was -- my father's first wife was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="368">So my stepbrother for certain didn't grow up Jewish, but he didn't grow up with anything else either, just nondenominational. </sentence><sentence id="369">And he married a Jewish woman, one whose sister and brother-in- law actually emigrated to Palestine, to Israel then. </sentence><sentence id="370">But they left. </sentence><sentence id="371">His biological mother was related to a very prominent Czech shoe manufacturer. </sentence><sentence id="372">And they were willing to help them get out, but only if he -- if they both converted and didn't ever acknowledge their Jewish family any more, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="373">But everybody had to survive in those days. </sentence><sentence id="374">That's what they had to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Do you recall -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: You go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: -- when the decision was made that you would leave on the Kindertransport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: Well, I think it was somehow made early in the year. </sentence><sentence id="390">Early "39, it must have been. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="391">But the understanding -- all this was, it didn't seem like such a tragic thing because the understanding always was that my parents would come to England two months later. </sentence><sentence id="392">And then after I left the British quarter was closed so they couldn't come. </sentence><sentence id="393">And they very fortunately were able to get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="394">And my father subsequently died here two years later, so I never did see him again. </sentence><sentence id="395">But the good-byes were not that terrible because it was like, "So long. </sentence><sentence id="396">I'm going to see you in a couple of months." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: What kind of preparation went into it? </sentence><sentence id="398">I mean, did you pack? </sentence><sentence id="399">Did your mother do it for you? </sentence><sentence id="400">What was the feeling in your home at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: Well, ironically, it was kind of up. </sentence><sentence id="402">We bought clothes and packed clothes. </sentence><sentence id="403">You're going to need this and you're going to need that. </sentence><sentence id="404">And so it was a rather positive preparation. </sentence><sentence id="405">Kind of naive, really, when you think about it. </sentence><sentence id="406">So I did not understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: How old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Iwas 13 by then. </sentence><sentence id="416">I understood, but I didn't expect a long separation. </sentence><sentence id="417">And then my relationship with my father, while it had always been good, you know, he was really overwhelmed by anxiety and worry. </sentence><sentence id="418">And I remember him being very short and angry with me a lot of the time. </sentence><sentence id="419">And so I do remember the feeling of, oh, good, I can get out of here kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="420">And he did not come to the train station with me. </sentence><sentence id="421">My mother sent me off. </sentence><sentence id="422">In retrospect, it might just have been too hard for him to come. </sentence><sentence id="423">But it was a way also of getting distance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: What are your memories of saying good-bye to your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="435">A: Well, again, it was a really warm and hugging good-bye, but it wasn't terribly sad because it was either denial or it was "I'm going to see you in a couple of months." </sentence><sentence id="436">So from what I've been reading -- and I just don't remember other kids and their parents in the train station. </sentence><sentence id="437">It was terrible for some kids. </sentence><sentence id="438">And then there's that story in that one movie about the father pulling the daughter out of the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="439">Q: "Into the Arms of Strangers." </sentence><sentence id="440">I just watched it yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="441">I recall that story when he pulled her out of the train. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="442">A: Did you read the book? </sentence><sentence id="443">It's a very readable, a nice book, very good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: What are your memories of the journey to England? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: Well, foggy. </sentence><sentence id="449">Just sitting with a lot of kids on a train and wearing my name tag. </sentence><sentence id="450">Some people remember their number. </sentence><sentence id="451">I don't remember my number. </sentence><sentence id="452">And then some -- When we got to the -- what was it? </sentence><sentence id="453">The German -- the German border I don't remember so much. </sentence><sentence id="454">There wasn't a border, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="455">But then the German-Dutch border was -- there were border guards who came on board, and it was scary. </sentence><sentence id="456">And we thought maybe we wouldn't get through or something. </sentence><sentence id="457">But we did. </sentence><sentence id="458">And somehow -- I remember most of this being at night, but I think maybe we did travel at night. </sentence><sentence id="459">People say when you get old your long-term memory is very good, but for me my short- or my long-term isn't very good. </sentence><sentence id="460">And so I remember that anxiety and those guards walking through and being very relieved afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="461">And so then we got to the Hague of Holland and got onto their boat, ship. </sentence><sentence id="462">And I was very seasick so I don't remember anything good about that. </sentence><sentence id="463">And then when I got there, some cousins of my mother's -- I don't remember whether they met me in -- what's the town that we landed in? </sentence><sentence id="464">Do you know? </sentence><sentence id="465">When we went to London. </sentence><sentence id="466">Anyway, when I got off the whole Kindertransport, they were there. </sentence><sentence id="467">And I stayed with them for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="468">And then I met my foster parents, who had been arranged for by my cousin, in a town called Cheltenham, which was west of London. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="491">Q: I've heard of it before. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: Yes, you're right. </sentence><sentence id="725">I think she was in different foster homes. </sentence><sentence id="726">So you know, I think that -- and I probably had a tendency to be a good girl anyway. </sentence><sentence id="727">Those were my father's expectations. </sentence><sentence id="728">It was very strict. </sentence><sentence id="729">And there was that. </sentence><sentence id="730">And then they didn't really get it. </sentence><sentence id="731">I remember my foster mother saying, when I was about 16, she said -- she asked me whether I wouldn't want to convert. </sentence><sentence id="732">And I said -- she said, "Because then you wouldn't have any trouble and then all your problems were because you were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="733">If there weren't any Jewish people, there wouldn't be any problems." </sentence><sentence id="734">It was something naive like that. </sentence><sentence id="735">It wasn't anti Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="736">It was naive, I think. </sentence><sentence id="737">And I was very hurt and angry about that. </sentence><sentence id="738">And I remember that being the first and, I think, the only time I must admit that I fasted on Yom Kippur, just to prove that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="739">Not that they ever knew about it or cared, but I felt better for doing that. </sentence><sentence id="740">And I think I had to prove to myself. </sentence><sentence id="741">But basically it was that I think they had led a rather insulated life and didn't understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="760">Q: There weren't any other Jewish people in the community? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="762">A: Well, eventually, when I was 16 I graduated,high school and I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="763">I found that there wasmfree Austria organization or something and that they were young people who eventually intended to go back to Austri </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="765">And they were all Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="766">It was kind of a group leader, a woman and her husband. </sentence><sentence id="767">They were also Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="768">Their name was Leichner. </sentence><sentence id="769">And so then I started associating with Jewish kids, and that became rather insular. </sentence><sentence id="770">That was a rather left-wing group. </sentence><sentence id="771">We read Karl Marx and all kinds of discussions and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="772">But it felt more like I belonged than the rest of my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="800">Q: What was it like leaving your foster family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="802">A: Well, I had left earlier, actually. </sentence><sentence id="803">I had left probably a year or two before I came to the States because I got -- my second job was -- my first job was at an egg grading    station. </sentence><sentence id="804">And my second job was for the Signal Corps because the Signal Corps had come to the -- the U.S. Signal Corps, because they had come to Britain and made their headquarters in Cheltenham at the time. </sentence><sentence id="805">And since my foster mother made me take typing and shorthand, when I graduated high school, I got a job, a secretarial job there. </sentence><sentence id="806">And I made quite a few friends. </sentence><sentence id="807">And when those guys left to go to London to go to the Grosvenor House, I went with. </sentence><sentence id="808">And I more or less said good-bye to them at that time. </sentence><sentence id="809">And that was probably in the spring of "44. </sentence><sentence id="810">I think I was in London maybe six months. </sentence><sentence id="811">I got an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="812">So I said good-bye at that time. </sentence><sentence id="813">And then my husband and I went back one time many years later. </sentence><sentence id="814">And my foster father had died. </sentence><sentence id="815">And she was living in a nursing home and had pretty advanced Alzheimer's so that she didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="816">But she eventually did. </sentence><sentence id="817">My husband, he was very good with her, and he was able to somehow refresh her memory. </sentence><sentence id="818">Either that or she pretended. </sentence><sentence id="819">And also when I came to this country, one of the first things I did was her daughter and husband lived in Alexandria here. </sentence><sentence id="820">And I went down to see them and meet them, and we corresponded. </sentence><sentence id="821">We sent Christmas letters to each other until she died last year. </sentence><sentence id="822">So that was what, 40, 50 years or something. </sentence><sentence id="823">So she just died recently. </sentence><sentence id="824">She was 10 years older than I was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="849">Q: So you were able to emigrate to America in 1944? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: How long had you been -- was it like four -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="880">A: I think five years, five and a half. </sentence><sentence id="881">It was quite a while. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="882">Q: It took some adjusting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="884">A: Yeah, it did take some adjusting. </sentence><sentence id="885">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="886">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="887">And then I had a kind of mentor, a friend of my father's who was also a lawyer and who worked for a big company in New York. </sentence><sentence id="888">And they were friends of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="889">And so when he heard that I was coming he said he would get me a job. </sentence><sentence id="890">And he immediately got me a secretarial job at this company on 6th Avenue, Rockefeller Center. </sentence><sentence id="891">And he said, "Well, of course you'll go to college. </sentence><sentence id="892">"Because there had never been any talk of -- when you graduate high school 16 and there is no money, you don't talk about going to college. </sentence><sentence id="893">I don't think I ever thought further than a day ahead of what I was going to do or what I was going to be or anything. </sentence><sentence id="894">It was all survival. </sentence><sentence id="895">So he got me this job and he said, "Of course you'll go to college." </sentence><sentence id="896">I said, "Oh, I will?" </sentence><sentence id="897">And he referred me to the Office for International Education. </sentence><sentence id="898">And I could have one of two scholarships, one to the University of Miami in Ohio and one at the University of Michigan. </sentence><sentence id="899">Somehow I picked the University of Michigan and had a room- and-board scholarship at a Jewish sorority and an academic scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="900">So a year later I - - oh, and I had to take a couple of courses to catch up in American history, which of course I needed, and intermediate algebra, of which I was very weak. </sentence><sentence id="901">And so I came to Ann Arbor. </sentence><sentence id="902">The person I admired most there is my mother, that she was able to let me go again and said she wanted to do this, that she wanted me to do this. </sentence><sentence id="903">Because I think if she had been, "Oh, poor me, you're leaving me" kind of thing, I probably wouldn't have gone. </sentence><sentence id="904">So that was good. </sentence><sentence id="905">And so that was another adjustment. </sentence><sentence id="906">It's been one after the other. </sentence><sentence id="907">And then I had this room-and-board scholarship at this Jewish sorority. </sentence><sentence id="908">So I was not a member, not that I ever wanted to be in a sorority. </sentence><sentence id="909">But nevertheless, I had a room of my own. </sentence><sentence id="910">And I made a couple of good friends there. </sentence><sentence id="911">But nevertheless, I was, again, on the outside, even though everybody was Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
