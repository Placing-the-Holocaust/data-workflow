<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Was Agnes. </sentence><sentence id="82">Agnes Rebunska. </sentence><sentence id="83">And she woke me up and I remember this...this actually [is] one of the first recollections that I have about this time. </sentence><sentence id="84">She just sent me out of the house in this little town named Piestany. </sentence><sentence id="85">And she pointed the direction to me, the neighboring village where her parents lived. </sentence><sentence id="86">I basically knew that village because she would take me there over the weekends. </sentence><sentence id="87">So I ran to this village. </sentence><sentence id="88">On the road somebody picked me up on a bicycle, brought me to her parents, and from there on based on that authorization that my father wrote just before he was taken to Majdanek I was given to this family who had these exemptions, the yellow/white exemptions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Feelings I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="102">I remember thoughts that it seemed to me too far. </sentence><sentence id="103">The village seemed to me too far, and that I was very relieved when one of the young men from the village who was on his way either to school or to a job in that small town took me on the bicycle, turned around, brought me to the village and handed me over to the parents. </sentence><sentence id="104">I recall much better when I was then brought to this family. </sentence><sentence id="105">The name was Pollack. </sentence><sentence id="106">They knew my father. </sentence><sentence id="107">And when I arrived there they had a 19 year old son and they asked me This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="108">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="109"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to feel at home. </sentence><sentence id="110">This will be my home. </sentence><sentence id="111">Incidentally, from this family's balcony I was watching when my father left for the railroad station to report to the labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="112">They told him that he will go to a small town named Novaki, which was just...I don't know, maybe 25 miles from Piestany. </sentence><sentence id="113">And I also recall that people were telling him, "Mr. Reiss, don't go. </sentence><sentence id="114">You are going to be taken somewhere else, not to a labor camp." </sentence><sentence id="115">And he just dismissed this and I remember standing on the balcony and waving to him. </sentence><sentence id="116">It was the last time I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="117">And after that I had to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="118">I was a first grader in the Jewish school which was just around the corner from this family's house so that my last recollection of seeing my father... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: You had no notion that that was the last time you would see your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="143">No. </sentence><sentence id="144">Neither did my father, because my father wrote a card which I have at home. </sentence><sentence id="145">I have it framed at home, smuggled it out of that car, and the card says in German, "We are full of optimism, and we are looking forward to all that's to come and we will stay in Novaki. </sentence><sentence id="146">And there and then he sends regards to several friends so he did not know, and of course, I had no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: And you're with the Pollack family. </sentence><sentence id="153">Can you tell us what happened them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: The Pollack family. </sentence><sentence id="157">And 6 weeks, maybe 6 weeks later, with this yellow exemption or white exemption disregarded, we went to the first concentration camp which was Zilina, which is about, 100 miles from Piestany and also in northern Slovakia, but it's also very close to the Polish border. </sentence><sentence id="158">And from there to Auschwitz is a very short distance. </sentence><sentence id="159">I don't know...maybe a hundred miles maybe, a little bit more, but certainly not much more. </sentence><sentence id="160">There I already recall that we were very cramped in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="161">And I was 7 and I was looking at the cattle cars being filled with people and I remember I always enjoyed trains. </sentence><sentence id="162">A train ride was always something I was looking forward to...incidentally to this day. </sentence><sentence id="163">And I was just waiting..."when will our turn come," so I did not view it as something negative. </sentence><sentence id="164">I wanted to take a train ride. </sentence><sentence id="165">I got different feelings when I saw that they closed the cattle cars and the train was just standing there and some people were screaming for water. </sentence><sentence id="166">And also what frightened me, there wasn't...there wasn't one German. </sentence><sentence id="167">This was all administered by the Slovaks, by the so called Hlinka guard. </sentence><sentence id="168">Was the fascist uniformed members of the Hlinka party. </sentence><sentence id="169">And one day I was wondering through this camp. </sentence><sentence id="170">There were wooden barracks and one of these Hlinka guards...I don't know whether they took pity on me. </sentence><sentence id="171">I don't know what I looked like. </sentence><sentence id="172">But he invited me into a large warehouse and there were all these knapsacks and there was food, canned food. </sentence><sentence id="173">Sardines. </sentence><sentence id="174">And there were lemons I remember. </sentence><sentence id="175">And he said, "Take what you want." </sentence><sentence id="176">And I was...I believed quite a street smart kid, so I put some string around my pants and I stuffed the pants with all kinds of foods, cans, sardines. </sentence><sentence id="177">And I brought it to the barrack where we were staying. </sentence><sentence id="178">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="179">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="180"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And I remember a great feeling of satisfaction because I distributed food. </sentence><sentence id="181">There wasn't starvation really there. </sentence><sentence id="182">We were fed. </sentence><sentence id="183">I believe twice a day we were getting some soup. </sentence><sentence id="184">And this was basically just a transit camp, a camp where people arrived, loaded in the cattle cars and sent on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: How did you get out of there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Well, this man...this Pollack was a dentist in Piestany. </sentence><sentence id="218">He had a brother named Arthur. </sentence><sentence id="219">Arthur was in Bratislava which is the capital of Slovakia and he was by profession a printer and he had a very influential friend and professional colleague from the printing business whose name was Shajno Mach (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="220">He was a minister of interior in the fascist government of Monsignor Tiso in charge of solving the Jewish question of Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="221">And Shajno Mach and Arthur Pollack were friends, drinking friends, card playing friends, fellow printers. </sentence><sentence id="222">And Arthur was sort of a bon vivant as a I always understood, a womanizer. </sentence><sentence id="223">All kinds of vices, but he was also very close friend of Shajno Mach. </sentence><sentence id="224">So Arthur, as I understand, went to Shaino Mach and he arranged that we were released from Sered. </sentence><sentence id="225">I remember that one day a car showed up and we were let out. </sentence><sentence id="226">And the magic word was a phonogram. </sentence><sentence id="227">| did not know what a phonogram was, but I can still visualize it. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was a white piece of paper with something written on it, and it had a red stripe across. </sentence><sentence id="229">And this was the paper that gave the orders to let us go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Did you have any idea that you are being rescued from death by that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="246">No. </sentence><sentence id="247">Quite the con...I think I was...I was... | must have had mixed feelings. </sentence><sentence id="248">I don't know exactly, but I know that part of the feeling was there will be no train ride. </sentence><sentence id="249">So that was the negative feeling. </sentence><sentence id="250">But I already saw some misery. </sentence><sentence id="251">I remember and I can still visualize it. </sentence><sentence id="252">There was a man laying on a stretcher. </sentence><sentence id="253">There were many people around him. </sentence><sentence id="254">And it bothered me terribly because this man was not 01:15: supposed to be there. </sentence><sentence id="255">He was ill. </sentence><sentence id="256">He was supposed to be in some kind of a therapeutic environment. </sentence><sentence id="257">I couldn't verbalize it at that time in this way, but I just remember that this was disturbing. </sentence><sentence id="258">The other disturbing thing was that we had extremely small space and we were sleeping on the floor and we were sleeping on straw. </sentence><sentence id="259">And this was again something that doesn't happen to you when you are in comfortable times. </sentence><sentence id="260">So it must have been a mixed bag but that I am not going to take a train ride that bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="261">So we got out of there and we knew that we have to go into a semi-hiding. </sentence><sentence id="262">So we went to a town called Bardell (ph) which is in eastern Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="263">And there we rented an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="264">Pollack could no longer practice as a independent dentist, but he took employment with a Jewish dentist. </sentence><sentence id="265">It was 1942. </sentence><sentence id="266">And we stayed in this town til 1943. </sentence><sentence id="267">I went to school there. </sentence><sentence id="268">And then some how things became bad. </sentence><sentence id="269">Was either end of 1943 or even the beginning of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="270">and Pollack decided that we have to go into hiding again. </sentence><sentence id="271">Not complete hiding, but just out of site into some location where we will be safer than in Bardell which is a quite Slovak This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="272">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="273"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection conditions, quite a big town. </sentence><sentence id="274">Let's say it had 20,000 inhabitants. </sentence><sentence id="275">And he made a very unfortunate decision. </sentence><sentence id="276">He decided together with two extended families, maybe some 35 people, that all of us are going to go back to Western Slovakia to a village named Sharfia (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="277">near Nitra. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Hadn't some of you become nominally Lutherans at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: We came Lutherans in Bardell. </sentence><sentence id="317">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="318">In Bardell we...we attended church. </sentence><sentence id="319">We got papers that we were Lutherans. </sentence><sentence id="320">I still have the baptismal certificate. </sentence><sentence id="321">And it was a serious situation, yet it was a funny situation too because Pollack was brought up in a Yeshiva and was brought up as an Orthodox Jew. </sentence><sentence id="322">And to see this man forcing me and his wife to go to a Lutheran service was quite a funny sight. </sentence><sentence id="323">And on top of everything, he would also use every opportunity and go to a synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="324">I don't think it was a synagogue anymore. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was a stiebel. </sentence><sentence id="326">It was a prayer hall, but nevertheless came, so the same man who on a Sunday would piously sit in a church with us, on a Friday night on a Shabat or on a holiday would put on his talith and pray in a stiebel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: Were you aware of the incongruity of that at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="341">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="342">I was 8 and I remember I had a friend there whose name was Thury, who I will tell you a very sad story about Thury. </sentence><sentence id="343">His name was Arthur. </sentence><sentence id="344">His nickname was Thury. </sentence><sentence id="345">And I remember we were somehow discussing it and had a good time discussing the funny aspect of that. </sentence><sentence id="346">Because his family had nothing to do with the Lutherans. </sentence><sentence id="347">We were 01:19: the ones. </sentence><sentence id="348">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="349">I don't know how it happened, but we were the ones who attended the Lutheran services. </sentence><sentence id="350">So now Pollack took this maybe 35 peoople to this village of Sharfia, and it was a very stupid decision because first of all, this village alone had many Hlinka guards. </sentence><sentence id="351">And one evening somebody came to tell us...somebody from the village, "Listen, tomorrow the Nazis are coming with the Hlinka guards." </sentence><sentence id="352">There were already Germans in the country. " </sentence><sentence id="353">And they're going to take everybody." </sentence><sentence id="354">And Pollack did not want to do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="355">We were urged to go into the forest. </sentence><sentence id="356">Pollack had a son who was 19, 20 by that time. </sentence><sentence id="357">Maybe 21 by that time. </sentence><sentence id="358">And he said, "If you don't want to go, I am taking the child (meaning me) and my mother and we are asking anybody else who wants to leave to leave with us into the forest." </sentence><sentence id="359">By the way, Pollack also brought to this village his brother, the baby that was about 4 months old. </sentence><sentence id="360">All in all there were maybe over 40 people. </sentence><sentence id="361">So the son of his, Marcel took us. </sentence><sentence id="362">He finally... he relented. </sentence><sentence id="363">His brother went too with a child that was my age, and his third brother stayed with his 4 month old child. </sentence><sentence id="364">So only the two families, we left at night for the woods. </sentence><sentence id="365">Sunday morning, trucks appeared with Hlinka guards, with Nazis, loaded up everybody and took them to a village called Nemchita. </sentence><sentence id="366">A few miles from this spot they had to dig out their own grave and they were all executed there. </sentence><sentence id="367">The children were not...they're not even shot. </sentence><sentence id="368">They were just This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="369">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="370"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection buried alive. </sentence><sentence id="371">And I know that because after the war Pollack went to the exhumation. </sentence><sentence id="372">And I was there too. </sentence><sentence id="373">I was on the side. </sentence><sentence id="374">I did not see the act in itself, and I know that that was the conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="375">The children were not even killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: Did you know about what had happened, though, in Sharfia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="418">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="419">And incidently, this Thury whom I mentioned from Bardell, we had a fight shortly after we arrived in this village, the two of us, and either I pushed him or he fell and he had quite a large wound on his leg. </sentence><sentence id="420">And when they exhumed him, he still had the bandages on his leg. </sentence><sentence id="421">Well, now they are buried in a mass grave near this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: At the time this event took place, you and the Pollacks were in the woods...in the forest, so you had escaped this and you heard about it after you returned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: You weren't directly involved? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: We heard about it from the son of this man who came to warn 01:23: us and this son, he was bringing us food into the forest. </sentence><sentence id="434">And we had a plan, again worked out by this Marcel, that we will go deeper into the forest until we find Partisans who were fighting the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="435">So that's what we were trying to do. </sentence><sentence id="436">But somehow we did not manage to connect with them. </sentence><sentence id="437">Maybe they were too far. </sentence><sentence id="438">They were in the center part of Slovakia, and one day as I was searching for some food because we were really very short of food in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="439">I came upon a hunting lodge that was owned by a name, a man named Baron Leonhardy. </sentence><sentence id="440">He was married to a Jewish lady, but he was a German in good standing. </sentence><sentence id="441">I don't know whether he was a member of the Nazi party. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="452">Q: How did you get to Baron Leonhardy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="454">A: It was in the forest where we were staying and we had some...out of...we had two blankets and we built a tent-like structure. </sentence><sentence id="455">And since those two brothers, the two Pollacks were constantly quarreling together and I could not get along with the son of Pollack's brother, I always made some forays into the forest. </sentence><sentence id="456">And it must have been a few hundred yards from where we were hiding there was this hunting lodge. </sentence><sentence id="457">And I remember Leonhardy he was a tall man, sitting on the porch, and I don't know whether he asked me what was I doing there, but I know that they feed me and they gave me food and I brought it to both the Pollack families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="462">Q: Were you led to Baron Leonhardy by Linka? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="464"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="465">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="466"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="468">Linka was a maid at Leonhardy's house and she saw a situation and she offered that she will take us at night to the same village from where they took these 35 to 40 people and that we can hide in their barn. </sentence><sentence id="469">And this is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="470">Linka was about 25 years old. </sentence><sentence id="471">She took us and we were hiding in the barn and we would have survived the war there, but Simon Pollack ran out of cash. </sentence><sentence id="472">He was paying Linka's father so that he can get some food. </sentence><sentence id="473">But he ran out of cash and Linka's father said, "Look it is...1 don't know. </sentence><sentence id="474">But now it's maybe August 44. </sentence><sentence id="475">Said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="476">The war will end and you will pay me," but Pollack concluded for some reason he has to pay. </sentence><sentence id="477">Otherwise we are in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="478">Whether he assumed that they won't keep us without money, which I think was the wrong conclusion or whether the man did not have money to go and buy food, which I don't think was the case because the man was growing his food and I remember they were slaughtering a pig while we were there hiding in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="479">And I remember big disputes between him and his brother. </sentence><sentence id="480">They really had fights there. </sentence><sentence id="481">They had fights that necessitated the separation of the two families in the barn under the worst of circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="482">So he asked his brother whether he has has cash and his brother told him no, he does not. </sentence><sentence id="483">So Pollack since he was a dentist, he was missing some teeth and before we went into hiding from Barbell, he created some removable dental work out of gold. </sentence><sentence id="484">And he said, "I have this gold here. </sentence><sentence id="485">I am going to send Linka's brother to sell it, and we'll have money. </sentence><sentence id="486">So Linka's brother took the gold, went to Piestany, got drunk, told somebody that here he has the gold that the Jews who are in hiding in his house are selling, and he must have realized what he has done because he came back running to the village and he said what he had done. </sentence><sentence id="487">So in a hurry it was at night, we picked ourselves up, run back into the forest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="510">Q: How long had you been in that barn before that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: I don't...must have been a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="513">And we ran there and there was sort of a small hut that belonged to one of the villagers. </sentence><sentence id="514">So that's where we went. </sentence><sentence id="515">That's where we were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="516">And what I remember a big bang and the tiles that covered the roof broke up. </sentence><sentence id="517">And then there was banging on the door and they dragged us out and all I remember seeing: Hlinka guards, some behind machine guns and laying on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="518">I remember 3 or 4 SS men in uniforms and they were dragging us out from this hut and as we came out, one of the Hlinka guards said, "You are going to dig a ditch and Pollack became hysterical and so did his brother. </sentence><sentence id="519">The women were very calm, and the two boys...the two of us, we were very calm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: Did you have any idea what the implication of that was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="531">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="532">At that time I knew exactly what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="545">Q: How much awareness did you have and what were your feelings up to this point of everything that had happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: In my life, it's a very significant moment. </sentence><sentence id="548">That's the first time I remember thinking about a supernatural being, so there's God. </sentence><sentence id="549">And I was so calm that...Pollack's wife told me that I was barefooted. </sentence><sentence id="550">She said, "Put on shoes." </sentence><sentence id="551">And I said, "Why would I need shoes?" </sentence><sentence id="552">I remember the thought was, "How preposterous that she should ask me to put on shoes. </sentence><sentence id="553">In a short while later we won't be any more." </sentence><sentence id="554">I remember this thought very vividly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: You knew...you knew that you are going to die at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="565">A: That we are going to die. </sentence><sentence id="566">The second thing I remember that they were throwing out... Oh, actually I found out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="567">Why did those tiles on the roof break? </sentence><sentence id="568">They threw a grenade. </sentence><sentence id="569">It did not explode. </sentence><sentence id="570">So one of the SS men went upstairs and was throwing our belongings down. </sentence><sentence id="571">One of them was a sort of an attache case that broke open while it was coming down from the first floor and it was full of bank notes and it belonged to the brother of Pollack. </sentence><sentence id="572">He had plenty of money, but said he didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="573">That means had he said he has money, we would not have been in that predicament. </sentence><sentence id="574">We would have been in hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="585">Q: He didn't let his brother know at the time his brother was trying to pawn the gold tooth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="587">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="588">And he wouldn't share the money. </sentence><sentence id="589">So we are going to die. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: Would you express that. </sentence><sentence id="594">The fact that I've just said, the fact about Pollack's brother's behavior and its effects. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="597">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="598">He was asked whether he has any money and he said he doesn't have. </sentence><sentence id="599">Had he said he has money...had he just lent it to his brother, we would have been safe because I remember the number of bank notes and the bank notes were in thousand crown denominations. </sentence><sentence id="600">That would have saved us. </sentence><sentence id="601">So as we were standing there and the man got hysterical, suddenly somebody came from the village on a motorcycle, a Nazi, and gave instructions. </sentence><sentence id="602">I did not hear him what he was saying, but it was obvious because they stopped everything and they took us down the village. </sentence><sentence id="603">Later we found out that the instruction was to take us down to the village to put us on a truck and to take us to Nitra, which was the county town, into the jail and to find out from us where the Partisans are. </sentence><sentence id="604">That we must know because we were caught in the forest. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: You say that there is no more lightness. </sentence><sentence id="666">Is this kind of a turning point in the whole experience? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: It was a dark moment because later on optimism again surfaced. </sentence><sentence id="670">Hope again surfaced, but at that time it was just bleak, dark, no hope. </sentence><sentence id="671">The next day, somebody opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="672">It was a Hlinka guard, and in a very vulgar way asked us to use the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="673">He used very descriptive language to go to the bathroom and what to do there in a Slovak---in the Slovak language. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="679">Q: What did he actually say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="681">A: He said, ??.. </sentence><sentence id="682">That means go and do number | and do number 2. </sentence><sentence id="683">Short while later, a man This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="684">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="685"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 came and brought in some food. </sentence><sentence id="686">And Pollack looked at him and said, 01:37: "Aren't you Mr. Kopsa?" </sentence><sentence id="687">And sure enough he was. </sentence><sentence id="688">The non-Jewish prisoner...I don't know for what reason...I think he was a Czech originally and that might have been the reason that he was in a Slovak prison. </sentence><sentence id="689">And that was the first spark of lightness again. </sentence><sentence id="690">We knew somebody who is in a position of power in prison, and we know him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="705">Q: How did Mr. Pollack know him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: Must have been a patient of his. </sentence><sentence id="708">I don't know exactly how. </sentence><sentence id="709">I think he was a patient of his who used to come to Piestany to take a cure. </sentence><sentence id="710">Piestany is a spa, quite a well known spa for treating rheumatism. </sentence><sentence id="711">And then just a day or so later, Pollack was called by the commandant of the prison. </sentence><sentence id="712">I believe his name was Cunsa. </sentence><sentence id="713">I am almost sure it was Cunsa. </sentence><sentence id="714">And he told Pollack... I was there. </sentence><sentence id="715">I was present when he was telling him that. </sentence><sentence id="716">And I remember it because it was something that drew my attention. </sentence><sentence id="717">He told him in German: Wenn Ich Dich jetzt weiter schicke, das Kind geht gleich durch den Kamin. </sentence><sentence id="718">Which means "If I send you on now, the child will go [immediately] through the chimney." </sentence><sentence id="719">And so that's how I remember also that we did not have to wait til the war's end or to be ina camp where there were gas chambers and crematoria, that this was no secret that this process was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: Did you know that at the time? </sentence><sentence id="734">Did the Pollacks know what happened to the people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="737">A: Before this, I know that I heard it long before the war 01:39: ended, that there was mass extermination going on. </sentence><sentence id="738">I know that this was no secret. </sentence><sentence id="739">So Cunsa continued and said, "Look, I will do one thing. </sentence><sentence id="740">You are a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="741">There are plenty of Jewish dental offices that have been closed in this town. </sentence><sentence id="742">Tomorrow, you will go. </sentence><sentence id="743">You will select one. </sentence><sentence id="744">We will move the entire dental office here, and you will fix our teeth. </sentence><sentence id="745">And Pollack somehow must have felt very happy because he told him, "That's wonderful Mr. Commandant, Herr Commandant. </sentence><sentence id="746">I will make you the most beautiful teeth." </sentence><sentence id="747">And Cunsa said: Wenn ich in der Erdt bin ist se mir scheissegal ob ich gute Zaehne hab oder nicht. </sentence><sentence id="748">When I am buried, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference whether I have good teeth or not. </sentence><sentence id="749">And from there on, sure enough, within a short period of time, might have been a week, Pollack was working as a dentist in the prison. </sentence><sentence id="750">His wife was helping him as an assistant. </sentence><sentence id="751">We had all the food in the world. </sentence><sentence id="752">The negative attitude of this Hlinka guard suddenly changed. </sentence><sentence id="753">They were bringing their wives in. </sentence><sentence id="754">They had their teeth fixed. </sentence><sentence id="755">And we were just having good times. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="793">Q: Did you...you didn't regard them as your enemies amongst them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="795">A: Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="796">Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="797">I did not have one negative thought about them. </sentence><sentence id="798">As a matter of fact, in that prison my only negative thoughts were about the Hlinka guards, because the only Nazi with whom I had something to do was Cunza who I already realized from his...what he said that he saving our lives. </sentence><sentence id="799">Then one night, the Allies bombed Nitra and in a hurry they had to pack us up and they sent us on concentration camp Sered. </sentence><sentence id="800">So again was from...from a very positive situation to a very negative because suddenly we were in Sered. </sentence><sentence id="801">Wooden barracks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: Was your family treated differently from the others or was everybody from there sent from Nitra to Sered? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: I think they just had to vacate the prison. </sentence><sentence id="812">I don't know what happened to the Nazi soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="813">I have some idea because after the war, I was asked to make a deposition about Cunsa, and I said what he did for us and it's my understanding that he was executed because he signed execution orders for some partisans and maybe for some of these deserters as well. </sentence><sentence id="814">So he was executed. </sentence><sentence id="815">Now in Sered, we found... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="821">Q: What was the trip...trip to Sered like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="824">I don't even know how we got to Sered. </sentence><sentence id="825">Whether it was by train or by truck, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="826">In Sered we spend a few weeks and the commandant there was the infamous Bruno who, to this day, is somewhere in hiding in Syria. </sentence><sentence id="827">And Bruno took it upon himself to torture Simon Pollack. </sentence><sentence id="828">He found out that he was a prominent prisoner in Nitra, and he must have felt a need to reduce him to the level of every other inmate in Sered. </sentence><sentence id="829">So he would call him to...and he tortured him. </sentence><sentence id="830">He beat him, and Pollack was a slight man, short, and I remember him. </sentence><sentence id="831">Every time he came back, he was quite shaken up. </sentence><sentence id="832">We spend a few weeks..I don't know how long in Sered, and from Sered then I went to Theresienstadt with the women </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="877">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="878">First of all, they separated us, and I remember Pollack crying there with his wife and I remember it appeared to me a quite a paradoxical(ly) and outright grotesque situation because they were constantly quarreling. </sentence><sentence id="879">And now that they were being separated and Bruno was standing there. </sentence><sentence id="880">He was crying...Pollack was crying. </sentence><sentence id="881">He said, "If we survive this, I will be... don't know, a model husband and we will never have these quarrels, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="882">And Bruno was standing there and I remember pulling Pollack's hat on his eyes and saying: Wir kennen Dich schon , Du alter Simulant. </sentence><sentence id="883">Which means we know each other already, you old faker, because Simulant in German is applied to a person who pretends pain or... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: I do not remember, but the overcrowding was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="951">The only negative thoughts are about the overcrowding. </sentence><sentence id="952">I do not remember either thirst or hunger. </sentence><sentence id="953">And once...now we arrived in Theresienstadt and again there's a very negative first impression because Theresienstadt is a garrison city surrounding by a fortress, by moats, and we arrived at the entrance of the fortress and was early in the morning and was a lot of noise, a lot of screaming, "Raus, Raus, Raus." </sentence><sentence id="954">And they registered us. </sentence><sentence id="955">And I was with the woman...with Pollack's wife and she was assigned to a spot which again was considered prominent. </sentence><sentence id="956">She was assigned to what was called in German Entaeusung, a place where they deloused people. </sentence><sentence id="957">They go through shower and shaving and get rid of lice because lice we had...Lice we already had in Sered I remember. </sentence><sentence id="958">So I stayed with her for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="959">I don't know for how long. </sentence><sentence id="960">And then suddenly transports started arriving in Theresienstadt from other concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="961">I understand that the plan was to concentrate as many people in Theresienstadt as possible, and then to liquidate the camp. </sentence><sentence id="962">Blow it up or...I don't know in what way, but that was...the plan was to liquidate it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
