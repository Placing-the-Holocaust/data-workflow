<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: (Let's just start by you telling me your name, and when you were born, and where, and give me a little family picture.) </sentence><sentence id="8">My name is Budd Schulberg, and I was born in really a neighborhood that is now Harlem -- I was born on 120" Street, March 27, 1914. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: And, in a way, my parents told me I was maybe the only person who was a born screenwriter, because my father wrote a photoplay -- it was on a suffragist subject. </sentence><sentence id="10">My mother was a suffragist, and he wrote a screenplay, a three-reel called "What Every Woman Wants" -- I think it was called. </sentence><sentence id="11">And he got $500 for that script, which was quite a lot for those days. </sentence><sentence id="12">And he told me it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. Jellyhouse -- I've always loved that name -- who delivered me, at home, and so I really owe my birth to film writing, you might say. </sentence><sentence id="13">My father was one of the earliest, very early photoplay writers, as they called them then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="19">What else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: (Take us from New York to California.) </sentence><sentence id="22">We left when I was about six years old. </sentence><sentence id="23">And my father had been working for Adolf Zukor, Famous Players, as a writer and publicist, from about the age of 18 -- he started very, very young. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="27">But by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own. </sentence><sentence id="28">And become his own film company producer. </sentence><sentence id="29">So we went out to Hollywood very early. </sentence><sentence id="30">I really remember the ride on that train. </sentence><sentence id="31">It was on the old Chief, Santa Fe Chief, before the Superchief, even. </sentence><sentence id="32">And I vaguely remember that, being out on the observation car, and watching the country fall away behind us. </sentence><sentence id="33">My father and Louis Mayer, later the famous third "M" at MGM - the two of them together set up a very early film studio, way downtown, not in what we call Hollywood now, but down by the railroad tracks, way downtown Los Angeles. </sentence><sentence id="34">It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio. </sentence><sentence id="35">So both Mayer and BP, so they both were making these early silent films. </sentence><sentence id="36">That's about it. </sentence><sentence id="37">My father's big discovery was Clara Bow. </sentence><sentence id="38">He found her in a Brooklyn beauty contest, actually, signed her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to Hollywood. </sentence><sentence id="39">I called Clara sort of a pre- Marilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen. </sentence><sentence id="40">She was known as the, as the "It" girl, from a famous novel of the time, and movie called "It." </sentence><sentence id="41">And she had it. </sentence><sentence id="42">Clara really did have It. </sentence><sentence id="43">She really did. </sentence><sentence id="44">She's still amazing to watch in those silent films. </sentence><sentence id="45">And that's so -- My father and Louis made their films for a few years, for about three or four years, and then Louis Mayer went to the newly formed MGM. </sentence><sentence id="46">And at that point my father went over, went back to Zukor, in a sense, and became head of the, of the west coast studio of Paramount. </sentence><sentence id="47">And so, all through my young manhood, growing up, I really grew up on the, in a way, on the backlot. </sentence><sentence id="48">I used to go there almost every day on my bike, drove through those famous gates, and roam around and play on the backlot sets, and wander into different stages where they were shooting amazing films. </sentence><sentence id="49">So all these famous stars were like old hat to us -- they were more like people who just worked for my father -- was the way we thought of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: (How early did you get interested in writing?) </sentence><sentence id="75">Very, very early, I'd say I was about 9 or 10, very early. </sentence><sentence id="76">It was very much a part of our household atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="80">My father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays. </sentence><sentence id="81">And he, also as a kid, worked on the old Daily Mail and a short time on the old World -- papers that we, that we dearly miss. </sentence><sentence id="82">There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we're down to about two and a half. </sentence><sentence id="83">So, so he, he had a great interest in, aside from film, in uh writing. </sentence><sentence id="84">And my mother was a frustrated librarian. </sentence><sentence id="85">And she set up a very big library, thousands of books, all set up like a regular library, all numbered like a library, a real library. </sentence><sentence id="86">My father used to -- Sunday morning was a ritual. </sentence><sentence id="87">He would read from the classics, aloud to us, Sunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so. </sentence><sentence id="88">It's amazing what we read. </sentence><sentence id="89">We read through Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, and we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years and years, we heard that. </sentence><sentence id="90">So writing was very much part of our life. </sentence><sentence id="91">So I started when I was about 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents. </sentence><sentence id="92">So by the time I went to high school, I just thought of myself as a writer, as if it was already my profession. </sentence><sentence id="93">And it all went -- it fell in place very naturally. </sentence><sentence id="94">I edited the high school -- Los Angeles High School daily paper. </sentence><sentence id="95">We had a daily paper. </sentence><sentence id="96">I laugh because these days, my kids at Westhampton High School couldn't get out a monthly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn't imagine putting it out every day. </sentence><sentence id="97">But we did. </sentence><sentence id="98">So anyway, that's why, so we breathed that atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="99">My sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that Scribners published, entitled, They Cried a Little. </sentence><sentence id="100">Sonya said that in our house, where in other homes they might have a piano and people might sit down -- Sonya said, in our house, we had a typewriter, and as we passed we might type out a little jingle or something or a little story, and we all, Sonya and Stuart, Stuart wrote very well, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="199">Well, 19 -, let's see. </sentence><sentence id="200">When I got out of college in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my father's assistant, had now set up his own studio, and was planning independent films, one of which of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born -- which was the daddy of all those later Star is Borns. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="201"> And, let's see, I came back and started working for David as a young screenwriter. </sentence><sentence id="202">And I had a seven-year contract -- it started at 50 and went to 75 a week. </sentence><sentence id="203">At the end of seven years, I would have been making $500. </sentence><sentence id="204">And, uh, but he, but even, a year and a half into it, I would write screenplays that David, I don't think ever read; he was so busy making the films he was already planning. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="205">And then they would call us in -- I thought of it as being a, sort of like being a pinch hitter who comes in off the bench. </sentence><sentence id="206">If there was some immediate problem, David would call Ring Lardner and me -- we were a writing team. </sentence><sentence id="207">We were both about 21, 22 years old. </sentence><sentence id="208">We were just out of college. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="209">And he would call us in on --like on A Star is Born. </sentence><sentence id="210">They couldn't figure out the ending of A Star is Born, and we wrote the ending of it, that one where Janet comes out of Grauman's Chinese and sees her husband's footprints and handprints, and when she's asked her name. </sentence><sentence id="211">She's now a big movie star, and he's gone down, and in fact he committed suicide because he couldn't stand his failure while she's gone up. </sentence><sentence id="212">And she looks down, and when they ask her on the radio, she says, "This is Mrs. Norman Maine." -- </sentence><sentence id="213">and it's a big ending in the movie. </sentence><sentence id="214">Things like that, little bits and pieces. </sentence><sentence id="215">It wasn't awfully satisfying. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">By the time he was about to pick up my third option, I went in to David and I asked David -- I'd known him so well for years and years -- my mother even put him, my mother really stage managed his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother really sort of put them together, encouraged them. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I'd known him since I was a kid, and I said, "David, do me a big favor, please, don't pick up my option." </sentence><sentence id="218">And David was really very hurt. </sentence><sentence id="219">He said -- he felt really insulted, and he said, "Well, I have great plans for you. </sentence><sentence id="220">I was thinking that as I get older, I may retire, and you might be ready to take over for me, and then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you the way you work...." You could see this going on until the 21* century -- a dynasty of the Selznicks and the Schulbergs. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="221">And I said, "Well, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big producer, like you." </sentence><sentence id="222">And David said, he said, "Well," he said, " I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer" -- and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that's exactly what he said -- he said, "I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer, but," he said, "I figure that sooner or later your producer's blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in." </sentence><sentence id="223">I told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon. </sentence><sentence id="224">It's in The Last Tycoon. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225">So anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="226">I started writing short stories for Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines. </sentence><sentence id="227">And I was doing very well with that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="228">And one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run? </sentence><sentence id="229">And I then decided that I'd like to put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel. </sentence><sentence id="230">And that, that caused me quite a bit of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="231">Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party (drinks) -- (PAUSE) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: (Let's start that sentence again.) </sentence><sentence id="233">We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments. </sentence><sentence id="234">We were very busy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters" Guild and the Anti-Nazi League -- all kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, to influence them toward the communist program. </sentence><sentence id="235">So I asked at the meeting if I could be excused from my regular assignments in order to -- I'd like to stop and write this book. </sentence><sentence id="236">The answer was, "I guess you'll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that" -- Lawson was the head of the communist party -- "to decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to justify your dropping your assignments." </sentence><sentence id="237">So I went to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very tough, really tough and hardnosed. </sentence><sentence id="238">And Jack said, "Well, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline of the book, show me the outline, and then if I think the book will be useful to the party, then I'1l sort of supervise the writing of the book." </sentence><sentence id="239">And I said, "Jesus, Jack, I can't do that." </sentence><sentence id="240">And Jack started to give me things about the responsibility to the party. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that went on for many, many weeks, and I refused to do it. </sentence><sentence id="242">And they said, "No, you have to do it, or if you...." Finally, one day I went home with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, "Jigee, I can't take the argument any more. </sentence><sentence id="243">It's just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the car and drive away and just leave. </sentence><sentence id="244">And even that was, even that -- people don't realize how tightly disciplined the party was. </sentence><sentence id="245">You couldn't just get in a car and drive away. </sentence><sentence id="246">If you were going to New York you had to tell them where you were going. </sentence><sentence id="247">And then if you were staying more than two or three weeks, you were reassigned to a unit in New York. </sentence><sentence id="248">It was very tightly controlled. </sentence><sentence id="249">So I just -- the very act of getting in a car and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline. </sentence><sentence id="250">And when I got back to, I went back to Dartmouth, where I'd gone to college, and found a little house, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was. </sentence><sentence id="251">And for the next year I worked on this book, Sammy. </sentence><sentence id="252">Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that drove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and suddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it's just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English. </sentence><sentence id="253">And we should be neutral and stuff, which I thought was a grave mistake, also. </sentence><sentence id="254">Also, and so I was even further alienated from the party. </sentence><sentence id="255">And I got the book done and, and went back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing this on my own. </sentence><sentence id="256">But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People's World, which was the western edition of the Daily Worker, Charles Glenn was his name -- he wrote a rave review of the book. </sentence><sentence id="257">He thought the book was the Hollywood book, if not maybe the great American novel that everyone was talking about -- raved about it. </sentence><sentence id="258">That caused a firestorm apparently. </sentence><sentence id="259">They called him in and they gave him hell -- Lawson and company. </sentence><sentence id="260">Two weeks later he re-reviewed the book and he said, "On further consideration" -- and he even said, "It's been pointed out to me the shortcomings," and he absolutely trashed the book. </sentence><sentence id="261">Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn't, if he didn't do that he would be fired from the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party. </sentence><sentence id="262">He had to do it, and so he just trashed the book. </sentence><sentence id="263">It was a terrible book. </sentence><sentence id="264">It didn't do that and it didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="265">It was really disgraceful, just disgraceful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?) </sentence><sentence id="302">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="303">The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me. </sentence><sentence id="304">He was just ina rage. </sentence><sentence id="305">When I came in, he screamed at me. </sentence><sentence id="306">It was almost like that Judge Freisler. </sentence><sentence id="307">And he screamed at me. " </sentence><sentence id="308">You're a traitor! </sentence><sentence id="309">You're a traitor!" </sentence><sentence id="310">Like that, he got purple, he was so mad. " </sentence><sentence id="311">How could you write that terrible book?!" </sentence><sentence id="312">he screamed at me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="325">And then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that -- my father of course was a member and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father. </sentence><sentence id="326">He took off the same way, and he said, "B.P. I blame you for this. </sentence><sentence id="327">You should have stopped him. </sentence><sentence id="328">It's your fault." </sentence><sentence id="329">He was yelling, too. </sentence><sentence id="330">You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing. </sentence><sentence id="331">My father said, "Louis, I did try to stop him. </sentence><sentence id="332">I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the book." </sentence><sentence id="333">I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. " </sentence><sentence id="334">If you publish this book, it will ruin you. </sentence><sentence id="335">You'll never be able to live. </sentence><sentence id="336">You'll never get a job here again. </sentence><sentence id="337">And not only that, it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother -- who was just entering the agency -- it will hurt the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="338">You've got to put -- don't publish the book." </sentence><sentence id="339">My father wrote that. </sentence><sentence id="340">Anyway, Louis Mayer said -- he said, "You know what I think we should do with him?" </sentence><sentence id="341">He said, "T think we should deport him." </sentence><sentence id="342">And he really meant it. </sentence><sentence id="343">It was really sort of fascinating, because I always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own country. </sentence><sentence id="344">They thought of it as their own country. </sentence><sentence id="345">It was like Luxembourg or something. </sentence><sentence id="346">They ran that country. </sentence><sentence id="347">And they could do anything they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="348">The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name. </sentence><sentence id="349">He was on a weekly salary. </sentence><sentence id="350">They paid him every week. </sentence><sentence id="351">And they could do anything. </sentence><sentence id="352">They could cover up any crime. </sentence><sentence id="353">It never got in the paper. </sentence><sentence id="354">Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody. </sentence><sentence id="355">He did. </sentence><sentence id="356">And no one every heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="357">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="358">Because they ran everything, including the press. </sentence><sentence id="359">It was really their country. </sentence><sentence id="360">So when Mayer said that -- it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be deported. </sentence><sentence id="361">And my father -- I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he knew so much more, but he wasn't as smart in a practical way as Louis was. </sentence><sentence id="362">And my father said, "Louis," he said, "maybe you're right, but," he said, "where do you think his St. Helena should be?" </sentence><sentence id="363">He said, "Maybe we should deport him to Catalina Island." </sentence><sentence id="364">And according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn't think that was a bit funny. </sentence><sentence id="365">So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by both the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both. </sentence><sentence id="366">It was from both extremes. </sentence><sentence id="367">So I went back to New York, and -- of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast. </sentence><sentence id="368">And then, from then on, which pretty much I've done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth, which I've tried to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: (Remind us how old you were at that time -- you were very young.) </sentence><sentence id="414">I was about 25. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="417"> (Drinks) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: (So wait till you're finished with the water... Tell us again that you were twenty five years old. </sentence><sentence id="419">I mean, that's a vulnerable time to be so berated by everyone around you.) </sentence><sentence id="420">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="421">That book changed my life completely. </sentence><sentence id="422">It even cost me harmony with my first love of my life, my wife, Jigee, Virginia. </sentence><sentence id="423">It even cost me the marriage in a way, because Jigee wanted to stay west. </sentence><sentence id="424">She didn't like the east. </sentence><sentence id="425">And she thought the climate was bad for our little daughter Vicky, and we sort of argued about that, back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="426">And the, she insisted, almost, on, on, that we live out there. </sentence><sentence id="427">And I was saying, "I can't live out there. </sentence><sentence id="428">It's over for me there. </sentence><sentence id="429">And in the east, I'm really accepted now. </sentence><sentence id="430">And I have a new contract for a book, and I'm -- my new life has begun." </sentence><sentence id="431">It really planted the seeds of our breaking up eventually. </sentence><sentence id="432">That book changed me in every possible way. </sentence><sentence id="433">It was really funny. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="466">Uh, and then I, I went back to Hollywood to see my daughter and Jigee, and at that time, I spoke to the, John Ford, the famous movie director. </sentence><sentence id="467">Ford was forming this outfit, the -- called the Navy OSS Photographic Unit that would work with the, in the OSS with, with photographic in- intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="468">And because of my book's success, uh, Ford asked, Ford asked me, he said he would like me to be in that unit. </sentence><sentence id="469">So that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="470">I then applied, with his recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="471">And that took about six months before I was approved. </sentence><sentence id="472">And in the meantime, I went down to Mexico and waited in Mexico and wrote screenplays to support myself, wrote screenplays down there, for Mexican producers. </sentence><sentence id="473">And then finally I was, I got my Navy commission and went to Washington to report to John Ford. </sentence><sentence id="474">And that was the beginning of my war experience. </sentence><sentence id="475">I was in, in for about four years, because after the war, I was with the Nuremberg Trial. </sentence><sentence id="476">It seems to me, | think it was from spring of "42 to spring of "46 before I got, before I got out, because the last six or seven months was spent preparing a film for the Nuremberg, the photographic evidence for the trial. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="494"> No. </sentence><sentence id="495">It was not. </sentence><sentence id="496">It could have been anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="497">It could have been Marine, or Army. </sentence><sentence id="498">I think that Jack just had contacts with the Navy. </sentence><sentence id="499">He was a friend of Bill Donovan, the OSS head, of the newly formed OSS. </sentence><sentence id="500">And, so it was a Navy outfit that really was, didn't really have very much to do with the Navy. </sentence><sentence id="501">At the same time, there were some really ridiculously funny things like at our headquarters in Washington, at the Agricultural Building, if you wanted to go out for lunch, you would go to the Marine Sergeant and say, "Permission to go ashore, Sir." </sentence><sentence id="502">We had all this naval talk, even though we never saw a ship. </sentence><sentence id="503">But, Ford did send me for naval training anyway, to Fort Schuyler. </sentence><sentence id="504">I went to Fort Schuyler and got Navy indoctrination, where I had some trouble with navigation and all these things, I wasn't very good at that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="675"> So, then I came back from Fort Schuyler, and Ford called me in and said -- well, by this time I'm really snapping, I'm really Navy. </sentence><sentence id="676">I've been there for three months or something. </sentence><sentence id="677">And I'm very snapped up. </sentence><sentence id="678">And Ford the sadist said, "Well, how'd you like that?" </sentence><sentence id="679">And I said, "Gee, I really loved it, Commander, it was great." </sentence><sentence id="680">It was sort of laying into him, and he wanted me to say, God, I suffered there or something. </sentence><sentence id="681">He was not happy -- he thought I was suffering there at Fort Schuyler. </sentence><sentence id="682">But after that, after that, the first nine or ten months or almost a year, we worked just in, in Washington. </sentence><sentence id="683">And Ford had made a film about, a film for public consumption about, about Pearl Harbor, and he asked me to write the, sort of the commentary, the narration, I mean, titles and stuff, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="684">I worked on films like that, which was more or less like working in Hollywood. </sentence><sentence id="685">And, then he sent me overseas to London. </sentence><sentence id="686">I was there in the blitz, and we did some, some undercover work in, in London, and then Paris. </sentence><sentence id="687">And then we had some really interesting assignments. </sentence><sentence id="688">One was not really involved in photography. </sentence><sentence id="689">We were part of a little group that, as soon as a German town fell, we would rush in and try to grab as much information -- we would go to the SS headquarters and things like that and grab papers and orders and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="690">It was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="691">It was interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: (Was this in 1943? </sentence><sentence id="710">deg44?) </sentence><sentence id="711">Yes, I'd say this was "43, "44, yes, as we moved through Belgium and into Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="715">And then they used writers in a very creative way. </sentence><sentence id="716">They had writers like me work with, on the team that would drop, drop agents behind the line. </sentence><sentence id="717">And each agent had about, a team of about eight that took care of them. </sentence><sentence id="718">They all had different assignments. </sentence><sentence id="719">One would just -- took care of his general welfare. </sentence><sentence id="720">And, and one was involved in the aviation problems, when he could be dropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="721">And I as a writer would work on their cover story, which was very much like writing a story. </sentence><sentence id="722">It was exactly like writing a character in fiction, because you would find out what they really did, and then just adjust it to what they would say when they got, if they were interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="723">And so that was really interesting. </sentence><sentence id="724">Right before the end of the war, we had one, one guy who was a Danish agent. </sentence><sentence id="725">I was just amazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people. </sentence><sentence id="726">And he'd become quite famous. </sentence><sentence id="727">He had been actually dropped in Berlin or something, or got to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="728">He went to the Adlon Hotel, and became a big pal of some big SS general. </sentence><sentence id="729">He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some kind --I forget what the hell they thought he was selling -- but he became a pal and drinking buddy, and so -.Now it was quite near the end of the war, and his main worry was that the war might end before he could do 50 drops. </sentence><sentence id="730">He really was worried that the war would be over. </sentence><sentence id="731">He couldn't wait to get his fiftieth in. </sentence><sentence id="732">And, but three days before, three or four days before the end of the war, back he went again. </sentence><sentence id="733">I asked him, it's against regulations really, because everything is so secret. </sentence><sentence id="734">But if he ever survived, if he ever came to the States, I'd love to know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="735">Because it was frustrating. </sentence><sentence id="736">When we did this work, when they made contact inside, they made someone, not us, but just someone, in London I think it was, so we would never know what happened, we didn't know whether they got killed or were doing great. </sentence><sentence id="737">We never could sort of complete the experience. </sentence><sentence id="738">So I asked him, if he ever got out, if he survived this last one, and got to the States, I wish he would look me up and tell me what the hell happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="739">But I never heard from him. </sentence><sentence id="740">I don't know what happened to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: (So you had intelligence training, also -- not just naval training, but intelligence training?) </sentence><sentence id="770">That's right, so they sent me to that school; it's the same place where the CIA is now. </sentence><sentence id="771">Yeah, that was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="772">They sent me to a school. </sentence><sentence id="773">There were a hundred or so agents, at agent school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="779">We were there about a couple of months, and each one had to make up a false identity, as to who they were and what they did. </sentence><sentence id="780">And they just went, funny things -- I said I was a sports writer. </sentence><sentence id="781">You had to of course choose something that you could talk about, or be questioned about, that they didn't know enough about, to pass. </sentence><sentence id="782">So I said I was a sports writer. </sentence><sentence id="783">I didn't say Los Angeles, but close to Los Angeles, like Alta --_,_ that I knew enough about. </sentence><sentence id="784">Sometimes at three o'clock in the morning, they would wake you up and shake you and say, "What's your name? </sentence><sentence id="785">What do you do?" -- </sentence><sentence id="786">kind of like that, to try and catch you. </sentence><sentence id="787">And fascinating, too, every Saturday night there was a long drinking session. </sentence><sentence id="788">They would all be at a long table, and they had every kind of booze on the table, and they would encourage people to drink. </sentence><sentence id="789">And they would see who fell apart in drinking, and who didn't. </sentence><sentence id="790">And they would weed them out like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="803">Q: (Were you good at that?) </sentence><sentence id="804">Yeah, I was. </sentence><sentence id="805">Yeah, I had had quite a bit of training in it by then. </sentence><sentence id="806">Yes, I was. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="823">Q: (Why don't you tell me how Stuart was brought into the unit and when that was?) </sentence><sentence id="824">Well, Stuart joined the Marine Corps. </sentence><sentence id="825">And after his Marine training -- the same tough stuff -- even tougher maybe that he went through -- he was assigned to a film unit, a film unit in the Marine Corps. </sentence><sentence id="826">Meantime, I heard that we'd a slot open in our outfit. </sentence><sentence id="827">Someone had dropped out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="833">I forget what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="834">Anyway, I then recommended to Ray Kellogg that we get Stuart, I said he was really very, very able. </sentence><sentence id="835">And so they did suggest to Stuart that he apply, and Ford approved it, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="836">And so Stuart came over, and from that time worked with us. </sentence><sentence id="837">And that's how we both happened to be, at the end of the war, involved in the Nuremberg Trial preparation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="843">Q: (Just a little background: Did you work at all with the Signal Corps? </sentence><sentence id="844">Did you have any connection or cooperation with the Signal Corps units, and with George Stevens" unit?) </sentence><sentence id="845">No, we had no connection whatsoever with the Signal Corps. </sentence><sentence id="846">It drives me a little crazy, because it will never get straightened out, I don't think. </sentence><sentence id="847">Somehow on the Internet it says that George Stevens worked on the Nuremberg film. </sentence><sentence id="848">And I get questions many times: How was it to work with George Stevens? </sentence><sentence id="849">And he seems inextricably bound up in our project. </sentence><sentence id="850">I didn't even know, know George Stevens. </sentence><sentence id="851">I know his son quite well, but I don't think I even ever met George Stevens. </sentence><sentence id="852">And he had nothing whatsoever to do with our project. </sentence><sentence id="853">Nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="865">What he did, and where it got mixed up is that, apparently Stevens, at the end of the war got a film unit and went around photographing the concentration camps, and made several films that were, I think, quite effective. </sentence><sentence id="866">But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial. </sentence><sentence id="867">For one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had shot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be admissible evidence. </sentence><sentence id="868">But we never saw George Stevens. </sentence><sentence id="869">And I don't think I'll ever be able to disconnect it. </sentence><sentence id="870">It comes up constantly. </sentence><sentence id="871">It's right there, if you find it-- George Stevens worked on this. </sentence><sentence id="872">It's one of the many, many troubles with the Internet, that's really a big negative for me. </sentence><sentence id="873">I get asked questions about Hollywood, about, did I get back to Hollywood work because I testified to the committee after the war, and I didn't go anywhere near Hollywood. </sentence><sentence id="874">I still felt outlawed, understand. </sentence><sentence id="875">And I lived in, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and just wrote books. </sentence><sentence id="876">But all that misinformation is set in there, and it will be there forever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="889">Q: (L agree.) </sentence><sentence id="890">And I'm sure there'll be biographies written full of misinformation. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="891">Q: (OK, So George Stevens had nothing to do with The Nazi Plan.) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="893"> Nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: (And did George Stevens and his group have anything to do with John Ford and his unit?) </sentence><sentence id="896">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="897">Zero. </sentence><sentence id="898">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="899">They were two completely separate -- I think that Stevens apparently did some very good work, but it had nothing to do with John Ford's OSS unit. </sentence><sentence id="900">Nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="901">Q: (OK. </sentence><sentence id="902">Why don't you tell us, give us some detail about how it came about, your suggestion about photographic evidence, and when you first came to Nuremberg, too, if you can go on to that.) </sentence><sentence id="903">At the end of the war, after the war was, was over, General Bill Donovan was very interested in, was one of the first, I think, to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major war criminals. </sentence><sentence id="904">And he, he called a meeting -- I need some water, too, cause my mouth gets dry from talking so much. ( </sentence><sentence id="905">Drinks) He called a meeting of, of all the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could contribute to the building of an international trial. </sentence><sentence id="906">And again, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I worked much more closely with Kellogg than I did with Ford -- Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford might make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior. </sentence><sentence id="907">So I guess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking about the importance of the impending trial. </sentence><sentence id="908">And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to make a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it. </sentence><sentence id="909">I got the feeling at the meeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="919">I think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson. </sentence><sentence id="920">Anyway, each one spoke up about what they could do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS Photographic -- it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we could use at, at a trial. </sentence><sentence id="921">As a result of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would look, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial. </sentence><sentence id="922">And so, so I... Then I went back to Berlin, and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and -- with my brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence. </sentence><sentence id="923">So, he set up in, I think in Wiesbaden. </sentence><sentence id="924">And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler's official photographer. </sentence><sentence id="925">And Hoffmann, who -- oddly enough, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von Schirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the Hitlerjugend. </sentence><sentence id="926">It was really ironic because in a sense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law. </sentence><sentence id="927">But as I point out -- with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do anything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a slavish point. </sentence><sentence id="928">I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, ina way. </sentence><sentence id="929">We would say that the -- feeling anti-German at that time, because we did feel that the country really overwhelmingly had supported Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="930">You see those crowds of millions and millions of people would turn out for those rallies. </sentence><sentence id="931">And we said that we thought of the Germans as being either, either at your throat or, or at your feet. </sentence><sentence id="932">That's what we said. </sentence><sentence id="933">And at that point, we found them willing -- that even formerly Nazi people would do anything that you, anything that you wanted, because they were scared of us also. </sentence><sentence id="934">But by then we were the conquerors and they were scared about what we might do to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="952">Q: (Was Hoffmann that cooperative too?) </sentence><sentence id="953">Hoffmann was totally cooperative with Stuart and turned over his entire treasure trove of photographs to Stuart. </sentence><sentence id="954">Went over with his staff, he had his staff down there, the way I had up in Berlin.

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="967">There was a lieutenant Jim Donovan who served as a liaison between the Jackson staff -- he was on Jackson's staff, well we all were really, we were officially on Jackson's staff too -- would work out the, the working arrangement between the indictments and what we could do to back up those indictments photographically. </sentence><sentence id="968">And we worked with Ben Kaplan, whom I still see from time to time on the Vineyard -- a very distinguished lawyer and I think a judge later, but we would work closely with them, and sometimes I was down there frequently. </sentence><sentence id="969">I might fly down for a few hours and fly back, and so I was in Nuremberg a lot, every, maybe a couple of times a week even, during that period when we were preparing the film. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: (Did you have any reflections on the impact of Allied bombing and whether it was justified?) </sentence><sentence id="1000">Well, that's a tough question, because really you might say on both sides, it really doesn't seemed justified to uh bomb civilians, you know, on one side or the other, just as the Nazis were doing in London, and we were doing in Dresden and everywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1001">We did destroy those cities. </sentence><sentence id="1002">At the time, I felt that, at that time I felt that we had to do it, because we, apparently that was, they thought, the only way to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And God knows we had to win the war if we wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1004">At the time, at the same time, it was really horrendous to see what we had done, I mean to people, and oh God, the wreckage of it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1005">Q: (I'm sorry, go ahead.) </sentence><sentence id="1006">When I saw Berlin, I, my feeling was that it would take fifty years or more to ever get it back together. </sentence><sentence id="1007">I was amazed at how quickly they restored those cities. </sentence><sentence id="1008">I was amazed at the resilience of people to rebuild them. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I thought it would take all through the 20" century. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1010">Q: (When did you first have real knowledge about what had been going on in the concentration camps?) </sentence><sentence id="1011">Un, trying to remember -- there -- Even before the war, there had been word, word had gotten out that there were concentration camps, uh, in, in 19... let's see, what's it in, yeah, in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="1012">Joe, Joe Louis's uh, when-- it was a, famous story that, there was, you know, that was -- Braddock's manager was Jewish, and, and Goebbels was working very hard to set up a championship fight between Braddock the champion and Max Schmeling in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And Joe Gould, the manager --I went to see him in the hospital shortly before he died. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And whether he made it up or not, Joe Gould told me that, that he got a phone call from Schmeling in Germany, and Max was dying to set up this rematch with Louis. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And, so he called. </sentence><sentence id="1016">Joe Gould was actually at, at Stillman's Gym when he got the call. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And Schmeling said, "Joe, I'm here with, with, I'm here with Mr. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1089">And for each one I would sit down with Donovan, sometimes with Ray Kellogg in attendance also -- Ray served as sort of an intermediary between Donovan and me -- and Donovan would spell out, out for us what the indictments were, show us, in fact I would read them, and then ask us, "How do you think that you see film building or buttressing the case that we're making?" </sentence><sentence id="1090">So, so I would go away with that information and then, then look for film that would answer his, his, what he was looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1091">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1095">Q: (Where did you look first?) </sentence><sentence id="1096">Stupidly, we, as a shortcut, because we were very, very worried about time -- at that time it was like August, and the trial was supposed to open on the 15" of September. </sentence><sentence id="1097">We had no time. </sentence><sentence id="1098">So we got, so as a shortcut, we thought we'd look at all the Fox Movietone footage, because actually that was produced, had come from Germany, and so we got all of that, and it, I thought it didn't answer all, all the things he was asking for, but some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And so I, I went down with a list. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1105">And at that point Donovan, Jim Donovan said, "Well, Budd, that's film that was released in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Even though the source was German, we can't use anything that was at the influence, say, of Fox Movietonews, because the defense attorneys would jump in and say "That, that's not admissible evidence, it might have been doctored," if they can't tell what happened to it, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1107">It has to be only German film, made in Germany, photographed by the Germans, official Germans, too -- the army or the Waffen SS people and so on." </sentence><sentence id="1108">It made our job so much more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1109">I wasn't sure we could really do it at all. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And then we heard that that film was, the German film was all in the Russian sector, which made it even more difficult for us. </sentence><sentence id="1111">It's sort of a long story, Raye, but I went to the head of the Russian archives, this unusual man, uh, Major Avenerius he was, and I told him what we were looking for, and as I said last night, he, he asked me, well, he said, "Did you come up from the John Ford unit?" </sentence><sentence id="1112">And I said, "Yes," and he said, "Well, that's very interesting." </sentence><sentence id="1113">And it turned out that he was a John Ford scholar. </sentence><sentence id="1114">He knew every, he really knew every Ford movie. </sentence><sentence id="1115">He named them, he must have named twenty of them or more, every single one, all the way back to the early 20s. </sentence><sentence id="1116">He knew the obscure silent films. </sentence><sentence id="1117">He knew every damned shot. </sentence><sentence id="1118">It turned out he was a... He was like really basically a civilian, and he'd been a professor at the film institute in Moscow, and John Ford was his favorite of all world directors. </sentence><sentence id="1119">John Ford was his favorite director. </sentence><sentence id="1120">He knew everything about Ford. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And he found it very interesting that Ford was the commander of the outfit. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And he asked me if Ford would be coming, and I said "Well, yes he might come, just to inspect what we're doing." </sentence><sentence id="1123">And he said, "Would you introduce me to him?" </sentence><sentence id="1124">All his life he'd wanted to meet John Ford. </sentence><sentence id="1125">I said, "Well, sure, if he comes. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I think he may come." </sentence><sentence id="1127">And with that, that opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="1128">He told me to come back in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1129">And he opened up to us only, German, not all but a lot of the German newsreel film that they had shot themselves, and that we, a great deal of that record, the whole record of the growth of the Nazis and their coming to power officially through that strange uh, actually through an election, and all the rest of it. </sentence><sentence id="1130">So much of that film that we got from him the next day [coughs] we got because of the John Ford connection. </sentence><sentence id="1131">We actually got a truck and loaded the truck with film. </sentence><sentence id="1132">We had, we only showed four hours at the trial but we had maybe forty or fifty hours. </sentence><sentence id="1133">We had hundreds and hundreds, hundreds of thousands of feet -- it may have been as much as a million feet, I swear to God. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1164">Q: (Do you want to clear your throat? </sentence><sentence id="1165">And then I'd like to have you go back and tell us -- This was at the Babelsberg studio, right? </sentence><sentence id="1166">Mention where Avenerius was taking you. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And also, talk about, you were presumably working on 35mm film, which is very unwieldy. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Let's go back into that, so you can tell us where, and some of those things about the film conditions, and how you could handle film, both viewing it, copying it, all of that. </sentence><sentence id="1169">So, go ahead.) </sentence><sentence id="1170">Well, we got so much of this film from him, as I mentioned last night, and after a few days of this, he suddenly stopped and suddenly became a little more stiff. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Apparently his colonel had objected to his giving us so much film, even though the Soviet Union was one of the four parties represented in the prosecution. </sentence><sentence id="1172">But the colonel stopped it. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And then, I won't go into so much detail, but then we had to win over the colonel, which we did with this lavish party that we threw for him, an all night into the dawn party. </sentence><sentence id="1174">When the colonel got drunk enough and softened up, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1186"> and we showed them the July 20" trial, which they were very interested in, and they wanted a -- we had that and they didn't -- and they wanted a copy of that, which we would make for them. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And so, softened up, the colonel then gave us permission to drive way into the Soviet sector. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And it was on that trip that -- which the Russians said it was the furthest any Americans had been allowed in to penetrate the Soviet sector -- they knew of this tunnel where film had ... I should backtrack. </sentence><sentence id="1189">My two, my two SS film editors -- we had recruited them from a POW camp -- Walter Rothe and Curt von Molo were their names - and they told us that there were films made of, actually showing the Jews being shoved into cattle cars and ripped of their rings and jewelry and, and various atrocious things that the SS were doing to these poor Jewish victims. </sentence><sentence id="1190">And, they had both worked on those, edited those films, and had shown them to Goebbels and Himmler, and obscenely, they called them "desserts," because they would be shown after dinner like a dessert in a--I guess as an amusement, partly an amusement but partly it was supposed to be reporting. </sentence><sentence id="1191">These were like SS reports on what they were accomplishing. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And they told us that there were a great many of these films. </sentence><sentence id="1193">And the Russians said that they might be in this place, where they'd been sort of sealed up in a tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And they did take us there, and it was on fire. </sentence><sentence id="1195">It was burning. </sentence><sentence id="1196">It was almost, it, it was, God, it looked like acres of film were burning. </sentence><sentence id="1197">We did pick up little pieces. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And then they told us about two, two places in the sector, one called Rossleben and, and Rudersdorf -- two small towns where the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1199">They would apparently make a tunnel into a mountainside or a hillside, and then seal up this film. </sentence><sentence id="1200">And they were hiding it. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And, and so we drove to both places. </sentence><sentence id="1202">And in both places, of course, Rossleben and Rudersdorf, we found the same thing that we had found in the Russian sector. </sentence><sentence id="1203">The film was burning, or had been burned -- acres of it. </sentence><sentence id="1204">It was huge. </sentence><sentence id="1205">And once again, we were cheated out of getting what would have been just invaluable stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1206">And again, we picked up here and there -- it would be like a foot of, of film that was -- you could see what it was if you held it to the light. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And we did find some of that and made copies of it and, and brought that, and brought that down to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1208">But I was convinced by this having happened three times that someone must be informing them that, that we were coming to get it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1232">Q: (So what you're saying really suggests that even though there was officially a prohibition on filming any of these kinds of activities, these guys were telling you that it was filmed.) </sentence><sentence id="1233">Oh yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1234">Q: (Presumably this was film that was kept highly secret, right?) </sentence><sentence id="1235">Yes, Yes </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1236">Q: (And not something that went through the Propaganda Ministry. ) </sentence><sentence id="1237">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1240">Q: (Well that's one question. </sentence><sentence id="1241">And the other part is -- these acres of films, was it your feeling that some of that was official German film, like the Goebbels empire, or that these were all SS film locations?) </sentence><sentence id="1242">I don't know if they all were, because we really couldn't, we were not able to examine them the way that we would have wished to, but I got the feeling that these were more SS films that they were hiding, rather than the Goebbels propaganda films. </sentence><sentence id="1243">But there might have been some of both. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I really don't know the answer. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1246">Q: (But tell us again where the German newsreel material was that you found.) </sentence><sentence id="1247">Well, that we found mostly in the Babelsberg, where, that Avenerius was in charge of. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Most of that film came from there that they had -- all of the newsreel film that had been shot all, all through the war, from the early days. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1249">Q: (Do you remember where you found the film of the trial of the bomb plotters?) </sentence><sentence id="1250">Yes, I do. </sentence><sentence id="1251">It, it was, I really, practically found that myself, with a couple of people with me. </sentence><sentence id="1252">We --It was a film lab, and in the basement we found about twenty, twenty reels of film, and so I just took it with us and went back and started to run it. </sentence><sentence id="1253">We didn't know what was in it, and there was the whole God damned trial of the plotters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1259">I was rather surprised, seeing the film did, The Nazi Plan, which had only a snippet of the trial, that I can't remember why that was chosen, because there were far more shocking scenes than that one that we showed, that was not as abusive as some. </sentence><sentence id="1260">I don't know why that one...For some reason, Donovan, at first he didn't want to use any of the film. </sentence><sentence id="1261">He thought that crimes against their own people would not be as germane. </sentence><sentence id="1262">| didn't really understand it, because after all we were using film of the anti-Jewish riots and so forth, which was against their own people. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I never really agreed with him. </sentence><sentence id="1264">I don't know what his reticence was about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1272">Q: (Well, I wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that the people on trial for trying to kill Hitler were not the defendants in the dock at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1273">This was a really opposite polarity.) </sentence><sentence id="1274">Well, that's true. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And Judge Freisler was not -- God he was a horrible, but it's true he was not on trial. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1276">Q: I think he was killed in an Allied bombing raid, actually, while he was in a courtroom.) </sentence><sentence id="1277">Freisler, I think he was. </sentence><sentence id="1278">I think he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Thank God, he was a, God what a horrible.... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1280">Q: (I share your, your passionate horror for that trial footage. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I know it very well.) </sentence><sentence id="1282">That trial was something. </sentence><sentence id="1283">Then also...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1294">Q: (Filmed?) </sentence><sentence id="1295">Filmed, I mean, yes, filmed. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And the idea was that they would show that to every, in every diplomatic center, show it to all the diplomats, Nazi diplomats and High Command people, as a way of frightening them against doing something like that again. </sentence><sentence id="1297">What we heard was that it, it sort of backfired. </sentence><sentence id="1298">It was so horrifying that they were afraid it would turn more people against the regime and they stopped circulating it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1377">So it was just a question really of, of very difficult selection and, and elimination. </sentence><sentence id="1378">I had told Jim Donovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to 5, and we could run all day. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1379">And he said, well obviously, we can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1380">And we finally worked it down. </sentence><sentence id="1381">Jim Donovan suggested four hours. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the indictment that our film would relate to, but it, the... We had four film editors and they literally worked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mean, they worked until two and three in the morning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And that film unit had so damn much film -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1384">Q: (Tell us more about the editors and particularly I'm interested in Joe Zigman since he also worked on the other film.) </sentence><sentence id="1385">We had three very good Hollywood film editors: Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and Bob Webb. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And then we had one Russian girl -- I swear to God, I don't remember how she got assigned to us. </sentence><sentence id="1387">She was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1388">She was a very small Russian newsreel editor. </sentence><sentence id="1389">I think her name was (Shostopol) or something. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And so the four of them would work around the clock, looking at this film and then trying to follow a sort of a rough outline that I would make. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Let's see now, we start in 1930 and we show highlights before Hitler comes in, and then, we sort of outlined it step by step, and then somebody tried to select the most effective visually and verbally. </sentence><sentence id="1392">And thank God, of course we had interpreters with us to translate for us, as my, my three years of German at Dartmouth College was being strained to the breaking point. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1416">They never understood. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And General Donovan was very impatient. </sentence><sentence id="1418">He had no patience with us at all, none at all. </sentence><sentence id="1419">Because he would promise things on a high level that couldn't be fulfilled down where we were, and that was the trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1420">And he would be embarrassed, "Well, where is it?" </sentence><sentence id="1421">So that, uh....Donovan finally pulled, he himself pulled out of the trial, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="1422">His, his nose was out of joint because he was jealous of Justice Jackson, and he didn't want to play second fiddle to Jackson, really and so, eventually he withdrew completely, but that didn't stop us, but we were left in place without Donovan, to finish the work that we'd been asked to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1467">So there was that sense of, of growing confidence in their aggression that you can't trace. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And also, there were people whose very presence indicted them. </sentence><sentence id="1469">People would say that we, like Speer was one, and Schacht was another -- and a number of people -- and Keitel and Jodl -- but people who said they were just German officials but not necessarily Nazi Party related. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And showing them with their Nazi badges and things was, was very helpful in indicting them. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And, and Riefenstahl was helpful in identifying various people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1553"> Tape 3 of 3: Leni Riefenstahl. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us.[Sound problem -- Boom mike was missing. ] </sentence><sentence id="1555">Well, the -- of all the Nazi propaganda films that, many were made, by far the most, by far the most illustrious, or you might say notorious, of the Germans was Leni Riefenstahl's master film of the Nazi party day -- I think it was the seventh -- called the Triumph of the Will. </sentence><sentence id="1556">It was shot in a way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sense of really ex-, ex-, exalting them. </sentence><sentence id="1557">The film, which was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of work. </sentence><sentence id="1558">It was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="1559">The, the idea that Goebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that could be shown, it was not only for German consumption. </sentence><sentence id="1560">It was shown all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1561">And I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies, capitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the Rhineland, and the Sudetenland, and on and on they went, one little step at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1562">And the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and their leaders say, "How can we possibly defeat that power?" </sentence><sentence id="1563">It was overwhelming, just overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="1564">I think it was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht divisions. </sentence><sentence id="1565">It was a powerful piece of propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And so, it was, it didn't take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl. </sentence><sentence id="1567">She not only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports. </sentence><sentence id="1568">She was very closely tied in with the whole Nazi propaganda machine. </sentence><sentence id="1569">And so it was obvious that we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1570">And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in Berlin, and they directed to me to some place in Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="1571">And I went there, and then I went to Kitzbiihl. </sentence><sentence id="1572">And one by one, I got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living -- sort of hiding in the open, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1573">It wasn't exactly hiding but she wasn't advertising either, what her address was. </sentence><sentence id="1574">And so I was able to actually, with a weapons carrier and an army driver, I was able to go to her house and literally just knock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="1575">She was living in a very nice place -- it was a big, big, tustic -- it looked like three stories -- a very, quite large -- on a, overlooking a Bavarian lake. </sentence><sentence id="1576">It was a very nice place. </sentence><sentence id="1577">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1578">I just knocked on the door and somebody came to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1579">And I was in my Navy uniform, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1580">And I said, "I would like to speak to Miss Riefenstahl." </sentence><sentence id="1581">And they let me in. </sentence><sentence id="1582">It was a little man, said he would call her. </sentence><sentence id="1583">So I sat down, and I waited. </sentence><sentence id="1584">It took a very long time for her to come. </sentence><sentence id="1585">I think it was almost half an hour, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1586">She took a very long time coming. </sentence><sentence id="1587">I think she was making up. </sentence><sentence id="1588">After all, she was a movie star as well as a filmmaker -- big star in Germany --all these famous ice movies that she made, and mountain movies. </sentence><sentence id="1589">And she finally came, and I sat with her on a couch. </sentence><sentence id="1590">And she started right away working on me. </sentence><sentence id="1591">She said, of course, "I'm a film artist, and internationally respected." </sentence><sentence id="1592">And she gave a very positive rundown on herself. </sentence><sentence id="1593">And she said, "I'm respected everywhere in London, in Hollywood, and so forth, and I'm not a Nazi, I'm a pure film artist." </sentence><sentence id="1594">That was her own party line and, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And, and when she told me how well received she was in Hollywood, of course that was my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1596">She didn't know that I came from Hollywood. </sentence><sentence id="1597">She just saw a young, an American officer who was trying to do her in. </sentence><sentence id="1598">And she told me that, after all, even in 1938 everyone in Hollywood received her as a pure filmmaker and fellow artist. </sentence><sentence id="1599">And I didn't tell her that I was in Hollywood when she came. </sentence><sentence id="1600">Hal Roach was an extremely rightwing -- the old comedy producer/director Hal Roach gave a party for her, a big reception party, and asked all the main people in Hollywood to come. </sentence><sentence id="1601">And all of the liberal people like Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan and Dorothy Parker and so many, Freddy March -- a whole bunch, there must have been twenty -- they were each given a list of ten people to phone and say, "Don't go." [ </sentence><sentence id="1602">had a list myself. </sentence><sentence id="1603">And the party was a fiasco. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Only about eight or ten people -- just the extreme right wing people like Victor McLaglen, people like that -- only the fascist minded people, of which there were unpleasantly some in Hollywood. </sentence><sentence id="1605">It was a total fiasco. </sentence><sentence id="1606">Basically, the party was a disaster for her. </sentence><sentence id="1607">But I didn't tell her that. </sentence><sentence id="1608">I just listened and listened. </sentence><sentence id="1609">But as I said last night, I had this warrant for her in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1610">It was like burning a hole in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1611">I thought, I would just let her talk a little longer, so I relaxed her. </sentence><sentence id="1612">I didn't argue with her at all about what she thought she was. </sentence><sentence id="1613">Finally I took the thing out and said, "Miss Riefenstahl, I'm sorry, but I have to take you to Nuremberg." </sentence><sentence id="1614">And that's when she screamed "Puppi, Puppi, they're, he's arresting me," she screamed. " </sentence><sentence id="1615">He's arresting me." </sentence><sentence id="1616">And he ran in. </sentence><sentence id="1617">I didn't know at the time, he was a major in the Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And I told her, I tried to reassure her, I said, "Look, you're not being put on trial with Goering and von Ribbentrop, but we do need you as a material witness, and you'll be held, you'll be put up in one of the hotels, and held until the court releases you." </sentence><sentence id="1619">And so out we went. </sentence><sentence id="1620">We went in -- I wish I had a photo of that -- because sitting outside was a weapons carrier, like an open truck almost. </sentence><sentence id="1621">It was just the three of us, and we drove from there, from Kitzbiihl, all the way to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1622">She didn't say anything on the way. </sentence><sentence id="1623">She was just silent. </sentence><sentence id="1624">She didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1625">She was very ticked off-- very. </sentence><sentence id="1626">And I guess scared. </sentence></p></dialogue>

about the other guy: "Walter Rothe really was a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1787">He was very sympathetic." </sentence><sentence id="1788">And Rothe said the same thing about von Molo. </sentence><sentence id="1789">He was anti Nazi but von Molo was pro-SS and wanted to get in that SS film unit. </sentence><sentence id="1790">They both said that. </sentence><sentence id="1791">They had no use for each other at all. </sentence><sentence id="1792">I really didn't know which of them was right. </sentence><sentence id="1793">Also, Curt von Molo told me that all through the war, while he was working for the SS, that a Jewish film editor had been hiding in his attic, like in his house. </sentence><sentence id="1794">And I took that with a grain of salt, because it was a joke to us. </sentence><sentence id="1795">But from the first crossing over into Germany, we didn't meet a German who didn't have a Jew in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="1796">How could there be six million Jews in the concentration camps, because they must have all been up in the attics. </sentence><sentence id="1797">Everybody we met, almost without fail, would say, "I was against Hitler and I saved a Jew in my attic." </sentence><sentence id="1798">It got to be a joke with us. </sentence><sentence id="1799">And von Molo said the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1800">He had this Jewish editor, and he said it was very precarious because he did work on these horrible SS films, at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1801">I guess I didn't tell that last night. </sentence><sentence id="1802">One Sunday, we -- we would tend to try to rest on Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="1803">We were, everybody was really wiped out by this work. </sentence><sentence id="1804">One Sunday, I said to von Molo, "Look, Curt, I'm really sick of hearing about these Jews in the attic, I've had it up to here with it, and I've got to tell you I don't believe it, and he said, "Well, honestly, I'm telling you the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1805">It was that fellow, a friend of mine, that I worked with in the studio, you know, UFA." </sentence><sentence id="1806">And I said, "Look, it's Sunday morning. </sentence><sentence id="1807">Let's take the day off. </sentence><sentence id="1808">We'll take a jeep, and you and I and a driver, we'll just drive around the whole day in Berlin." </sentence><sentence id="1809">Because, that's right, he said, "Someone told me that he survived and that he's back. </sentence><sentence id="1810">Someone said they saw him in Berlin, just a few days ago, and thank God, apparently he's alive." </sentence><sentence id="1811">So I said, "Curt, let's take the day off. </sentence><sentence id="1812">And we're going to look for this Jew in the attic." </sentence><sentence id="1813">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="1814">So we start out, and he noticed some girl in Nuremberg, and we go there and we find her -- it was incredible we could find anybody, with how they were living -- the place was a total disaster -- people were living in holes and doorways and Christ knows, anyway this first girl says, "I heard that too." </sentence><sentence id="1815">And I (referenced?) </sentence><sentence id="1816">this person, we went to see him, it was amazing we'd find anybody but there was still, even with everything down, there was a kind of amazing word of mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1817">People seemed to know where other people were. </sentence><sentence id="1818">And to cut this short -- after a few hours of going from one (street?) </sentence><sentence id="1819">to another, and finally to his actual, we found his own girlfriend, who had survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="1820">She lived all the way through the war in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And she said, "Yes, he is, he's definitely here." </sentence><sentence id="1822">And she told us where she thought he was. </sentence><sentence id="1823">And we went there. </sentence><sentence id="1824">And here comes this little Jewish guy, he was still in his concentration camp stripes and still -- he out, and he sees Curt, he hugs Curt, and he says to me, "This man saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="1825">I actually lived in his attic." </sentence><sentence id="1826">And we finally found a real Jew in the attic. </sentence><sentence id="1827">And apparently Curt was telling the truth the whole time. </sentence><sentence id="1828">And from that time on, I became very, now I believed, now I knew that Curt was for real and that he really, he told me that Fritz Lang left, and he tried to leave, and got stopped, or something. </sentence><sentence id="1829">He wasn't able to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1830">He was hoping to leave, too. </sentence><sentence id="1831">Now I believed him. </sentence><sentence id="1832">Now I thought that Walter Rothe was a Nazi rat. </sentence><sentence
