You could see this going on until the 21* century -- a dynasty of the Selznicks and the Schulbergs. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="232">And I said, "Well, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big producer, like you." </sentence><sentence id="233">And David said, he said, "Well," he said, " I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer" -- and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that's exactly what he said -- he said, "I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer, but," he said, "I figure that sooner or later your producer's blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in." </sentence><sentence id="234">I told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon. </sentence><sentence id="235">It's in The Last Tycoon. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="236">So anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="237">I started writing short stories for Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I was doing very well with that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">And one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run? </sentence><sentence id="240">And I then decided that I'd like to put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that, that caused me quite a bit of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="242">Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party (drinks) -- (PAUSE) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: (Let's start that sentence again.) </sentence><sentence id="244">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="245">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="246"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments. </sentence><sentence id="247">We were very busy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters" Guild and the Anti-Nazi League -- all kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, to influence them toward the communist program. </sentence><sentence id="248">So I asked at the meeting if I could be excused from my regular assignments in order to -- I'd like to stop and write this book. </sentence><sentence id="249">The answer was, "I guess you'll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that" -- Lawson was the head of the communist party -- "to decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to justify your dropping your assignments." </sentence><sentence id="250">So I went to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very tough, really tough and hardnosed. </sentence><sentence id="251">And Jack said, "Well, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline of the book, show me the outline, and then if I think the book will be useful to the party, then I'1l sort of supervise the writing of the book." </sentence><sentence id="252">And I said, "Jesus, Jack, I can't do that." </sentence><sentence id="253">And Jack started to give me things about the responsibility to the party. </sentence><sentence id="254">And that went on for many, many weeks, and I refused to do it. </sentence><sentence id="255">And they said, "No, you have to do it, or if you...." Finally, one day I went home with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, "Jigee, I can't take the argument any more. </sentence><sentence id="256">It's just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the car and drive away and just leave. </sentence><sentence id="257">And even that was, even that -- people don't realize how tightly disciplined the party was. </sentence><sentence id="258">You couldn't just get in a car and drive away. </sentence><sentence id="259">If you were going to New York you had to tell them where you were going. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then if you were staying more than two or three weeks, you were reassigned to a unit in New York. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was very tightly controlled. </sentence><sentence id="262">So I just -- the very act of getting in a car and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline. </sentence><sentence id="263">And when I got back to, I went back to Dartmouth, where I'd gone to college, and found a little house, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was. </sentence><sentence id="264">And for the next year I worked on this book, Sammy. </sentence><sentence id="265">Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that drove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and suddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it's just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English. </sentence><sentence id="266">And we should be neutral and stuff, which I thought was a grave mistake, also. </sentence><sentence id="267">Also, and so I was even further alienated from the party. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I got the book done and, and went back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing this on my own. </sentence><sentence id="269">But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People's World, which was the western edition of the Daily Worker, Charles Glenn was his name -- he wrote a rave review of the book. </sentence><sentence id="270">He thought the book was the Hollywood book, if not maybe the great American novel that everyone was talking about -- raved about it. </sentence><sentence id="271">That caused a firestorm apparently. </sentence><sentence id="272">They called him in and they gave him hell -- Lawson and company. </sentence><sentence id="273">Two weeks later he re-reviewed the book and he said, "On further consideration" -- and he even said, "It's been pointed out to me the shortcomings," and he absolutely trashed the book. </sentence><sentence id="274">Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn't, if he didn't do that he would be fired from the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party. </sentence><sentence id="275">He had to do it, and so he just trashed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="276">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="277"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the book. </sentence><sentence id="278">It was a terrible book. </sentence><sentence id="279">It didn't do that and it didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="280">It was really disgraceful, just disgraceful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?) </sentence><sentence id="323">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="324">The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me. </sentence><sentence id="325">He was just ina rage. </sentence><sentence id="326">When I came in, he screamed at me. </sentence><sentence id="327">It was almost like that Judge Freisler. </sentence><sentence id="328">And he screamed at me. " </sentence><sentence id="329">You're a traitor! </sentence><sentence id="330">You're a traitor!" </sentence><sentence id="331">Like that, he got purple, he was so mad. " </sentence><sentence id="332">How could you write that terrible book?!" </sentence><sentence id="333">he screamed at me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="346">And then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that -- my father of course was a member and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father. </sentence><sentence id="347">He took off the same way, and he said, "B.P. I blame you for this. </sentence><sentence id="348">You should have stopped him. </sentence><sentence id="349">It's your fault." </sentence><sentence id="350">He was yelling, too. </sentence><sentence id="351">You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing. </sentence><sentence id="352">My father said, "Louis, I did try to stop him. </sentence><sentence id="353">I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the book." </sentence><sentence id="354">I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. " </sentence><sentence id="355">If you publish this book, it will ruin you. </sentence><sentence id="356">You'll never be able to live. </sentence><sentence id="357">You'll never get a job here again. </sentence><sentence id="358">And not only that, it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother -- who was just entering the agency -- it will hurt the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="359">You've got to put -- don't publish the book." </sentence><sentence id="360">My father wrote that. </sentence><sentence id="361">Anyway, Louis Mayer said -- he said, "You know what I think we should do with him?" </sentence><sentence id="362">He said, "T think we should deport him." </sentence><sentence id="363">And he really meant it. </sentence><sentence id="364">It was really sort of fascinating, because I always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own country. </sentence><sentence id="365">They thought of it as their own country. </sentence><sentence id="366">It was like Luxembourg or something. </sentence><sentence id="367">They ran that country. </sentence><sentence id="368">And they could do anything they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="369">The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name. </sentence><sentence id="370">He was on a weekly salary. </sentence><sentence id="371">They paid him every week. </sentence><sentence id="372">And they could do anything. </sentence><sentence id="373">They could cover up any crime. </sentence><sentence id="374">It never got in the paper. </sentence><sentence id="375">Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody. </sentence><sentence id="376">He did. </sentence><sentence id="377">And no one every heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="378">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="379">Because they ran everything, including the press. </sentence><sentence id="380">It was really their country. </sentence><sentence id="381">So when Mayer said that -- it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be deported. </sentence><sentence id="382">And my father -- I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he knew so much more, but he wasn't as smart in a practical way as Louis was. </sentence><sentence id="383">And my father said, "Louis," he said, "maybe you're right, but," he said, "where do you think his St. Helena should be?" </sentence><sentence id="384">He said, "Maybe we should deport him to Catalina Island." </sentence><sentence id="385">And according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn't think that was a bit funny. </sentence><sentence id="386">So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by both the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both. </sentence><sentence id="387">It was from both extremes. </sentence><sentence id="388">So I went back to New York, and -- of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast. </sentence><sentence id="389">And then, from then on, which pretty much I've done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth, which I've tried to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1471">So it was just a question really of, of very difficult selection and, and elimination. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I had told Jim Donovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to 5, and we could run all day. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1473">And he said, well obviously, we can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1474">And we finally worked it down. </sentence><sentence id="1475">Jim Donovan suggested four hours. </sentence><sentence id="1476">And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the indictment that our film would relate to, but it, the... We had four film editors and they literally worked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mean, they worked until two and three in the morning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock. </sentence><sentence id="1477">And that film unit had so damn much film -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1478">Q: (Tell us more about the editors and particularly I'm interested in Joe Zigman since he also worked on the other film.) </sentence><sentence id="1479">We had three very good Hollywood film editors: Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and Bob Webb. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And then we had one Russian girl -- I swear to God, I don't remember how she got assigned to us. </sentence><sentence id="1481">She was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1482">She was a very small Russian newsreel editor. </sentence><sentence id="1483">I think her name was (Shostopol) or something. </sentence><sentence id="1484">And so the four of them would work around the clock, looking at this film and then trying to follow a sort of a rough outline that I would make. </sentence><sentence id="1485">Let's see now, we start in 1930 and we show highlights before Hitler comes in, and then, we sort of outlined it step by step, and then This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1486">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1487"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 somebody tried to select the most effective visually and verbally. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And thank God, of course we had interpreters with us to translate for us, as my, my three years of German at Dartmouth College was being strained to the breaking point. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1515">They never understood. </sentence><sentence id="1516">And General Donovan was very impatient. </sentence><sentence id="1517">He had no patience with us at all, none at all. </sentence><sentence id="1518">Because he would promise things on a high level that couldn't be fulfilled down where we were, and that was the trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And he would be embarrassed, "Well, where is it?" </sentence><sentence id="1520">So that, uh....Donovan finally pulled, he himself pulled out of the trial, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="1521">His, his nose was out of joint because he was jealous of Justice Jackson, and he didn't want to play second fiddle to Jackson, really and so, eventually he withdrew completely, but that didn't stop us, but we were left in place without Donovan, to finish the work that we'd been asked to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1561">Q: (Did you ever consider whether you had too many Nazi Party rallies?) </sentence><sentence id="1562">I was worried about that. </sentence><sentence id="1563">I was worried about the party rallies, but at the same time, the party rallies included two valuable things. </sentence><sentence id="1564">One was what they actually said at those rallies, which as it moved on, became more and more inflammatory as they got more and more powerful, and as the western democracies surrendered to them, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1565">They became more and more aggressive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1571">So there was that sense of, of growing confidence in their aggression that you can't trace. </sentence><sentence id="1572">And also, there were people whose very presence indicted them. </sentence><sentence id="1573">People would say that we, like Speer was one, and Schacht was another -- and a number of people -- and Keitel and Jodl -- but people who said they were just German officials but not necessarily Nazi Party related. </sentence><sentence id="1574">And showing them with their Nazi badges and things was, was very helpful in indicting them. </sentence><sentence id="1575">And, and Riefenstahl was helpful in identifying various people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1665"> Leni Riefenstahl. </sentence><sentence id="1666">Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us.[Sound problem -- Boom mike was missing. ] </sentence><sentence id="1667">Well, the -- of all the Nazi propaganda films that, many were made, by far the most, by far the most illustrious, or you might say notorious, of the Germans was Leni Riefenstahl's master film of the Nazi party day -- I think it was the seventh -- called the Triumph of the Will. </sentence><sentence id="1668">It was shot in a way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sense of really ex-, ex-, exalting them. </sentence><sentence id="1669">The film, which was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of work. </sentence><sentence id="1670">It was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="1671">The, the idea that Goebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that could be shown, it was not only for German consumption. </sentence><sentence id="1672">It was shown all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies, capitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the Rhineland, and the Sudetenland, and on and on they went, one little step at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and their leaders say, "How can we possibly defeat that power?" </sentence><sentence id="1675">It was overwhelming, just overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="1676">I think it was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht divisions. </sentence><sentence id="1677">It was a powerful piece of propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And so, it was, it didn't take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl. </sentence><sentence id="1679">She not only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports. </sentence><sentence id="1680">She was very closely tied in with the whole Nazi propaganda machine. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And so it was obvious that we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1682">And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in Berlin, and they directed to me to some place in Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And I went there, and then I went to Kitzbiihl. </sentence><sentence id="1684">And one by one, I got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living -- sort of hiding in the open, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1685">It wasn't exactly hiding but she wasn't advertising either, what her address was. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And so I was able to actually, with a weapons carrier and an army driver, I was able to go to her house and literally just knock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="1687">She was living in a very nice place -- it was a big, big, tustic -- it looked like three stories -- a very, quite large -- on a, overlooking a Bavarian lake. </sentence><sentence id="1688">It was a very nice place. </sentence><sentence id="1689">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1690">I just knocked on the door and somebody came to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1691">And I was in my Navy uniform, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1692">And I said, "I would like to speak to Miss Riefenstahl." </sentence><sentence id="1693">And they let me in. </sentence><sentence id="1694">It was a little man, said he would call her. </sentence><sentence id="1695">So I sat down, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1696">It is not the primary source, and it

</sentence><sentence id="1698">It took a very long time for her to come. </sentence><sentence id="1699">I think it was almost half an hour, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1700">She took a very long time coming. </sentence><sentence id="1701">I think she was making up. </sentence><sentence id="1702">After all, she was a movie star as well as a filmmaker -- big star in Germany --all these famous ice movies that she made, and mountain movies. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And she finally came, and I sat with her on a couch. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And she started right away working on me. </sentence><sentence id="1705">She said, of course, "I'm a film artist, and internationally respected." </sentence><sentence id="1706">And she gave a very positive rundown on herself. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And she said, "I'm respected everywhere in London, in Hollywood, and so forth, and I'm not a Nazi, I'm a pure film artist." </sentence><sentence id="1708">That was her own party line and, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And, and when she told me how well received she was in Hollywood, of course that was my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1710">She didn't know that I came from Hollywood. </sentence><sentence id="1711">She just saw a young, an American officer who was trying to do her in. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And she told me that, after all, even in 1938 everyone in Hollywood received her as a pure filmmaker and fellow artist. </sentence><sentence id="1713">And I didn't tell her that I was in Hollywood when she came. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Hal Roach was an extremely rightwing -- the old comedy producer/director Hal Roach gave a party for her, a big reception party, and asked all the main people in Hollywood to come. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And all of the liberal people like Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan and Dorothy Parker and so many, Freddy March -- a whole bunch, there must have been twenty -- they were each given a list of ten people to phone and say, "Don't go." [ </sentence><sentence id="1716">had a list myself. </sentence><sentence id="1717">And the party was a fiasco. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Only about eight or ten people -- just the extreme right wing people like Victor McLaglen, people like that -- only the fascist minded people, of which there were unpleasantly some in Hollywood. </sentence><sentence id="1719">It was a total fiasco. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Basically, the party was a disaster for her. </sentence><sentence id="1721">But I didn't tell her that. </sentence><sentence id="1722">I just listened and listened. </sentence><sentence id="1723">But as I said last night, I had this warrant for her in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1724">It was like burning a hole in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1725">I thought, I would just let her talk a little longer, so I relaxed her. </sentence><sentence id="1726">I didn't argue with her at all about what she thought she was. </sentence><sentence id="1727">Finally I took the thing out and said, "Miss Riefenstahl, I'm sorry, but I have to take you to Nuremberg." </sentence><sentence id="1728">And that's when she screamed "Puppi, Puppi, they're, he's arresting me," she screamed.
