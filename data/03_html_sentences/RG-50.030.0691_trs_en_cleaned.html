<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="436">A: I didn't have too much, I guess the excitement, and all that stuff, that you don't think about it, I was just trying to get out of that fiery airplane. </sentence><sentence id="437">And so we'd always been told to delay your jump, cause they may -- may shoot you coming down in the parachute, you know, a fighter come by, or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="438">So I had delayed my parachute til I could kind of see the leaves on the trees. </sentence><sentence id="439">And I popped the chute and it seemed like I took a couple swings and I was on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="440">And then there was a--a little boy, a lady, and a -- at the end of this field where I landed in, there was a little boy over there and a lady, and so I -- he ran over towards me and I reached in my kneepads to get my escape kit out and there's a little -- we have books in there, a little book that says English and French, you know, cause we [indecipherable] France, and maps and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="441">And he pointed the [indecipherable] in the book, and he says hide, in there. </sentence><sentence id="442">So they took off. </sentence><sentence id="443">So I stuck my parachute under some bushes there at the edge of the field, and ran through the forest and got to the other side and I didn't know going to the other side is that I was getting deeper in the forest, but I come to a clearing. </sentence><sentence id="444">Now that little boy don't want to go out in there, cause gonna see me. </sentence><sentence id="445">So I just heard these -- all these Germans running,   Interview with Chasten Bowen " April 26, 2013 you could hear them, and there's -- their canister they carry with them is -- their gas mask rattles like a tin can, you know, so I heard rattling, so I just dove under some bushes right there and pulled them down kind of over me and laid there, waited, and hear when the Germans come up, he's -- I could reach out and grab his pant leg, he was so close, but he was looking way out ahead, he wasn't looking down at his feet. </sentence><sentence id="446">And I don't know, it seemed like I laid there for a day, it was probably an hour or something like that, and he kept looking out there, and I didn't breathe for a couple hours, I don't think. </sentence><sentence id="447">But anyhow, they finally went away and then I just walked through the forest and -- and I got my maps and there -- they had maps that they gave you were like a silk handkerchief, but their maps were detailed, they had the curves in the road, you could see paths in the forest, and they had -- I don't know where I got them, but they were very good. </sentence><sentence id="448">So I saw a curve in the road and it's where I was at, and I located myself and then I started out to cross this one road, a divided highway. </sentence><sentence id="449">And then I heard a big racket coming, I was right in the middle of it, it was quite wide, their divided highway was, and there's grass and s -- lot of trees growing in the middle of it. </sentence><sentence id="450">And around the corner I get -- hear them coming. </sentence><sentence id="451">So I dove into the grass and hear a bunch of German tanks and everything else was coming by, and guys in, I don't know, looked like armored cars or something, I didn't -- I wasn't able to really look, I was -- buried myself in the grass, hoping they   Interview with Chasten Bowen " April 26, 2013 didn't see me. </sentence><sentence id="452">And they went on by, didn't see me, so I thought[indecipherable] get out of here, so I headed back. </sentence><sentence id="453">And every time I seen one walking, I would just veer off at an angle. </sentence><sentence id="454">I wouldn't walk close to them, cause they'd see me, identify me. </sentence><sentence id="455">So I just kept quite a ways away, and veer off at an angle. </sentence><sentence id="456">I never made any sharp turns or quick turns or anything like that, and finally I came to this forest area, and I ran across an old deserted -- I don't know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but it was pretty dilapidated. </sentence><sentence id="457">So I went in there cause it had been raining, and I got all wet and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="458">So I took off my coveralls, cause I had coveralls with suspenders and stuff, my flight suit. </sentence><sentence id="459">So hung up on the thing in the top of it there, and laid down on the straw, and went to bed. </sentence><sentence id="460">And then the next morning, early the next morning, I don't know, seven -- six, seven o'clock, or what time it was, but I heard crack -- like sticks breaking,

about them probably. </sentence><sentence id="933">I don't know how many, there were hundreds of them around there. </sentence><sentence id="934">And you had to watch, because if you had any food left

id="935">It was better than nothing. </sentence><sentence id="936">And if one of -- if you had piece of those left, they'd steal it, those poor little Gypsy kids that were running around, they were hungry, you know, and they steal anything that wasn't tied down. </sentence><sentence id="937">And they were in a barracks there, and one day, it seemed like to me, they all disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="938">And they come down and got us and gave us that barracks. </sentence><sentence id="939">And I used to think, oh my, what'd they do, did they kill them all? </sentence><sentence id="940">They [indecipherable] their camp, what happened to them? </sentence><sentence id="941">I still to this day don't know really what all happened to those poor little kids. </sentence><sentence id="942">But they were little -- you know, from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, all the eastern countries that they picked them up, their parents were probably killed, and they brought them in there. </sentence><sentence id="943">But that was -- that's been kind of a  Interview with Chasten Bowen *deg April 26, 2013 disturbing thing all my life, the -- what happened to those poor little kids, you know. </sentence><sentence id="944">But we wer -- we got the barracks and -- and we were fortunate to get those, you know, and then we were there I don't know how long and we got a bowl of grass soup every day, you know, and three -- we got about three little potatoes once a week or so, and -- and then they brought in some -- a barrel one time of la -- like little sardines, they were just in saltwater, they were raw things, you know, dead, but -- and were in saltwater, real heavy brine saltwater. </sentence><sentence id="945">And of course we ate those things like crazy. </sentence><sentence id="946">And w-we associated with all the other prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="947">There was a -- right near -- across from our barracks was a Polish barracks, and one day there was a big scuffle over there, you saw a whole bunch of them piling on some guy, and you wonder what happened. </sentence><sentence id="948">Well, later on I fou -- h-heard that this one Polish guy had been at another camp, and apparently he had been a snitch or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="949">And I don't know if it was a fake, or what, but they said he knocked a bowl of soup out of one of the guy's hands. </sentence><sentence id="950">So a bunch of them jumped on him and put a blanket over his head and slugged him to death. </sentence><sentence id="951">It was just, you know, dog eat dog type attitude. </sentence><sentence id="952">And then they had these guys, you maybe heard of kapos, they were called kapos. </sentence><sentence id="953">These were German prisoners, but they had given them special rations to be --and they were all big guys, and they'd give them a big board or a club, like a baseball bat, and they were to keep us other prisoners in line, to obey orders you  Interview with Chasten Bowen "" April 26, 2013 know. </sentence><sentence id="954">Line up, do this, to go here. </sentence><sentence id="955">So everybody tried to stay away from those kapos. </sentence><sentence id="956">And so -- but I used to talk to some of the Polish guys over there spoke English, and you -- I don't know if you've ever heard of the esso -- SOE guys, they were British and -- and some of them were Scottish, most of them British. </sentence><sentence id="957">But they were secret type guys, operations guys that were dropped behind the German lines to do sabotage and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="958">And they were about -- oh, there must have been 30 or so of them in there, 35 or 40. </sentence><sentence id="959">And one day they took -- took -- I heard -- I don't know how many, but th -- 17 of them went into Weimar, and I guess were tried, they brought them back and killed them. </sentence><sentence id="960">And later on they killed all the other guys. </sentence><sentence id="961">But I used to talk to some of those guys, and I found out two of them were from Scotland, they were twins, and one had had a scar up in his shoulder, and they put a scar on the other one's shoulder just like it. </sentence><sentence id="962">And they had -- one would be up in Bremen, up in northern Germany, another would be down in Munich and something would happen, a big explosion or something would happen, they'd catch this guy and -- cause he was there, and he had the evidence, because you know, he'd be -- be real obvious around someplace, and he said no, I was, you know, here. </sentence><sentence id="963">I wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="964">And here that they -- they finally coupled the fact together that this -- they were twins, and the Germans finally caught them both. </sentence><sentence id="965">And later on they were both killed. </sentence><sentence id="966">They killed all those SOE guys, the British guys. </sentence><sentence id="967">And the Russian guys   Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 --ILused to talk to some of the Russians, they'd speak a little bit of English, and one of them used to tell me all the time that America would never survive because we produced so many airplanes and stuff like that, and we would financially and everything, fold after the war, that we couldn't stand all that production, and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="968">A few little conversations like that we had with the Russians, you know, that did speak some English. </sentence><sentence id="969">And they -- I don't know if you've ever seen the [indecipherable] but I didn't know til after the war that they had a building up there, the Russians, a lot of them disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="970">They would take them up there and there was a like a--a medical examination. </sentence><sentence id="971">They'd stand them on some scales, and they had a hole right behind the scales, there in the wall, and a gun back there, and they'd turn around like that, and shoot them right through the back of the head. </sentence><sentence id="972">And they eliminated a whole bunch of Russians that way by -- by make -- make them think they were giving them a medical, they were standing on the scale, then bam, they're gone. </sentence><sentence id="973">And the crematorium there was -- I've been there a few times after the war, after I been out of there, and they still have the hooks on the wall where they used to hang the prisoners, and they would cut them, their legs and bodies, and bleed -- let the blood drain out of them into the drain, because then they would burn them in the crematorium upstairs, and they had these little trollies that they'd lay them on and wheel them up there, and then wheel them into these chambers up  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with

stacked by the crematorium all day long. </sentence><sentence id="975">The -- used to see so much inhumanity to man, that you couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="976">You're already a prisoner, and you'd be sta-- we'd stand up there -- we counted -- they called it appel. </sentence><sentence id="977">My number was 78,336, but -- and we weren't tattooed, and we used to ask the kapos, the fa -- the kapos told us that we were not tattooed because we were trading material. </sentence><sentence id="978">I guess -- we -- we assumed that that was going to be trading for German

</sentence><sentence id="980">But there were about -- later on I found there were about, probably about 50,000 prisoners there, you know [indecipherable] 78,000, but they were dying off so fast, and I later fi -- learned after the war that -- from the archives at Buchenwald that the diet was designed to starve you to death in about three months. </sentence><sentence id="981">Keep cycling prisoners through there, cause they needed ru -- labor, slave labor to work in the pri -- in the factories and stuff, you know? </sentence><sentence id="982">So that was one way of just getting rid of them,
