<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Bertna Belle Pasternak. </sentence><sentence id="4">Now, my name is Bernard. </sentence><sentence id="5">It went from Belle to Bernard. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in a place. </sentence><sentence id="7">It was Martimorish (ph). </sentence><sentence id="8">It's in Romania, and the city is Visho. </sentence><sentence id="9">In Visho, when Romania was there it was Vishosimos. </sentence><sentence id="10">And also, they called that city Feldesisho because the Hungarians were there. </sentence><sentence id="11">The area where I was born was surrounded with mountains around. </sentence><sentence id="12">We had high peaks of mountains over there which there was snow almost all year around. </sentence><sentence id="13">About September the snow melted, something like this and then a month later the snow came back. </sentence><sentence id="14">The area was a beautiful area surrounded with water. </sentence><sentence id="15">We had water. </sentence><sentence id="16">We had everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="17">We were there, approximately a few thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="18">There was a few thousand Germans and also a few thousands Rumanians and Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="19">We all had areas, different areas. </sentence><sentence id="20">The Jews had their Jewish quarter. </sentence><sentence id="21">The Rumanians the other quarter, the Germans the other quarter and the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="22">The Germans were not the same type of Germans as in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="23">They all speak German, but they call them Sipser (ph), a Shwab, some kind of a Shwab name. </sentence><sentence id="24">There was a lot of them, and we all understand each other and we got along great. </sentence><sentence id="25">In the city, in the Visho, as a matter of fact, the Jewish life was so great over there that on Friday, we had a whistle blowing when the Shobot comes, three times. </sentence><sentence id="26">The first whistle meant close the store. </sentence><sentence id="27">The second whistle meant you should be home by now, and the third one to light candles. </sentence><sentence id="28">That was the greatest thing to happen. </sentence><sentence id="29">We also had a there which children were coming from all around learning and that by us. </sentence><sentence id="30">We  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mountains, there was potatoes, beans, corns, so almost everybody had a little farm. </sentence><sentence id="31">We stored away the food for the wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="32">We put it in basements, whoever had basements and we kept on going day by day. </sentence><sentence id="33">We had no telephone of course. </sentence><sentence id="34">We had no radios and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="35">It was like in the early 1900 century. </sentence><sentence id="36">It didn't change much, the life. </sentence><sentence id="37">There was a lot of poor people in the area also because I came from a five sisters and two brothers, but most of the families were much larger, and it was not easy to keep up so many people to feed the people. </sentence><sentence id="38">The father only had the work over there. </sentence><sentence id="39">The mothers over there, like the Jewish mothers, they always took care of their children. </sentence><sentence id="40">They were trying to do the best they can to see that everybody is nourished the right way and lived the right way. </sentence><sentence id="41">But there were other kinds of things over there, the life was very harsh, the way it happened there. </sentence><sentence id="42">It started with beatings. </sentence><sentence id="43">No matter what you do, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="44">You went to Hadre, you didn't know the thing, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="45">You walked in the street, if there was an older man and you didn't give him the right of way, he give you a beating. </sentence><sentence id="46">You went to school which the principal from the school, his name was Hugar. </sentence><sentence id="47">He was standing in the steps just wait for children to come in and he pulled their hair so much until the kid collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="48">Then we went in the school. </sentence><sentence id="49">We sit down, there must be a least 300 children approximately. </sentence><sentence id="50">Now, the teacher came in. </sentence><sentence id="51">When the teacher came in, you could drop a pin, and it was so quiet nobody made a move. </sentence><sentence id="52">The teacher walked around and they didn't like any child or whatever it is, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="53">So, that's the way life was in school. </sentence><sentence id="54">Unfortunately I was a lefty, and I could not write with my right hand because I was a lefty. </sentence><sentence id="55">So, the teacher was watching most of the people who were lefties. </sentence><sentence id="56">She had a big stick, I would say at least one inch thick, short stick. </sentence><sentence id="57">When I had to write, I grabbed the pencil with the left hand, and I wanted to do what I have to do from the work. </sentence><sentence id="58">When the teacher noticed, she came over with that stick and it almost broke my arm. </sentence><sentence id="59">But there was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="60">I had to learn how to write with my right hand, which by the way away now, I do write with my right hand. </sentence><sentence id="61">It's the same thing with the food. </sentence><sentence id="62">If you're a lefty, of course you take the spoon and start eating with your left hand. </sentence><sentence id="63">You got a beating that time, too, because you're supposed to eat with your right hand. </sentence><sentence id="64">Everything came out with force just to do with the right hand. </sentence><sentence id="65">When I grow up a little bit bigger, I went to learn at a tin smith and he only had to shear with right hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="66">I had to learn how to cut with my right hand because there was no left hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="67">Like I was saying, life was going on with the Romanians, I was working during the day. </sentence><sentence id="68">Whenever I had time, sometimes in between sometimes I was working, helped out a little bit until 1940 when the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="69">The Romanians went out and the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="70">Once the Hungarians came in, the old timers used to tell us how good it was by the Hungarians before the World War so we should be happy that the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="71">Life would be different. </sentence><sentence id="72">What happened, there was a few soldiers, Jewish soldiers and they came over to us and they said this is not the same Hungarians that the older people know. </sentence><sentence id="73">This is a different type of Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="74">All right. </sentence><sentence id="75">In the beginning it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="76">A year or two or something, it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="77">By the way, in schooling, in the thirties, the late thirties, there was a Romanian, there was a party, an anti-Semitic party. </sentence><sentence id="78">Koozar was the name of the minister and the Prime Minster was Googar. </sentence><sentence id="79">Koozer and Googar. </sentence><sentence id="80">In the late thirties they came in to make the pogroms, and we were so worried they were going to come to Visho because we know they're coming to Visho to make the This is

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="83">What happened when it came to the area, the Visho left, they turned right and they went to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="84">They burned the whole town. </sentence><sentence id="85">They killed a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="86">They destroyed everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="87">That was in the late thirties. </sentence><sentence id="88">At that time, the anti- semitic thing was so big, all the things were so big, that I couldn't go to school any more. </sentence><sentence id="89">All my schooling was four years. </sentence><sentence id="90">I could not go to school any more due to the fact that I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="91">My parents whatever they could they give us a little private lesson, whatever we could just to keep up the thing. </sentence><sentence id="92">My father was a singer on the weddings. </sentence><sentence id="93">He was also a canter, and he was one of the greatest men from the area. </sentence><sentence id="94">They used to call him all around the area for states to sing and things. </sentence><sentence id="95">He used to put words together. </sentence><sentence id="96">If he would have been here in this country he would be the greatest man in the country as a singer. </sentence><sentence id="97">So, it was very hard to even keep up with the families so he also had a job -- like we had horse and wagon, which almost everybody had that thing. </sentence><sentence id="98">We had a little farm there to try and grow some food things like that, but life was very hard, very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="99">When the Hungarians were in already for a few years, then we saw the true colors from the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="100">First of all, they put us, we have to give a day's work, everybody has to give a free day's work. </sentence><sentence id="101">So, I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="102">I give them a day's work, so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too, if they pay you, you could work for somebody else too. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work. </sentence><sentence id="104">The people who had stores think like this. </sentence><sentence id="105">I used to get paid and go to work. </sentence><sentence id="106">What was the work?Most of the work was preparation for the war. </sentence><sentence id="107">We went out to work on the volleys. </sentence><sentence id="108">We dig big holes. </sentence><sentence id="109">We put trenches around the tanks should not come through. </sentence><sentence id="110">The Russian tanks should not be able to come through the area. </sentence><sentence id="111">So, we worked day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="112">After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work, so they put us to working more days. </sentence><sentence id="113">So, really we had the most miserable life of the Hungarians for the past few years. </sentence><sentence id="114">They took away everything whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="115">If somebody had a cow, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="116">If they had a horse, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="117">They left you flat with everything. </sentence><sentence id="118">The area where I was with all the people who we got along so great all those years, they looked the other way. </sentence><sentence id="119">I don't think there was one person who survived over there that somebody should hide that person. </sentence><sentence id="120">There was not such a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: This was from what period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: That was the period since the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="246">I would say from 1942 to 1944, because the first, in the beginning it was not too bad with the Hungarians, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="247">They needed the wood and there was a wood factory. </sentence><sentence id="248">I worked in the mountains where they sawed the wood and we cleaned off, you know around the wood they had that black thing around the wood, we chopped it off to clean the wood to be able to bring it down to prepare if for wood. </sentence><sentence id="249">So, it was a very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="250">We got paid very little. </sentence><sentence id="251">We got paid -- talking about child labor. </sentence><sentence id="252">You were 15, 16 and you put in eight, ten, twelve hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="253">It was the same thing with almost with everybody had to go through the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the Ghetto, tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other parts of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="264">Did they know what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="265">Did they know about concentration camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>

After, I would say in "43, we already it got very, very bad in general. </sentence><sentence id="272">Very bad for everybody for every Jew. </sentence><sentence id="273">If a Hungarian soldier passed on the street, the first thing he called over a Jew and he hit them. </sentence><sentence id="274">No reason. </sentence><sentence id="275">He went to the horses, they were riding horses, he would beat them up. </sentence><sentence id="276">Then later on, we heard something, that something is going on in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="277">There was something, a daughter-in-law was from Poland and she wrote a letter. </sentence><sentence id="278">She was in Poland and her husband was in Visho. </sentence><sentence id="279">They couldn't get together because the war started already. </sentence><sentence id="280">So, she wrote a letter and it was censored so bad, that he couldn't write anything what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="281">So, I will never forget this woman was a rabbi's daughter-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="282">So, she wrote for her husband and which I said for the rabbi, she wrote in the letter we should know what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="283">She wrote like this. </sentence><sentence id="284">There is that means money, is no more. </sentence><sentence id="285">It doesn't  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they had farms - the Jewish people and they put away their food for the winter time. </sentence><sentence id="286">They have them in the basement there. </sentence><sentence id="287">Let's bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="288">Let's feed them otherwise it's going to rot away anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="289">And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around. </sentence><sentence id="290">I got permission to go out of the Ghetto and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="291">Mostly what we brought in was potatoes, things like this because corn there was a lot of them. </sentence><sentence id="292">Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="293">They were already probably got their orders to round us out and start shipping out. </sentence><sentence id="294">They put us in the line, find out how many people there are and they made four transports. </sentence><sentence id="295">My father was -- when they round them up, when the German soldier passed, he give him some kind of a salute, so the guy looked at him and he asked him, he said, "Are you a military man?" </sentence><sentence id="296">He said, "Yes I am, this and this front and I am an officer." </sentence><sentence id="297">Do you have a -- well, he didn't do anything he just

thing you see there. </sentence><sentence id="299">First we were going for about a day or so and then they opened the door for everybody and says there is water in the station here because those days all the trains were going with water, so they had to pump in the water. </sentence><sentence id="300">So, they opened the door and they were watching us like the biggest criminals with guns and says only one to leave the car and go fill up with water for the rest of the people. </sentence><sentence id="301">It happened I was the one and my father was the one. </sentence><sentence id="302">We tried to supply water, whatever we could to the other cars, and then my father saw a hatch on the boxcar, because every boxcar had a hatch probably for the . </sentence><sentence id="303">He took that so nobody should see it. </sentence><sentence id="304">We finish with the water, then close the boxcar and we started going. </sentence><sentence id="305">Then my father called my over and said, "Let's dig a hole in there. </sentence><sentence id="306">Let's break the floor there to make a facility." </sentence><sentence id="307">We worked quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="308">It was very dark and we carted through and we made a facility there to go out like a thing. </sentence><sentence id="309">Everybody was using this. </sentence><sentence id="310">We were putting something  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection remember they opened for water and after that they did not open for water. </sentence><sentence id="311">The trains were going so fast. </sentence><sentence id="312">Usually in those days a train in Romania those days was going about 30 miles an hour. </sentence><sentence id="313">You couldn't go any more because you had to put the water in, the coal, all those things. </sentence><sentence id="314">It took a very long time for those trains until they reached the destination. </sentence><sentence id="315">But when we went in those boxcars, the trains were going so fast, my God, it must have been 60 or 70 miles an hours. </sentence><sentence id="316">We thought the train is going to flap over, things like this, because he was carrying animals in there. </sentence><sentence id="317">What difference does it make what happened to the train. </sentence><sentence id="318">Now, when we arrived already in Auschwitz, there was a lot of people over there came to the train. </sentence><sentence id="319">People were already in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="320">They came over and they say, if you have small child, give it to an older lady. </sentence><sentence id="321">So, my sister said to the guy, I have a small child and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="322">He said, "Give it to your mother." </sentence><sentence id="323">So, I had a little sister and my mother and of course my nephew, they went with my mother on the one side. </sentence><sentence id="324">They looked, I saw a guy over there was looking and he put his hand out and he make like this. </sentence><sentence id="325">After I find out there was . </sentence><sentence id="326">I didn't even know who that is. </sentence><sentence id="327">After I find out that that was the guy who did all those things. </sentence><sentence id="328">He selected them. </sentence><sentence id="329">I was very worried because the younger one they put them all with the older people so I was pretty worried because I see what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="330">I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to work. </sentence><sentence id="331">They put them in another area for work. </sentence><sentence id="332">So, finally I was dressed, you know, at that time we had clothes from the Ghetto, people had so much clothes, so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work. </sentence><sentence id="333">That's what happened after. </sentence><sentence id="334">And that time there is other guys they came over and they says to us, "Do you see over there, the smoke over there?" </sentence><sentence id="335">And I said yes, what's going on over there? </sentence><sentence id="336">What are they doing there? </sentence><sentence id="337">He says, "They're burning people there." </sentence><sentence id="338">I said, burning people? </sentence><sentence id="339">He said yes, they call it a crematorium and they're burning people over there. </sentence><sentence id="340">Then he said to me do you see all those people they are going over there. </sentence><sentence id="341">This is the people who were there already. </sentence><sentence id="342">We went from there, we went in the camp from there. </sentence><sentence id="343">First, we had to take the clothes off and throw it in the corner there. </sentence><sentence id="344">I took my coat and I throw it in the corner there. </sentence><sentence id="345">I figure it's going to be over soon and I'll take my coat back. </sentence><sentence id="346">It never happened. </sentence><sentence id="347">So, then we went to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="348">We went in the inside where they told the people what to do, where to go. </sentence><sentence id="349">We were lined up over there, and they first of all the guy who commanded the whole thing came out. </sentence><sentence id="350">He made an appeal, an appeal they call it, to see how many people he has in his jurisdiction. </sentence><sentence id="351">Then another guy came over and he says, I was with my father, near my father at that time, he came over and he said is there here any mechanics, any electricians. </sentence><sentence id="352">I was a tin smith and mechanic right away I want to be. </sentence><sentence id="353">The other people said good for you you're going to be a mechanic and you're going to do better than we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="354">My father says to me why go over. </sentence><sentence id="355">Let's be all together. </sentence><sentence id="356">Let's go together. </sentence><sentence id="357">The people in the barracks they were saying, why don't you let him go as a mechanic. </sentence><sentence id="358">Why -- suppose we go in another place. </sentence><sentence id="359">We could see already what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="360">Let him go over there. </sentence><sentence id="361">So finally my father says okay, go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="362">We went to another place in the camp there in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="363">The whole thing was only a few days. </sentence><sentence id="364">We went to another place and then all those mechanics they had we got round up and we were taking by big trucks to . </sentence><sentence id="365">We did not know at that time they took us to . </sentence><sentence id="366">We  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection figured there is the mechanics thing and there we were going to work. </sentence><sentence id="367">We arrived in . </sentence><sentence id="368">There was a camp over there already prepared. </sentence><sentence id="369">You got your place over there and everything and then we find out we're going to work in a coal mine. </sentence><sentence id="370">That's what they did with all of the mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="371">They put us in the coal mine. </sentence><sentence id="372">The next day we went already to work which they were putting it --- there was three shifts. </sentence><sentence id="373">There was a morning shift, a noon shift and a night shift. </sentence><sentence id="374">We went to the coal mine there and there was two types of mines in there. </sentence><sentence id="375">First one was about 1,000 feet and one was about 1500 or 1600 feet. </sentence><sentence id="376">I was working in the lower one, about 1500 feet. </sentence><sentence id="377">We came down there. </sentence><sentence id="378">They give you a light. </sentence><sentence id="379">They give you a light to go to be able to see because it's so dark. </sentence><sentence id="380">They gave me a lantern. </sentence><sentence id="381">The number was 4400. </sentence><sentence id="382">Also, when I go back, when I was in Auschwitz the time before I went to the camp, they give me they tattoo it, I got a tattoo in my arm because most of the people they sent to work they put a tattoo in my arm. </sentence><sentence id="383">I got the tattoo and I was so naive at that time. </sentence><sentence id="384">I was there with my cousin and we still didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="385">I saw they give numbers and I saw some people get smaller number and bigger number and I went to where they give a bigger number. </sentence><sentence id="386">Because we were naive we said let's have a bigger number. </sentence><sentence id="387">What they did to my cousin, I got 84 whatever I got number and he got a number after mine and something went wrong there and they put his head in a drum of water and they drowned him and he died on the spot over there. </sentence><sentence id="388">You never lasted more than a day over there in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="389">Then when we were going back, we went down to the coal mine --

</sentence><sentence id="972">To go back, we arrived in New York, like I said, I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="973">I got a job in the metal factory. </sentence><sentence id="974">First I did

like to take over the area, to be the lead man. </sentence><sentence id="979">I was in the union at that time. </sentence><sentence id="980">So, I says, I'm in the union, they give you pension, all
