<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Bertna Belle Pasternak. </sentence><sentence id="4">Now, my name is Bernard. </sentence><sentence id="5">It went from Belle to Bernard. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in a place. </sentence><sentence id="7">It was Martimorish (ph). </sentence><sentence id="8">It's in Romania, and the city is Visho. </sentence><sentence id="9">In Visho, when Romania was there it was Vishosimos. </sentence><sentence id="10">And also, they called that city Feldesisho because the Hungarians were there. </sentence><sentence id="11">The area where I was born was surrounded with mountains around. </sentence><sentence id="12">We had high peaks of mountains over there which there was snow almost all year around. </sentence><sentence id="13">About September the snow melted, something like this and then a month later the snow came back. </sentence><sentence id="14">The area was a beautiful area surrounded with water. </sentence><sentence id="15">We had water. </sentence><sentence id="16">We had everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="17">We were there, approximately a few thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="18">There was a few thousand Germans and also a few thousands Rumanians and Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="19">We all had areas, different areas. </sentence><sentence id="20">The Jews had their Jewish quarter. </sentence><sentence id="21">The Rumanians the other quarter, the Germans the other quarter and the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="22">The Germans were not the same type of Germans as in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="23">They all speak German, but they call them Sipser (ph), a Shwab, some kind of a Shwab name. </sentence><sentence id="24">There was a lot of them, and we all understand each other and we got along great. </sentence><sentence id="25">In the city, in the Visho, as a matter of fact, the Jewish life was so great over there that on Friday, we had a whistle blowing when the Shobot comes, three times. </sentence><sentence id="26">The first whistle meant close the store. </sentence><sentence id="27">The second whistle meant you should be home by now, and the third one to light candles. </sentence><sentence id="28">That was the greatest thing to happen. </sentence><sentence id="29">We also had a there which children were coming from all around learning and that by us. </sentence><sentence id="30">We had five schools. </sentence><sentence id="31">They named them number one, number three, number four and five. </sentence><sentence id="32">We also had about four or five shulls, and we all belonged to different area. </sentence><sentence id="33">Everybody had a different way to go wherever he wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="34">We were assigned to go to school number one which it was I would say about a half a mile. </sentence><sentence id="35">The area there -- there was no transportation like you have over here. </sentence><sentence id="36">We walked to school. </sentence><sentence id="37">The school wasn't so bad to walk except there were hills when you got to the school there. </sentence><sentence id="38">Also there was another system too over there. </sentence><sentence id="39">We went to Hebrew in the morning until 9:30, from 7:00 until about 9:30. </sentence><sentence id="40">At 9:30 we went to the Romanian school. </sentence><sentence id="41">We had lunch a little bit, about a half an hour, and then in the afternoon until 4:00. </sentence><sentence id="42">4:00 we went back to Hebrew school until about 8:00. </sentence><sentence id="43">Now, what did we do over there all this time, you know, with the children when they're grown up? </sentence><sentence id="44">Industrial life, there was only how should I say, wood factories. </sentence><sentence id="45">We had a lot of wood. </sentence><sentence id="46">All the time, when the Hungarians were before the First World War, and the Austrian life was very beautiful over there, very great. </sentence><sentence id="47">On the beginning on the 18th century, the beginning of the 18th century, the first Jew came over from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="48">He settled in Martimorish because there wasn't such a good life there so they kept on coming and coming. </sentence><sentence id="49">They settled. </sentence><sentence id="50">But after the Romanians took over, after the first world war, the Romanians took over and life turned sour because the Rumanians didn't need any wood and there was no other industry so it wasn't so great for everybody over there. </sentence><sentence id="51">Their lives started to be very poor, but what we grew over there and the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="52">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="53"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mountains, there was potatoes, beans, corns, so almost everybody had a little farm. </sentence><sentence id="54">We stored away the food for the wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="55">We put it in basements, whoever had basements and we kept on going day by day. </sentence><sentence id="56">We had no telephone of course. </sentence><sentence id="57">We had no radios and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="58">It was like in the early 1900 century. </sentence><sentence id="59">It didn't change much, the life. </sentence><sentence id="60">There was a lot of poor people in the area also because I came from a five sisters and two brothers, but most of the families were much larger, and it was not easy to keep up so many people to feed the people. </sentence><sentence id="61">The father only had the work over there. </sentence><sentence id="62">The mothers over there, like the Jewish mothers, they always took care of their children. </sentence><sentence id="63">They were trying to do the best they can to see that everybody is nourished the right way and lived the right way. </sentence><sentence id="64">But there were other kinds of things over there, the life was very harsh, the way it happened there. </sentence><sentence id="65">It started with beatings. </sentence><sentence id="66">No matter what you do, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="67">You went to Hadre, you didn't know the thing, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="68">You walked in the street, if there was an older man and you didn't give him the right of way, he give you a beating. </sentence><sentence id="69">You went to school which the principal from the school, his name was Hugar. </sentence><sentence id="70">He was standing in the steps just wait for children to come in and he pulled their hair so much until the kid collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="71">Then we went in the school. </sentence><sentence id="72">We sit down, there must be a least 300 children approximately. </sentence><sentence id="73">Now, the teacher came in. </sentence><sentence id="74">When the teacher came in, you could drop a pin, and it was so quiet nobody made a move. </sentence><sentence id="75">The teacher walked around and they didn't like any child or whatever it is, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="76">So, that's the way life was in school. </sentence><sentence id="77">Unfortunately I was a lefty, and I could not write with my right hand because I was a lefty. </sentence><sentence id="78">So, the teacher was watching most of the people who were lefties. </sentence><sentence id="79">She had a big stick, I would say at least one inch thick, short stick. </sentence><sentence id="80">When I had to write, I grabbed the pencil with the left hand, and I wanted to do what I have to do from the work. </sentence><sentence id="81">When the teacher noticed, she came over with that stick and it almost broke my arm. </sentence><sentence id="82">But there was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="83">I had to learn how to write with my right hand, which by the way away now, I do write with my right hand. </sentence><sentence id="84">It's the same thing with the food. </sentence><sentence id="85">If you're a lefty, of course you take the spoon and start eating with your left hand. </sentence><sentence id="86">You got a beating that time, too, because you're supposed to eat with your right hand. </sentence><sentence id="87">Everything came out with force just to do with the right hand. </sentence><sentence id="88">When I grow up a little bit bigger, I went to learn at a tin smith and he only had to shear with right hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="89">I had to learn how to cut with my right hand because there was no left hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="90">Like I was saying, life was going on with the Romanians, I was working during the day. </sentence><sentence id="91">Whenever I had time, sometimes in between sometimes I was working, helped out a little bit until 1940 when the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="92">The Romanians went out and the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="93">Once the Hungarians came in, the old timers used to tell us how good it was by the Hungarians before the World War so we should be happy that the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="94">Life would be different. </sentence><sentence id="95">What happened, there was a few soldiers, Jewish soldiers and they came over to us and they said this is not the same Hungarians that the older people know. </sentence><sentence id="96">This is a different type of Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="97">All right. </sentence><sentence id="98">In the beginning it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="99">A year or two or something, it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="100">By the way, in schooling, in the thirties, the late thirties, there was a Romanian, there was a party, an anti-Semitic party. </sentence><sentence id="101">Koozar was the name of the minister and the Prime Minster was Googar. </sentence><sentence id="102">Koozer and Googar. </sentence><sentence id="103">In the late thirties they came in to make the pogroms, and we were so worried they were going to come to Visho because we know they're coming to Visho to make the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="104">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="105"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="106">What happened when it came to the area, the Visho left, they turned right and they went to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="107">They burned the whole town. </sentence><sentence id="108">They killed a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="109">They destroyed everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="110">That was in the late thirties. </sentence><sentence id="111">At that time, the anti- semitic thing was so big, all the things were so big, that I couldn't go to school any more. </sentence><sentence id="112">All my schooling was four years. </sentence><sentence id="113">I could not go to school any more due to the fact that I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="114">My parents whatever they could they give us a little private lesson, whatever we could just to keep up the thing. </sentence><sentence id="115">My father was a singer on the weddings. </sentence><sentence id="116">He was also a canter, and he was one of the greatest men from the area. </sentence><sentence id="117">They used to call him all around the area for states to sing and things. </sentence><sentence id="118">He used to put words together. </sentence><sentence id="119">If he would have been here in this country he would be the greatest man in the country as a singer. </sentence><sentence id="120">So, it was very hard to even keep up with the families so he also had a job -- like we had horse and wagon, which almost everybody had that thing. </sentence><sentence id="121">We had a little farm there to try and grow some food things like that, but life was very hard, very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="122">When the Hungarians were in already for a few years, then we saw the true colors from the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="123">First of all, they put us, we have to give a day's work, everybody has to give a free day's work. </sentence><sentence id="124">So, I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="125">I give them a day's work, so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too, if they pay you, you could work for somebody else too. </sentence><sentence id="126">So, I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work. </sentence><sentence id="127">The people who had stores think like this. </sentence><sentence id="128">I used to get paid and go to work. </sentence><sentence id="129">What was the work?Most of the work was preparation for the war. </sentence><sentence id="130">We went out to work on the volleys. </sentence><sentence id="131">We dig big holes. </sentence><sentence id="132">We put trenches around the tanks should not come through. </sentence><sentence id="133">The Russian tanks should not be able to come through the area. </sentence><sentence id="134">So, we worked day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="135">After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work, so they put us to working more days. </sentence><sentence id="136">So, really we had the most miserable life of the Hungarians for the past few years. </sentence><sentence id="137">They took away everything whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="138">If somebody had a cow, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="139">If they had a horse, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="140">They left you flat with everything. </sentence><sentence id="141">The area where I was with all the people who we got along so great all those years, they looked the other way. </sentence><sentence id="142">I don't think there was one person who survived over there that somebody should hide that person. </sentence><sentence id="143">There was not such a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: This was from what period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: That was the period since the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="293">I would say from 1942 to 1944, because the first, in the beginning it was not too bad with the Hungarians, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="294">They needed the wood and there was a wood factory. </sentence><sentence id="295">I worked in the mountains where they sawed the wood and we cleaned off, you know around the wood they had that black thing around the wood, we chopped it off to clean the wood to be able to bring it down to prepare if for wood. </sentence><sentence id="296">So, it was a very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="297">We got paid very little. </sentence><sentence id="298">We got paid -- talking about child labor. </sentence><sentence id="299">You were 15, 16 and you put in eight, ten, twelve hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="300">It was the same thing with almost with everybody had to go through the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the Ghetto, tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other parts of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="311">Did they know what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="312">Did they know about concentration camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="316"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="317">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="318"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection A. After, I would say in "43, we already it got very, very bad in general. </sentence><sentence id="319">Very bad for everybody for every Jew. </sentence><sentence id="320">If a Hungarian soldier passed on the street, the first thing he called over a Jew and he hit them. </sentence><sentence id="321">No reason. </sentence><sentence id="322">He went to the horses, they were riding horses, he would beat them up. </sentence><sentence id="323">Then later on, we heard something, that something is going on in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="324">There was something, a daughter-in-law was from Poland and she wrote a letter. </sentence><sentence id="325">She was in Poland and her husband was in Visho. </sentence><sentence id="326">They couldn't get together because the war started already. </sentence><sentence id="327">So, she wrote a letter and it was censored so bad, that he couldn't write anything what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="328">So, I will never forget this woman was a rabbi's daughter-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="329">So, she wrote for her husband and which I said for the rabbi, she wrote in the letter we should know what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="330">She wrote like this. </sentence><sentence id="331">There is that means money, is no more. </sentence><sentence id="332">It doesn't exit any more. </sentence><sentence id="333">So we know from that two words we started to figure out what's going on in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="334">There was no radio or any other communication. </sentence><sentence id="335">We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="336">Later on, the situation got very bad. </sentence><sentence id="337">We heard, first of all before the state came, they called to the Army. </sentence><sentence id="338">They were calling all the Jewish children who were at age at that time, who were 17, 18 19 to go to the Army. </sentence><sentence id="339">In the Army they used those Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="340">They used them to bring ammunition to the front line to do all kind of work for the Hungarian Army. </sentence><sentence id="341">The Army -- they had uniformed Army, they had yellow around the arms -- armband, yellow. </sentence><sentence id="342">This way they recognized them as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="343">There was also another group where they had white arm bands. </sentence><sentence id="344">That means they were not pure Jews. </sentence><sentence id="345">The mother was Jewish or the father was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="346">So, they had two type of things. </sentence><sentence id="347">I did not go -- I'm supposed to go to the Army at that time, my father says to me, you don't have to go, let's go together because we don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="348">He also told me something -- he told me it looks like something is going on terrible in the world. </sentence><sentence id="349">I don't think you're going to be a Hungarian soldier. </sentence><sentence id="350">I think you are going to be some other place. </sentence><sentence id="351">Then, we all got together. </sentence><sentence id="352">They called us. </sentence><sentence id="353">How did they get the people together? </sentence><sentence id="354">There were drums. </sentence><sentence id="355">If you know when sometimes they have a drum and they bang on the drum and they got the people together, that was a sign that the whole town to get together because there is some news to tell. </sentence><sentence id="356">Then they tell us that everybody there's going to be a round up and they have to go in this and this area like but us on the street. </sentence><sentence id="357">There was the Jewish street and they started making the Ghetto all around. </sentence><sentence id="358">The Jewish street over there and the Romanian street's name was , the number was 25. </sentence><sentence id="359">The Hungarian name was 32. </sentence><sentence id="360">So, the reason is because I tell you this is because when they got us all together they told us which street to get in together. </sentence><sentence id="361">So this was the word the guy was using to get us there. </sentence><sentence id="362">And the same thing they got all around the town all around the little towns and they got all these people together and they bring them in and that's street around the area. </sentence><sentence id="363">We had so many people in the room that there was no room where to sleep or where to go or what to do anything because one was on top of the other one. </sentence><sentence id="364">The time wasn't too long in there. </sentence><sentence id="365">We was about a month in there. </sentence><sentence id="366">They were-- who was watching the Ghetto was the Hungarians and the Germans, the local people was watching in there. </sentence><sentence id="367">The food was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="368">There was no food in there. </sentence><sentence id="369">My father used to know all those big shots in there from the town and he used to help a lot of people out. </sentence><sentence id="370">If they were having a problem, he used to help them out. </sentence><sentence id="371">He used to go there, so he went over to one of those guards and he said, "look we are all together in one place." </sentence><sentence id="372">Those people This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="373">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="374"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they had farms - the Jewish people and they put away their food for the winter time. </sentence><sentence id="375">They have them in the basement there. </sentence><sentence id="376">Let's bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="377">Let's feed them otherwise it's going to rot away anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="378">And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around. </sentence><sentence id="379">I got permission to go out of the Ghetto and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="380">Mostly what we brought in was potatoes, things like this because corn there was a lot of them. </sentence><sentence id="381">Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="382">They were already probably got their orders to round us out and start shipping out. </sentence><sentence id="383">They put us in the line, find out how many people there are and they made four transports. </sentence><sentence id="384">My father was -- when they round them up, when the German soldier passed, he give him some kind of a salute, so the guy looked at him and he asked him, he said, "Are you a military man?" </sentence><sentence id="385">He said, "Yes I am, this and this front and I am an officer." </sentence><sentence id="386">Do you have a -- well, he didn't do anything he just bypassed and to find out that information. </sentence><sentence id="387">They made like I said four transports. </sentence><sentence id="388">We had two stations train stations. </sentence><sentence id="389">One stations they called it the small station where the train used to stop and drop off people, and the one station was a bigger station where the railroad came in. </sentence><sentence id="390">I also want to say that before all those things, I worked for the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="391">We took apart the tracks, the Romanian tracks, you know from the trains, and we send them into Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="392">So, I was loading and unloading the tracks. </sentence><sentence id="393">There was two Hungarian officers and they are not supposed to hire Jewish children for the job. </sentence><sentence id="394">When I went in there and applied for the job, he asked me the name, he asked me what your name, I said Bernard Pasternak. </sentence><sentence id="395">He said that sounds too Jewish, so he changed my name for Pasteronish. </sentence><sentence id="396">That's a real Hungarian name, and I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="397">They paid very good. </sentence><sentence id="398">We had it very good for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="399">The job only lasted for a few months because there wasn't so many tracks to pick apart and we loaded them. </sentence><sentence id="400">We did not load them in the same town, in Visho from the same city, we had to go about 50 miles away where they loaded those tracks. </sentence><sentence id="401">So we went with the big trucks and we unloaded. </sentence><sentence id="402">That was before the Ghetto and all those things happened. </sentence><sentence id="403">We -- due to the fact they were short on box cars, so they made four transports and we were going on the fourth transport. </sentence><sentence id="404">When they got together everybody, they told them don't take anything, just take what you could take with you because you have on other things over there and you wouldn't need them. </sentence><sentence id="405">To that point, we didn't know what was going on -- absolutely nothing. </sentence><sentence id="406">As a matter of fact, they told us we were going to working camps until the war is over for security reasons or whatever they want. </sentence><sentence id="407">We arrived with the fourth transport. </sentence><sentence id="408">With the other three transports, I mean it was about two days apart, so the other three transports left. </sentence><sentence id="409">When we got to our transport, I saw the box car and we saw all those things what happened. </sentence><sentence id="410">People on there with small children crying throwing packets down on the Hungarian soldiers and the collaborators pulling the bags out of the family they are taking away everything. </sentence><sentence id="411">They didn't need it anyhow, but we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="412">So finally, we went in the boxcars. </sentence><sentence id="413">I don't know, probably must have been 20 or 30 boxcars in there. </sentence><sentence id="414">We went in that car. </sentence><sentence id="415">He push you in, maybe seventy, eighty people. </sentence><sentence id="416">You can't tell how many you have with children, older ladies and things like this, and then they close the door and they locked it with a lock on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="417">The only air you had in that boxcar was if you see a boxcar, the ones you see in the Holocaust Museum, the same boxcar was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the same one they were taking away. </sentence><sentence id="420">All you could see is the same thing you see there. </sentence><sentence id="421">First we were going for about a day or so and then they opened the door for everybody and says there is water in the station here because those days all the trains were going with water, so they had to pump in the water. </sentence><sentence id="422">So, they opened the door and they were watching us like the biggest criminals with guns and says only one to leave the car and go fill up with water for the rest of the people. </sentence><sentence id="423">It happened I was the one and my father was the one. </sentence><sentence id="424">We tried to supply water, whatever we could to the other cars, and then my father saw a hatch on the boxcar, because every boxcar had a hatch probably for the . </sentence><sentence id="425">He took that so nobody should see it. </sentence><sentence id="426">We finish with the water, then close the boxcar and we started going. </sentence><sentence id="427">Then my father called my over and said, "Let's dig a hole in there. </sentence><sentence id="428">Let's break the floor there to make a facility." </sentence><sentence id="429">We worked quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="430">It was very dark and we carted through and we made a facility there to go out like a thing. </sentence><sentence id="431">Everybody was using this. </sentence><sentence id="432">We were putting something around there so people would have a little privacy. </sentence><sentence id="433">It took quite a few days before we got to Auschwitz, but the middle of the way there was a few guys in the boxcar they told me, if you could pay attention, are we turning left or right and Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="434">I says to the guy, no we are turning left, he says that's bad news because right is to Hungary, left is to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="435">It's the one other area. </sentence><sentence id="436">I don't remember if it took five days or six days. </sentence><sentence id="437">When we got off in Auschwitz, first of all in that time when I was taking the water there was a couple of dead children already, which I took them out and there was somebody going through with a carriage or wagon and I put them in the wagon because there was a lot of sick children already and they caught already. </sentence><sentence id="438">Nothing in there was no food, no nothing, very little things whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="439">And the car, like my mother will know something. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Who gave you permission to leave, or did you sneak out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="575">You couldn't sneak out because the Ghetto was surrounded by corroborators to make sure nobody was out. </sentence><sentence id="576">And besides that, which I did not mention, you already had the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="577">You had the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing the yellow star you were finished. </sentence><sentence id="578">So, right away they know you. </sentence><sentence id="579">And I think all the things that my father knew so many of those guys and they hand picked a few of the people to go out of the Ghetto to bring in the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="580">It wasn't -- the neighborhood was quite a ride, maybe thirty, forty miles in some area until we got all the food together and brought it in in the tank. </sentence><sentence id="581">Like I was saying, in the car, my mother put her hands around and squeezed me. </sentence><sentence id="582">She said, "I hope you remember me." </sentence><sentence id="583">I did not know what she meant because we were so naive we didn't know what's going on until the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="584">When we got off of the train, first what I saw it was sickening just to see. </sentence><sentence id="585">Our boxcar had the only one facility from all the 40 or 50 wagons, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="586">They opened the door, all the dirt came out when they opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="587">People were half to the waist with that dirt

fast. </sentence><sentence id="593">Usually in those days a train in Romania those days was going about 30 miles an hour. </sentence><sentence id="594">You couldn't go any more because you had to put the water in, the coal, all those things. </sentence><sentence id="595">It took a very long time for those trains until they reached the destination. </sentence><sentence id="596">But when we went in those boxcars, the trains were going so fast, my God, it must have been 60 or 70 miles an hours. </sentence><sentence id="597">We thought the train is going to flap over, things like this, because he was carrying animals in there. </sentence><sentence id="598">What difference does it make what happened to the train. </sentence><sentence id="599">Now, when we arrived already in Auschwitz, there was a lot of people over there came to the train. </sentence><sentence id="600">People were already in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="601">They came over and they say, if you have small child, give it to an older lady. </sentence><sentence id="602">So, my sister said to the guy, I have a small child and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="603">He said, "Give it to your mother." </sentence><sentence id="604">So, I had a little sister and my mother and of course my nephew, they went with my mother on the one side. </sentence><sentence id="605">They looked, I saw a guy over there was looking and he put his hand out and he make like this. </sentence><sentence id="606">After I find out there was . </sentence><sentence id="607">I didn't even know who that is. </sentence><sentence id="608">After I find out that that was the guy who did all those things. </sentence><sentence id="609">He selected them. </sentence><sentence id="610">I was very worried because the younger one they put them all with the older people so I was pretty worried because I see what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="611">I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to work. </sentence><sentence id="612">They put them in another area for work. </sentence><sentence id="613">So, finally I was dressed, you know, at that time we had clothes from the Ghetto, people had so much clothes, so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work. </sentence><sentence id="614">That's what happened after. </sentence><sentence id="615">And that time there is other guys they came over and they says to us, "Do you see over there, the smoke over there?" </sentence><sentence id="616">And I said yes, what's going on over there? </sentence><sentence id="617">What are they doing there? </sentence><sentence id="618">He says, "They're burning people there." </sentence><sentence id="619">I said, burning people? </sentence><sentence id="620">He said yes, they call it a crematorium and they're burning people over there. </sentence><sentence id="621">Then he said to me do you see all those people they are going over there. </sentence><sentence id="622">This is the people who were there already. </sentence><sentence id="623">We went from there, we went in the camp from there. </sentence><sentence id="624">First, we had to take the clothes off and throw it in the corner there. </sentence><sentence id="625">I took my coat and I throw it in the corner there. </sentence><sentence id="626">I figure it's going to be over soon and I'll take my coat back. </sentence><sentence id="627">It never happened. </sentence><sentence id="628">So, then we went to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="629">We went in the inside where they told the people what to do, where to go. </sentence><sentence id="630">We were lined up over there, and they first of all the guy who commanded the whole thing came out. </sentence><sentence id="631">He made an appeal, an appeal they call it, to see how many people he has in his jurisdiction. </sentence><sentence id="632">Then another guy came over and he says, I was with my father, near my father at that time, he came over and he said is there here any mechanics, any electricians. </sentence><sentence id="633">I was a tin smith and mechanic right away I want to be. </sentence><sentence id="634">The other people said good for you you're going to be a mechanic and you're going to do better than we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="635">My father says to me why go over. </sentence><sentence id="636">Let's be all together. </sentence><sentence id="637">Let's go together.

was 4400. </sentence><sentence id="665">Also, when I go back, when I was in Auschwitz the time before I went to the camp, they give me they tattoo it, I got a tattoo in my arm because most of the

still didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="668">I saw they give numbers and I saw some people get smaller number and bigger number and I went to where they give a bigger number.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: No, we did not know what happened to my mother until after I find out a few days later. </sentence><sentence id="781">Even they pointed out to us, we could not believe it. </sentence><sentence id="782">Then some people were talking about the people and who worked in the crematorium, they call it the . </sentence><sentence id="783">They were saying to me, that's the living in that barracks over there, they have everything over there because they are doing such a special job. </sentence><sentence id="784">Well, we did not know after a while they got rid of the and took new people. </sentence><sentence id="785">We didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="786">Then we find out after what happened and who the was and what they did after a while. </sentence><sentence id="787">With my father, I was there after the first line up, the first appeal after that. </sentence><sentence id="788">Then, I went to the place where the coal mine was and my father wasn't at that place, and I never heard from him after. </sentence><sentence id="789">I never heard what happened. </sentence><sentence id="790">We went down in the coal mine, like I said, my lantern was 4400 and we were working with civilian Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="791">The light --my light had a red stripe around and the civilian had white. </sentence><sentence id="792">We also to recognize us, in the center of the hat there was a cut in straight, this way they recognize you right away in case you run away someplace. </sentence><sentence id="793">They put me

id="796">The one I was it was approximately four or five feet high. </sentence><sentence id="797">That doesn't mean there's coal in the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="798">The coal is only about two feet in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="799">In order to get the coal out, you have to have some kind of supporters to hold up, to be able to take the coal out. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="803">So, you had to have special supporters to hold up and then to dig the coal out to get the coal out. </sentence><sentence id="804">Once we got the coal out from there, you took it out with a shovel and there was something not far from where you throw the shovel there, it was something, it was going up and down, five inches up, five inches down, you know it was shaking until the coal went down, because it was a little down hill over there. </sentence><sentence id="805">There was one day when they come to inspect it looks like the Germans didn't get enough coal and they came to inspect the mines. </sentence><sentence id="806">What happened how come there is no more coming out. </sentence><sentence id="807">I saw some people from far away, but I didn't pay much attention who they are, but they did look to me like they're civilians, Polish civilians, work in the mine. </sentence><sentence id="808">They come around and they stop everybody over there who were working there. </sentence><sentence id="809">Some of them they said report to the office, which I never saw those people again anymore. </sentence><sentence id="810">So they took them off the line and they got new people. </sentence><sentence id="811">Then I was told they eliminated them because they didn't do the job. </sentence><sentence id="812">Somehow, for some reason I don't know I always worked very hard all my life and I saw there is no way out. </sentence><sentence id="813">You really have to work if you want to survive. </sentence><sentence id="814">So, I picked up work, kept on working the right way and they come around, the inspectors, the Nazi inspector, they came around and they checked me out, how I worked. </sentence><sentence id="815">Then the guy asked me, what is your number. </sentence><sentence id="816">I showed him my tattoo and so the other guy says to me, you know you're going to have a lot of problems because they took your number down like the other guy. </sentence><sentence id="817">No, it was the other way around, believe it or not. </sentence><sentence id="818">They gave me a premium of a bottle of wine because I was a good worker. </sentence><sentence id="819">I took the bottle of wine and turned it in for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="820">I gave it to one of the kapos inside. </sentence><sentence id="821">They gave me a piece of bread for it, which I wouldn't drink it anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="822">Also, for the good workers, they also give two cigarettes a day. </sentence><sentence id="823">I also turned in my cigarettes for a little soup or whatever they could. </sentence><sentence id="824">There were some people who were chain smokers, they give away their food for the cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="825">There was quite a few prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war, and most of them they give away the cigarettes for the thing. </sentence><sentence id="826">What did we eat when going into the mine? </sentence><sentence id="827">In the morning, we had black coffee with a little piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="828">Of course there was no lunch. </sentence><sentence id="829">Lunch you were at the mercy of the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="830">If you find a good civilian there, he'd throw you a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="831">If you find a civilian who didn't have or he didn't care, you were there with bread, without a little piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="832">Somehow, someway I managed to recognize the guys a little bit, I always had a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="833">We were working until 6:00 at night. </sentence><sentence id="834">From 8:00 in the morning until about 6:00 at night. </sentence><sentence id="835">Something like that. </sentence><sentence id="836">Like I was saying, there was a morning and a noon shift and a night shift. </sentence><sentence id="837">The night shift, the people who brought the SS who escorted the morning shift had to take back the noon shift from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="838">They always took back a shift because we didn't walk back to the camp without a Nazi guard, which I would say it was a 15, 20 minute to half hour walk. </sentence><sentence id="839">At night they had to take us back, they brought another shift and they had to take us back to the camp there. </sentence><sentence id="840">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="841">We had something to finish and those Germans did not wait for us. </sentence><sentence id="842">We were sitting in that coal mine until the next evening. </sentence><sentence id="843">No food, absolutely no food, no nothing, only the mercy, whatever the civilian throw you a piece of bread of things like this. </sentence><sentence id="844">I also, on Sunday we did not work. </sentence><sentence id="845">We worked six days a week. </sentence><sentence id="846">On Sunday I also volunteer to clean the barracks a little bit for that I got another little soup. </sentence><sentence id="847">I always tried to manage somehow to get a little more. </sentence><sentence id="848">When

</sentence><sentence id="851">I used to carry it for them or for that when I went back to the camp they give me another little piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="852">So, I was trying to look around to see how I should be able to get a little bit more than I could get. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="930">Q: When you were working in the coal mine, if you missed the SS going back to the camp, and you spent the whole night in the coal mine, were there guards there that you couldn't have left a night, you were locked in the coal mines? </sentence><sentence id="931">Did you work if you got stuck there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: No, you did not work when you got stuck there and you couldn't leave the coal mine because you had 1500 feet to go up by elevator. </sentence><sentence id="935">The lift took you down, so you couldn't leave anyhow and there was guards over there and a lot of corroborators. </sentence><sentence id="936">You couldn't go no place and you had to stay right in there. </sentence><sentence id="937">It was pretty cool too, it was July, August and it was pretty cool. </sentence><sentence id="938">There was horses and wagons in there. </sentence><sentence id="939">There was little wagons not with the train, you pushed it by hand the railroad train. </sentence><sentence id="940">There was a lot of things going on in that mine. </sentence><sentence id="941">When you came out of that mine, you know it almost blinded you. </sentence><sentence id="942">I had to keep my hand for a few minutes on my eyes because down in the mine, I saw very well like it was daylight, once you get used to it. </sentence><sentence id="943">Then when you came out, you have to be prepared otherwise you would lose your eyes. </sentence><sentence id="944">When we went back to the camp, like I said, you have to take a shower every night. </sentence><sentence id="945">The place, I would describe it, it wasn't a dirty place. </sentence><sentence id="946">Really, they kept it very clean and we were forced to keep it clean. </sentence><sentence id="947">In the morning when we get up, we had to make our bed. </sentence><sentence id="948">It was a three bunk bed and when you make the bed the one was helping the other one. </sentence><sentence id="949">If there was a little bit uneven they came they take it apart and you have to go all over again. </sentence><sentence id="950">Sometimes you couldn't even mix a little piece of bread with coffee, black coffee, because you had to make sure the bed is all right. </sentence><sentence id="951">When we came home, we took a shower and in this camp there was also other people who did not work in the coal mines. </sentence><sentence id="952">They called them . </sentence><sentence id="953">That means they were working outside in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="954">We were getting different soap than the was getting. </sentence><sentence id="955">They got a little piece of white soap, and we got a piece of yellow soap. </sentence><sentence id="956">The white soap did not take off the dirt, the coal dirt, because when we came out from there we were black, coal black. </sentence><sentence id="957">We were --for two or three days we were spitting black. </sentence><sentence id="958">So, this yellow soap was very good soap. </sentence><sentence id="959">It did the job. </sentence><sentence id="960">It cleaned everything off. </sentence><sentence id="961">Somehow, we got together with some people over there and we saw that piece of yellow soap, I would describe it it was about four by three inches and maybe one inch thick. </sentence><sentence id="962">Four by three approximately. </sentence><sentence id="963">And that soap was written a R-I-F. We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="964">We always said one to the other one give me RIF soap, give me a piece of RIF because it's better. </sentence><sentence id="965">You also had to be careful because they only give you a certain time, they give you the soap it should last you a certain time, but when you bend down, you know, sometimes they stole the piece of soap. </sentence><sentence id="966">That soap, the civilian used to buy it. </sentence><sentence id="967">You know, you could put it in the pocket and bring it out, you got an extra piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="968">So, you had to be very careful it shouldn't be stolen. </sentence><sentence id="969">But later on, I was told that the R-I-F meant fat, pure Jewish fat. </sentence><sentence id="970">That was what I was told. </sentence></p></dialogue>

cold this time of the year. </sentence><sentence id="1408">So, they were looking for boxcar and they came around the Germans they say the language I had no problem because I spoke the language. </sentence><sentence id="1409">So they said there is no more boxcars we had to go in open cars. </sentence><sentence id="1410">So there was some open cars over there and there was some snow then maybe two feet of snow was inside in those cars. </sentence><sentence id="1411">It looks like they didn't use them for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1412">The first thing we did was a few guys over there with the little strength we had we pushed the snow to the center a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1413">We went in maybe eighty ninety people in that open car. </sentence><sentence id="1414">Some of the people you know we were all around, sitting all around that car but some of the people had no room to get in there so they were staying in the center of the car, of that boxcar.

</sentence><sentence id="1421">When I give it out to everybody, there was nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="1422">It was exactly what I said. </sentence><sentence id="1423">So, we were going for another few days, we were driving in the car for another few days and the only food we had was like a piece a bread and the margarine. </sentence><sentence id="1424">The margarine was so hard that I was nibbling in the margarine. </sentence><sentence id="1425">It was hard. </sentence><sentence id="1426">We didn't know where we were going, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Finally the

came so long, which actually, they waved at us the people over there. </sentence><sentence id="1705">That low they came down. </sentence><sentence id="1706">I really couldn't make out what kind of a plane they were, whether they were British or which Allies they were, but I did find out. </sentence><sentence id="1707">They were American planes. </sentence><sentence id="1708">I did find out that after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1709">Then finally we arrived in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1710">In Buchenwald when we arrived it was one of the miserable things that ever happened

was no such thing anymore about names and numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1720">You went over to get the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1721">You were lined up a few thousand people because there was camp from before. </sentence><sentence id="1722">They brought in other camps in that center camp. </sentence><sentence id="1723">You lined up by the time you took the food -- when they give you the food, by the time a few feet away, they grabbed it from you already. </sentence><sentence id="1724">The people themselves, the hungry people, they grabbed you. </sentence><sentence id="1725">You had to be very lucky to eat the food they give it to you over there because somebody would grab it. </sentence><sentence id="1726">When I saw what happened when it came to my turn, as soon as they put it in, I swallowed it on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1727">I didn't even carry it further down. </sentence><sentence id="1728">Sometimes I was lucky and I went twice in the lines.

touch my nose it was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="1741">So, I was laying down on the ground and I touch my nose and whatever blood I had I had in my mouth, put it in my mouth and lay down flat on my back with the eyes turned over. </sentence><sentence id="1742">I was so skinny. </sentence><sentence id="1743">I don't know how many pounds I have, maybe 50, 60, 40. </sentence><sentence id="1744">I don't know how many pounds I had. </sentence><sentence id="1745">I was laying and then I saw the dead bodies how they look, so I was imitating the dead bodies over there.

open my eyes to see who was around. </sentence><sentence id="1753">Then a guy walks around and says whoever can get up get because the Germans are gone, the Americans are here, at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Now we tried to get up whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I saw American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1756">Several of them were speaking Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1757">They came around and they talk in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1758">That was one of the greatest things. </sentence><sentence id="1759">American soldier to come over to me and say in Yiddish, is there more Jews around? </sentence><sentence id="1760">I said they're all Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1761">Most of them are all Jews around. </sentence><sentence id="1762">They were trying to do whatever they can. </sentence><sentence id="1763">They did not touch us because we were all sick. </sentence><sentence id="1764">Not to get any disease from that thing. </sentence><sentence id="1765">I see more soldiers and more soldiers coming around and checking out what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="1766">Later on, a while later I find out that guy who was watching and looking there it was General Patton's third army. </sentence><sentence id="1767">Those people liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="1768">It took a little while until everybody come to himself. </sentence><sentence id="1769">It was one of the biggest mistake that our own people in the camps did. </sentence><sentence id="1770">They went and emptied out all the food that the Germans had accumulated. </sentence><sentence id="1771">They brought it in to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1772">Nobody told us be careful, your stomach has shrunk. </sentence><sentence id="1773">We started eating whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="1774">I got a hole in a box of dog dishes and I kept on eating dog dishes until I got typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1775">I got so sick they took me in a hospital, in the camp hospital, which it was a Nazi hospital and guess who was the doctor? </sentence><sentence id="1776">The Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1777">The German Nazis who wanted to destroy me, they are the ones that treated me in the camp because they were prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1778">It took quite a while until I came to myself but I could tell you one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1779">I had a headache for five years. </sentence><sentence id="1780">I couldn't get rid of the headache day and night from that typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1781">What happened to the other people? </sentence><sentence id="1782">Most of them died from overeating after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1783">They were eating -- there were so many things to eat it was a very few people who understand. </sentence><sentence id="1784">Then the German doctor told me in German, don't eat so much because your stomach is not strong enough. </sentence><sentence id="1785">We felt a little better. </sentence><sentence id="1786">We went out of the city which the next city near Buchenwald was Vilmar. </sentence><sentence id="1787">That's a city. </sentence><sentence id="1788">We saw so many American soldiers over there. </sentence><sentence id="1789">I don't know, there were thousands and thousands.

would get sick with so much food. </sentence><sentence id="1795">I got a hold of a box of chewing gum. </sentence><sentence id="1796">I took the box of chewing gum and I take one and oh, that tastes good. </sentence><sentence id="1797">I take another one, that tastes good. </sentence><sentence id="1798">Then I took four or five at the time and oh, that tastes good. </sentence><sentence

id="1806">I said how do you chew it. </sentence><sentence id="1807">So he showed me how you chew it. </sentence><sentence id="1808">When I went out again in the city, I saw so many people chewing that we recognize right away our people because they were chewing so funny. </sentence><sentence id="1809">We know right away from looking around everybody wanted to be an American to chew the gum at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1810">So we were over there I'd say about a month or two months. </sentence><sentence id="1811">Then they had lists over there of where your family and friends from other camps. </sentence><sentence id="1812">You could go in there and take a look and if you recognize anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1813">I saw my three sisters in a camp not far from there, in . </sentence><sentence id="1814">There was busses provided by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1815">Inside there was no more room, so I was riding on the roof, on top. </sentence><sentence

gave us a place over there, and he put over there in another place so this was the way we were all together at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1820">So that time we were together with three sisters, and I ask my sisters, because we had four sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1821">One sister I know, the younger one, they went with my mother I know. </sentence><sentence id="1822">So, I asked my other one, I said where is Esther, my younger sister? </sentence><sentence id="1823">So, she says, she died of the typhus, and they kept her where she was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1824">So, I saw we were together and then we made all the preparation to go back to Romania to find out to see maybe somebody is left to see us start life out again. </sentence><sentence id="1825">That is the time they made the agreement the way how Germany between the British, the Americans and Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1826">Due to the fact that the Russians were in Berlin, so the Americans had to go there too, so they gave up all the area over there to the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1827">And the Americans pulled in. </sentence><sentence id="1828">We was still in the camp in because we wanted to make preparation to go back to Romania to see who's left. </sentence><sentence id="1829">As the gang comes over, Jewish soldiers, and they said to us, all right, let's go in because we're going to leave the area and this is the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1830">When we were children we were told how good communism, how good the Russians are, how good everything is so you could have such a nice life. </sentence><sentence id="1831">You don't have to work, you get everything for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1832">When the guy told us this, I said what are you talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1833">We were told how good it is by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1834">Why should we leave them. </sentence><sentence id="1835">They're in the area we're going to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1836">That Jewish captain, because he had some stripes, he says it's not what they told you, it's what it is.

id="1840">That comes around, a bunch of Russians, dirty with watches on their arms, five or six watches, running after the girls which they couldn't stand on their legs how weak they are, saying if you step out of the line, we'll send you to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="1841">That was the thank you when they saw us over there. </sentence><sentence id="1842">We're going to send you to different type of work now, if you don't behave and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="1843">So, we started making preparations to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1844">We took trains,

arrived in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1847">We find already some collaborators from our town, and we tried to turn them in to the Russian. </sentence><sentence id="1848">We told them what

do. </sentence><sentence id="1854">We couldn't work it out. </sentence><sentence id="1855">We packed up whatever we had and we turned back. </sentence><sentence id="1856">The turning back was not so easy because you had to go out of the Russian zone. </sentence><sentence id="1857">We went in -- from Romania we went into Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1858">We were staying in the field all day long because the Russians should not catch us to take us back to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="1859">Finally we went into Hungary and from Hungary we went to Budapest and Budapest there was already operating a kitchen from . </sentence><sentence id="1860">We had food in there. </sentence><sentence id="1861">We had shelter in there. </sentence><sentence id="1862">Our destination was not Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1863">Our destination was further down to Israel, whatever we go. </sentence><sentence id="1864">So, we went to the border by Austria-Hungary border. </sentence><sentence id="1865">There was a Russian guy. </sentence><sentence id="1866">His name was Sashka. </sentence><sentence id="1867">We sold something home in Wishno, whatever we had, and we got a little money in there. </sentence><sentence id="1868">This guy Sashka had truck and for a fee he took you over to Austria, because he couldn't cross the border. </sentence><sentence id="1869">This guy filled up a truck with people like cattle flat down, and we went across to Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1870">We went to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1871">When we went to Vienna there was already in the American zone, and we had to stay there a little bit in Vienna until they got all the trains ready. </sentence><sentence id="1872">Then we went to Saltzburg. </sentence><sentence id="1873">When we went through the border, the Russians had to examine everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1874">If they're not some of them were running away from the Army, which there was a lot of Russian Jewish officers. </sentence><sentence id="1875">They came with us because they went to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1876">So, they wanted to see if there were any deserters and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="1877">So, we said we were all Greeks. </sentence><sentence id="1878">We went on that plane as all Greeks from the war. </sentence><sentence id="1879">They came around no, we're Greek. </sentence><sentence id="1880">So, finally we cross the border and went into Lenz. </sentence><sentence id="1881">From Lenz, that's right over the border and we went over to Saltzburg. </sentence><sentence id="1882">Then we settled in Saltzburg. </sentence><sentence id="1883">I had one sister, she did not leave Romania so my brother went back from Saltzburg to bring him back into Saltzburg. </sentence><sentence id="1884">We were in Saltzburg for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1885">In the meantime, I was training myself to be a soldier, and Israeli soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1886">I was training . </sentence><sentence id="1887">I was very good in the training thing, which they told me I do very good. </sentence><sentence id="1888">My sister find out from my aunt, we had a few aunts, a couple aunts in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1889">She remembers the others where they are, so she wrote a letter to them, and they got back a letter with some money in the envelope in there. </sentence><sentence id="1890">He says, don't go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1891">You have time to go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1892">First come to America and then you go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1893">Let's come over here first and settle. </sentence><sentence id="1894">I was ready to go to Israel, so we had a big debate, and she told us how good America is. </sentence><sentence id="1895">They said they have everything you could find even money on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1896">I said to myself and to my brother, I said listen, look they have the Marshall plan, they got everything for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1897">Couldn't you imagine if you get everything over here for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1898">Couldn't you imagine if you go to the source. </sentence><sentence id="1899">So, finally we decided we go to America. </sentence><sentence id="1900">I came with the boat with General Greeley. </sentence><sentence id="1901">It was an American boat. </sentence><sentence id="1902">I came in December 1949. </sentence><sentence id="1903">It took over a week to get to the country. </sentence><sentence id="1904">I worked in the ship, also. </sentence><sentence id="1905">I worked in the kitchen, which I couldn't work too much because I was so seasick for a few days but then I felt better and I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="1906">We arrived in New York which the aunts picked us up. </sentence><sentence id="1907">So I was in a hotel, and also when they picked us up there was a taxi driver and he put six in the taxi to take us over. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I was the last one to get out of the taxi and I looked down and I looked all over and so the guy asked me in Yiddish he says, , what are you looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1909">I said I look for dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1910">He says, boy if you come for that, he says you don't know how you're going to get here until you get a dollar. </sentence><sentence id="1911">That was the hello in America. </sentence><sentence id="1912">So, then I went to the hotel, and then I got through friends, I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="1913">I was in the hotel only a few months. </sentence><sentence id="1914">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1918">We were riding on the slate roofs on top of the trains for days. </sentence><sentence id="1919">When a bridge came, you had to lay down flat before you know, you could get killed and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="1920">To go back, we arrived in New York, like I said, I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="1921">I got a job in the metal factory. </sentence><sentence id="1922">First I did odd jobs all over and then I got a job in a metal factory. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I was doing pretty good for about a year or so. </sentence><sentence id="1924">It was very hard work, and then the boss came over to me. </sentence><sentence id="1925">He looked at me and he says whatever I do, I just happen to do right. </sentence><sentence id="1926">He calls me over and he says how would you like to take over the area, to be the lead man. </sentence><sentence id="1927">I was in the union at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1928">So, I says, I'm in the union, they give you pension, all those things. </sentence><sentence id="1929">I started with the union. </sentence><sentence id="1930">He says, I'm not going to touch your union, just take over the job as a lead man. </sentence><sentence id="1931">I took over the job as a lead man, and I corrected a lot of mistakes in the department and that department started booming. </sentence><sentence id="1932">The boss comes again and he says, how about doing this and this and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="1933">So, finally I became the research and the developing machinery. </sentence><sentence id="1934">I know that because I was a mechanic so I had a lot of knowledge of machinery. </sentence><sentence id="1935">I was the one who went to buy machines all over the country for cleaning machines, cleaning special metal. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Like a metal engineer. </sentence><sentence id="1937">They even give me the title metal engineer. </sentence><sentence id="1938">I traveled all over. </sentence><sentence id="1939">I got machines in there. </sentence><sentence id="1940">As a matter of fact, there was one time, one of the bosses was a German Jew decent and he went to Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="1941">He bought a machine there, and I had to go there and check out that machine there in Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="1942">Which I said I'd never go back there, but I said a job is a job so I went back to Germany, checked out the machine on its progress and everything worked out good. </sentence><sentence id="1943">There was a time when I had over 200 people taking care over there. </sentence><sentence id="1944">There was an operation working day and night, brought in a lot of machines. </sentence><sentence id="1945">Then the place was sold to another corporation that wasn't so good, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1946">Then a few years later, I figure it's already time for me to look around. </sentence><sentence id="1947">I was already in my late 20s. </sentence><sentence id="1948">I start to look around and get married and bring up a family. </sentence><sentence id="1949">So, I went to places where young people got together, especially all the people who came from the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1950">We had a place. </sentence><sentence id="1951">There was the Hotel Diplomat and other places we used to get together. </sentence><sentence id="1952">So, I went there with some friends and I asked my friend, who is that girl over there. </sentence><sentence id="1953">Oh she said, my friend, would you like to know her? </sentence><sentence id="1954">I go over there and I start talking a little bit and I asked her where she comes. </sentence><sentence id="1955">She also comes from the area where I came, and she became my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1956">We got to know each other. </sentence><sentence
