<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1"> JACOB WIENER February 8, 1996 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2">Q: Rabbi Weiner, when we finished up with your earlier interview, you were talking about after Kristallnacht, in December of 1938, you went to Hamburg and stayed with your sister for about a week, who was living there. </sentence><sentence id="3">What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the rest of your family was and did you have any contact with them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4">A: My family was, my whole family was in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="5">My brother who had run away from Bremen had also come to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="6">My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in Hamburg, so they were all in Hamburg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: Your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: My father was also in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="13">After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I returned to Bremen and we were living in the same house where we had lived before. </sentence><sentence id="14">We were searching the house and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything upside-down, we put the whole house in order and we were living there and repairing as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="15">In addition we tried to emigrate and find a place where to emigrate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="20">Q: And what were the results of that effort? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we have no place, we like to help you, but we can't. </sentence><sentence id="23">Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November ninth to the 10th, 1938 of November, we wrote again to these people and we told them about my mother and especially my father's cousin, who was living in Yorktown(ph), Saskatchewan, if he could do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="24">This time we got a letter from him, that he would talk to the member of Parliament in Canada and find how to get us special permission. </sentence><sentence id="25">And he would then send us what is called a landing card, that we were allowed to land. </sentence><sentence id="26">After a few weeks, we got this landing card. </sentence><sentence id="27">Now the question was to leave Germany. </sentence><sentence id="28">You needed first of all, permission from the German government and they would be there when we would pack our things. </sentence><sentence id="29">But first of all we had to get tickets to go to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="30">My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph), which is a shipping company in Germany, and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German company, they told us they were all booked up for two years. </sentence><sentence id="31">We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to Hamburg again and Hamburg had that, Hamburg had a connection with British Airline, with the British, not airline, with the British shipping line, the Koolnot(ph) Whitestar(ph) line and he met a man from there and he said he would get us passage to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="32">However, to get there, we needed first to go by ferry boat, from Hamburg to England and from England to Southampton, we would take a boat to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="33">When the landing cart came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he arranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="34">We were traveling five people, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="35">But we needed money for the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="36">In order to do this, we had to sell our house. </sentence><sentence id="37">Now there was one woman, --__ woman, who the Nazi's had planted into our house, she wanted to buy it. </sentence><sentence id="38">Of course she bought it with very little money, just enough money to pay for the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="39">So we had the tickets and we set our date, I mean in fact the date was set by the shipping company, for May 31, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="40">On that day we would leave Germany with the ferry boat. </sentence><sentence id="41">Many other things happened between December and May, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="42">For instance, one thing which happened was in January, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="43">On the 18th of January, which was the Kaiser's birthday, before Hitler came to power, I got it, I was visiting a friend of ours, the family Greenberg(ph) and just about 10 o'clock I got a telegram which said, "Come to Berlin." </sentence><sentence id="44">I didn't know originally from whom it came, but it came from a friend of mine who was working with a Jewish organization, the same I had been working for and I knew that I would go to Berlin and go to this organization. </sentence><sentence id="45">He said to me, my, the family I was working, I was visiting, said to me, "Go there    right away." </sentence><sentence id="46">So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the train station and the next train was going at 12 at night, so I took that night train. </sentence><sentence id="47">But it was a very uncomfortable trip because there were the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I walked around the train. </sentence><sentence id="48">It was what we call a express train, where there is a hallway at the side and then there are cabins in there. </sentence><sentence id="49">So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in Berlin, it wasn't my first time in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="50">It was a very rainy day and a dark day and I just started to walk. </sentence><sentence id="51">I came to the Brandenberger(ph) gate, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a sign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Jews are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very quickly through, there was no one really watching me and I walked to this place of our organization, I came to the fourth floor and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we are waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of course, that our friends, young people you see, would have a chance to go to Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, to the Baltic states and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation for emigration to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="52">Then they would recognize us and they would go there. </sentence><sentence id="53">So the whole day we were typing out, with the type machine, of course they had no electric typing machines at that time, we were typing out letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission, they were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in Latvia, I still have some letters in my files, and we gave them to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were freed from concentration camp and they came out. </sentence><sentence id="54">However, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, because afterwards the Nazis conquered Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania and you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them might have. </sentence><sentence id="55">So that was in January. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Now, I want to ask you a few questions about what you've just described. </sentence><sentence id="92">First of all, were you at this point, supposed to be identified as a Jew, did you wear a, were you wearing bands? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: No, no, they didn't have this, only in 1941 they made them, they made them wear the yellow star. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: And in terms of this operation in Berlin, what was this organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: It was a Jewish organization called Agoutis(ph) Israel and they were trying, like everyone else, trying to get Jews out. </sentence><sentence id="100">Sometimes you could find a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would accept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone knew it was fake, because especially the South American countries, Latin American countries were working very much with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, because I went to the South American diplomats very many times and they said to me, "Give us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will let you out." </sentence><sentence id="101">So I went, oh we don't do it, go to that company, to that country and they were all working together. </sentence><sentence id="102">Many times that's what happened and you know this from your history, people went out and they were not permitted in that country because they said we don't, these are illegal certificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many countries. </sentence><sentence id="103">But the Nazi's were very smart and they recognized the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see, either by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by the form of the head, because they measured them all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: This organization that you were working with in Berlin, was this in place for years, was this an outgrowth of political organizations you were involved with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: No, they had nothing to do with politics, actually. </sentence><sentence id="112">They were more or less a Jewish ____--s more, I would say more religious kind of organization than another kind of organization. </sentence><sentence id="113">But all organizations tried somehow to bring their members or to bring Jews out, because I can tell you, later on when I, all right, that comes later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Were you, my question is, were you affiliated with this organization or similar organizations, years before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="120">I was already, I was already affiliated with this organization since 1934. </sentence><sentence id="121">They had such an organization in Bremen, where I was living at that time, you see and it was at first a Zionist organization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious reasons and then there was a special teacher in Bremen, who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he was from this organization, from Agoutis(ph) Israel and I joined him. </sentence><sentence id="122">So I was already affiliated with this organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: And in 1934, what was the basic theme of the, the focus of this organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: The focus was to work for the Jews to go to Israel, mainly at that time, you see and also religiously, to make an organization where the people, where the Jews especially, became more religious instead of assimilation. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was a question of assimilation. </sentence><sentence id="131">It was a question of assimilation, emancipation. </sentence><sentence id="132">That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of uniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was more individualized, by themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: And you felt that was important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="140">Because as I had mentioned before, I said to the teacher when they changed this, the school days, from Saturday, from Shabbat, I said to him that I don't want to come to school any more on Shabbat, because I want to become more Orthodox, like the Germans want to become, in quotation marks, more German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: And this was your, this was really your own past, not your family's? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: No, because my father was, was not as religious you see, as my mother and my mother came from a religious family you see, but my father did not keep all the laws, but he was just Jewish </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Back to Agoutis(ph) in Berlin, was there any risk to what you were doing or was this basically authorized? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: It was not legally authorized, but everyone did it and the Nazis knew about it was be done, because the Nazis were interested at that time just to get the Jews out, until in 1941, when they had the final solution, you see and they didn't want them to _in there, they said, "The world does not take them, the world does not want them." </sentence><sentence id="148">As long as they saw a letter, you see, that another country was taking them, that was enough for them and they would sometimes, not always, let these people go and go there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: When you say you were able to help, maybe, a couple hundred people... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: How, how were these people chosen from where they, from where did you find them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: They were no lists, however we had friends and we knew from our organization, let's say my organization in Bremen at that time, I know names and besides is they had names, each one has names, each one of the people has some names, so they gave them the names and if people gave them different names, if friends gave them friends names, a friend, a friend, a friend, you see. </sentence><sentence id="158">So that's how they were choosing them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: So you helped whoever you could? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Whoever, yeah, </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: And how did you know that somebody was in Sachsenhausen or somebody was in Dachau, or wherever? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: These people sometimes wrote. </sentence><sentence id="166">If they were in Sachsenhausen, it say Sachsenhausen, near Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="167">Or Dachau near Munich. </sentence><sentence id="168">They wrote and at that time, we knew where the people were, besides this, as I can tell you later, I had some contact with the Gestapo and they told me that, "We have people here in Sachsenhausen," and so forth and forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: How long did you work with Agoutis(ph) in Berlin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: I only stayed there one day, however in this one day, you see, we did a lot of things, because on this one day, we wrote all these letters and we brought them to the, to the Nazis and they let them go, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="176">And then I went back to Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="177">I was still in contact with them afterwards, but this was a deadline, I think this 18th of January was a deadline that they gave us, so we came on that day and made it all final, in one day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Busy day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: So you went back to Bremen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: I went back to Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="188">Now one day it happened, we were always afraid, especially at nighttime that they may knock at the door and take us away and it happened one day, I think in, also in January one day they came, an ominous knock at the door in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="189">My brother who were, had, one of my brothers, who had remained in Hamburg and they had sent him to the Jewish hospital in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="190">First he was in Sachsenhausen and from Sachsenhausen, somehow, they arranged with the Hamburg, I don't know who, how, but he was in the Jewish hospital in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="191">So one night, they knocked at the door and I looked out of the window and I made myself not known, but they continued knocking and I said, "What can I lose?" </sentence><sentence id="192">I go downstairs, I open up. </sentence><sentence id="193">I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went downstairs, I opened up and he came in, not in Nazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform and he said to him, we have here a search warrant for your brother, Benu(ph), his name. </sentence><sentence id="194">I said to them, "Don't you know that he is in the hospital in Hamburg?" </sentence><sentence id="195">He made as if he didn't know anything, see, but come in and look through. </sentence><sentence id="196">They came through, they put upside-down the beds and this and they're all corner and then in the end I said, "You should have known that he is in Hamburg in the hospital." </sentence><sentence id="197">He said, "Yeah, excuse me" and they left. </sentence><sentence id="198">But they came in and they made a person scared, you know. </sentence><sentence id="199">They could always come in,    middle of the night and knock at the door. </sentence><sentence id="200">I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a bicycle, we had a bicycle, to the synagogue, which was about, by bicycle, 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I didn't mind. </sentence><sentence id="201">So this was 1939, in January. </sentence><sentence id="202">In February, the congregation in Bremen, the Jewish congregation in Bremen, organized itself again and they had a temporary president, vice-president and, but they had no place any more to live, so there was this one family, I mentioned before this family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a brother of this Greenberg and they had a house in Bremen and they had already left this house in September 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the Bremen congregation. </sentence><sentence id="203">I met him later on in New York. </sentence><sentence id="204">But this was a house in the old city and there were maybe 20 families living in this house now, besides that's the office of the congregation, was also in this house and we organized it. </sentence><sentence id="205">So we re-organized it, the congregation, you made a few things. </sentence><sentence id="206">Number one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and made translations, I knew a little bit of English, not too much. </sentence><sentence id="207">Number two, we organized some courses for women in sewing and other things like this. </sentence><sentence id="208">Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in Weisaminda(ph), which is near Bremerhaven(ph), that wanted some people to come and talk to them, so I went there sometimes and talked to them. </sentence><sentence id="209">Number four, we wanted to make a Jewish school again because the children did not go to school. </sentence><sentence id="210">I can speak about this later. </sentence><sentence id="211">And, besides this, number five, they wanted a person from the Jewish community to be acontact _, going to the Gestapo maybe once, twice, or maybe three times a week and tell them about what was happening in the congregation, so I was elected, appointed. </sentence><sentence id="212">So I went there many times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Were you and your father living in this Jewish house, community house now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: No, we did not live in this Jewish community house, we lived in our own house, but many people had no house any more, especially people from the small communities outside, you see. </sentence><sentence id="243">Many people in Germany, most people, most Jews in Germany, did not live in the big cities, they lived in small hamlets, how do you call it, villages and they came then to the bigger cities to be safer. </sentence><sentence id="244">So they appointed me and I went to the Gestapo and I never knew whether I would come out because ___-- Gestapo was a big building which had no sign outside. </sentence><sentence id="245">You didn't know that it was a Gestapo building. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was in a section of Bremen, they had and Bremen was a medieval city and it had a trench around it and around the trench was a street which was called Amvahl(ph), it means ___ in the war, there used to be war in medieval Germany, the cities had a wall around it and when I came there I had to push a button on top and the door would open and I would go in. </sentence><sentence id="247">And when I went in, there was a big picture, a man with two fingers on his lips that said silence, schweigne(ph), quiet. </sentence><sentence id="248">And then someone would tell me, "Come upstairs." </sentence><sentence id="249">I didn't know who it was, but I went upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="250">So I went upstairs, I went into this office and it was all clattered around with all kinds of things and this man was sitting there and his name was Mr. Parchman, | still remember that P-a-r-c-h-m-a-n and he was nobody, an illiterate person __--_--.-:~ And he said to me, "Sit down." </sentence><sentence id="251">Of course they address the Jews as Uder(ph) in German and they were very, very rude. </sentence><sentence id="252">Sit down. </sentence><sentence id="253">Then he took out and I remember the first time I came, he took out a bunch of pictures and papers and he said to me, "These are the pictures and papers which we rescued from your house." </sentence><sentence id="254">Rescued, you know. </sentence><sentence id="255">Was not rescued, they confiscated it. </sentence><sentence id="256">I said, "Can I have them?" </sentence><sentence id="257">So he gave me a little bit, not everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Why were they so nice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: They did not want to be complete, you see, every person, even the worst person in the world, sometimes has a soft moment. </sentence><sentence id="277">So he also had a soft moment at one time. </sentence><sentence id="278">He gave me a little bit, but what I asked him then, most of the time when I went to him, I asked him, "Can you get this person and this person," I've got a few names of people from the Jewish congregation who were in concentration camp, "I want this person to get out, can you get him out, will you let him out?" </sentence><sentence id="279">And that was the main purpose in the first part of my contacts with them, to save people, to let them out of concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="280">Sometimes he let them out, but not very many times, he said, "What's he going to do, where's he going to go," so forth. </sentence><sentence id="281">The second part of my contact with the Gestapo was to have permission to make a Jewish school, because the children didn't have any more school, they were forbidden to go in German school, even in Jewish school, no schools. </sentence><sentence id="282">So what do we want to teach them in the schools? </sentence><sentence id="283">I want to teach them how to leave Germany as quick as possible, because that's what you want. </sentence><sentence id="284">So what would he teach them? </sentence><sentence id="285">I will teach them English and geography and certain things which they might be able to use after the emigrate and also I will teach, I will give them a little bit of exercise, gymnastics or so, you see they have to be strong when they leave. </sentence><sentence id="286">So they went on, they said, "We have no place for German children and besides," says, "when do you want to teach the children?" </sentence><sentence id="287">In the morning you are not allowed to teach them, he told me, because then German children are being taught and German children cannot be taught at the same time when Jewish children are being taught and the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="288">So I, I negotiated with him for a long time and he didn't want to give us a Jewish school or a place, then I said to him, "What about a place," and I found a place, "near, near that hotel there, no one is there, it's not a school building, but it could be used as a school building and we can use it in the afternoon." " </sentence><sentence id="289">When do you want to teach the children, what time? </sentence><sentence id="290">Because the German children go to school until three-thirty in the afternoon, you can only teach them from four until about six or six-thirty." </sentence><sentence id="291">I said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="292">So finally he agreed and we had this place to take the Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="293">Now I made a list of Jewish children, we had about 40 Jewish children at that time, boys and girls in all ages, up to 15 or 16 years of age and some of them came from small villages outside. </sentence><sentence id="294">But the question was teachers, we had no teachers. </sentence><sentence id="295">So I knew some merchants, you see and I said to them, you teach him    this, you teach him this and I'll tell you what to do. </sentence><sentence id="296">So we, we had a few teachers, you see and they were not trained teachers, but I said the school should not be like a very slow, a very low elementary school, but more like a middle school or so, like a little bit higher school and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="297">So the school opened on April 12th, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="298">We left Germany in May 1939, end of May, May 31, 1939, so I was there just two months, but during that time, I hired a teacher, one of my, one of my colleagues from ____--_ seminary, where he was, had learned to be a teacher and he became my successor and the school stayed until about 1941, I think, when all the Jews were in Bremen, were sent to Minsk and Pinsk, in concentration camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Couple questions, I guess about school first. </sentence><sentence id="325">You said there were about how many students who were able to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: 42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: And were they all ages? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: All ages. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: Anybody who could, come? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Anybody who could come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: Do you think that that school was helpful in terms of morale, in terms of education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Yes, it was very helpful I think, because the parents, I mean when we had our first meeting and I gave them the introductory talk about what the school was going to be and what we would be teaching and so the parents also came and it was very helpful and in fact, I met two of my students from that time in New York later on. </sentence><sentence id="341">In fact, one of my, one of, no, at least two students who I met in New York, they are now married, you know and their husbands came to my classes here, which I gave here in America. </sentence><sentence id="342">So, it was helpful, I think.[end of side one, tape one]    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: I want to ask you a few questions about the Jewish community house. </sentence><sentence id="348">Do you think that everybody living together served a purpose other than just a place to live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="352">First of all, it was safer, they felt safer being together, you see, being among friends, being among people of their own kind, I mean, that already makes them feel safer. </sentence><sentence id="353">And besides this, if they had any problems, they had right away in that house, people whom they could ask and turn to, because these, and these, their Jewish community you see, had contacts with getting food, getting other things and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Did the Germans periodically come to the house, visit the house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: They knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="360">I don't remember any more, if they came, because I wasn't living there, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: Did people get around much or did they largely stay at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="676">So the greenhorns have first to be, have, cannot stay where they want to stay, they must go to their destination, because there's an affidavit that these people guaranteed that they would take care of them and the government will not take care of them, the Canadian government did not want to take care of them, they just wanted them out as much as possible, because Canada was not so friendly to the greenhorns, because I know about internment camps in Canada, where people from England were sent to and stayed there for many years. </sentence><sentence id="677">Okay, so my father and we, and we children, all left and he brought us to a small restaurant and we had breakfast there and then he brought us to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="678">Now the train in Canada at that time was a Canadian Pacific Train, railroad company I think it was and it was a small shack, I wouldn't call it more than a shack. </sentence><sentence id="679">It was a small shack and it was in June, on June 15th and it was very hot in Canada, we never had such heat before in Germany, was very hot and winter's very cold, summer's very hot. </sentence><sentence id="680">And we were sitting there and he, I don't know if he gave us a ticket, or somehow we stayed there, it was about 10 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="681">So we thought of how, what can we do in order to remain in Montreal, so we remembered one thing, that we had written to relatives in Montreal, my father had a cousin from Ekatarinaslav(ph) in Russia, who was a tailor and who had moved to Montreal and we had written them, but the letter had come back to Germany, addressee not found. </sentence><sentence id="682">So we said, maybe he's, he's still living there, my father said and he was sure that he was still living. </sentence><sentence id="683">Maybe we can find out, but how can we find out? </sentence><sentence id="684">So about 10:30 I think it was, there was a desk in the train station and two nuns came in, because Canada, Quebec is Catholic, you see and two nuns came in and they put on a light and the light said, traveler's aid. </sentence><sentence id="685">So my father said, "Maybe these nuns can find out if this family's still living here." </sentence><sentence id="686">So he went over to the nuns, but the nuns didn't speak English and we didn't speak French. </sentence><sentence id="687">So what language are you speaking in. </sentence><sentence id="688">So they knew Russian, my father    spoke Russian to them and he told them that we think there is a family living here, if they knew that we would be here, they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown(ph), Saskatchewan. </sentence><sentence id="689">So the nuns said, but what's their name? </sentence><sentence id="690">Said Kaplan. </sentence><sentence id="691">There are many Kaplans, come to find out, Caplan with a C, Kaplan with a K. What's the first name? </sentence><sentence id="692">Burr(ph) Kaplan. </sentence><sentence id="693">What's his profession? </sentence><sentence id="694">He was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="695">What's his mother's, his wife's name? </sentence><sentence id="696">Bebe(ph), I think. </sentence><sentence id="697">So they came and they took the telephone book I think, or address book that they had at that time and they went through it and they called up all these people and they called up and people came to the the phone and they said, no, I'm not from Ekatarinaslav(ph), I'm not a tailor, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="698">So they called up 15, 16 people, then they called up someone and there came a young boy at that time, of my age, from the phone and he said, I don't know, but I'll call my mother, so he called his mother, his mother says, "Yes, my husband's name is Burr(ph), he's a tailor, he came from Ekatarinaslav(ph), what are you calling about?" </sentence><sentence id="699">They said, "There are some people who are claim you are relatives and they want to talk to you." </sentence><sentence id="700">Okay, so made my father talk to them and my father right away recognized him, he seen him, he, not he, his wife, they hadn't seen each other for, at that time I mean, 15, 20 years and she said, "What? </sentence><sentence id="701">You're here? </sentence><sentence id="702">I have a son who is a pharmacist, his name is Jackie, so I call him and have come right over and we take you into our house." </sentence><sentence id="703">So we waited about 15 or 20 minutes and then he came and he came and he took us all and we went to, we went to the Kaplan's and we stayed there for a few days and in the mean time we did not go to, to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="704">But, what happened was this, in the mean time, about 11 o'clock, we had received a telegram, I don't know how it came to us, it came to the JIAS, probably, because the JIAS had sent them a telegram that your refugee, your family is here and we are going to send them right on to you, so they had sent a telegram, Western Union, I still have the certificate and they said to them, "Stay where you are, we cannot support you here because we had droughts for several years." </sentence><sentence id="705">They    were farmers and I was supposed to be a farmer and the young fellow at that time, who was about my age, I would be his farmer, you see and I never had seen the family, just recently, last year only, I met him. </sentence><sentence id="706">Now he is 72 years old. </sentence><sentence id="707">At that time he was 20. </sentence><sentence id="708">So what happened is, stay there. </sentence><sentence id="709">So he said to us, the man from the JIAS said to us, that doesn't matter because he promised to let you stay there and the Canadian government made us promise them that we will send them all back there, but this is____ how we stayed there, through America, because the __ out about it. </sentence><sentence id="710">I don't know what happened to the tickets, but we stayed there, so we stayed in Montreal. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="818">Q: Now why didn't you want it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: First of all, it was too far out and was too many things to do and I wanted to stay in the big city, I wanted to stay in Montreal or some other big city. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: And with your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="824">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="825">So what happened is, my father found, in Montreal, another cousin. </sentence><sentence id="826">His name was Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph) and Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph), he was already a little bit older, not too old he wasn't, only like 50, 60 years old. </sentence><sentence id="827">So he came over to us and he said to me, "You went to Wurzburg, to the seminary, as a teacher, you see and you were in__, go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="828">That's the only, because in Canada there isn't much Yiddishgad(ph)," Jewishness, "you go United States." </sentence><sentence id="829">And at that time, just at that time, they closed it. </sentence><sentence id="830">Up to that time students could come very easily to the United States, but it was closed in 1938 or 1939, that you needed more than just this, you needed a reason, other things. </sentence><sentence id="831">So, I didn't think much of it and I said, "What can you do?" </sentence><sentence id="832">But one day he called us up, this Fevel(ph) and said, "I saw in a Jewish paper, there was a Yiddish paper, written in Yiddish, it's for the Americana, the American and it said on the front page of this," unfortunately I don't have that paper any more, had it for _--&lt;&lt;.:""On the front page of this paper is a big picture of refugees, who came to Baltimore and some of them came from Wurzburg", from where I had studied, and he said he wants to show it to me and if I recognized any of them. </sentence><sentence id="833">I had no interest in that, but I said to myself, "What can you lose? </sentence><sentence id="834">Go to him and look at it." </sentence><sentence id="835">So I went to him one day, it was in August, I think it was in August and, and he showed me the picture and I recognized a few people on these pictures, I recognized them. </sentence><sentence id="836">Besides this I read the article and it mentioned a certain Kalibar(ph), Rabbi Kalibar(ph), not that Kalibar(ph), related to them. </sentence><sentence id="837">And he said to me what I do is, what I should do is, I should write to this yeshiva(ph) near Israel College in Baltimore, it's still existing. </sentence><sentence id="838">And I should tell them about this and see what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="839">So I wrote to them, it's in here, and I got an answer right away and the answer said, "We will accept you. </sentence><sentence id="840">We will accept you. </sentence><sentence id="841">We will give you an affidavit and just come in. </sentence><sentence id="842">Go to the Consul and have it verified." </sentence><sentence id="843">Now at that time, to get permission to go from Canada to Britain ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="864">Q: To the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: To the United States, was the Consul in Montreal, the American Consul in Montreal, he had the final say, not the Justice Department, they didn't have a Justice Department yet, the Naturalization Department yet, that was only instituted later. </sentence><sentence id="867">But go to the American Consul in Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="868">I went to the Consul and it was a very nice man, it was a British man, because at that time, Canada was not it's own country, it was a dominion, British dominion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="872">Q: Even in Montreal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="874">A: Yeah, actually, it was a British dominion, it said here, a commonwealth, but it only became a country by itself in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="875">Then it was independent of Britain, but at that time it was still dependent on Britain. </sentence><sentence id="876">So I said to the Consul, I told them my story and he was very receiving, accepting it and he said to me, "But you don't have a valid passport, number one, number two, it's not so easy for students to get to the United States now, number two, you don't have citizenship at all, you are not even a Canadian domiciled person, because you lived here less than six months, because we came in June 15th and this was August. </sentence><sentence id="877">You lived here less than... and you only gained citizenship, domicile in Canada, after six months, so you are not domiciled person, so I cannot let you go." </sentence><sentence id="878">I said, "But I promise that I will come back, because my family is here." </sentence><sentence id="879">He said, "Still." </sentence><sentence id="880">So he said, "I will do something special," he said. " </sentence><sentence id="881">I will call my consul together and discuss it with them and then you come before this consul and they can make a decision." </sentence><sentence id="882">So he made a, he called his people together, I don't know who was his high officials and I talked to them about the story and they said to me, finally and they, and they sent me out and then they called me back and said, "We made a decision, we made a decision that we will let you go, as a student, until February, because you're, that means 60 days before your passport expires. </sentence><sentence id="883">Your passport expires in April 21st, we will let you go until February 21st, under the condition that when you come to Montreal, when you come to    Baltimore, you will have your passport extended by the Germans." </sentence><sentence id="884">I said okay. </sentence><sentence id="885">So I made the arrangements, and so I had the permission here now to go to Canada, to go to Baltimore, however, how will I get there? </sentence><sentence id="886">So I went again to the JIAS and I had no money and the JIAS gave me 30 dollars, I think. </sentence><sentence id="887">That was the amount of the trip. </sentence><sentence id="888">I went with Greyhound bus from Montreal to Baltimore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="905">Q: Now, let me ask you a couple of questions for the record. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="907">A: Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: When you said you didn't have any citizenship, maybe you can explain why you didn't have a German's passport, why you were stateless. </sentence><sentence id="910">Because certainly you were born in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: In Europe, especially in Germany and all the countries, you have the citizenship of your father. </sentence><sentence id="914">My father was born in Russia and he was a Russian citizen at one time. </sentence><sentence id="915">However, in, shortly before the first World War I think, he came over to the, he came over to Germany, to Breslau and to other cities in Germany and he stayed there and he got married in Bremen, 1916 he got married and then he stayed there and he had, he was working and he had his own bicycle business and motorcycle business. </sentence><sentence id="916">And then in 1921, 1922, 1923, when Russia became Soviet Republic and they made it law, I think in 1933 was the final law, that anyone who left Russia before it became the Soviet Republic, has to return in order to retain his citizenship and my father didn't want to return to, to Russia, because he just escaped because in the very beginning of the century, they would capture the Jewish children and let them work for 25 years in the army, cantoons(ph) they were called. </sentence><sentence id="917">So he didn't want to return, so he lost his citizen, he became stateless. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="923">Q: So technically, how'd you stay, had you been able to stay in Germany and you had had a child there, your child would have been a German citizen, although... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="927">Q: But you were... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="929">A: My, all my family is stateless. </sentence><sentence id="930">Only if you buy the German citizenship, because there was a time, at the end of the 1920's that you could buy the German citizenship for 50 marks and they came many times to my father's store and said buy, become a German, but my father said no. </sentence><sentence id="931">Germany is the source of all anti-Semitism, I don't want to be and it was good, because afterwards they took it away from them anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="932">So he never bought German citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="933">He remained stateless all his life and when we came to Canada, they became Canadian citizen, not I and when we came to America, I became American citizen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="939">Q: So you arrived in Baltimore by yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="941">A: Yeah but there, before I arrived in Baltimore, there's something else. </sentence><sentence id="942">I, all right, when we came to the border, to the American border, they examined all my luggage and I had Tosefa Torah, which I spoke to you before, with me. </sentence><sentence id="943">They didn't know what it was, but I explained it to them. </sentence><sentence id="944">So we came then, to New York, first we come from, we stopped in New York and we stopped in New York in the middle of the night, 11, 12 o'clock at night. </sentence><sentence id="945">And my father had told me that he had a friend in New York, Eiseman(ph), whom he had once saved in Germany, he was in the prison and he had given him an affidavit and he was able to leave Germany and he went to the United States already, in the 20's. </sentence><sentence id="946">And he had sent us an affidavit at that time, we could have gone to United States in the 20's, but my mother didn't want to go because she had all the relatives in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="947">So we missed up on that opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="948">But when I came to New York, I said, "I'm going to call up this person." </sentence><sentence id="949">I didn't know very much about New York, we, we, at the Madison Square Garden, I think, we, there was a Greyhound station. </sentence><sentence id="950">So I called him up in the middle of the night, of course, I didn't know very much. </sentence><sentence id="951">So then I said I have to wait until the morning. </sentence><sentence id="952">Then in the morning I called up again, six or seven o'clock now and at that time they didn't, not everyone had a telephone, there was    probably one telephone for the whole apartment house and people had to be called and come down to that place. </sentence><sentence id="953">It's a little bit of history. </sentence><sentence id="954">So I call them and I said, "Is there a Mr. Eiseman(ph) living in this building?" </sentence><sentence id="955">and the woman said, "Yes, yes there are, I'll call him, I'll call him." </sentence><sentence id="956">And he came down to the phone and he heard me and when he heard me, he said, "Where are you? </sentence><sentence id="957">You are going to stay here for a few days, I want you to stay here for a few days" and he will come and see me. " </sentence><sentence id="958">So where do you live?" </sentence><sentence id="959">This Mr. Eiseman(ph) lived in Brooklyn and I was in Manhattan and I didn't know the distances here, I thought maybe in half an hour he can come over, he said, "No, it takes me at least two and a half hours." </sentence><sentence id="960">Long distances. </sentence><sentence id="961">And it was 1939, they had the World's Fair in New York at that time, I don't know if you remember. </sentence><sentence id="962">So he said and he wants to show me the World's Fair. </sentence><sentence id="963">So I waited there in the Greyhound station and finally he came over, his wife was home, I think and his daughter, they came and they came and they picked me up at 10 o'clock or so and we went to a kosher restaurant there and then he took me to the __ and I stayed with him maybe at least overnight, one night, I don't remember any more how long and then next morning, I continued to Baltimore. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1013">Q: Did it make you angry? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1019">Q: Did, did a lot of what you observed seem frivolous to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1021">A: Yes, I think they did not feel with the people in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I mean, it was quite different in America at that time, even though America is nowadays probably the best country to live in in the whole world, but it seemed to me at that time at least, that it was more a detached kind of    relationship, that the people had with each other and not a kind of very close kinship relationship. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Because everything went like automatically. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Business-like, more business-like. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And we have, in our family, I mean they're talking about, about family life, but we had more a family kind of relationship, not only with the family, but with other people, too. </sentence><sentence id="1026">The people who came from Europe still had this kind of relationship, to a certain extent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1034">Q: Did you feel a responsibility to let people know what was going on in Germany and in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1049">A: I knew that, that first of all, religion was completely different in the United States and Canada than it was in Europe or especially in my section, even though in Germany, many of them or most of them are not religious, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1050">But here it was also different, as I said, it was more, how do you call it, stylish. </sentence><sentence id="1051">That means, organized and not so, what we call in Yiddish, Haemish(ph), Haemish(ph) means having a close bond relationship, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1052">My relatives, 1 mean my father's relatives, the Kaplans, you see, were very, were very friendly and they had ___ this kind of relationship, a warm relationship. </sentence><sentence id="1053">But in other circles, it was just to a certain point, as I said before, when I went the synagogue and I saw these people there, they more or less were for themselves, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They didn't care so much about what was going on anywhere in the world at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And I think that was also one of the reasons why the United States didn't recognize what happened    in Germany until much later and Roosevelt had a hard time to convince them to, to do something about it, the War Relief Fund and so, they came all much later. </sentence><sentence id="1056">I hope it's not true, but that was true at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1074">Q: When you stopped getting any information, did that alarm you at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1076">A: I knew that bad things were happening there and I knew it from some people, again from my organization, Agoutis(ph) Israel, because when I was in Baltimore there was one man, who came every week from Washington and he had cousins there, he was my roommate, next door roommate you see, came every Thursday to go back to what, he came from New York, excuse me, not from Washington, he came from New York and stopped over in Baltimore and went to Washington to do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And he had very much information. </sentence><sentence id="1078">So I knew that what, that what was going on, that it was not good and he was working in it, in this organization very much. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I knew things were not good. </sentence><sentence id="1080">But I knew, the way the letters came to me from Germany, from the, indirectly, I knew what was happening there. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And they'd all try, instance, so and so is on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="1082">That meant he was in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Or when they wrote for instance, we had to change, that means that they displaced them and sent them to another place, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I think once I sent a 20 dollar    mark, which I had just how some ___, I never heard of again, it was against the law, I sent it in an envelope. </sentence><sentence id="1085">20 mark wasn't really so much, but still. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1170">A: That was one thing, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1171">But, but the further away we came from Germany, the more we thought about new opportunities. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And of course we were sorry and sad for those people who couldn't come out and who we had left behind. </sentence><sentence id="1173">But we couldn't think of very much because now we had to be on our own and make our own. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Some people left with money, very early in the 30's, but we left with no money, four dollars. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1239">A: Yeah, different congregations in New York, but they were much later. </sentence><sentence id="1240">Because I stayed in Baltimore from 1939 to 1945 and in 1944, I was ordained as a rabbi and I learned there many years, with many other people and during the war, I can tell you, during the war, even in the United States, I was considered an alien, what do they call it? </sentence><sentence id="1241">Enemy alien and I had to get permission to go from Baltimore to New York, each time, from the Attorney General, it was a woman, I went to her many times, put a stamp in the passport or so, something like this, gave me a special card. </sentence><sentence id="1242">When I traveled from Baltimore to Yonkers, near New York, I also needed special permission. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And I needed every year, an extension of my passport. </sentence><sentence id="1244">So now that comes to this point. </sentence><sentence id="1245">All right, they had told me in Montreal, when you come there, get your passport extended, yeah? </sentence><sentence id="1246">I go, I'm there. </sentence><sentence id="1247">So I said to myself, who can extend it, it was made out by the German government, go to the German consulate. </sentence><sentence id="1248">At that time, 1939, yeah, Canada entered the war, I left, I left Canada on the fifth or sixth of September, Canada entered the war at, on the seventh of September, September, day after. </sentence><sentence id="1249">So I came there, the German consulate, at that time, America was not at war yet, so the Germans still had the consulate here. </sentence><sentence id="1250">But I had no money to go there because it was 15 cents    already at that time, a bus in Washington, Baltimore. </sentence><sentence id="1251">In New York was five cents a subway. </sentence><sentence id="1252">So I got the money, I went to the consul and I said to myself, "I have to be very careful when I go to these people." </sentence><sentence id="1253">So I went up there. </sentence><sentence id="1254">So they, so it was lunchtime. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I didn't know that they have lunchtime in America and that there is such long lunchtime and they go out and no one is there. </sentence><sentence id="1256">But there was someone there, so I said to him I wanted my passport extended if they can extend it. </sentence><sentence id="1257">They said, "Yes, leave the passport with us." </sentence><sentence id="1258">I said to myself, "No, I don't leave anything here." </sentence><sentence id="1259">I take it with me and said, "I come back another time." </sentence><sentence id="1260">I never came back. </sentence><sentence id="1261">I went to the Canadian consul, because I came from Canada and I said to him, "I cannot get this passport extended, but I only have permission here until February 21st, so if he cannot get permission for me, extension of the passport." </sentence><sentence id="1262">So he said to me, you see, and this is interesting that he made a mistake and that saved me. </sentence><sentence id="1263">He said to me, about, he did not ask me about domicile, he just said I came from Canada and he gave me permission to stay until June. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Did he give me permission? </sentence><sentence id="1265">Then I had no more permission and he said he cannot give me permission any more because I wasn't in Canada and he has no longer authority to do this. </sentence><sentence id="1266">So I go to Washington and I told them, "I came here on this passport that cannot be extended and I'm studying, I came here as a student and I cannot return to Canada because I didn't gain domicile and I cannot return to Germany because they are at war" and if I can stay here longer. </sentence><sentence id="1267">So he gave me, Washington gave me permission for one more year and they waived my passport requirements and every year, only every year I had to write to them for another year extension and that I did until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And then at the end of the war, I made a, during the war I made a request to become a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1269">It was 1943, but I couldn't become a citizen at that time because it was the height of the war, Stalingrad. </sentence><sentence id="1270">He said, "Did you do anything for the war effort?" </sentence><sentence id="1271">So what could I do, I wasn't in the army, but I bought war bonds, but that wasn't enough, so they said, "No, you cannot become a citizen now, but after six months, you can reapply." </sentence><sentence id="1272">   So I reapplied again after six months and the situation got better, then I got the FBI to help me and finally, in 1945, I got what's called first papers. </sentence><sentence id="1273">At that time there were first papers and second papers, now you can right away become a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Anyhow I had to wait five years in between and then in 1951, I became a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1275">When I became a citizen, I changed my name. </sentence><sentence id="1276">Why did I change my name? </sentence><sentence id="1277">First of all, my wife didn't like this name, in the meantime I got married, 1948, so. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1497">A: Before we moved over here, we had to make a decision when we want to move and where we want to move to. </sentence><sentence id="1498">When we want to move to | already told you, I wanted to move when we are, still can work and do something. </sentence><sentence id="1499">I did not want to retire completely. </sentence><sentence id="1500">When I gave my retirement speech in the Department of Social Services, I said to them, "Retire means to put on a new tire, to put on a new career. </sentence><sentence id="1501">Retirement means a new career and people in their retirement usually are more busy than before." </sentence><sentence id="1502">Where we want to move to. </sentence><sentence id="1503">So my son, who lives in New York state, I didn't want to move there, because they have a lot of business to do with themselves, they have their own family and they wouldn't have any time for us, not that I want people to have time for me, but they're busy with themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1504">The second reason I didn't want to move there is, there wouldn't be any chance for    me to do something else, to get a job for something else. </sentence><sentence id="1505">Cleveland, my daughter lives in Cleveland. </sentence><sentence id="1506">I didn't want to move there, the Cleveland climate is too cold. </sentence><sentence id="1507">So we moved here. </sentence><sentence id="1508">That's our youngest daughter, she is here, living here and I think we could give her some help and also here would be the possibility to get another job and I got some other jobs here. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1532">A: What was most difficult to adjust to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1534">Q: Or most challenging for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1536">A: First of all, there were already in America at that time when we came here, there were already groups of equally minded, equal minded Jews, were already living here. </sentence><sentence id="1537">There were already congregations, certain places and therefore it made it easier for me and therefore I might be able to find a job through them and I did. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And there is more possibility and opportunity here than other places. </sentence><sentence id="1539">It was not as hard, as difficult to find connections, see and to study and learn something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1544">Q: So what you're saying is adjustment really wasn't that difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1546">A: No, well, not too difficult here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1548">Q: Do you think that there were certain events in the history of the last 50 years, that impacted you or that you thought about in a different way because of your experience in Germany? </sentence><sentence id="1549">Whether it    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1552"> was the McCarthy hearings or the Civil Rights movement or even the Japanese internment centers, I mean were there events here that you had a particular, particularly strong reaction to? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1553">A: Yeah, for instance, as I mentioned before, during the war... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1555">Q: You don't have to be so close to the mike, but you keep turning your head away from it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1557">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1558">During the war, that we were considered enemy aliens, despite the fact that we were saving, they were not, they did not make a differentiation between those who came here because of their own personal persecution and those who were actually went along with the Nazi system. </sentence><sentence id="1559">They didn't make any difference here, they just considered everyone who came from Germany in the same category, the Japanese too. </sentence><sentence id="1560">That was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1561">And then, afterwards, I mean the McCarthy hearings and so forth, the un-American committee, see that it's not American again, not too much American. </sentence><sentence id="1562">I mean that was a, a leftover, I would say, from what the thinking was here in the beginning of the 40's. </sentence><sentence id="1563">Is means that they very much believed in, in pure American and anything which came from outside of America, like Russia, and the Communists and so forth, was considered, you cannot live with it and you have to fight it. </sentence><sentence id="1564">So I think, but then the people understood that the most important here is actually to do something for the country, when Kennedy, when Kennedy came. </sentence><sentence id="1565">I don't know if this is the right answer, there is no right answer to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1575">Q: That's okay. </sentence><sentence id="1576">I'm just sort of wondering if there were certain events over the years that had a very unusually strong impact on you and, or that you identified with or that made you think in a new way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1579">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1580">All right. </sentence><sentence id="1581">At one point, at one point I could have gotten a job, I was even offered a job already, in Portland Oregon, I was offered a job, in 19, 1956 and I got the contract in and everything like this and I thought everything would be okay and I would be able to do this, to go there, to start a school and certain other things and I discussed it with some of the friends here and some intelligent    people, if this is country that's reliable, if I can believe it and they said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1582">But what happened is, I made already arrangements for the plane to go there and the condition was, my condition, that I would go there for three months on trial and if I like it, I stay, if I don't, and fulfill the complete contract, if not I would come back. </sentence><sentence id="1583">But just the day before I was leaving, I was told that they changed their mind there and they don't want to make a school there, they want to make some kind of a social program or who knows what there and I had already given up my job, which I had here. </sentence><sentence id="1584">I had two jobs, I had the job in the Hebrew school and I had the job in the burlap factory. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And fortunately, the burlap factory, they took me back right away, even though I had canceled with them, the Jewish school did not take me back, but I didn't mind and the Portland, the one who had signed the contract gave me 50 dollars, which was not very much for the whole contract, which they signed, so then I decided, I'm not going into this field any more, because you cannot believe them and I wanted to go on something which was safer. </sentence><sentence id="1586">Then I found out about the city of New York and I went into the Social Work System with the city of New York. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1596">Q: Now, when you said, a few minutes ago you mentioned Kennedy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1598">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1600">Q: Why did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1602">A: Because Kennedy, in his speech, especially the first speech we'd seen, don't do what the country wants from you, do what you can do for your country, you see, that people should work more for each other instead of against each other and always expecting things coming to them, you have to in, put some input, you have to do something and I wanted some input also, not all, that's why I wanted to make my own school and my this and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="1603">Some input, not just just on the receiving end. </sentence><sentence id="1604">This is unfortunately, naturally, people like to be served, but that's not how we can build up something. </sentence><sentence id="1605">So that's just the kind of input, and when I came here, for instance, that    synagogue, they didn't have a certain class, so I instituted a class there. </sentence><sentence id="1606">When I came here, they didn't have a certain kind of information sheet, so I instituted an information sheet. </sentence><sentence id="1607">When I came to Wurzburg, they did not have a newsletter all the time, so we instituted a newsletter and___ to the ____ and we told them some stories about, I would like some input. </sentence><sentence id="1608">Giving something see, more giving than taking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1617">Q: What, do you feel, as a Jew, absolutely safe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1619">A: Safe in what respect? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1621">Q: That, that not, that what happened 50 years ago would never happen again, that you are free from anti-Semitism, whether institutional or personal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1623">A: You can never feel 100 percent safe, you can only, as an actual thing, you cannot be safe. </sentence><sentence id="1624">In your mind you can feel safe. </sentence><sentence id="1625">You can say, I have done what I do, what I've wanted to do and I have done this and that's how it will go, it will be, it will be. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Things may change, things change all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1627">The only constant in this world is change. </sentence><sentence id="1628">So it will constantly change and I don't think that anti-Semitism will ever stop. </sentence><sentence id="1629">Because I see it, whether it's in Israel, whether it's all over, you see, there are always people who are very self-centered and they want just what they want and they do whatever is necessary in order to get what they want without thinking about other people, hurting other people or harming or killing other people. </sentence><sentence id="1630">So therefore, I can only feel safe in the way, what I'm doing. </sentence><sentence id="1631">If you believe in a certain thing, you believe in this and then you feel safe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1641">Q: Do you think that, that Jews need to remain vigilant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1643">A: Vigilant? </sentence><sentence id="1644">Only so certain respect. </sentence><sentence id="1645">Let's say if someone is a very fanatic, it wouldn't help them. </sentence><sentence id="1646">You can only be, be vigilant in your own approach and what you are doing yourself, not vigilant in respect to, in regard to other people, that will not help very much. </sentence><sentence id="1647">Because one war brings upon another war __, like it was in, in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1648">First the war of 1870 brought about the war of 1914,    brought about the war 1939 and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1649">So one war brings about another war, so to bring about peace you see, that's actually what our intent is, the intent. </sentence><sentence id="1650">Everyone talks about peace, but no one does anything about it, like the weather. </sentence><sentence id="1651">It doesn't happen in the world today. </sentence><sentence id="1652">We have many arenas of war and people talk about peace and it continues. </sentence><sentence id="1653">In Israel, all over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1666">Q: Well, let me ask you this, in terms of history. </sentence><sentence id="1667">You left Germany in 1939, you knew if was scary? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1670">A: Mmm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1672">Q: You knew it wasn't getting better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1674">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1676">Q: But I suspect you had no idea what you would learn later. </sentence><sentence id="1677">That must have been somewhat shocking to you, yes? </sentence><sentence id="1678">I mean what would you, when you finally learned what really happened over there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1682">A: You cannot always think of the worst, you, you think something will happen you see, how much will happen, I don't know and then you have to be guided, like I did, by some principal which is basic, by some basic principal which you believe by. </sentence><sentence id="1683">If someone has a belief, then he knows something, then he, then he, then he feels safe. </sentence><sentence id="1684">If someone had religion, for instance, he says, this is what I can do, so much I can do and not more and the rest I may, I may leave up to God or someone else. </sentence><sentence id="1685">I can do only my best, what I can do and every person's limited, can only do certain thing. </sentence><sentence id="1686">So I will try my best. </sentence><sentence id="1687">But then you really have to try your best. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1694">Q: But I think what I was asking is, when you got tangible information about the atrocities in Europe, what was the impact on you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1696">A: I felt very bad about what was happening and I felt that something had to be done about it and the question, who could do something about it and how can you help, but it is not up to one person,    it has to be a group of people and before you change any person's, before you can change any person, before you can ask any person to help you, he has to have in his mind that he wants to help, really. </sentence><sentence id="1697">So you have to find out what is in his mind, you know and by talking to them and how bad it is. </sentence><sentence id="1698">Many people didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And I see it many times, there are still people today who don't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1700">People only believe it if it hurts themself, if it hits themself, hits them or their family. </sentence><sentence id="1701">So therefore, I think the most important thing is education and therefore I was always in the educational field, I wanted to be in the educational field, because the work education means to bring out ____. </sentence><sentence id="1702">Not revolution by force, but to bring it out for other person, every person has something unique in themself, which other person doesn't have and bring this out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1711">Q: Was there a sense of celebration or satisfaction in the birth of Israel, or is that just something that you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1713">A: It was a momentary victory, momentary, because... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1714">[end of side one, tape three] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1715">Q: What we were, you know, I was just asking you about Israel and you... Let me ask you, I mean clearly your religion has always been important to you. </sentence><sentence id="1716">Do you think that it helps you get through hard times, or that it affected the way you lived your life? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1717">A: I think it helped me lot of times and I also think that it helped me, not to get too involved or too much engrossed in thinking that this is very good, it wouldn't change. </sentence><sentence id="1718">There is still, there is still things that will change and not that this is a final answer, like what they are doing now in Israel? </sentence><sentence id="1719">I don't think that will be the final answer. </sentence><sentence id="1720">There's a progress going on, life is movement, it continuously moves. </sentence><sentence id="1721">It was good at that time, for instance, that many people needed someplace to live and this was provided. </sentence><sentence id="1722">But, as they saw in German, that the most pious person cannot live in    peace if the evil neighbor doesn't want it. </sentence><sentence id="1723">That's what Goyter(ph) said, he was a great German poet. </sentence><sentence id="1724">So you have to live with others together and sometimes the others don't want peace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1734">Q: When you were living in Germany still and there was really a constant fear of not knowing what was going to happen next, did you pray a lot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1736">A: You see, in the beginning, as I mentioned, I only became more religious after my bar mitzvah, even though we kept chabiss(ph) to a certain extent and my mother kept kosher food, household, but in wasn't such a problem, you see, we didn't think of it so much, we thought it would always remain like that. </sentence><sentence id="1737">Because I had friends, non-Jewish friends, we playing together and we didn't think of, so much about it. </sentence><sentence id="1738">Neither did they think so much about it, the difference between Jews and non-Jews, until the Nazis came and made it a policy, everyone has to think about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1742">Q: How about after your Bar Mitzvah and times were getting worse then? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1750">Q: Nothing special? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1752">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1754">Q: But you continued, you continued to pray and to believe in the value or the power of prayer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1756">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1758">Q: Is there anything you can point to, that might explain what gave you special strength, special skills in, instinct, to get through all of this? </sentence><sentence id="1759">That you carry with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1762">A: I know one thing, that, I was the first born in the family, you see and usually the first born, gets more attention from the parents, like in my case and they sent me to a school of higher learning and they gave me piano lessons training. </sentence><sentence id="1763">Not my sister, she always complained about this and so, so in    order to give them a kind of feeling you see, of a little bit more than someone else, because like honoring your parents, you respect your older brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1764">But I didn't take advantage of it. </sentence><sentence id="1765">Probably it made me feel a little bit, a little better, I don't know, you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1771">Q: It may have made you a little bit more of an activist, of a leader, which it seemed like you were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1773">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1775">Q: When you think back to Germany, are there any images that still stick with you, that haunt you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1777">A: As I said, no I didn't say it but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1779">Q: But now you will. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1781">A: As you know, my wife doesn't want to have any connection any more with Germany and ____. </sentence><sentence id="1782">I say, there were certain things in Germany which were very nice, you see and we would, and I would like to see it, I would like, let's say, for instance, go back and see where I was born and where we used to live. </sentence><sentence id="1783">In fact we once went to Germany, since, since we immigrated here, but that was only one day, but I don't know what the German mind is now, but I remember one thing, that after the war, our neighbor, non-Jewish neighbors, wrote to my father a lot and they and I still have the letters, in German, that they were good friends and they are sorry for what happened in Germany and so forth and of course they wrote, also said, they suffered a lot, but that's not comparable to what the Jews suffered, because anyone else, even I tell most of the young people, too, anyone else who suffered, if he would accept the Nazi policy, would not be persecuted any more, Jews were persecuted whether they did or not and it was a purpose, so therefore I'd like to know, what the German attitude is now. </sentence><sentence id="1784">When they asked me this question in the museum, you see, how I feel, I ask them how do you feel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1789">Q: Do you ever dream about Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1791">A: No, not any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1793">Q: When you did, were there certain recurring images? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1795">A: It was only during the war that I dreamt about some people I knew and I didn't know what would happen to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1797">Q: Now, your wife is also from Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1799">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1801">Q: Besides the fact that she's a lovely, wonderful, woman, was there a certain commonality, a certain bond that you felt because she was also a German? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1803">A: No, because I met her when we were still in Germany, she did not remember this, but I did, do. </sentence><sentence id="1804">Because when I was in Germany and I was going to the Wurzberger school, to the seminary, at one time, in the last year, 1938, beginning of 1938, they wanted a foreign language to be taught and the question was, do you want Spanish or French. </sentence><sentence id="1805">The majority wanted Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="1806">After the majority wanted Spanish, they asked, is there anyone who can teach Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="1807">I had had correspondence with Spain, a friend of mine, so I knew a little bit of Spanish, so I said, I'll try to give a Spanish course. </sentence><sentence id="1808">So I was appointed the first Spanish teacher in Wurzburg. </sentence><sentence id="1809">And in order to make it applicable and have people join this course, I gave a sample lecture in a big auditorium and she was one of the students there. </sentence><sentence id="1810">She didn't even know that. </sentence><sentence id="1811">And then we met again when we came to America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1821">Q: Well the reason I ask is that it seems a lot of survivors marry survivors, a lot of survivors from one area in Europe, later marry somebody from that same area of Europe and I'm wondering if there's a logical reason for that and why you wouldn't have necessarily married somebody who was American, or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1823">A: No, there, and a few reasons for it, number one, first of all, people like to marry someone who, with whom they can converse, I mean, who is on their level and maybe even intellectually, culturally and so forth and when I came to New York, my wife had an aunt there who knew this    family, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1824">In fact I knew some, I knew of a cousin of my wife's, whom I liked, but she was killed in the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1825">And then one day when my wife came here, she made the contact and, so that's, we had met before as I said, but not knowing it and that's how it came about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1830">Q: So it wasn't a matter of either more comfort there or less comfort with somebody who doesn't understand where you came from and what you went through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1832">A: No, it came, it came automatically, you know, it happened this way, just to happen you see, it is true, you see, that both people try to marry someone who is from their own background or so, unless someone cannot find anyone at all here and I know people who are going to Iran, or go to other place and marry there, but usually they try to find someone. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Also I liked her family and the family gave me some, something, yeah, helped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1836">Q: Well I guess, you know when you had talked about initially coming over here and being surprised that most Americans were clueless about what was happening in Europe and they didn't care and they didn't even want to know, it would seem to me that it might be logical that you'd want to spend your time with people who had your same sensibilities about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1838">A: Mmm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1840">Q: You know, that's the thing ___--_--waas trying to get at. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1842">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1844">Q: I guess I have one more question. </sentence><sentence id="1845">Do you think there's any way that the Holocaust could have been avoided? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1848">A: Not the way in which the German government operated at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1849">Because in the 20's, when they wanted to establish a democracy in Germany, _ a democracy, most people were not in favor of this democracy, or they didn't care and therefore, one government after the other fell. </sentence><sentence id="1850">That was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1851">Number two was, the Treaty of Versailles, in 1918, 1919, did not intend to create a    United Nations, or what we have now, in the League of Nations. </sentence><sentence id="1852">They did not want to, they did not want to bring people closer, but they wanted to separate people and they made different countries, small countries, which didn't exist before. </sentence><sentence id="1853">They made this a country, this a country, they made all different countries, before it was all united. </sentence><sentence id="1854">And all this encouraged someone like Hitler to bring them together again and to tell the people, you see, don't worry about it, you are not treated well, the Versailles Treaty didn't treat you well and there's inflation and you can't get anything, no jobs, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1855">I will bring the sun. </sentence><sentence id="1856">But he could only do this by having a scapegoat and he took the Jews, because the Jews are very, very passive in this way. </sentence><sentence id="1857">So therefore, from this point of view, giving him the power, people gave him the power, so that Holocaust came about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1869">Q: And the passivity of the Jews, did it play into this? </sentence><sentence id="1870">Should they have resisted more strongly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1873">A: No, the Jews don't resist, you see, the Jews try to go along with the government, whatever the government is. </sentence><sentence id="1874">In fact, even here in America, after Truman I think, they mention the name of the president in every prayer. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Roosevelt especially, Truman. </sentence><sentence id="1876">After Truman, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1877">They did not want to, they accepted whatever, whatever the government said. </sentence><sentence id="1878">Pray for the welfare of the government, so they accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="1879">What should they have done? </sentence><sentence id="1880">What should they have done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1889">Q: Is there something wrong in our teaching? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1891">A: It has to be honest. </sentence><sentence id="1892">The first thing that happened, what Hitler did, it was in education. </sentence><sentence id="1893">He changed the, all the pictures in the books of the kindergarten and who knows what and put in the Jews with the big nose and with hook and this kind of thing and such a person you have to hate. </sentence><sentence id="1894">You can put everything into a child's mind, a child doesn't know the difference between right and wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1895">They learned this only much later. </sentence><sentence id="1896">So therefore, if a child does not get the right information from the beginning, everything goes wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1897">And that's why this sof the ------__ and other things, taught them wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1898">Education is very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1907">Q: But what about our education as Jews? </sentence><sentence id="1908">To make us stand up a little bit quicker? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1911">A: What should they do? </sentence><sentence id="1912">The Jews education does not, does not emphasize war or things of this sort, or hate or, even the Christian religion you see, says love your neighbor like yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And many religions teach, say this, but the difference is, we say and I don't know if I should say it, but we say, that's a way to act, not that's a way to think only. </sentence><sentence id="1914">Roosevelt said it. </sentence><sentence id="1915">Roosevelt knew only in mind, but not in action. </sentence><sentence id="1916">Same thing also with religion you see, to love your neighbor like yourself in your mind, yes, but in your action, not. </sentence><sentence id="1917">The action has to follow what you say in your mind, if not so, not so. </sentence><sentence id="1918">So that's what they have to teach the children here, to really act, to be together, to be friends with each other and so forth, to have more kind of realistic system, not just in your mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1927">Q: Well, getting back to your saying that Jews as a people are passive... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1929">A: It seems so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1931">Q: They're supportive of their community or their government, that they're passive. </sentence><sentence id="1932">Should we be less passive, should we be more attentive to what's going on and act? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1935">A: There are certain, in certain areas in which you should not be passive, but that I cannot say and make everyone responsible for, that is, there are certain laws, let's say the 10 Commandments, you see, they should be more active in those, not to kill, not to steal and so forth, you see, and just be more active in that, not only the Jews, everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Because what's going on now with the drug scene, with the killing and so forth, they don't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1937">So, so there are certain, certain laws which, which every person should understand, logically. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And that they should teach them and not only teach them to think about this, I want to, I don't want to preach here, you see, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1943">Q: I don't have any other questions, is there something you would like to add, that I haven't asked you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1945">A: Except, I don't know if I gave you everything, because it's impossible, there are too many things to be remembered and too many things which happened, but, if you want to build a world of peace, that all people want to do now, at least they say so, then, then we have to, then we have to give everyone the equal opportunity, but it's unfortunate that many times, as soon as someone gets a little bit higher, he wants the whole, he wants everything you see, people aren't satisfied with a finger, they want the whole hand. </sentence><sentence id="1946">And, we wrote once, an essay, we _ wrote an essay in school, when I was in the Nazi school and the essay was called, German loyalty. </sentence><sentence id="1947">The Germans were always loyal to their leader, not only were they loyal to their leader, also they wanted to be on top of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1948">And they believed in the Darwin theory, the survival of the fittest, we have to be the fittest, the Germans said. </sentence><sentence id="1949">Now if everyone thinks I'm the fittest and he will always subdue other ones and have weaker ones whom he destroys and that's what I want to end with. </sentence><sentence id="1950">The teacher once, once asked me, he brought it out in a class and he said, "The Germans are superior and all the other races are inferior, because we are the strongest, we are the tallest, we are the blondest, we have the bluest eyes," and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1951">And, and he said to me, this was a Nazi teacher, "What do you think about it?" </sentence><sentence id="1952">I said to him, "There is nothing in this world superior or inferior, everyone can rise to a high level, everyone can go low. </sentence><sentence id="1953">But there is one thing in this world which the Nazis don't recognize and that's that every person's different and you don't realize the difference between one person, everyone contributes something you see and you cannot put him down because he's different and him down because he's different in this way and he's different in that way." </sentence><sentence id="1954">Same thing like happens in America now. </sentence><sentence id="1955">Everyone's different, they can all contribute and as long as they contrib, as long as someone thinks I am superior and you are inferior, I am a majority and you are a minority. </sentence><sentence id="1956">Once a person in my office told me, "The Jews are not a minority," he said to me. " </sentence><sentence id="1957">Not in New York, "I said, but maybe another thing. </sentence><sentence id="1958">So I asked him, "When does a minority stop to be a minority? </sentence><sentence id="1959">I    asked him. </sentence><sentence id="1960">He couldn't answer that. </sentence><sentence id="1961">But someone's, if someone works under the logical thinking that he's a minority, then he will always strive to be a majority, we always strive to majority and there will always be a fight going on, but the only time someone thinks I'm different, I have certain things which you don't have and you have certain things which I don't have, then they will live together in peace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1980">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1982">A: Accept it or not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1984">Q: Thank you very much. </sentence><sentence id="1985">You mentioned a Nazi school and I'm wondering at what point you were in a Nazi school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1988">A: I think I made a mistake, it should not be called Nazi school, but German school. </sentence><sentence id="1989">Because when Hitler came to power, all the previous directors and teachers were either asked to become members of the Nazi party, or leave the school. </sentence><sentence id="1990">So the director in my school, where I went, the , had been with the Social Democrat party and he was dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And from then on, there were two kinds of teachers, the teachers who were members of the party from long time ago, the early numbers, all the early numbers had priority or a later number. </sentence><sentence id="1992">But they came all in with the Nazi emblem, which was like a lifesaver and there was written NASDP, National Socialist Democratic Workers Party, that's how they called themselves, with a swastika in the middle and one teacher came in with a Nazi uniform and whenever a teacher came in, the students get up and says Heil Hitler, when the teacher leaves the classroom, Heil Hitler, they all stand up. </sentence><sentence id="1993">But that was, that was already before that they would stand up, but that was respect for the teacher, because you were, you were supposed to have respect for the teacher, the teacher was a high official in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2000">Q: So this was in 1933 and did you, what, did you stand up, did you have to stand up to salute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2002">A: I stand up, but I did not have to lift the hand with the Heil Hitler salute or the Nazi salute, but there was, when you came into the building, there was a teacher standing and everyone when he came in, would lift his hand. </sentence><sentence id="2003">I didn't have to lift my hand, but then on the other hand, some people who didn't know it, would beat you up if you didn't do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2006">Q: Were you ever beaten up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2008">A: No, not for that. </sentence><sentence id="2009">But I tell you, I saw a boy on a bicycle, he met a Nazi and he lifted his hand and he fell from his bike, so they said on the bike, you don't have to lift your hand, just make, sit up straight. </sentence><sentence id="2010">But this teacher came in and one of these teachers who was from Strasbourg, Alsace- Lorraine, which was French and German again, he called me over, his son was in my own, in my class, in my class, same class as 1am. </sentence><sentence id="2011">He said to me privately, "You know, I am not actually anti- Semitic," he said, "but in order to keep my job, I have to put this life saver on," he said to me. </sentence><sentence id="2012">And, and this other teacher I told you about, he gave a course in Assencunder(ph), it means knowledge of the races. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2018">Q: And you went, you took this course? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2020">A: [had to take it. </sentence><sentence id="2021">The only thing is, afterwards they changed, that I didn't go on Shabbat any more to school, so this teacher was an older teacher, he was 65 at that time, he called me over and he said to me, "If you don't come to school on Saturday, I'm going to teach Hitler's Kampf, Mein Kampf, the book on Saturday, so you do, are not there. </sentence><sentence id="2022">And if you miss anything, I will give you the, I will tell some student to give you the homework," see there, but still, some teachers of, from the older class, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2023">But they had to be members, you see and if you had and if not, they could be dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="2024">Now him they probably left, he was going anyhow, retirement age 65 there, he left. </sentence><sentence id="2025">That's okay, but, but I help as a teacher, you see, when he gave this kind, so I asked a question, what makes it~. :~"Why does he know everything? </sentence><sentence id="2026">So they taught that he has intuition that comes    from himself Hitler does not believe in manifestation from above, because there's no one above him. </sentence><sentence id="2027">No God, no nothing, he didn't believe in God, even though he was Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="2028">So there's no manifestation from above, everything comes from the blood and soil and it goes up to him and he knows it by intuition. </sentence><sentence id="2029">What they call a, I forget already the word in German, but it's something like a combination of blood and soil. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2041">Q: What'd they teach you in the race class? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2043">A: They taught me similar things and they also taught me that the German race is superior. </sentence><sentence id="2044">Why?Because when God created the world in he interprets the bible, but not the correct way of course, he created man and then they believe in Darwin's theory, that the fittest survive, only the survival of the fittest, so that means the fittest survive and we are the fittest. </sentence><sentence id="2045">The Jews are not fit, that's why they have to be eradicated. </sentence><sentence id="2046">And about this, what I mentioned before about inferiority and superiority and which I don't believe in, I believe in the same thing, you see, but difference, differency, differentiation, but I don't believe in superior and this other thing. </sentence><sentence id="2047">And finally, oh, not about that. </sentence><sentence id="2048">I was the only student of 700 in that school, that was a big school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2056">Q: The only Jewish student. </sentence></p></dialogue>
