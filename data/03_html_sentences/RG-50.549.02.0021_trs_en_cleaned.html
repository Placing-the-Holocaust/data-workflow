<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: It's still being investigated to this day, no? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: It sure is. </sentence><sentence id="140">There is a film that was made by a German young man who -- who happened to -- to be spending some vacation time at the North Sea, and he's -- heard about that there is a -- a memorial for the Holocaust ma -- victims, 7,000 of them. </sentence><sentence id="141">And he started to dig in and -- and look -- look into it. </sentence><sentence id="142">And he found ca -- found out all kinds of details and he found a few survivors, including me. </sentence><sentence id="143">And he made a film at -- a documentary about it. </sentence><sentence id="144">Unfortunately, the film is not well known at all, because the English subtitles are not legible. </sentence><sentence id="145">Very -- they didn't have enough money to -- to do the right subtitling. </sentence><sentence id="146">And that's -- that's where it is. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was played in -- I mean, it was shown in -- in Germany several ti -- several places, in France and in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="148">But, many people know about the Titanic, everybody knows about the Titanic. </sentence><sentence id="149">Nobody knows about the Caparkone and the Deutschland. </sentence><sentence id="150">And the Athena, there was three ships. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: And the vast majority of people on those ships died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="166">There were only -- only about 400 all together that survived. </sentence><sentence id="167">And 7,000 are at - - known dead. </sentence><sentence id="168">So they -- they knew the numbers that -- that were shipped -- put -- put on the ships. </sentence><sentence id="169">So this film was done on a very si -- very low budget. </sentence><sentence id="170">This is a one man operation, basically. </sentence><sentence id="171">The guy is from Berlin and he was trying his best. </sentence><sentence id="172">But a -- without enough backing, is not going to be well-known anywhere. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="173"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="175">So you're experience actually, on the -- you know, your quote unquote, "Day of Liberation" -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: -- consisted of diving off the side of this -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Of jumping into the -- into the cold sea and being lucky enough to be fished out by -- by some little boat that was around the ship and getting into the -- o-on land, when the British came in, that was a -- a -- barracks -- some kind of barracks when we -- we came on -- on shore and the British tanks were coming in and -- and tearing down the -- the flags. </sentence><sentence id="180">And then we -- we had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="181">Basically zero. </sentence><sentence id="182">What we had on was wet and that -- that was what -- what we owned, the few people who -- who survived. </sentence><sentence id="183">So the British went into different houses and told the Germans, give these people eat -- to eat, give these people something to wear and shoes and -- and this is how I started my new life. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: When -- do you remember, when you were with the British and they were telling Germans to give you something to eat and to give you clothes, I guess, how were the Germans reacting to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Well, they -- they had no idea what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="187">They only saw the -- the British come in and they didn't know what were these wet -- wet people came from. </sentence><sentence id="188">They -- they saw some bombing maybe, but they didn't know that those -- those -- the concentration camp prisoners, until they saw them with -- with the hair shor-shorn and no -- well, nobody had anything, but basically, no-nobody has a -- had a piece of paper to -- to prove who they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 8 were. </sentence><sentence id="189">Anyway, the British then -- then gave us some -- some identification cards. </sentence><sentence id="190">But it was hairy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: Hairy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Very hairy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: In what way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: In very many ways. </sentence><sentence id="204">You -- you didn't know who you were talking to, whether it was a -- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who is now trying to -- to save his own hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the ship, by accident. </sentence><sentence id="205">Anyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="206">Then it was difficult to get - - get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the Poles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were notified. </sentence><sentence id="207">But anybody behind the Iron Curtain, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and -- nobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the UNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized myself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist for the officer's club. </sentence><sentence id="208">I didn't know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I -- I survived somehow and I played a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="209">Of course, it was difficult because -- I spoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same. </sentence><sentence id="210">But I had to make myself understood. </sentence><sentence id="211">And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get notification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in Ankara who survived the war in - - in Turkey. </sentence><sentence id="212">And I knew his address. </sentence><sentence id="213">I didn't have a chance to send anything to Budapest, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 9 because I -- I didn't know whether my parents were alive or not, first of all and secondly there was no c-communication or -- or mail or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="214">But through the Red Cross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive. </sentence><sentence id="215">So it took four months until I -- I finally got back to Hungary -- to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="216">Mayas -- with a Czech transport. </sentence><sentence id="217">There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="218">But I -- I joined at that Czech transport and I got back somehow. </sentence><sentence id="219">On buses, on trains, on -- had no money, of course. </sentence><sentence id="220">And then I went to -- to my old apartment, not knowing whether my mother is around, or my father. </sentence><sentence id="221">That's where they -- they deported me from, originally. </sentence><sentence id="222">And so they were alive. </sentence><sentence id="223">And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra. </sentence><sentence id="224">They knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a -- with -- with that position. </sentence><sentence id="225">And those were the first few months, everything was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="226">There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="227">Basically, it was terrible times. </sentence><sentence id="228">And it was basically Russian occupation. </sentence><sentence id="229">So, we went through all kinds of horror stories. </sentence><sentence id="230">But I played. </sentence><sentence id="231">I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of things and then I left. </sentence><sentence id="232">Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is over, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et- etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="233">And we went over to Austria and then to France and we ha -- we s -- we had a -- with some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived. </sentence><sentence id="234">Because the world wasn't open. </sentence><sentence id="235">In France, you couldn't -- couldn't get a job if you didn't have nationality -- I mean, didn't belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn't have the right kind of papers, you couldn't get a job. </sentence><sentence id="236">So when I went back, I played an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 10 audition for the opera. </sentence><sentence id="237">They were looking for a concertmaster in Budapest and I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="238">I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the Budapest Philharmonic. </sentence><sentence id="239">Twas like -- like in Vienna, the Philharmonic and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the same. </sentence><sentence id="240">And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from way back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in -- in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="241">And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to Gurterburg, in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="242">So I got the passport, I didn't promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play the audition. </sentence><sentence id="243">And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I went back to Budapest -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a leave, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="244">And then I never went back, afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="245">I didn't go back, I went out to Sweden and I was concertmaster in Gurterburg for three years. </sentence><sentence id="246">Then there was an opening in Berlin and they wanted me to come. </sentence><sentence id="247">I played an audition again. </sentence><sentence id="248">I got the job and that's when I started in the opera house. </sentence><sentence id="249">This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera, but that was one of the big operas. </sentence><sentence id="250">They had three in -- in Berlin -- in West Berlin and in East Berlin, there were three or four opera houses, but three of -- three of them were famous. </sentence><sentence id="251">The Startsh oper and the Commisher oper was -- were in East Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="252">My opera, the Shtetisher oper was West Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="253">And I never went over to the east side, because I wasn't interested in it. </sentence><sentence id="254">I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian occupation is, I wasn't interested. </sentence><sentence id="255">But that was an interesting life. </sentence><sentence id="256">West Berlin was -- was an island in -- in -- in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="257">And that was very good, until I got my American pa -- visa, which took eight -- eight years I was waiting for the American visa. </sentence><sentence id="258">And when I got USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 11 it, I couldn't say, "No, I don't come, because I have a good job in Berlin." </sentence><sentence id="259">So I came to America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Let me -- before we take up that part of the story, let me ask you a couple questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="322">I'm curious -- you know, you're -- most -- most of the people that I've interviewed who survived the Holocaust, they have very vivid memories of their day of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="323">And usually it's soldiers march into a camp or they're -- they're in hiding and they -- they see the Russians coming or the Americans coming or whatever and it's a -- it's a very distinctive experience. </sentence><sentence id="324">Now your day of liberation is actually being bombed, scrambling for -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Much more distinctive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: -- scrambling for you life -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Just looking. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: -- tremendous -- tremendous chaos. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="332">It was -- it was -- I was right in the middle of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="336">So my -- my question is -- do you know, or can you remember, when was -- you know, all these other interviews I've done, people say, "And th -- and then, when we went out and met the Russians, then we were liberated." </sentence><sentence id="337">You know, they knew they were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="338">They -- people knew what their -- that their moment of liberation had come and I'm wondering, when was the time you ever felt that, given how crazy it was that day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: | -- [never really verbalized it, but I suppose it was the time when I saw the English soldiers cam -- coming in the -- in the tanks, into this Ubertshooter -- what is an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 12 Ubertshooter -- un -- submarine school, basically. </sentence><sentence id="344">It was in the submarine school where -- where the left side of the -- the harbor, that we hit land with these little boats that helped. </sentence><sentence id="345">Not too many. </sentence><sentence id="346">And at the same time, this Bri-British tanks were coming from the right and those British soldiers took down the Nazi flag that was still o-on -- on the flagpole. </sentence><sentence id="347">And I suppose that was the time that I was liberated, because now -- now I could speak English to the English soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="348">So that was -- that was the end of the war for me. </sentence><sentence id="349">I didn't know it's -- May three is -- is just a date. </sentence><sentence id="350">And now I know what it was, cause they were -- five more days they -- they went on with the war, but that was almost the ho -- the end. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: But even now, when you're talking, you say, "When I saw them take down the flag, I suppose that was it." </sentence><sentence id="361">Sounds like -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: Yeah, I suppose that was it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: -- y-you say you suppose that was it, sounds like at the time, it didn't really strike you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: I didn't -- no, it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="366">I was wet and cold and I was worried. </sentence><sentence id="367">I really didn't -- didn't feel liberated, but that was it, cause I was liberated, basically. </sentence><sentence id="368">And I survived. </sentence><sentence id="369">The other 7,000 died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: Did you ever have any discu -- I mean you s -- you s -- you spoke some English, so I believe in your other interviews, you mentioned that you were able to speak with the British about what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="376">Did you ever -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: Nobody -- nobody really asked me what happened. </sentence><sentence id="378">They -- they just -- somehow they -- they must have known it from other people, too. </sentence><sentence id="379">I probably told them, I don't remember exactly what -- what I told them, that we were on the ship and the ship was </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="383">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 13 bombed, that -- and who we are. </sentence><sentence id="384">Maybe I did, but they -- they seem to have known that these are people who should be helped, these are not Nazis coming out of the water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: Did you feel -- you know, the British saved you on the one hand, but had bombed you </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="391"> on the other hand. </sentence><sentence id="392">Did you feel grateful, resentful? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: After -- after the fact, I've -- I felt very resentful, but I was glad that it was over. </sentence><sentence id="394">It was over because of them. </sentence><sentence id="395">That was a big, big mistake that they made and nobody can explain how it happened. </sentence><sentence id="396">Nobody really could find out details. </sentence><sentence id="397">This guy who -- who made the film went all -- all the way to -- to the British command and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: If you could move -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: -- he interviewed -- he interviewed some of the pilots -- no, that was in the Stern magazine, that was a -- a -- a serial that they had an interview with the pilots and they really did not have any inkling what they did. </sentence><sentence id="409">But then when they found out, it was -- they had regrets, too. </sentence><sentence id="410">So thousands -- thousands perished and a few hundred were survivors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Could you tell me a little more about what it was like when you went back to </sentence></p></dialogue>
