<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: There was no time to stop and think and deliberate as to what it feels like. </sentence><sentence id="78">The entire focus second by second, minute by minute, day by day was on self preservation and that meant watching my facial expressions, my  gesticulations, my "true story"  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection so-so because of exposure and because of my childhood where my father taught me a little bit German and I was speaking German passably and I'll never forget when I spoke to a German and I used the word for bread Broit. </sentence><sentence id="79">Broit is the Yiddish, Brot is the German. </sentence><sentence id="80">Well, inadvertently trying to acquire as much German as I could in order to speak to the Germans, | used that word Broit and the German looked at me and corrected me and said it's not Broit, it's Brot. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I said yes, of course, but I almost collapsed within me because I felt that I would give myself away with that one word. </sentence><sentence id="82">Fortunately the German was not aware of that, but one had to be on a constant alert every second of the day first speaking to the Polish population for whom out in the country I was the "educated city boy." </sentence><sentence id="83">So, when they commented how good my Polish is, well he's from the city. </sentence><sentence id="84">But also with the priest, Father Farkowski we had a number of sessions where he would pluck out a word from my daily 13:12: lingo and then coach me not to use this  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Well, the day after the liberation by the American troops and this was Patton's third army in Erfurt, Thuringen, which I was liberated the day after President Roosevelt died, which I believe was April 13, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="101">A couple of the Polish fellows with whom I lived courtesy of my boss, where he found a small room for five, six of us Polish civilian workers so we would not have to stay in a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="102">One of the two Polish fellows said to me to go to the main railroad station, Erfurt, because that's where there were a lot of Americans. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, we walked over there maybe a half an hour or so, and there across the street from the main railroad station in Erfurt, there were a lot of G.I.s. </sentence><sentence id="104">In front of the hotel across the street from the station there was a lot of movement of G.I.s so obviously it's hard to describe how it felt. </sentence><sentence id="105">A mixture of enthusiasm that one actually not fully believed yet that this was liberation, but it must have been because there were American soldiers all around. </sentence><sentence id="106">It was warm and many of the soldiers were in a very friendly mood so I trying to invoke my English of which I had had two years in the underground high school courses in the Warsaw Ghetto, and I knew a fair amount of English because I liked the language from the beginning more so than French and I started conversing with the American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="107">One word led to the other and they give us as usually after liberation -- skip it. </sentence><sentence id="108">They give us chocolate and cigarettes and things of that nature and we were very grateful and they said to come back in the evening and they'll have something more for us to eat. </sentence><sentence id="109">When I went back there the second day, one of the soldiers introduced me to a first lieutenant Preston. </sentence><sentence id="110">That lieutenant asked me, he looked like by the way one of the British This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

said Yes, I do. </sentence><sentence id="114">Do I know Polish, yes of course, I'm Polish, I know some Russian. </sentence><sentence id="115">He said come on in and help us interpret because they've had a number of refugees and foreign nationals and also Germans whom they were interrogating apparently. </sentence><sentence id="116">So, I studied interpreting. </sentence><sentence id="117">I was then 17, for the American G.Ls. </sentence><sentence id="118">He asked me to come back the next day and after some two or three days, they gave me a shirt and the trousers of a G.I. uniform without an insignia so that within three or four days after the liberation I was already dressed as an American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="119">My job there was ostensibly as an interpreter and all around helper. </sentence><sentence id="120">I suppose some people call guys like me in those days a mascot or just a kid who fell in with the American troops. </sentence><sentence id="121">Within about a week later after I helped interpret for a huge number of displaced persons, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, goodness knows who else who would stop by that hotel simply because the Americans were there. </sentence><sentence id="122">Help me with this and help me with that. </sentence><sentence id="123">It was a whole movement of nations. </sentence><sentence id="124">Occasionally, they would bring in Germans and as I found out later some got pretty rough treatment. </sentence><sentence id="125">They were moving out. </sentence><sentence id="126">This American unit and they asked me if I wanted to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="127">Well, you might as well of put me on the moon of my dreams because of course I would want to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="128">By that time I was eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the war time diet. </sentence><sentence id="129">There was candy and cigarettes and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="130">It wasn't until a few weeks later when my English started getting better and so on that I found out what that unit what. </sentence><sentence id="131">To me they were just American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="132">They were CIC. </sentence><sentence id="133">Counter Intelligence Corp of the United States Army, and as it turned out this was detachment 220 of the 20th Corp which was part of the 3rd Army, Patton's. </sentence><sentence id="134">So, I traveled with that unit. </sentence><sentence id="135">There were at the most This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

of a gun, he was the judge who once found me guilty when I had a traffic ticket in New York. </sentence><sentence id="138">Major Loeb who was a prince of a fellow in contrast with one of his lieutenants who within I would say two weeks or so made approaches to me, homosexual approaches that I frankly didn't know how to cope with. </sentence><sentence id="139">In the best English I could offer him when he came into my room in the evening, because wherever we went they commandeered the German hotel, I told him I was a catholic and as best as I could that we don't do things like these. </sentence><sentence id="140">Because up until that time I had never had any sexual encounter at age 17 since during the war in East Prussia at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or women to be with. </sentence><sentence id="141">A foreign national, Pole or any other non-German was under severe penalty to have any intimate relationships with a German girl, which was unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="142">Some who had and found a German girl I suppose consenting were taken to concentration camp or severely beaten by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="143">That was to preserve the purity of the German race. </sentence><sentence id="144">So, I had had absolutely no experience with a man or a woman. </sentence><sentence id="145">Within a few days after I was liberated and I was with these American G.I.s in a hotel  where they were stationed. </sentence><sentence id="146">One of them  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection learned that as the saying goes the intelligence community not to mention the diplomatic community is disportionately staffed by homosexuals. </sentence><sentence id="147">My experience in the American counter intelligence, that's the people who liberated me within two weeks two of them had made advances vis-a-vis me and I was 17. </sentence><sentence id="148">As we drove with my liberators -- and the advances stopped by the way soon enough because I had made it clear that I didn't want them. </sentence><sentence id="149">The CIC detachment followed the front line troops throughout Bavaria and into Austria almost to reach Linz. </sentence><sentence id="150">As soon as the American troops occupied a city, the CIC was there within hours and sometimes even ahead of them. </sentence><sentence id="151">Once we were caught in the cross fire because we had marching orders to reach the next city and it turned out that that had not yet been freed by front line troops. </sentence><sentence id="152">Wherever we reached the city and it went - - we had 13:25: gone through Augsburg and a number of southern German cities and into Austria, and I remember we were stationed for a while in Ried, in Innkreis meaning the district of Inn and the town was Reid. </sentence><sentence id="153">As soon as we reached the town that was liberated, we had four or five jeeps and in teams of two we had addresses to pluck out the Nazis who had been on the list. </sentence><sentence id="154">So, this was basically the job of the CIC, that was to arrest the more prominent Nazis, and I interpreted when I could. </sentence><sentence id="155">I have not seen any bad treatment except one that who was detached from the first French army, a native Alsatian Frenchman who despised the Germans and whenever he was interrogating them he beat them up very badly. </sentence><sentence id="156">Since I didn't have to interpret I never wanted to be part of that but I would hear from another room and he would break chairs over their heads and so on and a number of the Hitler Jugend or the SS men caught were beaten up pretty badly when they didn't want to answer questions. </sentence><sentence id="157">Eventually, by the time that our unit was commandeered back into Germany from Austria, the CIC unit I believe was being This is a verbatim transcript of

with the recommendation that the MPs could use an interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="160">By that time, my English became 14:02: more proficient. </sentence><sentence id="161">I was with

the southerner who loathed negroes, blacks, so much so that whenever I went out on the inspection tou throughout the city, as an MP, an officer of the MPs, he was checking IDs and whether they had a pass, and whenever he met up with black soldiers, he treated them abominably,sometimes would lock them up. </sentence><sentence id="163">I asked him why he would he do that and he said because I hate the blacks because they are garbage and they are the scum of humanity, and I said but Lieutenant, as much as I was able to express myself, but isn't America for all? </sentence><sentence id="164">This was my dream of America, equality, justice from outside looking in. </sentence><sentence id="165">He said, yes, except for the blacks. </sentence><sentence id="166">And strangely enough, this was an MP lieutenant who was magnificent toward me even though he already began to find out that I was of Jewish background. </sentence><sentence id="167">But his superior officer, Major, also from the deep south, hated the Jews, and after a while, when Lieutenant Dempsey come sneaking into my room and bringing me something to eat, and I even needed permission to go the bathroom, because the major the provost marshall put me in a house arrest for as long as he would deliberate what to do with me next. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: What was the basis for house arrest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: That he didn't want a Jew boy to be an interpreter any more and he was trying to make up his mind what to do with me next, and Lieutenant Dempsy would come in an sharing his outrage but saying this was his superior officer. </sentence><sentence id="247">I can't  do anything about. </sentence><sentence id="248">And  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 also because he was one of the MPs. </sentence><sentence id="249">Strangely enough, he looked me up later when I was in the hospital and would bring me things to the hospital and when I came to the United States we became friends for years to come. </sentence><sentence id="250">So, that's another face of an American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="251">But, I never lost faith in the ideals of America and I wanted to go there, although I have already seen some of the shady sides of the face of the American people as exemplified by some of the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="252">Meaning, some homosexuals, some Jew hating soldiers, and eventually I was taken to a DP camp in Augsburg which was a Polish displaced persons camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="268">My official name was then Kutrzeba, which was the assumed name under which I got the Polish identity card under the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="269">When the time came to register at the Polish DP camp, I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites, I still felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I.s that I met were just great and friendly people, and I felt that I should revert back to my original name. </sentence><sentence id="270">Pride in my family and my background, so I had given the name Fajwiszys, the original family name, but as the

September of 1945 and as I lived in the DP camp with one of the American MPs, the one who became a friend of mine, stopping by occasionally and bringing me cigarettes and candy and all that, I began to experience manifestations of anti-semitism among my fellow Poles. </sentence><sentence id="275">It seems that whenever they talked about Jews it was denigrating and Jew boys and I wish they got rid of all of them and worse. </sentence><sentence id="276">So, here I was  in a DP camp with Polish population listening to a lot of anti-semitic  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org

when I started attending the university of Munich on food rations that one can only imagine, no money no tuition to be sure, I have friends in New York to this day there are three of them that are my

</sentence><sentence id="305">Officially they became to be known as Polish guard, but we where in the service of the American army not armed because the soviets launched a huge propaganda that we were out to liberate Poland that the Americans and the British were cultivating this force in order to march on Poland but we were guarding American depots and performing a semi police duty for the American army. </sentence><sentence id="306">By that time, it was very difficult to get in on that force because there were three square meals a day and lodging and so on. </sentence><sentence

how I wanted to be known from now on. </sentence><sentence id="311">He asked me why and I had to concoct a new story in order to as by that time I pledged to myself remain Polish and catholic and make an absolutely clean break with Jews, and eventually hoping to immigrate to America into yet another lions den and I say it advisedly just as went into East Prussia with fake Polish documents hoping that in Germany I would be less apt to be found out a Jew than by fellow Polish nationals. </sentence><sentence id="312">This time I felt I would go to America as a Polish catholic and as long as I keep away from certain people, nobody would care, nobody would even bother because I had been told that in American as long as you do your job well, nobody cares who you are. </sentence><sentence id="313">Well, we'll get to that. </sentence><sentence id="314">So, when I appeared 15:06: before the captain and told him that Fajwiszys was a name that I took on because
