<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: There was one episode that I meant to cite and I will do it now. </sentence><sentence id="4">In those first few days of September of 1942, when the mass deportation started, my mother had been taken away. </sentence><sentence id="5">My father and my sister had to leave our dwelling because the Germans who were shrinking and shrinking the size of the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="6">It was hot. </sentence><sentence id="7">It was summer and there was no roof over their head anymore so we lived in the street for about three days and three nights on the pavement. </sentence><sentence id="8">When I finally obtained my father's permission to leave him for a few minutes because I wanted to look up my buddies from the resistance movement, something which he opposed for two or three hours, because he didn't want to lose sight of me in case we don't find each other again or that one of us will be swept up by yet another Razzia. </sentence><sentence id="9">I, walking down the street, I ran into one of the two fellows who a year and a half before recruited me for the resistance movement Hashomer Hatzair. </sentence><sentence id="10">This was Richard, we called him Rishak. </sentence><sentence id="11">He had the look of an insane person rushing about, and I asked him well where are the leaders and where is our cell and he finally gave me an address where I could find our company commander, a girl about 17. </sentence><sentence id="12">The word being Gdud, and when I asked him where Simon was, the taller of us three who also with him recruited me into the resistance movement, he told me that several days before the two of them were caught by the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="13">They had managed to work their way homesby a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="14">The streets were deserted. </sentence><sentence id="15">The punishment for violating the curfew was often This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="16">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="17"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection instant execution in the street. </sentence><sentence id="18">So, the two of them darted into a store front and were flat against the wall when the German gendarme went by. </sentence><sentence id="19">German gendarme, who paroled the Ghetto most of the time in addition to the SS who used to come in for forays, for selection, but mainly after 9:00 in the evening it was the gendarmes, you might call it the military policemen. </sentence><sentence id="20">They discovered them and as Richie had time to tell me in those few words with the commotion in the street and throngs of hundreds of people milling about not knowing where to go what to do with themselves, waiting yet another selection. </sentence><sentence id="21">He said when the German gendarme approached them and asked them what they were doing in German, the gendarme turned to the taller Simon who was always the more combative one, the more bellicose one of us three. </sentence><sentence id="22">He always felt that when the time comes, the sooner the better that we should fight with whatever we had at our disposal. </sentence><sentence id="23">The German gendarme turned to him and called him "Du verfluchter Juedischer Schwein_, which means you Goddamn Jewish pig. </sentence><sentence id="24">Richard said Simon shot back and said you Goddamn German pig, at which point the gendarme shot him between the eyes. </sentence><sentence id="25">That's how we lost our closest friend, and at that point Richard, with his half insane look on his face said I got to go. </sentence><sentence id="26">I got to look for my father. </sentence><sentence id="27">I don't know where my father is. </sentence><sentence id="28">So, I went back to join my father and my sister in the street. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Let me ask you one question. </sentence><sentence id="58">The years after that when hiding you were a catholic boy when you converted, did you have any information or contact with Jewish people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Since I jumped out of the train on the way to Treblinka in the first few days of September of "42, other than sneaking into two more Ghettos, in the provincial small towns, which This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="62">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="63"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection lasted a few weeks before the deportations there started also. </sentence><sentence id="64">Once I was on my own again, and later with the priest and working for the Polish peasants, as of November "43 going to east Prussia with new Polish documents and Polish catholic until the end of the war, I had absolutely no contact with the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="65">I had no idea what became of them except that common talk had it that they were all either having been exterminated or they're in the concentration camps, and that there is a countrywide hunt for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="66">I did not know about the crematoria obviously at that point, but I had the foreboding based on tidbits that they're either all exterminated or about to be exterminated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: What about </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: There was no time to stop and think and deliberate as to what it feels like. </sentence><sentence id="78">The entire focus second by second, minute by minute, day by day was on self preservation and that meant watching my facial expressions, my  gesticulations, my "true story" where I came from, my identity obviously changed as to my background, my schooling, who my parents were, watching my speech. </sentence><sentence id="79">Because one could give one self away with one word. </sentence><sentence id="80">Even though we were quite Polanized, coming from a certain environment one accrues a lexicon of words that one doesn't even think about. </sentence><sentence id="81">Whether one be an Irishman or a Jew or an Italian, every now and then you use a certain word which under normal circumstances it is accepted and is part of the mosaic of life especially when there are some minorities in the country. </sentence><sentence id="82">You don't think of that, but when you try to play another role as it were and pose for someone else, one could give one's self away with a word. </sentence><sentence id="83">I'll never forget by the time I got to East Prussia and my German was already This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="84">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="85"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection so-so because of exposure and because of my childhood where my father taught me a little bit German and I was speaking German passably and I'll never forget when I spoke to a German and I used the word for bread Broit. </sentence><sentence id="86">Broit is the Yiddish, Brot is the German. </sentence><sentence id="87">Well, inadvertently trying to acquire as much German as I could in order to speak to the Germans, | used that word Broit and the German looked at me and corrected me and said it's not Broit, it's Brot. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I said yes, of course, but I almost collapsed within me because I felt that I would give myself away with that one word. </sentence><sentence id="89">Fortunately the German was not aware of that, but one had to be on a constant alert every second of the day first speaking to the Polish population for whom out in the country I was the "educated city boy." </sentence><sentence id="90">So, when they commented how good my Polish is, well he's from the city. </sentence><sentence id="91">But also with the priest, Father Farkowski we had a number of sessions where he would pluck out a word from my daily 13:12: lingo and then coach me not to use this word, not to use that word, and taught me a new melody of speech. </sentence><sentence id="92">In other words, a pygmaleon, he was remaking me right down to how to hold my lips together because he felt that Jews by and large were more sensuous people and their lips were by and large thicker. </sentence><sentence id="93">Many Poles so he felt had a thinner line of lips, so then he coached me that when I'm not actually speaking to hold my lips together like this. </sentence><sentence id="94">In order to project a thinner lip line. </sentence><sentence id="95">So, I was -- ever since those days when he started remaking my identity as it were, for years and years after the war as I see it now, I have been groomed to play a role, and that lasted for years and years after the war, until not too long ago, maybe ten or fifteen years ago when I began to search for what is my own self. </sentence><sentence id="96">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="97">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="98"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: I want to get to that a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="124">Let's pick up from when you were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="125">If you can remember that for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Well, the day after the liberation by the American troops and this was Patton's third army in Erfurt, Thuringen, which I was liberated the day after President Roosevelt died, which I believe was April 13, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="130">A couple of the Polish fellows with whom I lived courtesy of my boss, where he found a small room for five, six of us Polish civilian workers so we would not have to stay in a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="131">One of the two Polish fellows said to me to go to the main railroad station, Erfurt, because that's where there were a lot of Americans. </sentence><sentence id="132">So, we walked over there maybe a half an hour or so, and there across the street from the main railroad station in Erfurt, there were a lot of G.I.s. </sentence><sentence id="133">In front of the hotel across the street from the station there was a lot of movement of G.I.s so obviously it's hard to describe how it felt. </sentence><sentence id="134">A mixture of enthusiasm that one actually not fully believed yet that this was liberation, but it must have been because there were American soldiers all around. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was warm and many of the soldiers were in a very friendly mood so I trying to invoke my English of which I had had two years in the underground high school courses in the Warsaw Ghetto, and I knew a fair amount of English because I liked the language from the beginning more so than French and I started conversing with the American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="136">One word led to the other and they give us as usually after liberation -- skip it. </sentence><sentence id="137">They give us chocolate and cigarettes and things of that nature and we were very grateful and they said to come back in the evening and they'll have something more for us to eat. </sentence><sentence id="138">When I went back there the second day, one of the soldiers introduced me to a first lieutenant Preston. </sentence><sentence id="139">That lieutenant asked me, he looked like by the way one of the British This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection stars, David Niven, with the moustache, slim, tall very presentable, asked me whether I knew German. </sentence><sentence id="142">I said Yes, I do. </sentence><sentence id="143">Do I know Polish, yes of course, I'm Polish, I know some Russian. </sentence><sentence id="144">He said come on in and help us interpret because they've had a number of refugees and foreign nationals and also Germans whom they were interrogating apparently. </sentence><sentence id="145">So, I studied interpreting. </sentence><sentence id="146">I was then 17, for the American G.Ls. </sentence><sentence id="147">He asked me to come back the next day and after some two or three days, they gave me a shirt and the trousers of a G.I. uniform without an insignia so that within three or four days after the liberation I was already dressed as an American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="148">My job there was ostensibly as an interpreter and all around helper. </sentence><sentence id="149">I suppose some people call guys like me in those days a mascot or just a kid who fell in with the American troops. </sentence><sentence id="150">Within about a week later after I helped interpret for a huge number of displaced persons, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, goodness knows who else who would stop by that hotel simply because the Americans were there. </sentence><sentence id="151">Help me with this and help me with that. </sentence><sentence id="152">It was a whole movement of nations. </sentence><sentence id="153">Occasionally, they would bring in Germans and as I found out later some got pretty rough treatment. </sentence><sentence id="154">They were moving out. </sentence><sentence id="155">This American unit and they asked me if I wanted to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="156">Well, you might as well of put me on the moon of my dreams because of course I would want to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="157">By that time I was eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the war time diet. </sentence><sentence id="158">There was candy and cigarettes and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="159">It wasn't until a few weeks later when my English started getting better and so on that I found out what that unit what. </sentence><sentence id="160">To me they were just American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="161">They were CIC. </sentence><sentence id="162">Counter Intelligence Corp of the United States Army, and as it turned out this was detachment 220 of the 20th Corp which was part of the 3rd Army, Patton's. </sentence><sentence id="163">So, I traveled with that unit. </sentence><sentence id="164">There were at the most This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

of a gun, he was the judge who once found me guilty when I had a traffic ticket in New York. </sentence><sentence id="167">Major Loeb who was a prince of a fellow in contrast with one of his lieutenants who within I would say two weeks or so made approaches to me, homosexual approaches that I frankly didn't know how to cope with. </sentence><sentence id="168">In the best English I could offer him when he came into my room in the evening, because wherever we went they commandeered the German hotel, I told him I was a catholic and as best as I could that we don't do things like these. </sentence><sentence id="169">Because up until that time I had never had any sexual encounter at age 17 since during the war in East Prussia at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or women to be with. </sentence><sentence id="170">A foreign national, Pole or any other non-German was under severe penalty to have any intimate relationships with a German girl, which was unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="171">Some who had and found a German girl I suppose consenting were taken to concentration camp or severely beaten by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="172">That was to preserve the purity of the German race. </sentence><sentence id="173">So, I had had absolutely no experience with a man or a woman. </sentence><sentence id="174">Within a few days after I was liberated and I was with these American G.Is in a hotel  where they were stationed. </sentence><sentence id="175">One of them asked me if I could play piano and I said yes a little bit and I sat down to play piano. </sentence><sentence id="176">I had short pants. </sentence><sentence id="177">It was April and he sidled up to me and he put his hand inside my pants and started fondling me as I was playing piano. </sentence><sentence id="178">This was a few days after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="179">That was before I found out that they were CIC. </sentence><sentence id="180">To me they were just normal American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="181">Within a couple of weeks two of them had made advances to me. </sentence><sentence id="182">That was part of my exposure to my great liberators and it wasn't until years, years later when I had gone to Yale and acquired a little bit more street wisdom and exposure to the world that I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="183">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="184"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection learned that as the saying goes the intelligence community not to mention the diplomatic community is disportionately staffed by homosexuals. </sentence><sentence id="185">My experience in the American counter intelligence, that's the people who liberated me within two weeks two of them had made advances vis-a-vis me and I was 17. </sentence><sentence id="186">As we drove with my liberators -- and the advances stopped by the way soon enough because I had made it clear that I didn't want them. </sentence><sentence id="187">The CIC detachment followed the front line troops throughout Bavaria and into Austria almost to reach Linz. </sentence><sentence id="188">As soon as the American troops occupied a city, the CIC was there within hours and sometimes even ahead of them. </sentence><sentence id="189">Once we were caught in the cross fire because we had marching orders to reach the next city and it turned out that that had not yet been freed by front line troops. </sentence><sentence id="190">Wherever we reached the city and it went - - we had 13:25: gone through Augsburg and a number of southern German cities and into Austria, and I remember we were stationed for a while in Ried, in Innkreis meaning the district of Inn and the town was Reid. </sentence><sentence id="191">As soon as we reached the town that was liberated, we had four or five jeeps and in teams of two we had addresses to pluck out the Nazis who had been on the list. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, this was basically the job of the CIC, that was to arrest the more prominent Nazis, and I interpreted when I could. </sentence><sentence id="193">I have not seen any bad treatment except one that who was detached from the first French army, a native Alsatian Frenchman who despised the Germans and whenever he was interrogating them he beat them up very badly. </sentence><sentence id="194">Since I didn't have to interpret I never wanted to be part of that but I would hear from another room and he would break chairs over their heads and so on and a number of the Hitler Jugend or the SS men caught were beaten up pretty badly when they didn't want to answer questions. </sentence><sentence id="195">Eventually, by the time that our unit was commandeered back into Germany from Austria, the CIC unit I believe was being

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection transferred or sent home so that I was taken by one of the officers to an MP unit, Military Police, and that was in Augsburg, Germany, with the recommendation that the MPs could use an interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="198">By that time, my English became 14:02: more proficient. </sentence><sentence id="199">I was with that unit of the MPs being houses and fed and of course living with them and having a GI uniform without insignia, for many weeks. </sentence><sentence id="200">This was when I gradually emboldened by my liberation began to confide in one or two soldiers about my true background. </sentence><sentence id="201">That I was Polish but I was also Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="202">Although by and large the Gls and MPs with whom I was living and working were a magnificent lot of young people. </sentence><sentence id="203">They were mostly draftees. </sentence><sentence id="204">They couldn't wait to count their points to be repatriated and to be released from the army. </sentence><sentence id="205">To them I was a kid, 17 and Polish and anxious to help them and grateful. </sentence><sentence id="206">They treated me magnificently. </sentence><sentence id="207">But, as the word got out that I was also Jewish, I started experiencing a few incidents of anti- semitism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: It was a noticeable change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Significantly, I remember standing in line for chow, the 14:04: army meal, in Augsburg where we were quartered. </sentence><sentence id="298">One MP sergeant with whom I only had a passing acquaintance was in the line nearby and he started calling me the Jew boy. </sentence><sentence id="299">As it turned out he was of Polish ethnic background from Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="300">Then, a time came soon after when I was ordered to undergo house arrest. </sentence><sentence id="301">The lieutenant Dempsey I remember his name a strapping, huge giant of a man from Kentucky who behaved towards me like an older brother with no hint of homosexuality whatsoever, always protected me and liked me. </sentence><sentence id="302">He told me that the major of the MPs, the provost marshall of that division, didn't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="303">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="304"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 like Jews and ordered me house arrest for me. </sentence><sentence id="305">Lieutenant Dempsey the southerner who loathed negroes, blacks, so much so that whenever I went out on the inspection tou throughout the city, as an MP, an officer of the MPs, he was checking IDs and whether they had a pass, and whenever he met up with black soldiers, he treated them abominably,sometimes would lock them up. </sentence><sentence id="306">I asked him why he would he do that and he said because I hate the blacks because they are garbage and they are the scum of humanity, and I said but Lieutenant, as much as I was able to express myself, but isn't America for all? </sentence><sentence id="307">This was my dream of America, equality, justice from outside looking in. </sentence><sentence id="308">He said, yes, except for the blacks. </sentence><sentence id="309">And strangely enough, this was an MP lieutenant who was magnificent toward me even though he already began to find out that I was of Jewish background. </sentence><sentence id="310">But his superior officer, Major, also from the deep south, hated the Jews, and after a while, when Lieutenant Dempsey come sneaking into my room and bringing me something to eat, and I even needed permission to go the bathroom, because the major the provost marshall put me in a house arrest for as long as he would deliberate what to do with me next. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: What was the basis for house arrest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: That he didn't want a Jew boy to be an interpreter any more and he was trying to make up his mind what to do with me next, and Lieutenant Dempsy would come in an sharing his outrage but saying this was his superior officer. </sentence><sentence id="330">I can't  do anything about. </sentence><sentence id="331">And strangely enough, a man who became a friend of mine for years later in the United States, an attorney in Watertown, Massachusetts, an Irish man, John Corbot, who befriended me This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="332">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="333"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 also because he was one of the MPs. </sentence><sentence id="334">Strangely enough, he looked me up later when I was in the hospital and would bring me things to the hospital and when I came to the United States we became friends for years to come. </sentence><sentence id="335">So, that's another face of an American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="336">But, I never lost faith in the ideals of America and I wanted to go there, although I have already seen some of the shady sides of the face of the American people as exemplified by some of the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="337">Meaning, some homosexuals, some Jew hating soldiers, and eventually I was taken to a DP camp in Augsburg which was a Polish displaced persons camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Let me interrupt you for a second. </sentence><sentence id="350">How you experienced this, did it make you question whether you should remain catholic or admit your Judaism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: So, when I got to the DP camp in Augsburg, at the time when the population of the camp had to be registered, most had lost their i.d. </sentence><sentence id="354">cards and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="355">I then had a talk with myself because there was no one I could trust or knew what name I should use. </sentence><sentence id="356">My official name was then Kutrzeba, which was the assumed name under which I got the Polish identity card under the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="357">When the time came to register at the Polish DP camp, I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites, I still felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I.s that I met were just great and friendly people, and I felt that I should revert back to my original name. </sentence><sentence id="358">Pride in my family and my background, so I had given the name Fajwiszys, the original family name, but as the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="359">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="360"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 weeks went by into August, September of 1945 and as I lived in the DP camp with one of the American MPs, the one who became a friend of mine, stopping by occasionally and bringing me cigarettes and candy and all that, I began to experience manifestations of anti-semitism among my fellow Poles. </sentence><sentence id="361">It seems that whenever they talked about Jews it was denigrating and Jew boys and I wish they got rid of all of them and worse. </sentence><sentence id="362">So, here I was  in a DP camp with Polish population listening to a lot of anti-semitic comments, time and again, with most of them or all of them not knowing that I was also Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="363">This is no time and place, and I'm not a historian in order to make a case where there was anti-semitism in almost any country, including the United States, and there was some anti-semitism in Poland before the war, and the fact that there was six years of constant barrage on the average uneducated Pole by the German occupying authorities ridiculing Jews showing in the press caricatures of the Jew with the hook nose who is out to rob everybody and cheat everybody and for a case can be made, but this is no time and place for me to raise that. </sentence><sentence id="364">The fact is is that I began to experience almost daily anti-semitic conversations. </sentence><sentence id="365">That didn't make it easy, and when I was asked about the origin of the name of Fajwiszys which to those who know origin of names, might recognize that it is a Jewish name, I would say that it was a Lithuanian name, because a great many of Lithuanian names end is i-s. So, I said yes, it's an old family name from Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="366">Then, when word reached me that a Polish gymnasium was being formed in Munich that one could go on with one's studies, I got permission to leave that camp and repaired to Munich where I was accepted into the gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="367">There was a Polish gymnasium also in the DP camp specifically in the former SS Kaserne outside of Munich where very large Polish dp camp had been formed. </sentence><sentence id="368">The Jews had another camp a few This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="369">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="370"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 miles away and I had nothing to do with that and I have no reason to look up anybody because I was convinced that everybody I knew had perished. </sentence><sentence id="371">As I was exposed to some anti-semitism in the American army and in the DP camp I reached the conclusion by myself that the persecution is going to start over again. </sentence><sentence id="372">It's just a matter of time. </sentence><sentence id="373">I could not imagine that a country that was known to be the most civilized in Europe, Germany, at least 14:15 by some, launching a genocide with the whole world standing by without that it would start all over again. </sentence><sentence id="374">It was just a matter of time, and I didn't want to go through this again, now that I had obtained through some very difficult rambulations. </sentence><sentence id="375">My new identity I thought I would stick with it except in the way that my mind formed itself then, by then almost age 18, I felt that I should be proud of my original family name and somehow fake the answers to the origination of the name. </sentence><sentence id="376">In the DP camp in Munich, I eventually graduated from the Lyceum in 1947 an accelerated course with excellent marks, and the question was what's next. </sentence><sentence id="377">I still bore my original name Fajwiszys. </sentence><sentence id="378">But when I got to -- I'm going to start with something else now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="409">Q: I just want to ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="410">I just want to a little bit about the conditions or the life in the DP camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: The DP camp in Munich was the former SS barracks but barracks is not quite appropriate because Kaserne actually means a center, a military center.
