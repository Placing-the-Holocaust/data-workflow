<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2452">A: Yes, the booklet is -- I -- the teacher was thoughtful enough to send me two copies, one for me and one for the museum specifically, and I forwarded it to Dr.ronga -- Ringelheim. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2455">Q: Well, since we are with the museum, let me follow up with a question about the museum. </sentence><sentence id="2456">How do you -- how do you see the role of the Holocaust Museum in -- in Washington, D.C.? </sentence><sentence id="2457">How do you feel about what -- what they are doing, or what they have done already? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2461">A: Well, I express myself, I feel very eloquently about it on my video. </sentence><sentence id="2462">I -- I was absolutely delighted with the creation of this museum, because it is a tremendous tool, not only of showing people what has happened, but as a tool for educating people for the future, how to learn to get along. </sentence><sentence id="2463">How to -- how to see things from the perspective of different human beings, people who went through it, people who did help, people who taught about it. </sentence><sentence id="2464">The museum has testimonies of so many survivors, and they range from people who can hardly express themselves to people who are very articulate and who can just bare their soul, and try to teach the listeners, and open their eyes and ears and teach them the lessons. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2465">  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2466"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 73 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2467">Q: I've heard some survivors be quite critical, though, of the fact that this is not a museum solely dedicated to Jewish survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2468">Ho-How do you feel about that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2469">A: No, I disagree strongly. </sentence><sentence id="2470">I disagree because then it would defeat the purpose. </sentence><sentence id="2471">If it would be only to perpetuate the Jewish Holocaust, it would be very parochial. </sentence><sentence id="2472">I think that the museum is a warning and teaching experience for people of all persuasions all around the world, of all the people who can have the access to the museum. </sentence><sentence id="2473">It is a morally and ethically marvelous tool, because it exposes people to -- not only to the evil, but also to the goodness. </sentence><sentence id="2474">It exposes people to the teaching of the survivors like myself, what did they learn, and what did they want to tell the future generations?Because we as survivors are getting old, and we are dying out, and we will be the last ones who will be heard from. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2482">Q: Do you think there can ever be too much education about the Holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="2483">Because some people are also a little fearful that too much quote, fixation on the Holocaust takes away from more -- fr-from other aspects of Jewish culture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2486">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="2487">I disagree. </sentence><sentence id="2488">This is my point of view. </sentence><sentence id="2489">You can never take away from the culture by teaching people how to get along with other people. </sentence><sentence id="2490">It is this -- my individual understanding, and I hope by -- that people who will listen to me will agree with me, that the museum, it was created for the purpose of teaching people to avoid in the future, genocides not only of Jewish people, but all the people everywhere on this earth. </sentence><sentence id="2491">Unfortunately, we have the bad examples occurring now throughout the world. </sentence><sentence id="2492">And this museum teaches people how to -- how to understand   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 74 this, and how to avoid. </sentence><sentence id="2493">How can the museum be a -- a -- o-only preaching about the Jewish genocide? </sentence><sentence id="2494">There's genocide now going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2505">Q: D-Do you feel that there was a certain point in American history when people were beginning to be more interested and more knowledgeable about the Holocaust in -- in -- as -- as a whole? </sentence><sentence id="2506">Was -- do you think there was a certain turning point, or -- yeah, well, that's the first point of my question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2509">A: I think that many of the survivors who became successful in their private lives were very instrumental in pushing the idea of creating this museum, and they were able to support it financially. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And ever since that time -- there are other museums in different countries that are being spurred by the idea of the -- of the Washington Holocaust Museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2513">Q: And how do you feel about sort of popular films and -- and sort of popular culture to -- representing the Holocaust? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2515">A: Well, I'm not too fond of them because they could never really portray the true Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2516">The movie "Holocaust" that was in three or four parts, was a -- a -- a fairy tale, absolutely pointless. </sentence><sentence id="2517">On the other hand, "Schindler's List" was a teaching tool. </sentence><sentence id="2518">I feel that Schindler deserved to be mentioned because no matter what his motives in the beginning were -- he was a businessman who wanted to cash in on, and make money. </sentence><sentence id="2519">However, eventually, by seeing the injustice and the h-horror of the German authorities, he changed his mind and he became instrumental in saving people. </sentence><sentence id="2520">So this fi-film I believe it -- it was worthwhile. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2521">  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2522"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 75 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2523">Q: Do you -- are you a part of a s-survivor group, or do you -- do you socialize with survivors? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2524">A: Not really, because where I lived, I -- | have my few friends here who happen to be just American born friends, and not necessarily Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2525">I -- we have a writing class, we have a reading club, and I also play Bridge. </sentence><sentence id="2526">I do not belong to the group which is very active in our city, of -- there is no -- no reason really, I just can't travel them and I -- I stay in touch with people who help me because I can't drive, they pick me up and take me with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2530">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say to end this interview? </sentence><sentence id="2531">I have asked you what I wanted you to ask -- what I wanted to ask you and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2532">A: As usual, my ending would be first thanking the interviewer for taking the time, and being very kind, and asking me all the questions and traveling here in the very hot day. </sentence><sentence id="2533">And my philosophy is always the same, I try to persuade people to open their hearts, and open their ears, and thinking of -- that we are here on this earth, put on temporarily, and we should make the best of the time that is allotted to us. </sentence><sentence id="2534">Why do we have to fight? </sentence><sentence id="2535">What divides us? </sentence><sentence id="2536">We all are of human race, no matter what color, what religious persuasion. </sentence><sentence id="2537">We should concentrate on doing the very best to get along and to -- to divert our energy and resources to help eradicate the [indecipherable] that we have spread around the world. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2538">Q: Unfortunately, I have just thought of one more question, and that's the very last -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2539">A: That's ok -- that's all right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
