loaded with water, was heavy the pot, you know, to carry. </sentence><sentence id="94">That's the way we brought the water. </sentence><sentence id="95">Till my father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was my birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding from the bombs and I said, "That's my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="96">I maybe get killed from the bombs." </sentence><sentence id="97">And in the same dav mv father was... went to the Rabbi with mv two brothers on the He  the whole building came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, "Is this how you so holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?" </sentence><sentence id="98">So the Rabbi said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="99">You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren." </sentence><sentence id="100">And all of a sudden like a window was opening in the ground, and my father was out from the...from the, you know, bombed out house, from the shrapnels, and he pulled out my brothers, the two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="101">They were injured, the face and scratches and he

stay in a store in the same building. </sentence><sentence id="102">They had a dairy store with people. </sentence><sentence id="103">They didn't have children, two old people. </sentence><sentence id="104">So they agreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a room by himself. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was a very holy man. </sentence><sentence id="106">And we also stood there. </sentence><sentence id="107">Not only us, but practically the whole building of people were standing like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there. </sentence><sentence id="108">And then when the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied Poland, so my father...somebody came already and said our mill was bombed and we have nothing to go there. </sentence><sentence id="109">So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, "Where are you? </sentence><sentence id="110">What I am going to do. </sentence><sentence id="111">Everything is bombed?" </sentence><sentence id="112">And the Rabbi said, "Believe me. </sentence><sentence id="113">Not you....uh...not you mill is...is bombed." </sentence><sentence id="114">In the same town was my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="115">My mother's brother was a very rich man. </sentence><sentence id="116">He had a mill in the same neighborhood what my father and actually my uncle's mill was bombed and burned and ours was partly burned but not completely. </sentence><sentence id="117">So my mother wasn't able to go. </sentence><sentence id="118">We didn't had any communication to go back to Tarczyn. </sentence><sentence id="119">So we start to walk. </sentence><sentence id="120">Myself, my father and mine...one of mine brothers, and my father's partner and his son. </sentence><sentence id="121">I will name him Mr. Leshno and another two people. </sentence><sentence id="122">It was a distant relative of ours. </sentence><sentence id="123">He also went with his son to Tarezyn. </sentence><sentence id="124">32 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="125">We maked it in a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="126">We get to come home. </sentence><sentence id="127">But we came near to the town. </sentence><sentence id="128">The smell was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="129">From fire, from bodies, from sweat. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was very hot. </sentence><sentence id="131">And we saw as we came to the town...uh...I could...everybody could see our house, and it was like the edge burned the house and in behind was our mill. </sentence><sentence id="132">So we came back to the house. </sentence><sentence id="133">I opened the closet. </sentence><sentence id="134">It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we didn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because the war was coing we didn't susnect that we will have to run awav. </sentence><sentence id="135">So that was s00d  and they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this house from the fire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno. </sentence><sentence id="136">They took him on the attic. </sentence><sentence id="137">They wanted money. </sentence><sentence id="138">So my father said he has no money. </sentence><sentence id="139">He has the mill. </sentence><sentence id="140">And it's after the war and I don't have money. </sentence><sentence id="141">And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a person like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away. </sentence><sentence id="142">So my father was afraid to go to his room but on the attic a tailor was living there, without children, a nice old Jewish poor people. </sentence><sentence id="143">So he went into them and he sat til the morning there. </sentence><sentence id="144">But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive. </sentence><sentence id="145">And it was the first night in the town. </sentence><sentence id="146">So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my aunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too. </sentence><sentence id="147">It didn't took too long. </sentence><sentence id="148">It took about maybe 2 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="149">My father decided he's going to be free. </sentence><sentence id="150">He cannot live like this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="151">First, they go to Warsaw, and later will go to Russia to Bialystok (ph). </sentence><sentence id="152">They said goodbye to us and my mother was crying. </sentence><sentence id="153">She screamed, "I am already a widow. </sentence><sentence id="154">How do you leave me?" </sentence><sentence id="155">But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also. </sentence><sentence id="156">So we remained in the town with the maid. </sentence><sentence id="157">The maid had no place where to go. </sentence><sentence id="158">It was a Jewish woman. </sentence><sentence id="159">She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there. </sentence><sentence id="160">And my father disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="161">We didn't know what and where and what. </sentence><sentence id="162">Occasionally we got... mean my mother got...just had the news. </sentence><sentence id="163">My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything is alright. </sentence><sentence id="164">Maybe we'll some day be able to join him." </sentence><sentence id="165">So...uh...we stood together in this Tarezyn, and nothing specially, you know. </sentence><sentence id="166">We lived without... just with the hope that we will join our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace. ( </sentence><sentence id="167">Sigh) Then one day what I remember, my mother said, "We're out of money and I have to go to Warsaw to Mr. Flynn. </sentence><sentence id="168">Mr. Flynn was a Polish German. </sentence><sentence id="169">That means he was a German by birth, but he lived in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="170">And he had...uh....we call it here commissioned bakery, and he owned us a lot of money so maybe he could give us some money. </sentence><sentence id="171">So my mother left and my younger brother got very sick and I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="172">I was like the woman of the house so I called a neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="173">She was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="174">And she give him some medication and make us not cry and the maid was very good to us. </sentence><sentence id="175">And my mother went to my uncle and from my uncle they took a car and they went to this bakery. </sentence><sentence id="176">And on the way, as they was driving on this...I don't know if they went by druska we call this with two horses and a wagon, you know, like a rickshaw, another rickshaw met them but like back and forth and there was my father with partner and with my cousin and my...my father's partner said, "I think I see Frymet." </sentence><sentence id="177">Frymet was my mother's name. </sentence><sentence id="178">So they stopped the rickshaws and my father when he...they arrived with my...with Leshno, they...they really don't have money, so they went right away to this Flynn to this...uh...man. </sentence><sentence id="179">And my mother went to him, not knowing, so actually they meet on the...met on the street. </sentence><sentence id="180">What a coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="181">So this was a happiest day for us. </sentence><sentence id="182">My brother's very sick and here I have my father back and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="183">Instead we're supposed to go to my father, they came back to us because in Russia they give us...they get them a few days to make their mind or they want to stay with them and they go to Sibiria or other places in Russia or they're going back. </sentence><sentence id="184">So it was not only for my father but all the people was like a mixup. </sentence><sentence id="185">Nobody wants to know...nobody knowed where they're going. </sentence><sentence id="186">This was my recollection as a little girl what I remembered. </sentence><sentence id="187">And...uh...my father came back and he was more calmly, wasn't afraid anymore, and he went in back to the mill and they started to do  business again. </sentence><sentence id="188">And this...uh...German Pole from the bakery gave him money. </sentence><sentence id="189">I mean he payed him what little by little, and we had a comfortable life. </sentence><sentence id="190">I wouldn't say no. </sentence><sentence id="191">Again I didn't have any worry as a child. </sentence><sentence id="192">School wasn't any more for us. </sentence><sentence id="193">So my parents hired...uh... a tutor and 5, 6 children been together and we learned whatever. </sentence><sentence id="194">Wasn't much, but was enough to...to go along, you know. </sentence><sentence id="195">And then it started to be very bad and my mother was afraid that my father should go to Warsaw to collect the money for the...so I volunteered and I went with Mr. Leshno once to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="196">I carried the money and one day a German came over, not to me, to Mr. Leshno and he took him away to work. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I didn't know what to do with me, but I know what where to go. </sentence><sentence id="198">So I went to my aunt, my mother's...uh...brother. </sentence><sentence id="199">And I start to cry. </sentence><sentence id="200">They took him away and...
