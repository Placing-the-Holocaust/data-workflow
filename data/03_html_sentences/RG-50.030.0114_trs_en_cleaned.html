</sentence><sentence id="93">It was like a half hour maybe, a hour walk but til we were loaded with water, was heavy the pot, you know, to carry. </sentence><sentence id="94">That's the way we brought the water. </sentence><sentence id="95">Till my father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was my birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding from the bombs and I said, "That's my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="96">I maybe get killed from the bombs." </sentence><sentence id="97">And in the same day my father

came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, "Is this how you so holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?" </sentence><sentence id="99">So the Rabbi said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="100">You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren." </sentence><sentence id="101">And all of a sudden like a window was opening in the ground, and my father was

took and then he slipped out the Rabbi too and they came to us in the evening and the Rabbi...and we couldn't stay in my uncle's apartment anymore because he lived in the third floor so we went to stay in a store in the same building. </sentence><sentence id="103">They had a dairy store with people. </sentence><sentence id="104">They didn't have children, two old people. </sentence><sentence id="105">So they agreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a room by himself. </sentence><sentence id="106">He was a very holy man. </sentence><sentence id="107">And we also stood there. </sentence><sentence id="108">Not only us, but practically the whole building of people were standing like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there. </sentence><sentence id="109">And then when the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied Poland, so my father...somebody came already and said our mill was bombed and we have nothing to go there. </sentence><sentence id="110">So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, "Where are you? </sentence><sentence id="111">What I am going to do. </sentence><sentence id="112">Everything is bombed?" </sentence><sentence id="113">And the Rabbi said, "Believe me. </sentence><sentence id="114">Not you....uh...not you mill is...is bombed." </sentence><sentence id="115">In the same town was my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="116">My mother's brother was a very rich man. </sentence><sentence id="117">He had a mill in the same neighborhood what my father and actually my uncle's mill was bombed and burned and ours was partly burned but not completely. </sentence><sentence id="118">So my mother wasn't able to go. </sentence><sentence id="119">We didn't had any communication to go back to Tarczyn. </sentence><sentence id="120">So we start to walk. </sentence><sentence id="121">Myself, my father and mine...one of mine brothers, and my father's partner and his son. </sentence><sentence id="122">I will name him Mr. Leshno and another two people. </sentence><sentence id="123">It was a distant relative of ours. </sentence><sentence id="124">He also went with his son to Tarezyn. </sentence><sentence id="125">32 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="126">We maked it in a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="127">We get to come home. </sentence><sentence id="128">But we came near to the town. </sentence><sentence id="129">The smell was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="130">From fire, from bodies, from sweat. </sentence><sentence id="131">It was very hot. </sentence><sentence id="132">And we saw as we came to the town...uh...I could...everybody could see our house, and it was like the edge burned the house and in behind was our mill. </sentence><sentence id="133">So we came back to the house. </sentence><sentence id="134">I opened the closet. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we didn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because the war was going we didn't suspect that we will have to run away. </sentence><sentence id="136">So that was good for us, that we had right away everything. </sentence><sentence id="137">Also a cousin of mine moved in to our apartment because her house was burned and she actually saved this house because...with water...was no firemen at the time...so with water, with buckets of water she saved this fire shouldn't go farther. </sentence><sentence id="138">And we were again happy to stay. </sentence><sentence id="139">Right? </sentence><sentence id="140">As a child you ask me what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="141">I remember I was afraid to sleep in my bed because after all...uh...the two, three weeks I didn't sleep in a bed. </sentence><sentence id="142">I was always sitting or lying on the floor, no bed. </sentence><sentence id="143">So I went to mine aunt, mine father's sister to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="144">She had a restaurant in town, and she had a girl, my cousin, mine age. </sentence><sentence id="145">And we like each other very much. </sentence><sentence id="146">I said I would sleep with my cousin Hilda, and I don't want to sleep at home. </sentence><sentence id="147">So my mother said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="148">Oh...and at the time my mother came also to the town back. </sentence><sentence id="149">And I ran around to my aunt's to see if everybody is alive, and the town had a square and a lot of Germans in it. </sentence><sentence id="150">And I was very much afraid and people were running up to the Germans with a cigarette to sell bread or something and I slept this night by my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="151">In the morning about 7 o'clock, my father came in and talked something to my aunt and I was very anxious to know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="152">And they didn't want to tell me...a child...what happened during the night. </sentence><sentence id="153">That the German with the Poles come into our house  and they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this house from the fire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno. </sentence><sentence id="154">They took him on the attic. </sentence><sentence id="155">They wanted money. </sentence><sentence id="156">So my father said he has no money. </sentence><sentence id="157">He has the mill. </sentence><sentence id="158">And it's after the war and I don't have money. </sentence><sentence id="159">And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a person like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away. </sentence><sentence id="160">So my father was afraid to go to his room but on the attic a tailor was living there, without children, a nice old Jewish poor people. </sentence><sentence id="161">So he went into them and he sat til the morning there. </sentence><sentence id="162">But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive. </sentence><sentence id="163">And it was the first night in the town. </sentence><sentence id="164">So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my aunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too. </sentence><sentence id="165">It didn't took too long. </sentence><sentence id="166">It took about maybe 2 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="167">My father decided he's going to be free. </sentence><sentence id="168">He cannot live like this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="169">First, they go to Warsaw, and later will go to Russia to Bialystok (ph). </sentence><sentence id="170">They said goodbye to us and my mother was crying. </sentence><sentence id="171">She screamed, "I am already a widow. </sentence><sentence id="172">How do you leave me?" </sentence><sentence id="173">But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also. </sentence><sentence id="174">So we remained in the town with the maid. </sentence><sentence id="175">The maid had no place where to go. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was a Jewish woman. </sentence><sentence id="177">She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there. </sentence><sentence id="178">And my father disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="179">We didn't know what and where and what. </sentence><sentence id="180">Occasionally we got... mean my mother got...just had the news. </sentence><sentence id="181">My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything is alright. </sentence><sentence id="182">Maybe we'll some day be able to join him." </sentence><sentence id="183">So...uh...we stood together in this Tarezyn, and nothing specially, you know. </sentence><sentence id="184">We lived without... just with the hope that we will join our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace. ( </sentence><sentence id="185">Sigh) Then one day what I remember, my mother said, "We're out of money and I have to go to Warsaw to Mr. Flynn. </sentence><sentence id="186">Mr. Flynn was a Polish German. </sentence><sentence id="187">That means he was a German by birth, but he lived in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="188">And he had...uh....we call it here commissioned bakery, and he owned us a lot of money so maybe he could give us some money. </sentence><sentence id="189">So my mother left and my younger brother got very sick and I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="190">I was like the woman of the house so I called a neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="191">She was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="192">And she give him some medication and make us not cry and the maid was very good to us. </sentence><sentence id="193">And my mother went to my uncle and from my uncle they took a car and they went to this bakery. </sentence><sentence id="194">And on the way, as they was driving on this...I don't know if they went by druska we call this with two horses and a wagon, you know, like a rickshaw, another rickshaw met them but like back and forth and there was my father with partner and with my cousin and my...my father's partner said, "I think I see Frymet." </sentence><sentence id="195">Frymet was my mother's name. </sentence><sentence id="196">So they stopped the rickshaws and my father when he...they arrived with my...with Leshno, they...they really don't have money, so they went right away to this Flynn to this...uh...man. </sentence><sentence id="197">And my mother went to him, not knowing, so actually they meet on the...met on the street. </sentence><sentence id="198">What a coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="199">So this was a happiest day for us. </sentence><sentence id="200">My brother's very sick and here I have my father back and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="201">Instead we're supposed to go to my father, they came back to us because in Russia they give us...they get them a few days to make their mind or they want to stay with them and they go to Sibiria or other places in Russia or they're going back. </sentence><sentence id="202">So it was not only for my father but all the people was like a mixup. </sentence><sentence id="203">Nobody wants to know...nobody knowed where they're going. </sentence><sentence id="204">This was my recollection as a little girl what I remembered. </sentence><sentence id="205">And...uh...my father came back and he was more calmly, wasn't afraid anymore, and he went in back to the mill and they started to do  business again. </sentence><sentence id="206">And this...uh...German Pole from the bakery gave him money. </sentence><sentence id="207">I mean he payed him what little by little, and we had a comfortable life. </sentence><sentence id="208">I wouldn't say no. </sentence><sentence id="209">Again I didn't have any worry as a child. </sentence><sentence id="210">School wasn't any more for us. </sentence><sentence id="211">So my parents hired...uh... a tutor and 5, 6 children been together and we learned whatever. </sentence><sentence id="212">Wasn't much, but was enough to...to go along, you know. </sentence><sentence id="213">And then it started to be very bad and my mother was afraid that my father should go to Warsaw to collect the money for the...so I volunteered and I went with Mr. Leshno once to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="214">I carried the money and one day a German came over, not to me, to Mr. Leshno and he took him away to work. </sentence><sentence id="215">And I didn't know what to do with me, but I know what where to go. </sentence><sentence id="216">So I went to my aunt, my mother's...uh...brother. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I start to cry. </sentence><sentence id="218">They took him away and...

</sentence><sentence id="1265">Otherwise, they will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1266">So everybody went down. </sentence><sentence id="1267">This little boy didn't go out. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1273">And then when he came down they left and took them all to the train. </sentence><sentence id="1274">This was day before our New Year, exactly September 9, 42.

id="1278">Maybe he doesn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1279">You have to touch it to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1280">So we came to this house and when they saw me...a few people..."Oh, my God, you're such a pretty child. </sentence><sentence id="1281">Your mother showed us pictures from you. </sentence><sentence id="1282">She was crying all the day. </sentence><sentence id="1283">Poor woman if she wouldn't go out." </sentence><sentence id="1284">So we knew it already that's...that's the story what the little boy told is true. </sentence><sentence id="1285">As we were there the German were smart, so they start a new selection and they start to catch people from the street because they had all amount that they wanted, card or no card. </sentence><sentence id="1286">So we start to...to hide again. </sentence><sentence id="1287">But luckily, to tell you the truth I don't know how, I...we came...my father, myself and the rest of us back to the shop. </sentence><sentence id="1288">We didn't go back to the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1289">We were afraid that maybe they will take us away. </sentence><sentence id="1290">We wanted to spend as much as we could in the shop. </sentence><sentence id="1291">It wasn't safe, but better than at home. </sentence><sentence id="1292">You know I worked in the night time. </sentence><sentence id="1293">I...I fell asleep during the day. </sentence><sentence id="1294">I couldn't sit in the shop. </sentence><sentence id="1295">They wouldn't let me in. </sentence><sentence id="1296">So I stood mostly in the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And this same time my father met an acquaintance and he said, "You know, I am looking for you. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Your son come to me from Miller 22"...he was also from the Miller 22..."and he said, "David, maybe you have a better...better bunker where I could hide with my brother and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I have the money. </sentence><sentence id="1300">I will give you." </sentence><sentence id="1301">And he told this my father. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And I said, "In my bunker is just the amount of people what we could go in, so I couldn't take him." </sentence><sentence id="1303">So my father was very abusive that he couldn't...that my brother was saved with mother. </sentence><sentence id="1304">But he said, "Please believe me. </sentence><sentence id="1305">I couldn't do it." </sentence><sentence id="1306">This man was a very selfish man and a very rich man. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So my father said, "And what you doing now." " </sentence><sentence id="1308">I have no place where  4 to go." </sentence><sentence id="1309">So my father said, "It's okay. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Come to my house." </sentence><sentence id="1311">And he with his wife and child came to live together in our house. </sentence><sentence id="1312">I give even away my bed to his wife because she was a very sick woman. </sentence><sentence id="1313">She didn't look like Jewish at all with a little girl 3 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1314">This woman survived the war thanks to me. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Many days I didn't go to the shop. </sentence><sentence id="1316">I was afraid and my work was in the night. </sentence><sentence id="1317">So I was hiding under my covers and I said, "I don't care if I live or not. </sentence><sentence id="1318">What do I have to lose. </sentence><sentence id="1319">My mother is not here. </sentence><sentence id="1320">My father is working. </sentence><sentence id="1321">I can't talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="1322">And I have...I am always hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1323">I don't know how to cook and I have nothing to cook. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So what's the use of living." </sentence><sentence id="1325">So he said and I was already 16 or 17 years old and this woman was very nice, but she had what to eat and she never shared. </sentence><sentence id="1326">She never would say, "Oh, Cywia take a biscuit or something." </sentence><sentence id="1327">No. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Mine little cousin when we met him. </sentence><sentence id="1329">He was a child. </sentence><sentence id="1330">He stole from her things to eat and one day I give him an address and I said to him, "You know, you have nothing to lose. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Go over the...the gates. </sentence><sentence id="1332">Go to the Irish, to the Poles and go to my friend. </sentence><sentence id="1333">She will know who you are, and tell her that you're hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Maybe she will give you a place to live. </sentence><sentence id="1335">He went. </sentence><sentence id="1336">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="1337">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="1338">He ate a good meal. </sentence><sentence id="1339">He brought me a bread. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1341">So this family...he had a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="1342">She was hiding two little sacks under my mattress. </sentence><sentence id="1343">She was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="1344">I never looked in into the ____ believe me and I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And one day, looking out from the window...was in the day time, I saw that the building was like this that Germans are in the building. </sentence><sentence id="1346">They are looking for people. </sentence><sentence id="1347">So I took the cover over my head. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And I said, "I don't care. </sentence><sentence id="1349">If they come, they will come." </sentence><sentence id="1350">So she put the little girl under my cover and she sat on the side and all of a sudden boom boom boom on the door, but nobody was open. </sentence><sentence id="1351">It was like dumb. </sentence><sentence id="1352">Pretend there is nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="1353">After a few minutes it was quiet and so they went away. </sentence><sentence id="1354">Okay?
