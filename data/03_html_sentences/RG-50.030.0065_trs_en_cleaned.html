through the town followed by a crowd of school children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the occupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were

had so the structure of the Jewish community remained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the famous day of 29th of August 1943. </sentence><sentence id="15">I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew about what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in September, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we were related to the community, intermarriage between the communities and youthful activities, we didn't know because we kind of lived in empty space, we didn't have information. </sentence><sentence id="16">We could hear pbe of course, but pbe didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't know about the Warsaw Ghetto for instance,

promise. </sentence><sentence id="36">Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. </sentence><sentence id="37">At any rate, so the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="38">At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had control over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. </sentence><sentence id="39">The Germans wanted the Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews they sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and

and . </sentence><sentence id="41">Then come September, September month and somebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph) with regard to our situation as Jews in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="42">But suffice here to say that the Germans decided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at that time and they ordered three ships to come from Germany and anchor in Copenhagen preparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish authorities who had not yet been released, not

kept against the constitution. </sentence><sentence id="45">Anyhow, the ships were prepared to take 7,000 Jews and a few hundred communists to Germany or to Poland, whatever they planned to do. </sentence><sentence id="46">But then something happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came from the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="47">His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a "W", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the entire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German cooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="48">But for his own reasons, which is a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much more versed into the details than I am. </sentence><sentence id="49">For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told one of his collaborators in the German, in

</sentence><sentence id="52">We never, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motive for his having to invent it, but there's no third witness. </sentence><sentence id="53">You only have his word for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because he loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his year fighting Jews, killing Jews. </sentence><sentence id="54">But his didn't find that it was in his best interests that particular moment of history where everything was going against the German, the German arms, after the invasion of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="55">After the collapse of the German, the German military that fought in the Stantengard(ph) in Eastern Russia, in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="56">It was not for his, in his interests that this anti-Jewish action should secede, that's why he told it to Tuckawitz who immediately informed the German, the Danish social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately went to the head of the Jewish community, a very respectable and respective lawyer of the high court called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="57">And they went to him and told him, okay, now you better prepare for something because there are only a couple of days left. </sentence><sentence id="58">And it's very interesting, it has to be remembered because part of the Disney Land atmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews all over, all around us. </sentence><sentence id="59">From Norway and all through the continent and we thought that we would go Scot-free and didn't prepare for anything. </sentence><sentence id="60">The Jewish community and leadership didn't even destroy the index of names and addresses of the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="61">The Germans came one day and confiscated it. </sentence><sentence id="62">Still this was not enough for us, so start moving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="63">And this guy in and the Danish  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 Germans will come after us. </sentence><sentence id="64">Where you go, everybody was on his own. </sentence><sentence id="65">The community had not prepare any escape route or any escape organization, nope, nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

escape routes. </sentence><sentence id="441">You go by the smell, you know, and you go by instinct you went down to the coast because the only place that you could hide, along the coast and hope to be able to get to the only place that might receive you and protect you was Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="442">And the sound(ph) between Denmark and Sweden is not very wide, but it recovered by the distance from the Danish coast to Sweden territory water could be covered by a quick boat in less than half an hour. </sentence><sentence id="443">But it was beyond our imagination. </sentence><sentence id="444">There lies Denmark which is hidden in the darkness and just across this narrow sound was neutral Sweden with lights and with chocolate and bananas and what not. </sentence><sentence id="445">But began to realize that there were people who were able to live another kind of life that we were. </sentence><sentence id="446">But we went down to the coast hoping that we could escape this way of course and hapbeny(ph), the Swedish government who had, by the way, not been welcoming to Romney refugees in 42's and early 43 issued a declaration during these H days welcoming all Jews saying that they could come to Swedish protection. </sentence><sentence id="447">The fact is that the Swedish not only made statements to that effect, but they also acted accordingly because Swedish patrol boats from the navy went out took the Swedish to the borderline and the moment that Danish boats crossed this borderline the Swedish boats immediately came to

you're afraid of moving on the roads because you were afraid of ending up in the arms of German patrol, there were Germans all over the place, soldiers mainly. </sentence><sentence id="450">Only later we know that the army decided not to interfere, not to take part in the acts against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="451">So the German army for its own reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews, wanted to protect the Jews, but simply for its own interests the German army only had one case that's known to have participated in this anti- Jewish action. </sentence><sentence id="452">This was left to the police and the, what do you call it, the visheyesteins(ph), the what the German counter intelligence, whatever it is the, Estit(ph), it's called Estit(ph). </sentence><sentence id="453">So the very fact that the army was all around didn't interfere. </sentence><sentence id="454">This we couldn't have known either. </sentence><sentence id="455">So we took hiding at this place

bridge where another Jewish family was waiting and picked them up and off it went to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="460">Of course we never learned what the reason was, maybe these people could have paid them more money, maybe it was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="461">I don't know, but we were standing out there in the darkness without any alternative. </sentence><sentence id="462">So we returned to the fisherman and we really did not, my father was responsible for the family. </sentence><sentence id="463">These were times when the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know what to do, we all relied on the fisherman getting some kind of connection which we could use in order to get out. </sentence><sentence id="464">Another night we spent at a large white house with lots of other
