<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1"> HERBERT PUNDIK November 11, 1995 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: Anyhow, uh, from that period I only remember one anticipated incident and it's quite remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="3">I have got back memories of I was locked, this was in the thirties when Hitler had taken over Germany and well he had to kind of, well you know, he stimulated a Nazi movement in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="4">Of course, Nazi movements , against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="5">But what I meant by this, some instant in the school yard, and I must have been very unhappy because our headmaster who had finished , he was a priest by , by background, but running this prep school. [ </sentence><sentence id="6">headmaster's name] called me up to his office and tried to console me and you know it's funny, it's uh, it's uh, it's uh, almost sixty years ago., [ </sentence><sentence id="7">headmaster's name] took off this typing and put it on my label and said that this is for you. </sentence><sentence id="8">It's fantastic, that this small incident I remember so vividly because it was a gentle way of declaring sympathy. </sentence><sentence id="9">But, at any rate, at that time I must have been about ten years old or so, my grandmother had died, so it must have been in the mid, in the mid thirties, maybe thirty-six. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father was the , religious Jews who had the means. </sentence><sentence id="11">They went, he went to Czechoslovakia and he found a scribe who could write a , you know. </sentence><sentence id="12">This usually took about one year's time and around thirty-seven my father went down to pick it up in Czechoslovakia and of course then it should be installed in the synagogue and this of course required a whole ceremony and I still remember at that time they had moved to more, my grandparents had moved to more comfortable quarters in the center of , not far away from the synagogue by the way. </sentence><sentence id="13">And um, I still remember the procession leaving the flat of my grandparents, my grandfather, had taken the route towards the synagogue it must have been about one kilometer and in front of this procession were two policemen riding on horseback , to keep order and then came the whole, you know, Orthodox Jewish community with the hasaan(ph), you know, the church singer in front singing all kind of very sad Jewish, Hebrew songs, I'm sure prayers. </sentence><sentence id="14">And after this came, my grandfather holding the Torah(ph), he    was not a very tall fellow, must have been about sixty or so. </sentence><sentence id="15">The Torah was almost as tall as he was. </sentence><sentence id="16">It was a beautiful decorated , of the family had made with the cover decoration with, you know, the name of my grandmother and so on and so forth and the whole Jewish community followed my grandfather then his sons and the rest of the community and the Rabi and what not, you know. </sentence><sentence id="17">And when we passed, the windows of the other private school in this district we had always been in competition, sports competition and academic, you know, competition who brought out the best, the best, you know the best exams and so on. </sentence><sentence id="18">I remember the pupil, this strange, no exotic sons, all three they rushed out and looked out from the window, hey , you know, it was me, they knew me from the football field, ah this is Pundik, you know. </sentence><sentence id="19">They didn't say first names at that time usually formal. </sentence><sentence id="20">Pundik ; yes, DKs laid up[ph], one of the school mates remembered this incident and it made a deep impression on him of course because it was so weird, it was so odd, but it made a very strong impression on me, which I remember to this day. </sentence><sentence id="21">It gave me some kind of, you know, spiritual base, not in a religious term, I respect very much my grandfather and my uncle's and my father to stand by their traditions and not to succumb, you know, to fear and what not and simply go through with this procession as it should be done. </sentence><sentence id="22">And I must say that very often I have been in all kinds of strange situations, I've been reminded of this because these people, they, you know, you couldn't, they were not, they were not, doubtful about, they may have lost, slowly lost their religious feeling, but as Jews to remit very proud, very full of self assurance; which made it easier for them to become , because if you stand by your culture the , will respect you for what you are. </sentence><sentence id="23">But if you start, you know, being wishy-washy and you lose your culture background it becomes more difficult for you to be accepted and integrated in , culture. </sentence><sentence id="24">Jewish culture and other national cultures go very well together because the Jewish culture of Tereshney[ph] was spiritual culture, not nationally, not nationally, rooted in a special territory. </sentence><sentence id="25">That what is said about Jewish living, you know, the new Jews almost thought(ph), that this was something in the heaven, I mean, it was not through(ph) the Turkish Jews living in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="26">So this is, I want to relate one more incident which is, which is, told to me a couple of years ago, I had a schoolmate who is also of Jewish origin in this elementary school, this schoolmate, uh, came from an assimilated family, , | mean they came probably two or three generations before us. </sentence><sentence id="27">They came from a place in Germany called Desow (ph) and the name of the family to this day remains Desow (ph) and he told me when we met by chance a couple of years ago, that, uh, I was always dressed in brown, for some reason my mother always thought that brown suited me well, uh, and of course a very unharmonious relationship between me and the color brown , can't stand it, but that is how it was imposed on you, so I even dressed up in brown, what do you call it, special weaving, uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Herringbone </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: I don't know, it's some kind of brown, uh, well most of us either wore blue or gray, or what not, but I wore brown. </sentence><sentence id="59">This guy from Desow(ph) he once came home and asked his mother, Tammy(ph), what is being Jew and then the mother said, well Jew, she didn't say Jewish like you, no, no, she said well the Jew, this is like Putnik. </sentence><sentence id="60">So, now I understand he said, the Jews are those who walk around with thier brown outfits. </sentence><sentence id="61">Anyhow, from that school I graduated into the Jewish school of the fine arts, by the way, also been a pupil, uh, and later I went to, we ought to now reach 1940, uh, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="62">I finished the other school which was a remarkable free school and then I joined the Sengre(ph), the Sengre School, one of the best in Coopenhagen, by the way, where the master, the chief, rector, whatever they are called was married to a Jewish woman who had been my father's teacher in the Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="63">You know it's a very, very small community, both the Jewish and the non-Jewish community are very interwoven. </sentence><sentence id="64">At any rate, so I, this was 1943 I joined this school, </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: This is when you(ph) joined the occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: This was after the Germans in 1940 had occupied Denmark. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: How did that effect your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Well, you know, interesting that they Germans made a deal with the Danish Government. </sentence><sentence id="72">So, when the German occupation was rather non-violent a few Danish soliders put up resistance because they didn't want to listen to the orders from the superiors to lay down their arms. </sentence><sentence id="73">But in Janisport(ph) when the Germans just marched into neutral Denmark and Denmark had to know that of course they could provide heroes, get heroes had they fought. </sentence><sentence id="74">But they had no political or military power to assist the Danish, the German occupation forces. </sentence><sentence id="75">Demark succumbed, made a deal with the Germans, a deal by the way which is of great significance to our life as Jews because that set us apart from the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, occupied Europe, because the made a deal with the Germans based on a kind of mutual respect, so to say, sharing of, sharing of authority. </sentence><sentence id="76">The Danes(ph) got permission from the Germans to go on with their normal lives. </sentence><sentence id="77">Political parties were non-functioning, the parliament went on giving laws, the government was inside, the King was riding through the town followed by a crowd of school children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the occupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were effected by the war and by the supply situation, but basically the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="78">We had two, we had two free parliamentary elections Denmark during the German occupation and the last one, the Nazi party, was simply trashed and the Germans didn't, didn't interfere. </sentence><sentence id="79">The Germans on their side of course wanted the Danes(ph) to let the Germans go on, so to say, building fortresses along the west coast to protect against a possible allied invasion and Denmark was supposed to be kind of supplying people for the Germans so the last part of the agricultural production(ph) went to the German army and the last part of the industrial production went to, so Denmark as a matter of fact became kind of unwilling, but still partner to the German war effort, one has to admit that, but this, sorry yes... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Let me ask you about the Jewish community and your family in particular. </sentence><sentence id="91">Did they feel threatened, vulnerable, did they feel... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: no, no, no... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: They felt protected by the Danes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Well the Danish government, this of course we did not know, but we know today. </sentence><sentence id="99">The Danish government told the Germans that there were a number of red lines which the Germans were supposed to respect in order to protect Danish sovreignty. </sentence><sentence id="100">One of the red lines was that no distinction between Danish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="101">Meaning that no special anti-Jewish legislation, no interference with Jewish life at the synagogue, the synagogues were operating the schools, were operating the old age homes, whatever you had so the structure of the Jewish community remained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the famous day of 29th of August 1943. </sentence><sentence id="102">I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew about what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in September, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we were related to the community, intermarriage between the communities and youthful activities, we didn't know because we kind of lived in empty space, we didn't have information. </sentence><sentence id="103">We could hear pbe of course, but pbe didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't know about the Warsaw Ghetto for instance, and the allies did not consider this a very important item in the news broadcasting, so we lived as a matter of fact in a fools paradise. </sentence><sentence id="104">Being persuaded to believe that the normal life we lived could continue without end. </sentence><sentence id="105">In the Danish community, by the way, was influenced by the Danish patricians, the Danish officials went on telling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the Jews this is what you call , this would be cause for war and then we would resign and the Germans would have to run the country. </sentence><sentence id="106">The Germans at that time did not necessarily have the desire to turn this country which was serving their ends into a hostile country which they would have to occupy with tens of thousands of soldiers which they needed somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="107">So there was kind of a balance based on communal interest, the Danish wanted to run the country safely out of the war the Germans wanted to have as much peace as possible to concentrate their efforts in another front. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Were there Jews who went into the resistance, the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: I wanted to come to this because one of the things that was posted on us was not to get involved with the emerging resistance, don't get the resistance started, acting to be a popular movement only after the mid or end 1943. </sentence><sentence id="122">Until then resistance was some groups committing small sabotage acts, publishing newspapers, but it was not something which the Germans at all felt threatened by, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="123">Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people, but didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-German agreement. </sentence><sentence id="124">People bother, but they have no effect on the German war effort. </sentence><sentence id="125">So, we were told don't join them. </sentence><sentence id="126">Now I was at that time at the age of 15 and of course I joined them. </sentence><sentence id="127">If people told me not to do it and it happened so that the famous communist , it was a schoolmate of mine. </sentence><sentence id="128">We started selling illegal newspapers and books published by the emerging resistance in order to finance their activities, they sold these books to underground of course, it was banned by the Germans, banned by the authorities, by the censor, the Danes had a post on Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="129">The Danes in order to prevent annoying the Germans too much, so one of the books I remember was by John Steinbeck. </sentence><sentence id="130">He was a part of the German occupation of Norway with me. </sentence><sentence id="131">He write, not a very sophisticated book, what it was, it served the purpose of these times. </sentence><sentence id="132">So, we were and of course the first thing you did was to settle to your family, but at any rate this was discolored by my father who was a member of the Jewish, one of the Jewish community agencies, member of the board or something. </sentence><sentence id="133">So of course he was more exposed(ph) than others because the Germans, as you know, that there had been always before going for the Jews in the community to take all the members of the leadership of the community simply to deprive the rest of the Jews from any leadership. </sentence><sentence id="134">This is the way they used to handle it. </sentence><sentence id="135">So my father was very unnerved, you've got to do this because that might put me, the family, the community in a very sensitive dangerous position. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I didn't want to listen to my father and he of course, what do you do, you call the chief Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="137">At that time chief Rabbis were not administrators of community affairs. </sentence><sentence id="138">They were people, imposing people with beards, you know and supposed to harbor a certain amount of wisdom. </sentence><sentence id="139">So I was told to go to the chief Rabbi. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: This is Fleetiger(ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: His name was Max Fleetiger(ph). </sentence><sentence id="164">He was originally from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="165">He spoke in the Danish language, but of course speaking with a heavy Hungarian accent. </sentence><sentence id="166">Later he was taken by the Germans and brought to a concentration camp and survived and came back into the community again. </sentence><sentence id="167">But, I still remember, there are some parts in history which you remember vividly where you are standing or sitting with the other guy, like the story with the typing, I remember that I was asked to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="168">I was standing up and he was sitting behind a huge desk with his , his and had a beard like or square, long beard, very well groomed, but you know. </sentence><sentence id="169">They told me that they, he ordered me to give up all this playing around and he said, I remember this today, if you don't give it up, you and others of your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of the Jewish community because if the Germans catch you or the Danes catch you revenge might be taken and that might put the whole safety of our community in danger. </sentence><sentence id="170">So, give it up. </sentence><sentence id="171">The moment that you have been told that you have the responsibility for a whole community and you're only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it up. </sentence><sentence id="172">So I went home and I burnt, and burnt all that was left of the illegal books and newspapers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="173">That must have been immediately before the trip to or immediately after. </sentence><sentence id="174">But you know that in 1943, August there was a clash between the Danes and the German interest and to put it shortly the Danes resigned and the Danish Government retired and the Parliament went home the King went into exile in his castle and the Shee(ph) which has protected us from German encroachment was removed overnight. </sentence><sentence id="175">Suddenly there were only Germans and us. </sentence><sentence id="176">The Germans didn't have to anymore consider this deal about you stick to your things and we'll stick to our things and the Jewish we are leaving behind. </sentence><sentence id="177">So at that time, 1943 August, about half of the Jewish community of Europe had been destroyed by the holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="178">We didn't know a thing, we didn't prepare a thing, the community did not try to build up kind of work preparing us. </sentence><sentence id="179">We were, we were__, remember my father went to the Director of the Foreign Ministry, during these days, of course we had a feeling that the situation had changed dramatically and that of course would change our situation, but we just didn't know how and he went to the Director of Foreign Ministry, who was living in the neighboring house and he asked me what's new so he said, don't worry, I have contact with the Germans all of the time and if anything is cropping up, we will warn you, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="180">Well, of course something cropped up, mainly the German Nazi against the Jews on the 2nd of October and he never warned us. </sentence><sentence id="181">I just want to tell in brackets a little human angle. </sentence><sentence id="182">We escaped of course and came back a couple of years(ph) later from Sweden and right after our return my parents sent this, by then had retired, a big bunch of flowers saying, don't worry, you didn't warn us but we got away and safely we came back. </sentence><sentence id="183">Now, whether they heard anything from me or not, I don't know, it was a very, very difficult situation of course, being faced with this old preach of promise. </sentence><sentence id="184">But many, many years later when I was serving as chief editor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put___.(ph) maybe 50 years later...and one of our staff members aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very easy because he sort of wanted to stay out of the limelight. </sentence><sentence id="185">I called him and asked him to make an exception and our reporter. </sentence><sentence id="186">He said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunch of flowers I received one night which I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="187">These were the flowers which your parents sent me in 1945 after you came back from refuge in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="188">It meant a lot to him that some people were trying to forgive him for having broken his promise. </sentence><sentence id="189">Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. </sentence><sentence id="190">At any rate, so the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="191">At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had control over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. </sentence><sentence id="192">The Germans wanted the Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews they sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="193">Well it's a long story, but the Danes refused the whole set up, so to say once abolished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with the mark in their hands and . </sentence><sentence id="194">Then come September, September month and somebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph) with regard to our situation as Jews in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="195">But suffice here to say that the Germans decided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at that time and they ordered three ships to come from Germany and anchor in Copenhagen preparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish authorities who had not yet been released, not succeeded in being released when the authorities went home. </sentence><sentence id="196">So the Germans simply arrested them as one of the most, most dishonorable, dishonorable events in modern day history, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="197">Of course they were arrested and kept against the constitution. </sentence><sentence id="198">Anyhow, the ships were prepared to take 7,000 Jews and a few hundred communists to Germany or to Poland, whatever they planned to do. </sentence><sentence id="199">But then something happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came from the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="200">His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a "W", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the entire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German cooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="201">But for his own reasons, which is a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much more versed into the details than I am. </sentence><sentence id="202">For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told one of his collaborators in the German, in the German embassy . </sentence><sentence id="203">A fellow who was a Nazi too, his name was Tuckawitz, T-U-C-K-A-W-I-T-Z, Tuckawitz, told about the approaching, German, German, action, I guess the Jews...Now this Tuckawitz, by the way, was a member of the German Nazi party, an early member of the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="204">Best was much earlier, Best was one of the evil spirits of the police department of the emerging Nazi party even before the two powers divides(ph) into three. </sentence><sentence id="205">Really, really a war criminal. </sentence><sentence id="206">He was not ever condemned to death, he should have been, for the reason that he let the secret slip and this was used by his defense to protect him against a life sentence after, death sentence after the war. </sentence><sentence id="207">But Tuckawitz was kind of a reformed Nazi and he became close, he was a neighbor, commercial, commercial. </sentence><sentence id="208">He had been with Camaris the head of the German intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="209">Camaris, C-A-M-A-R-I-S who is by the way execute(ph) by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="210">He had been with him at this job at the German embassy and was to prepare the German occupation of Denmark in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="211">But he remained here and established very close contact with the leaderships of the socialcratic party and became embarked with them and started to distancing himself from the Nazi ideology. </sentence><sentence id="212">Of course especially the anti-Jewish part of it and that when Best tipped him off saying that this day the of the Jews will take place and Best is quoted by Tuckawitz by the way, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="213">In racial talk or what German to the station. </sentence><sentence id="214">Tuckawitz quoted Best as saying, "I wish we could build a bridge across the south between Denmark and Sweden to aid these poor people to get safely away." </sentence><sentence id="215">We never, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motive for his having to invent it, but there's no third witness. </sentence><sentence id="216">You only have his word for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because he loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his year fighting Jews, killing Jews. </sentence><sentence id="217">But his didn't find that it was in his best interests that particular moment of history where everything was going against the German, the German arms, after the invasion of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="218">After the collapse of the German, the German military that fought in the Stantengard(ph) in Eastern Russia, in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="219">It was not for his, in his interests that this anti-Jewish action should secede, that's why he told it to Tuckawitz who immediately informed the German, the Danish social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately went to the head of the Jewish community, a very respectable and respective lawyer of the high court called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="220">And they went to him and told him, okay, now you better prepare for something because there are only a couple of days left. </sentence><sentence id="221">And it's very interesting, it has to be remembered because part of the Disney Land atmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews all over, all around us. </sentence><sentence id="222">From Norway and all through the continent and we thought that we would go Scot-free and didn't prepare for anything. </sentence><sentence id="223">The Jewish community and leadership didn't even destroy the index of names and addresses of the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="224">The Germans came one day and confiscated it. </sentence><sentence id="225">Still this was not enough for us, so start moving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="226">And this guy in and the Danish political(ph) leaders, to want him(ph), they said, Mr. Hedtoft, H-E-D-T-O-F-T, Mr.Hedtoft, later became the prime minister of Denmark after the war. </sentence><sentence id="227">He said, you are lying, he said well Hedtoft told him that he had a good source and that the game was up. </sentence><sentence id="228">You are lying. </sentence><sentence id="229">And Hedtoft almost broke out in tears because he was facing the war(ph) and the war(ph) didn't respond. </sentence><sentence id="230">But they succeeded after a while at making them understand that this was a serious matter and then out went the warning, the telephone chain as they called it, from one Jewish family to another that tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, don't stay at home because the Germans will come after us. </sentence><sentence id="231">Where you go, everybody was on his own. </sentence><sentence id="232">The community had not prepare any escape route or any escape organization, nope, nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: How did your father hear? </sentence><sentence id="313">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: My father, yes, my father heard this from somebody who had called him, who had been to morning prayers in the synagogue on September 13th I think. </sentence><sentence id="317">And he came home, I was in school, you know, we went on acting as if life was normal, you know, and as if we were as Danish as the Danes; which to some extent we were, at least in the eyes of the Danes, but not in the eyes of the Germans of course. </sentence><sentence id="318">By the way there was no yellow star, you know, there were no, there were no special legislation introduced by the Germans as regards to the Jewish part of the Danish community, Danish population. </sentence><sentence id="319">I went to school early in the morning, maybe at ten o'clock or so, the headmaster came in and he said, "I'm sorry but you and you," he said, "you better come out, I have something to tell you in the corridor." </sentence><sentence id="320">And I remember that suddenly we got up from our desks and were following him. </sentence><sentence id="321">Suddenly he turned around again and he said to the teacher, "you better come with me too." </sentence><sentence id="322">The teacher was also a part Jewish and then the fade away(ph). </sentence><sentence id="323">But you know, at that time, I was fifteen, I was fifteen years old I must have been, you know, retarded because I didn't understand anything at all, because we didn't speak about these things at home. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Well, as a matter of fact I am the first generation born in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="347">My father's side the family came just after the turn of the century from Ukraine, a town called Romney. </sentence><sentence id="348">Which is quite a famous town in Jewish history because a guy named Toebetor, who became a hero in the Palestine fighting(ph) with the Arab's(ph) back in the 20's came from there. </sentence><sentence id="349">Another guy called Rotenbeck(ph) who made the first project for electrification(ph) of Palestine there. </sentence><sentence id="350">My, , the first group of chim(ph) agricultural pioneers came from the same small town called Romney and they settled at the canya(ph) and they formed the first . </sentence><sentence id="351">Now my grandfather was what they call a kabaducmaha(ph). </sentence><sentence id="352">That means a...do you know what that is? </sentence><sentence id="353">Well, he made hats, caps. </sentence><sentence id="354">And he told me when I was a young man and I asked him why did you leave Romney, why did you run away from Russia, the Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="355">He said that there was a in Romney around 1903 or 4, there was a whole empetamy(ph) of good programs at that time the collection(ph) with the defeat of Russians to the Russian-Japanese war. </sentence><sentence id="356">And this Romney was a little influential town where half of the population was Jewish, many of them were artisans, as my grandfather and he and a number of friends lived in a square, farm-like building on the outskirts of the town. </sentence><sentence id="357">And he told me that just before the pulcrum(ph) erupted a Russian officer came to him and he was from the Cossack brigade and told him that you come with him and take his family. </sentence><sentence id="358">And you know at that time you didn't ask why when an officer told you, so he took the family and they walked to the house of the officer and he said you stay here. </sentence><sentence id="359">And just right after the pulcrum(ph) erupted many Jews were killed some of the work staff(ph) in this farm-like building where my grandfather had his works were burned and after the pulcrum the officer took my grandfather back to the place and on the way he asked him, "why did you save me and my family?" </sentence><sentence id="360">and the officer said, "well Jew, that's because you make such wonderful hats for my soldiers." </sentence><sentence id="361">And my grandfather who hadn't finished any main(ph) university or any higher education he just knew that to survive that if the future of his family was dependent on his hats fit square with the soldiers heads then he better get out as quick as possible. </sentence><sentence id="362">So the pack(ph) that was left and of course they were on their way to America, like most Jews, millions of Jews during these years went to America. </sentence><sentence id="363">Being poor people the money quickly was spent when the in Germany they had no more money to pay for their passage across the Atlantic. </sentence><sentence id="364">So they made up their mind to go to some place called Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="365">Why Denmark, because my grandmother had a brother who had immigrated earlier to Denmark and he had sent some postcards saying that it was not a bad country. </sentence><sentence id="366">So the thoughts in their heads were let's go where the money reached, the money took them to Gomain(ph), that was, as I said around 1905 or 6 or something. </sentence><sentence id="367">And they settled down in one of the poorest quarters of Copenhagen, which today of course is Bohem(ph) quarter and were renovated(ph) slum houses. </sentence><sentence id="368">It was, but they went there because it was Jewish district and they could meet people which spoke their language, which was not Russian it was Yettish, they were not Russian speakers. </sentence><sentence id="369">And they could somehow repeat and rebuild to some extent the medium(ph) in which they had lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: A religious ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: Well, that's what I want to add. </sentence><sentence id="399">Another reason why they went their was that it was not far away, within walking distance from the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="400">For them the synagogue was the center in their lives, both the religious life and the sacred(ph) life they lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: Which synagogue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: Well it was, it was the synagogue which belonged to the Uta(ph) orthodox and the community which was built around that time. , </sentence><sentence id="407">it was not at that time as far as my grandfather goes, the big synagogue which had the kind of modernistic service, although it's conservative. </sentence><sentence id="408">He looked for his people and they were at this small synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="409">Of course, the , my father's generation they left the synagogue and joined the large, more modern synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="410">But this was kind of an intimate relationship with religion. </sentence><sentence id="411">By the way this relationship with religion didn't last for long because my grandfather of course was very religious, he was also a small bearded fellow, my father didn't of course, he shaved and he was observant but not orthodox and the third generation intermarried and in a few cases were not Jews or became non-observant. </sentence><sentence id="412">But still of course were some hang(ph) for tradition, you know, they speak about two kinds of Jews: they speak about Balkhudan(ph); means Jews whose sits in the stomach, gives Jews and the other group is called; alkhudan, which means that they are also Jews. </sentence><sentence id="413">But at any rate, so they settled there, and of course at that time they were three children, one of them that immigrated was my father. </sentence><sentence id="414">He was at that time he was maybe 5, 6, 7 years old. </sentence><sentence id="415">They were immediately sent to school. </sentence><sentence id="416">And here starts the immediate integration into Danish society because of this school was a Jewish school was formed by a Jew of Danish origin who saw that these immigrants who came from Poland, from Russia at the turn of the century. </sentence><sentence id="417">They had to become Danes quickly, he didn't mind if they would stay Jewish as far as religious observances, but he wanted them integrate us as quickly as possible into the Danish social life. </sentence><sentence id="418">Simply in order to protect the community that was there from rotten shoulders cold(ph) religionist who sort of say would be looked at with hostility from the Danish environment because they were unobservant. </sentence><sentence id="419">So this was a great lack of the Danish-Jewish community that they would provide services that would immediately channel them into the Danish society. </sentence><sentence id="420">Learning language, getting ready for Danish career. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="437">Q: Did your grandfather continue as a hat maker? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: He continued, sure he continued as a hat maker and my father when he was at the age of 9, 10 years old when he came back from school, everyday he would have to take a case with hats, 6 penses, you know, and go in the harbor of Copenhagen. </sentence><sentence id="440">At that time Copenhagen was very, very dynamic harbor town, which it is not today, and to sell six penses to the sailors and to the harbor, port workers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="441">From that time my father had a deep feeling of gratitude to the Danish working class. </sentence><sentence id="442">Which put a little attitude so that he, although it became what you would call industrially started capitalism, he went on continued voting for social democrats because as he always told me, these people, you can match a little Yettish speaking boy looking strange with this Danish were Danish of course, but two or three years in the country, walking around the harbor with a box of 6 penses trying to peddle them to the Danish workers. </sentence><sentence id="443">He could feel rejected by them and the country, so he had a very, since then, he so to say P [person's name] admired the Jews to politics and he became very, very generous as a donor for all kinds of Jewish and non-Jewish causes because he felt that he owed these people something. </sentence><sentence id="444">By the way, jumping out a bit, but when they later built a very large and modern textile factory in Copenhagen he was one of the first Danish industrialists to attend to the needs of the workers. </sentence><sentence id="445">Providing for instance, kindergarten for the workers who couldn't leave home or find a place in the public service and a building one of the best, beautiful canteens facing a garden so that they could relax. </sentence><sentence id="446">He was, he didn't know that he was progressive, but he acted in a very progressive way out of purely sentimental reasons. </sentence><sentence id="447">At any rate, so they settled here, and of course I'm not telling you anything that you don't know, because it's sort of kind of a replica of what happened to many Jews who came to the east coast of America as immigrants from the same areas. </sentence><sentence id="448">That they put learning very high because they knew, for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="449">Learning was part of the Jewish tradition, of course. </sentence><sentence id="450">The religious tradition, where all, all children quickly at the age of 3 or 4 years went to Torah(ph) school and learned to read. </sentence><sentence id="451">Read Hebrew letters, so of course this was pretty converted also so the desire to learn other things, other written languages but Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="452">That was one thing, the respect for the book and the respect for the language. </sentence><sentence id="453">And secondly of course we learned that if you want to kind of upward mobility in society, you had to study. </sentence><sentence id="454">So my father couldn't afford it because he was the eldest so he had to go out and help the parents make a living, so the others could afford to study. </sentence><sentence id="455">But the second boy in the family became an engineer and living great desires. </sentence><sentence id="456">And he became one of the very first immigrant boys who graduated from the university. </sentence><sentence id="457">So very quickly they started moving into society. </sentence><sentence id="458">Then of course came the first World War, 1914. </sentence><sentence id="459">Denmark was, as you know, a neutral country and there was kind of an economic boom, prosperity in Denmark because it was neutral. </sentence><sentence id="460">Of course it exploited the possibilities it had by supplying the warring(ph) states with what they needed. </sentence><sentence id="461">There was Danish military mobilization to protect the neutrality of Denmark and of course these soldiers they needed hats and they needed uniforms and so on. </sentence><sentence id="462">And the Jewish didn't know anything about a 7 or 8 day work week, you know, a 7 or 8 hour work week. </sentence><sentence id="463">They worked as much, as long as they needed to provide, to supply those that gave them to consignments. </sentence><sentence id="464">They started establishing themselves and moving from this very poor street to this street in the same neighborhood which was a little bit less poorer, and I have a list at home which one of my uncles made where he noted all of the addresses within the first couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="465">It was tremendous, this was kind of migrant population. </sentence><sentence id="466">they had more money, they got another child, they moved into a flat with a half room more, bedroom more, that's how they slowly, slowly progressed and moved into more boudoir quarters and became, as a matter of fact part of the Danish middle class. </sentence><sentence id="467">Within probably the early 30's they had become middle class. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="499">Q: Living separately in a Jewish community within the Danish middle class? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="501">A: No, no, when the moment they moved out of the poor quarter, of course they moved into the middle, they used the Danish community. </sentence><sentence id="502">I wouldn't say that they had lots of social contact with them of course, because still their religion and the synagogue was, so to say, the axis of their life. </sentence><sentence id="503">But of course, there were 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, there were 8 children and of course the children reached out towards Danish society. </sentence><sentence id="504">You probably had the same effect that you have today, many Danish girls attempted to strike up relationships with types from the Mediterranean and these were not Mediterranean's, but they were exotic at least. </sentence><sentence id="505">And Denmark at that time was a very, very homogenous society and when these young Jews came to Copenhagen, they were attractive and exotic. </sentence><sentence id="506">By the way many of them married non-Jewish, already(ph) in the first generation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: And how did your grandfather react to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: You know, you know what happens, I don't know if this is pattern, but anyhow in my experience is that there are several phases. </sentence><sentence id="516">One of the phases, one is a phase of shock. </sentence><sentence id="517">The second is the phase of slowly adapting but not reestablishing contacts. </sentence><sentence id="518">The third phase is when the first child is born and then the whole bloody thing breaks down, you know you can't, then relations are reestablished and everybody's is happy. </sentence><sentence id="519">But at any rate, I just want to go back for one moment to this Romney, I tried to visit it during the communist times before Gorbachev and before the break down of the soviet system. </sentence><sentence id="520">I went with a friend, a Russian    speaking friend, and we went to Kiev(ph) and we asked if anybody would take us to this place which is about 150 kilometers from Romney and everybody shied away and said, no you need a special permit, this is a closed country. </sentence><sentence id="521">So we found a very unhappy driver, unhappy because he was deeply indebt for playing some kind of, I don't know, hasard(ph) or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="522">One of his other friends, and couldn't pay his debt to the people who he owed money, they were people, very strong armed people. </sentence><sentence id="523">One of his friends had to explain to us, we should jump out of the window because was jumping himself or being thrown out of the window, so he wanted to make money. </sentence><sentence id="524">You know, at any costs, so he decided that it was worth to run the risk and take us without permission to Romney and during the trip he turned to us and said, this friend of yours who speaks perfect Russian, they're Danish Jew, by the way, but born in Russia, he was a corespondent of the Danish state journalist in Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="525">He said that this guy is from the KGB, so we said why should he be from the KGB? </sentence><sentence id="526">Well, he speaks such perfect Russian, he's just posing as a Danish journalist. </sentence><sentence id="527">But after just a few miles, the guy turns around and he said to us, "gee" he said, "I'm sorry, I made a mistake he's not from the KGB." </sentence><sentence id="528">And we said, "how do you know by now" and he said, "look out through the back window" and we looked out and there was a car following us, he said, "these are the KGB's." </sentence><sentence id="529">And they really followed us all the way from Kiev(ph) about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of the town Baneso(ph) the sign board spelling Romney, then they jumped at us, they stopped our progress and we had to go out, we had to sign documents and there was investigation and what not. </sentence><sentence id="530">Later we complained to the Russian foreign minister, of course, didn't help. </sentence><sentence id="531">I asked one of the Russians to take me, how long to keep this place closed. </sentence><sentence id="532">He said, "well as long as you want to visit it, it remains closed." </sentence><sentence id="533">There must have been some military reasons, reasons for it. </sentence><sentence id="534">Anyhow, now of course, the town, I wanted to see. </sentence><sentence id="535">Maybe because of family, maybe because of cemetery, maybe because of the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="536">I just wanted, for several reasons, to see the place where my father had been born. </sentence><sentence id="537">But now, of course, everybody can go there, but now I'm not very attracted by it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was the prohibition that was attractive apparently. </sentence><sentence id="539">But anyhow, from this town, originally the first group that formed the first collective settlement keboots(ph) in Palestine at that time, later Israel. </sentence><sentence id="540">That was around 1908, or something of that close, maybe 1909. </sentence><sentence id="541">But I asked my grandfather, why didn't you join them, you were the same age group and you had to leave your town anyhow? </sentence><sentence id="542">Why did you have to take this long route around Copenhagen and what not, just for me 50 odd years afterwards to have to rise and go to Zion(ph), you know, all the troubles. </sentence><sentence id="543">We could have landed there earlier, be part of the aristocracy. </sentence><sentence id="544">So he said, "are you crazy," I would never have guessed this, he said, "do you think that I would have joined a gang where the Tracy Malicker(ph)," it's a Yettish, it's a Yettish derivation of Melcher(ph) which is a female name in Hebrew, "the Tracy Malicker, should I join these barefoot people, you know, they walk around barefoot." </sentence><sentence id="545">It's true, that the first you know, that they called them the "ball fees(ph)," the barefeet, because they were poor and they made an issue about being puretanic(ph) and so. </sentence><sentence id="546">Well anyhow I decided that, well, they were crazy we all could see that they were crazy, we all could see that they were crazy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="547">I decided that I wanted to find out what this crazy Malicker(ph) had been doing and I called the keeboots(ph) and they found out that this crazy Malicker(ph) who my grandfather didn't want to join, she became one of the most prominent educators in the Palestine Zionist(ph) Keeboots(ph) movement. </sentence><sentence id="548">But anyhow, to jump ahead, we, my grandfather, became retired and my father started working at the Petlier(ph), the famous 7 , you know. </sentence><sentence id="549">They only went to school for 7 years at that time and he became a statesman(ph)[possibly "salesman" and he passed the career which, you know, the marriage of Jewish immigrants, he started as an employee, as a statesman, he became independent(ph) statesman and by the year, he was traveling very much in Scandinavia, some place else that the I have been living commuting between Denmark and Israel for thirty years is part of the inheritance from my father. </sentence><sentence id="550">Every Sunday I met my dad, we wished him well, and he went to the railway station and either went to Days(ph) Provinces, or he went to Sweden, or Finland to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="551">He came back Friday went to the Synagogue in the evening, had to, back at home and on Sunday off they went again. </sentence><sentence id="552">In the mean time, he got married. </sentence><sentence id="553">My mother's family came originally from Poland, when she was a couple    of years old they settled in Litic(ph). </sentence><sentence id="554">I'm sure I inherited some of the adventurous spirit of that part of the family because my grandfather, my great-grandfather... </sentence></p></dialogue>

which is kind of cloth which you wear under your, on your skin with four tetsiut(ph) applied, you know. </sentence><sentence id="749">This was a religious garment and I wore this as a child. </sentence><sentence id="750">You can imagine that when we had physical training lessons in school and they discovered that this guy wore some very strange things under his underwear. </sentence><sentence id="751">But it gave me a feeling of identity and I survived whatever it might have been on funny remarks. </sentence><sentence id="752">And this ties up with a story that I want to tell you which happened to me during the same period when I went to this elementary, non-Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="753">Well one thing I remember very, very strongly that was one anti-Semitic incident in school. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="754">End of Tape 2. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="755">Tape 3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="756">A: Anyhow, I remember when we took a taxi out to hide with a friend of my father's, a business friend, of course, non-Jewish couple. </sentence><sentence id="757">And I was later told by my mother, years after that the driver of the taxi refused to take money for the trip. </sentence><sentence id="758">At that time this was the first sign of some kind of, say, popular resistance coming to the aid of the Danes. </sentence><sentence id="759">You know, people were warned by neighbors, by Jewish families to just leave their homes. </sentence><sentence id="760">But there were moving details, you know, some Jews who took hiding into the woods because they had no where to go. </sentence><sentence id="761">There was a botanical garden in the center of Copenhagen just across from one of the large municipal hospital and the doctors and nurses during the day went out and searched for Jews hiding in the botanical garden. </sentence><sentence id="762">People who didn't have business friends who they could turn to. </sentence><sentence id="763">I remember, one of my, a friend of mine later at the university who became a member of parliament for the social democratic party, his father was head of the social democratic party organization in the center of Copenhagen and he simply recruited his son and a few other youngsters and he told them to go through each and every house, look at the name cards and when they see something that could be Jewish, warn them and tell them to get away. </sentence><sentence id="764">At that time, already, lots of individual initiatives were taken. </sentence><sentence id="765">There was no coordinating rule for organization. </sentence><sentence id="766">But the moment the people, non- Jews realized that the Jews were in danger, than all kinds of initiatives were taken by individuals, by groups of people, by priests, by hospitals and so on. </sentence><sentence id="767">So, this particular case, whenever they met a Jewish family, there were many Jewish families in this area here, especially poorer Jewish families because it was at that time before the war restrictive, not so, no quality housing, I would say to put it mildly. </sentence><sentence id="768">So they had been told, if you find a Jewish couple, tell them immediately to take a taxi and go to Bespepyau(ph), Bespepyau Hospital, where they would be offered hospitality and put into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="769">One place he found another friend student of his a student, a fellow of his and they said, well it can't be, you know, that's how the Jewish reaction was to the unintelligible. </sentence><sentence id="770">Of course, it must be against nature. </sentence><sentence id="771">And again he told me years later that it broke him to weeping, simply because...so then the father, the father said, you're my friends, you're my sons friends and if you say, we believe it and then to the car(ph) and went out to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="772">In one case he told me that he found an old, old lady and took her to the hospital and suddenly she got a fit of hysterics... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="808">Q: ...sensitivity </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="809">A: sensitivity or empathy with the people who...anyway that's the story. </sentence><sentence id="810">The story is that night we stayed with our friends, we couldn't stay more than one night at one place because, you know. </sentence><sentence id="811">Now we know in retrospect that the Germans acted totally different than they acted in other occupied countries. </sentence><sentence id="812">But we had to prepare for the worst, so we had to make all kinds of decisions because we believed that this was a serious matter for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="813">Now we know that they were all common interest in the German camp which enabled us to escape to Sweden, but it's quite obvious that half the Germans acted with the same will power. </sentence><sentence id="814">The same, the same organizational talent which they used in prosecuting, persecuting Jews in other countries. </sentence><sentence id="815">Of course they would have caught us, but we didn't know so we had to act as if...by the way this is also true for the Danes. </sentence><sentence id="816">After the war there was the inclination to say, well anyhow the Danes are not such great heroes, but the of the Danes were caught, those few that were caught got two or three weeks of prison by the Danish authorities. </sentence><sentence id="817">You know, we still had Danish courts, we didn't have German courts. </sentence><sentence id="818">Looking at most of the Jews, only 500 were arrested, the rest were . </sentence><sentence id="819">It's true that the conditions were in our favor and in the favor of the Danes who helped us to rescue. </sentence><sentence id="820">But one has to go back and look at the situation as it were in as far as we could know and all the Danes who came to our help. </sentence><sentence id="821">They had no reason to believe that they did not risk their lives. </sentence><sentence id="822">And in other countries like Poland, France, Germany and anybody hiding a Jew was stood up against the wall and shot. </sentence><sentence id="823">So I really think that this was a very heroic chapter in Danish history. </sentence><sentence id="824">But we thousands of things, well, could believe that they were ready to risk their lives and save the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="825">The fact that they didn't(ph) do it comes, that we learn after the war. </sentence><sentence id="826">But this doesn't change the fact that they were justified believing that they acted as heroes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="827">Q: But the Germans did capture some, didn't they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="829">A: They captured about 5 hundred and about 6,500 came over. </sentence><sentence id="830">Now in our case, we shifted from the first hiding place to another. </sentence><sentence id="831">We went down the coast. </sentence><sentence id="832">This was like animals do looking for escape routes. </sentence><sentence id="833">You go by the smell, you know, and you go by instinct you went down to the coast because the only place that you could hide, along the coast and hope to be able to get to the only place that might receive you and protect you was Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="834">And the sound(ph) between Denmark and Sweden is not very wide, but it recovered by the distance from the Danish coast to Sweden territory water could be covered by a quick boat in less than half an hour. </sentence><sentence id="835">But it was beyond our imagination. </sentence><sentence id="836">There lies Denmark which is hidden in the darkness and just across this narrow sound was neutral Sweden with lights and with chocolate and bananas and what not. </sentence><sentence id="837">But began to realize that there were people who were able to live another kind of life that we were. </sentence><sentence id="838">But we went down to the coast hoping that we could escape this way of course and hapbeny(ph), the Swedish government who had, by the way, not been welcoming to Romney refugees in 42's and early 43 issued a declaration during these H days welcoming all Jews saying that they could come to Swedish protection. </sentence><sentence id="839">The fact is that the Swedish not only made statements to that effect, but they also acted accordingly because Swedish patrol boats from the navy went out took the Swedish to the borderline and the moment that Danish boats crossed this borderline the Swedish boats immediately came to protect them. </sentence><sentence id="840">So that in case that Germans, I mean, you had to account for all . </sentence><sentence id="841">Incase a German patrol boat would try to encroach on Swedish waters to catch a fleeing refugee boat the Swedes would simply intervene. </sentence><sentence id="842">But anyhow we went to the coast... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="858">Q: Wait, where on the coast? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="860">A: It was a place called Sletten, S-L-E-double T-E-N, which is not far away. </sentence><sentence id="861">I mean very close, it's fishing, to the museum of Catipriod(ph) called Louisiana. </sentence><sentence id="862">Then we went to the fisherman with whom we had stayed for years during our summer vacation, plus it was a rule that they sublet the houses to people from town, then they move into a house in the back yard, during these two months of summer vacation. </sentence><sentence id="863">And of course he knew us well and he offered us hospitality that we could have wanted because he didn't use a telephone. </sentence><sentence id="864">We believed that this was real, this was for real, you didn't use a telephone, you didn't speak to any strangers, you're afraid of moving on the roads because you were afraid of ending up in the arms of German patrol, there were Germans all over the place, soldiers mainly. </sentence><sentence id="865">Only later we know that the army decided not to interfere, not to take part in the acts against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="866">So the German army for its own reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews, wanted to protect the Jews, but simply for its own interests the German army only had one case that's known to have participated in this anti- Jewish action. </sentence><sentence id="867">This was left to the police and the, what do you call it, the visheyesteins(ph), the what the German counter intelligence, whatever it is the, Estit(ph), it's called Estit(ph). </sentence><sentence id="868">So the very fact that the army was all around didn't interfere. </sentence><sentence id="869">This we couldn't have known either. </sentence><sentence id="870">So we took hiding at this place and one night he had negotiated with another fisherman to take us across to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="871">We were told that late at night to move across the coastal road and go down to the beach and wait under a small bridge to be picked up. </sentence><sentence id="872">We were standing there freezing, my parents, my father, my mother and my three sisters and brother and we heard the doc(ph), doc(ph), doc, doc [sound of approaching boat], of the fishing boat approaching the docks of course the lights are on us. </sentence><sentence id="873">I mean today we're sitting in a warm room, this thing 50 years behind us, it's difficult to imagine a family all on its own alone, without any protection standing on a small wooden bridge looking into the water waiting for the doc, doc, doc, doc to come to pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="874">But anyhow, the boat appears from the darkness and we are all already to jump at the boat and it simply passed by and it went to a bridge where another Jewish family was waiting and picked them up and off it went to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="875">Of course we never learned what the reason was, maybe these people could have paid them more money, maybe it was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="876">I don't know, but we were standing out there in the darkness without any alternative. </sentence><sentence id="877">So we returned to the fisherman and we really did not, my father was responsible for the family. </sentence><sentence id="878">These were times when the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know what to do, we all relied on the fisherman getting some kind of connection which we could use in order to get out. </sentence><sentence id="879">Another night we spent at a large white house with lots of other refugees sitting in the dark sitting room, living room and the specification, the student organization, while rowing us over, rowing, can you imagine, maybe room for 2 or 3 people in these heavy wooden boats which they were taking from the fisherman, loaned from the fishermen rather. </sentence><sentence id="880">And I remember that when our turn came, the guy who was supposed to row us over, this would take hours, I mean you could go by quick boat for 30 minutes, but to be rowed over by one man that was very heavy(ph) going, two hours, and going for more than one trip was very difficult, but these were in the days that when the crisis was really on these were the nice ones that knew that the Jewish were looking for us... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="904">Q: ...the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="906">A: The Germans, sorry, the Germans were looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="907">People got scared, the Germans were looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="908">And suddenly the door opened, I remember this vividly because you are on the edge, you're on the way of getting out of this horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="909">Then the guy, the student, who was supposed to take us came in and we saw that blood was running down his palms and he said to my parents so we had to go back to . </sentence><sentence id="910">Then the next day, suddenly the door bell rings, we of course are like mice scurrying around hiding. </sentence><sentence id="911">I remember one of my brother hide a my father had hidden under the bed. </sentence><sentence id="912">A very undignified situation today, it's very hard to remember. </sentence><sentence id="913">You know, that parents at that time were, had different stature(ph) then they do today. </sentence><sentence id="914">For instance, in our dining room there was a father's chair and nobody would ever dream of sitting in father's chair even if he was away. </sentence><sentence id="915">Another thing that I remember so vividly is some very painful memory is that when we finally got on our way and found a reliable escape route it was the day after. </sentence><sentence id="916">We run through a forest at night, single file of course, the father in front. </sentence><sentence id="917">Suddenly my father slipped on a route or a branch and fell. </sentence><sentence id="918">This was the fall of, this was the fall, suddenly seeing your father in this, he was always in control, the provider, the protector, suddenly seeing him in a situation with this falling you know at the time when the whole family was relying on him, you know, this is something which still today can give me the creeps. </sentence><sentence id="919">But at any rate, the door bell rang and the fisherman went out to answer the door, because in those days if you didn't open the door, they would break in. </sentence><sentence id="920">At any rate, if you didn't open the door, as I said, they would break them in. </sentence><sentence id="921">So he went out and opening the door and a voice asked, as we heard from inside, "is the family Pundik here?" </sentence><sentence id="922">Of course the fisherman says, "no, no, no, I don't know anything about Pundik, I haven't seen them since summer." </sentence><sentence id="923">My father recognized the voice and he took a chance and said, "yes we are." </sentence><sentence id="924">He took a chance because we were without and turned to chances. </sentence><sentence id="925">The guy comes in, another business friend of my fathers, who by the way his son was collaborated with the German Nazis, a very strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="926">And this guy, by the way, he way limping, walking with a stick. </sentence><sentence id="927">He had walked from Elsenor(ph) along the coast knocking all doors available asking the same question, "have you seen the Pundik family?" </sentence><sentence id="928">He couldn't know if we had escaped already, but he simply, you know, that is the way that people had to act it was a moral imperative for them to act, so he did this impossible thing and found a needle in the haystack. </sentence><sentence id="929">He went along the coast asking, he knocked on the door where we were and happily my father recognized the voice and said that I'll come get you tonight when it is dark in a doctor's car, in a physician's car was permitted by the Germans to move around freely came and picked us up and took us to his home. </sentence><sentence id="930">A place called Ultzgolden(ph) which is about 15 kilometer north of Elsenor(ph). </sentence><sentence id="931">He lived in a house facing the coastal road which was facing the sea. </sentence><sentence id="932">And at night, the next day he negotiated a deal with the fisherman, at the night we were told to rush across the coastal road and go down to the sea. </sentence><sentence id="933">And there was a small rowboat waiting there for us, we jumped into the boat, there was a larger motor fishing boat waiting just a few hundred meters from the coast and we were rowed out to the fishing boat and I remember two things. </sentence><sentence id="934">I remember that I turned around and had a last look at Denmark and on the beach were kneeling with their hands raised in a kind of praying position were the fisherman's wife and the follow who had saved us, my father's business friend and his wife, they were believing(ph) people, praying. </sentence><sentence id="935">Another thing that I remember was maybe only that time I showed a knack for journalism, I looked at my watch the moment the motor started operating and we were heading for Swedish territory waters and I remember that it took us exactly 37 minutes to go from Denmark into safety to Swedish territory water. </sentence><sentence id="936">But some people, I want to conclude with a little anecdote, some people were not so lucky of course. </sentence><sentence id="937">One of my predecessors, is a chief of Puting(ph), was June(ph) Koppel, now I'll spell Koppel, K-0-double P- E-L and he was caught by the Germans while crossing the same coastal road. </sentence><sentence id="938">His wife who was not Jewish got across and was down in the boat waiting for them, his two sons also, and he was caught by a Gestapo car headlights. </sentence><sentence id="939">Caught the moment that he tried to escape and they took him into the car and wrestled him and he was a fellow who was a off the Copenhagen . </sentence><sentence id="940">Even in difficult times, that while they were driving him off to Exenal(ph) to the prison, to the arrest house in Exenal(ph) one German Gestapo man turned around and says, vense huden(ph), "are you Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="941">and Mr. Koppel said, "yes, and you?" </sentence><sentence id="942">That's it.
