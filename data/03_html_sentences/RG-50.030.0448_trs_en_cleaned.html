<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: When he came back and told you about that incident, was he very worried about going out again? </sentence><sentence id="370">Were you very worried about him? </sentence></p></dialogue>

reality. </sentence><sentence id="375">He picked up messages, he knew that the war is coming closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="376">And when he returned from the outside, he knew that something has to be done and started to organize the men in the compound to build bunkers, hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="377">So, immediate action was taken to build bunkers within the big house or compound. </sentence><sentence id="378">They organized and searched the house and the ground and finally they found what they thought was a great tunnel under the house and constructed a rock that blocked off a certain area. </sentence><sentence id="379">And that was deep tunnel leading to nowhere, that's what they thought and for days they were digging and constructing that bunker. </sentence><sentence id="380">At the same place they built some alternate places, hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="381">One day, very soon, the guard, quote unquote, the guard, was sitting in front of the windows spotted some activity going on on the street with German soldiers popping out on the corners. </sentence><sentence id="382">The signal was given for us to run to the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="383">It was amazing that prior to that we used to practice every day, how fast we, it has to take for us to run down the stairs and climb up those rocks and one elder was standing and timing us. </sentence><sentence id="384">Well, time came to hide and we started hearing shots. </sentence><sentence id="385">People became panicky and one was climbing up on the other too fast, enter that bunker and moved the rocks. </sentence><sentence id="386">I remember there were sick people on the second floor and nobody could carry them down, cause everybody was running towards the bunker and they were left in their beds. </sentence><sentence id="387">The place was very small and the people were crowded together, there was nowhere to move, you couldn't breathe. </sentence><sentence id="388">But unfortunately it didn't last long, pretty soon we heard, started hearing shots and German voices shouting rousse(ph), rousse(ph), which meant get out, get out. </sentence><sentence id="389">We couldn't believe that they discovered us so soon, we were so convinced that this was such a safe bunker. </sentence><sentence id="390">What it turned out to be is that the tunnel was leading across the street underground, below some of the stores on the Aryan side and there was the barber shop and when we were digging that tunnel, they used to hear the voices of the Jewish people building that bunker and as soon as this action started, the barber right away notified the Germans and the Polish militia, that there were Jews hiding right underneath and they came straight, without having to search long. </sentence><sentence id="391">They found the rock, they opened the rock and urged us to come out, but nobody would move, so they started shooting into the bunker and throwing some gas rockets, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="392">People started to move back, towards the wall, there was screaming of children, people bleeding from these wounds inflicted upon them by the shots. </sentence><sentence id="393">There were a few sick people laying right near the entrance, they were shot on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="394">And I remember pulling my mom and my dad and said, "Let's go." </sentence><sentence id="395">And even at that moment, I was thinking of my brother and I said, "Let's go, we'll join now Joshua." </sentence><sentence id="396">On the way out they were beating everybody with clubs. </sentence><sentence id="397">People became disoriented. </sentence><sentence id="398">There was blood running through their faces. </sentence><sentence id="399">They were lined, these soldiers were lined out along the corridor, lining up the people and beating them at the same time, so they will be, came so helpless and disoriented and did not offer any resistance. </sentence><sentence id="400">Any resistance would have been met with a bullet anyhow, so there was no point. </sentence><sentence id="401">I remember spotting my uncle, standing there and his blood was dripping from his head and we could not do anything and we were ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="402">I stood with my parents and I spotted a door and I tried the door and it cracked opened and I pulled my mother and she says, "Why are you pulling me?" </sentence><sentence id="403">I said, I pointed with my finger, with my thumb, "Go over there, go over." </sentence><sentence id="404">And then I pulled my father and then I, I pulled them in and we went up the stairs, we went up the stairs and there were bodies laying up there on the bed, with the blood dripping down and went into a room and each of us hid under the bed in a puddle of blood. </sentence><sentence id="405">And then we heard the lamenting voices from downstairs and pretty soon it became more quiet. </sentence><sentence id="406">Suddenly we heard footsteps running up the stairs and a voice saying in Polish, "I saw you running up there, I know you are hiding. </sentence><sentence id="407">Stay under the bed until it becomes quiet and then go down and hide again." </sentence><sentence id="408">And he disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="409">As it became quiet we emerged from under the beds and we went into a different hiding that my father constructed. </sentence><sentence id="410">It was located on top of a toilet which pretended to be like a ceiling. </sentence><sentence id="411">Pretty soon the Germans and the Polish militia returned with some other citizens, to remove the dead bodies and to do a last minute search. </sentence><sentence id="412">They entered the toilet room where we were hiding and instead of looking up, they looked down and there was a child that fell through the toilet seat, it was a constructed toilet, not like we have here and this child was deep in feces and the soldiers were standing there and laughing and one said, "Don't waste a bullet, she'll drown in the feces anyhow, " and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="413">We remained breathless up on top, until all the bodies were removed and the doors were closed. </sentence><sentence id="414">Later we emerged from our hiding and there were a few other people that survived in that same room. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: What did you do immediately after this actione(ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: Well, as we were lucky enough to escape the second time in that toilet, hiding, we stayed in that house for a day or two until everything quieted down and pretty soon [pause], we remained in the house, all the four of us, wondering what's going to happen next. </sentence><sentence id="501">We did not remain for long alone. </sentence><sentence id="502">Few days after this total destruction, new transports were coming in from nearby cities and villages. </sentence><sentence id="503">These were new resettlers. </sentence><sentence id="504">The house was filled again with Jews from all over the area. </sentence><sentence id="505">Some urban, some rural, people that had only in common by being persecuted by the Nazis because of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="506">They came from all walks of life. </sentence><sentence id="507">We befriended one family that was a farming, a Jew from a farm that had a little girl my age and we became friends. </sentence><sentence id="508">My father, being again mobile and circling around the non-Jewish quarters, was aware that the war is coming to an end and this is a time, a final action that they final solution of the Jewish question is in sight. </sentence><sentence id="509">And his only way of escape would be to do it now, otherwise we are doomed to die. </sentence><sentence id="510">We were lucky enough that we were able to save gold and silver coins that we carried in our clothing, hidden in seams. </sentence><sentence id="511">And my father approached this, befriended a family, his name was Abraham and told them that he would offer him money in order for both of the families to escape. </sentence><sentence id="512">His idea was, because Abraham knew all these farmers and had such great faith in his village, that he would send Abraham to find a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="513">The plan was to divide our families so that in case somebody's killed, one member at least, will remain. </sentence><sentence id="514">Abraham went back to the farm and was to come up with three hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="515">He left, but we never knew whether he would return or not. </sentence><sentence id="516">After some time he did return and announce that he found a place and the children would go first. </sentence><sentence id="517">Thus it was decided that I and his little girl would follow him. </sentence><sentence id="518">The eve of one day, we were to follow Abraham through fields and paths, through forests, moving forward through the night and hiding in the fields during the day, in order not to be spotted by farming people in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="519">We crawled on our four, until Abraham decided that he was going to venture out and find a farming house and we stayed in the fields until he returns. </sentence><sentence id="520">The two little girls remained laying there, waiting for Abraham to return. </sentence><sentence id="521">It took days til he returned and announced that he found a place, we ought to follow him and just run into a barn, in towards the evening, without telling anybody or speaking to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="522">That night he let us into a barn, we climbed up on a high stack of hay and Abraham said goodbye to us and left us there. </sentence><sentence id="523">And if, if we only knew that we are in a barn, but we had no concept where we were, we had no image whether this was a city, a village, a town, a farmer's house. </sentence><sentence id="524">We had no concept what's on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="525">We could only tell day from night by the sound of the environment, like the crack of the dawn, the rooster, the rooster would crow, or towards the evening the farmers would return from the fields. </sentence><sentence id="526">The only other being was the horse in the barn and we knew day from night when the horse would return from work in the field. </sentence><sentence id="527">And the morning when the farmer would come and feed the horse and get him ready to go to the field. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="635">Q: What about being around the horse, what was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="637">A: The horse became our savior and our guardian angel. </sentence><sentence id="638">We were always, I was always wondering whether he understood, they knew what was going on, but in certain ways he protected us from being thrown out of the barn. </sentence><sentence id="639">He formed a shield that night when I fell off and I was sure that the farmer was going to throw me out that night, just throw me into the fields and the horse gathered some hay around me, laid down, embraced me half-circle and I laid down on top of him, feeling the warmth of his body and, and the warm breath and the soft, friendly eyes, as if he were saying, "I'm not going to let you die." </sentence><sentence id="640">And he refused to eat and drink until the farmer would place me back on the haystack and leave us some food, and only then he drank his portion. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="641">End of tape 1. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="642"> Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="643">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Anne Resnick, conducted by Amy Rubin, on November 25", 1996 in Washington, D.C.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="657">The farmer was not Jewish and oddly enough, in all these days when he was bringing us the food, the exchange was so swift and fast that we never saw the face of the, of, we never saw his face. </sentence><sentence id="658">We just used to see a hand stretching out, placing that food, that piece of bread and water and just retrieve right away. </sentence><sentence id="659">There was never an exchange of words between us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="664">Q: Did you feel that he was nice to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: Were you scared a lot of the time being there"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: I, I cannot describe it as being scared but it was, we were always on guard. </sentence><sentence id="679">We knew that it's only, it would take only one moment to be discovered either by a child or by a neighbor, by    somebody walking into the barn and suspecting something. </sentence><sentence id="680">And as a matter of fact, that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="681">Through some mysterious way, the farmer, not beknown to us or to himself became a suspect of hiding, quote unquote, hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="682">One day when he was out in the field working, we suddenly heard some suspicious sounds, loud sounds of militia approaching the barn. </sentence><sentence id="683">Within a moment or two, we realized that this is danger lurking right behind the barn and what do we do?With a glance at each other we knew that we have to escape and how do you escape? </sentence><sentence id="684">There's no ladder and we are way up high there and those voices are coming closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="685">We jumped off that big high haystack and by some miracle we got up from that cold stone floor and ran through half-open door and behind another haystack and the yard and then into the wide fields. </sentence><sentence id="686">Just in that moment as we went through that yard, the militia was approaching the gate and entered the barn. </sentence><sentence id="687">There was loud noises and singing and voices of joy assuming that they are gonna catch us. </sentence><sentence id="688">Well we were right behind. </sentence><sentence id="689">They ran into the farmer's house, ransacked his house and did not find us. </sentence><sentence id="690">We in turn laid in the field. </sentence><sentence id="691">It was broad daylight and the sun was piercing through the high comfields. </sentence><sentence id="692">We laid there until the evening approach, approached. </sentence><sentence id="693">We're afraid to go too far away from the village, yet by staying too close, we were in danger of being discovered. </sentence><sentence id="694">Now, and by going too far we'd have, we would have lost our way back to the same house. </sentence><sentence id="695">That night we moved back and ran back into that barn. </sentence><sentence id="696">There was no ladder so we couldn't climb up so we just laid there on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="697">The farmer suspected that we would return and came in at night into the barn and found us there. </sentence><sentence id="698">He mumbled something and then place the ladder and we climbed up. </sentence><sentence id="699">However, he was not too happy because next morning no food was delivered to us. </sentence><sentence id="700">That following night, Abram heard in his hiding place that, that farmer's house was ransacked and he was sure that we got caught and killed. </sentence><sentence id="701">And he came to find bodies in that barn. </sentence><sentence id="702">He came and sat there at night and didn't see any blood on the floor so he thought maybe they took us away and killed us in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="703">He sat in that barn quiet, assuming that the farmer will come in and he did but his only greeting was that to take us away, right away he will not subject his family to danger. </sentence><sentence id="704">And he wanted us out. </sentence><sentence id="705">Despite all the pleading, Abram had won his confidence by giving him a day or two to go out and find another hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="706">He agreed to wait "til Abram returns next day. </sentence><sentence id="707">Next day Abram never did    come back. </sentence><sentence id="708">We did not know what to expect. </sentence><sentence id="709">We thought maybe he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="710">However, after a few days, Abram came back and took us. </sentence><sentence id="711">He took us to, not find, not being to able to find a new hiding place, he divided us up and took us to where my parents were and took his little girl to where he was hiding at. </sentence><sentence id="712">I was very weak and quite ill and it did me well be staying with my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: What was it like to see them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: It was a shock because I myself did not see myself. </sentence><sentence id="754">There were no mirror, you couldn't tell how I looked. </sentence><sentence id="755">I was shocked by their appearance in rags, unwashed, not well nourished as you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="756">And they were shocked by my appearance. </sentence><sentence id="757">I was totally emaciated, unkept, in rags and I could tell from the expression on their face that I was not a very well sight to look at. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="763">Q: Had you known that they were also in hiding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="766">It was a planned situation that we knew that they were in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="767">We did not know where and we had no concept of the geographic location of the whole village. </sentence><sentence id="768">But we did know that they were alive and as the plan was, to divide us up, it was not a surprise that they were close by. </sentence><sentence id="769">The hiding place they were at was designated by their farmer as only for two people and when the farmer walked in and saw an additional person he said, "No way. </sentence><sentence id="770">I did not agree to three." </sentence><sentence id="771">We tried to bribe him and give him some more gold. </sentence><sentence id="772">He took it and then next day changed his mind. </sentence><sentence id="773">He said, "You gotta go." </sentence><sentence id="774">And so again, Abram was caught between having to take us out of this hiding place and not finding another. </sentence><sentence id="775">We were chased out, by now it was turning cold and winter snow was on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="776">I was very weak, practically unable to walk and Abram was just trying to help by finding another place which was no avail. </sentence><sentence id="777">I was begging him to leave me there on the cold white snow. </sentence><sentence id="778">I could not walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="779">The wind was fierce in an open field, the snow was blowing, and I, all I wanted is to be left alone. </sentence><sentence id="780">But Abram said, "As God is my witness, I'm not gonna let you die." </sentence><sentence id="781">And he carried me on his shoulders and he was alternating. </sentence><sentence id="782">My father did a little bit carrying and we wandered days in that bitter cold in the white snow until we spotted a dark object far away. </sentence><sentence id="783">Abram ventured out by leaving us on the snow and moving forward to examine what it was, came back few feet, telling us that it looked like it's a house and that we have no choice but try to go towards it. </sentence><sentence id="784">We chose to wait there in the snow while he himself ventured out. </sentence><sentence id="785">He    dared to walk into that house and came out alive, coming back to us and carrying us, carrying me back into that house. </sentence><sentence id="786">It turned out to be an isolated little hut in the prairie and the cold snow, a very very poor farmer allowing us, agreeing to take us in. </sentence><sentence id="787">We entered the barn which was totally empty. </sentence><sentence id="788">This time there was neither a horse nor a cow nor hay. </sentence><sentence id="789">We lay down on the cold floor just waiting. </sentence><sentence id="790">The farmer was very poor. </sentence><sentence id="791">It was one of these, God's people really, that had nothing worldly around him. </sentence><sentence id="792">He had children, they had no shoes, therefore stayed inside the house. </sentence><sentence id="793">Therefore the danger of them running into the barn was diminished. </sentence><sentence id="794">He explained to us that he had a cow that died because he could not feed her so he had no milk. </sentence><sentence id="795">His crop died in that cold weather and he had no bread and the gold that we gave him was no avail to him because he could not go into the market to buy anything because he was known to be the poorest soul in the area. </sentence><sentence id="796">So on a Sunday we would have some potatoes but he was so poor that he couldn't afford any salt. </sentence><sentence id="797">But he was good-hearted and really sympathized with our fate. </sentence><sentence id="798">For some time we stayed there until one day we heard shots. </sentence><sentence id="799">These were very distant and we did not pay much attention until the farmer came and said, "Do you know the war's approaching. </sentence><sentence id="800">The Russians are coming nearer and nearer and they are beating the Germans and you're going to be free soon." </sentence><sentence id="801">We did not believe that. </sentence><sentence id="802">We continued to remain in the same position, very pessimistic and doubting whether we would ever get out alive from these places. </sentence><sentence id="803">One night, we heard very close shots. </sentence><sentence id="804">Prior to those shots, we heard this lamenting of human beings was was, which was so painful, was like these lamenting cats that sometime cry at night. </sentence><sentence id="805">It was so close that we thought that it's approaching us and soon engulf us in it. </sentence><sentence id="806">I remember thinking is this how you die, by hearing these voices coming out of nowhere? </sentence><sentence id="807">Pretty soon, we heard some voices knocking, some sound knocking at the door of the farmer's house and later we learned that Abraham, his little girl and his wife, at the last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the village, were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at. </sentence><sentence id="808">Abram and his wife and daughter were dragged out into the open field, close to this farmer's

</sentence><sentence id="1461">Said, "Well how are you gonna start? </sentence><sentence id="1462">You don't have any money. </sentence><sentence id="1463">I'm gonna give you a job because I signed for that." </sentence><sentence id="1464">So he offered a job for my mother and for myself. </sentence><sentence id="1465">Now legally I was not supposed to be working yet. </sentence><sentence id="1466">He placed us in a sweatshop where it was packed with women sitting alongside a large long table folding those nets, hairnets and placing them in envelopes. </sentence><sentence id="1467">The work was so fast and depended on the success of the speed. </sentence><sentence id="1468">There was a foreman there, supervising the working women which have been working there for years and were very well suited for that job. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Except the two of us, strangers and never having be subjected to that kind of work. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And he used to stand there with a real whip and hit the table and we used to withdraw our hands because we were not fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="1471">After few days of that kind of environment, we walked out and feeling very disappointed, I kept on walking the streets of 5" Avenue, seeing a different world for myself. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I, at the same time, I had the great sense of art and I loved to sew and prepare clothes and I started to design children's clothing and until one person noticed that and gave me a lead where I presented it to a manufacturer. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And after a while, I was designing children's wear at one of the biggest companies in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1474">I was not happy with my life though. </sentence><sentence id="1475">I used to finish a job and say well, so what else did I do today?Another piece of cloth. </sentence><sentence id="1476">IL, my, I, but I was determined to help my parents get established. </sentence><sentence id="1477">I also won scholarship but that was a chance that I took and, subjecting myself to a certain test that I saw at an international student organization offering a scholarship in Texas, Southwestern University. </sentence><sentence id="1478">So I was awarded their, their, I was awarded that scholarship, went down to Texas, stayed there for a short while at the University but I guess I had a guilt feeling leaving my parents in New York and, not really knowing what, how they gonna survive and what they were gonna do. </sentence><sentence id="1479">So I dropped everything and came back to New York. </sentence><sentence id="1480">But then my father had, still had some resources, financial ones and had bought a grocery store and we all helped. </sentence><sentence id="1481">My mother became the major storekeeper as my father was mainly ordering milk and supplies and that's how we got our feet back and got back into business. </sentence><sentence id="1482">I then, it was time that I get out of this family business and my parents having lost all their property and home and textile plant in Europe thought that maybe they could get it back. </sentence><sentence id="1483">A movement was on for , meant that the German government should restore some of the property to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1484">I, there not being very happy in that environment of store and just doing designing, I decided to go back to Europe and to enroll in the university there and at the same time try to see if I could regain some of our, our property. </sentence><sentence id="1485">It was difficult for me to stay in New York and continue my education there although I could have stayed in Texas but I, again, did not feel very suited in that, for that area, being that was a total different culture between, in Texas and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1486">I went back to Munich and enrolled at the university and was determined to pursue medical degree and become a physician. </sentence><sentence id="1487">I did make some contacts with that office but they discouraged me saying that there properties will never be recovered. </sentence><sentence id="1488">By then my father had had some account in a Swiss bank and he suggested that I transfer myself to Bairn (ph), Switzerland and enroll at the university, continue my medical studies there and while trying to recover the monies from the bank. </sentence><sentence id="1489">But that again, was to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="1490">I went to the bank and they said there's no such account. </sentence><sentence id="1491">But I stayed on at the University of Bairn (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1492">I enjoyed the studies there and I graduated with honors. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Switzerland was nice in the effect that I had all the freedom to study and there was a small Jewish student population there where you could interact and pursue your studies. </sentence><sentence id="1494">That was my aim and that's was my goal and that's why I went there. </sentence><sentence id="1495">I used to come home to New York in the summer. </sentence><sentence id="1496">I used to take fellowships at various hospitals and join various international medical students" groups and learned a lot and there was my life: to learn and to be able to do medicine. </sentence><sentence id="1497">I graduated from the University of Bairn (ph) and then I met my father in Israel after graduation. </sentence><sentence id="1498">And the meantime, a very sad thing happened, while I was in Bairn (ph), my mother was ill, became ill and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. </sentence><sentence id="1499">I came back to New York and faced that reality. </sentence><sentence id="1500">It was very difficult since being in medicine, I knew what the outcome would be. </sentence><sentence id="1501">However, I had to go back and continue my life. </sentence><sentence id="1502">During my last year of school, I was not aware of this grave situation    and my mother passed away without me being at her bedside. </sentence><sentence id="1503">My father upon consultation with a rabbi decided not to let me know until it was too late for me to come "cause they were afraid that I would stop school and never return to it. </sentence><sentence id="1504">And being in the last year they thought it would be wise for me to finish and that I definitely could not change the situation. </sentence><sentence id="1505">This is still a very heavy guilt that is weighing upon my shoulders, not being able to hold the hand at the end of her life and I'll just have to live with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
