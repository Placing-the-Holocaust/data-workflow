I just want to ask you a few questions and clarify something. </sentence><sentence id="36">I think by mistake you said that you were born the first year of World War II; you meant World War I.A. Oh, of course. </sentence><sentence id="37">Should I, should I repeat this? </sentence><sentence id="38">No. </sentence><sentence id="39">I wish I would be so young. </sentence><sentence id="40">Q. The other question I had for you, before the war were you, did you know Jewish people?Did you have contact with them?A. Oh, yes, I had many schoolmates, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="41">For instance the man by the name of Anton Rosenthal, was my boyscout master. </sentence><sentence id="42">A close friend of mine was Jan Kott (?), </sentence><sentence id="43">who is now in United States. </sentence><sentence id="44">He's my contemporary professor emeritus of Stonebrook University, a well known international authority of Shakespeare. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was a very close friend of mine and I had many other colleagues who were, who were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="46">Q. Were you aware of anti-semitism before the war?A. Not in the schools. </sentence><sentence id="47">I don't believe that for instance, Jan Kott or Rosenthal or Antoni Thom who were Jewish or, or Josef Handelsman, that they were really in any way felt different from others. </sentence><sentence id="48">They considered themselves Poles and I, I didn't witness any kind of, you know, unpleasant treatment. </sentence><sentence id="49">At the University, yes, not my university but the last years I mean, 30s, there was a lot of anti-semitism at the universities and Jewish students were requested to sit on a separate bench. </sentence><sentence id="50">They were humiliated. </sentence><sentence id="51">And they had really a bad life. </sentence><sentence id="52">This is, this is the time when I did witness anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="53">Not in the school. </sentence><sentence id="54">We went, eh, by curiosity, I remember that we did go in a small group to the synagogue just to see how it is inside. </sentence><sentence id="55">It was something very exotic to us, but I, I really didn't see much anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="56">I remember when I was bad in mathematics and I had to, my, my mother had to hire some student in mathematics who would, who would help me and there was an advertising and a young Jew from the ghetto from the Jewish district came and he asked, "Do you mind? </sentence><sentence id="57">I, lama Jew." </sentence><sentence id="58">It never even occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="59">I mean, of course, I don't mind. </sentence><sentence id="60">But there was, this was a different kind of anti-semitism than in, in Germany, but, but there were this extremist students organization of the right wing and that was one of the reasons why I didn't want to study in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="61">I didn't like these kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="62"> Q. How much did you know or think about what was going on in Germany about the Nazism that was really starting to take form about Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="63">How was that perceived? </sentence><sentence id="64">A. Well, I remember when Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="65">They were, we were scared. </sentence><sentence id="66">This was the first time we realized that maybe a war. </sentence><sentence id="67">We knew all he wrote, I mean, and this was considered to be a threat. </sentence><sentence id="68">I do remember maybe in "38 or "37 some Jews who escaped from Germany into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="69">I remember I, when I was on, on the train from Posznan to Warsaw that I talked to a, to an elderly Jew who just escaped from Berlin and he was telling me all about it. </sentence><sentence id="70">Q. What was the general attitude in Posznan and in Warsaw towards the Nazis? </sentence><sentence id="71">A. Well, you know, to us Nazis were Germans and Germans were Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="72">And Germans were enemies. </sentence><sentence id="73">Germans were considered to be enemies. </sentence><sentence id="74">So at that time really we considered every German is a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="75">You see it was over simplification, but this is how we... And after all, the support for Hitler was overwhelming in Germany, that we couldn't see any difference. </sentence><sentence id="76">We considered Germans as a big threat to us and that's from my young age, because Germans did want to take back the territories which they lost to Poland after the war and they were always considered the greatest threat to us. </sentence><sentence id="77">But until the end of the war really we didn't differentiate much between the Germans and the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="78">Q. In this distrust of the Germans was really a very separate than the, their ideas about genocide. </sentence><sentence id="79">A. Well, you know genocide came late. </sentence><sentence id="80">Remember they were of course victims of Nazis in Germany itself and in Poland, I mean, the number of people that were executed was considerable. </sentence><sentence id="81">I lost my uncle who was executed in October "39, but this was not genocide. </sentence><sentence id="82">In the sense that came later. </sentence><sentence id="83">The genocide of Jews did come, happen in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="84">This is when it started. </sentence><sentence id="85">There was extermination of Poles and of Jews, but this was not a sort of a total extermination of race or religion of people who belonged to the race or to the religion. </sentence><sentence id="86">Many victims, there was a German terror. </sentence><sentence id="87">Q. Early on it was very clear that the Germans weren't, were going to try to eliminate Jewish people in one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="88">Your distrust of Germans and Nazis was more territorial? </sentence><sentence id="89">A. Well, as far as Jews are concerned during the war, no. </sentence><sentence id="90">Nobody really anticipated that there will be a sort of a total extermination of every Jew. </sentence><sentence id="91">That came later. </sentence><sentence id="92">We knew that Jews are persecuted, that they are discriminated, that they are being killed, but the final solution in the sense that every Jew had to be killed because the crime he committed was that he was alive, that came later. </sentence><sentence id="93">Q. l understand that. </sentence><sentence id="94">I was trying to distinguish between you as a catholic Pole disliking or distrusting or hating the Germans as something separate than because they were persecuting the Jews and other minorities. </sentence><sentence id="95">A. Well, they were persecuting Poles, they were, they were, of course, but it was all, we abhored it. </sentence><sentence id="96">This was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="97">But we in the first stages we considered the persecution of Jews as the part of Nazism, of atrocities that they were committing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="98">Of course I felt great sympathy for my Jewish friends. </sentence><sentence id="99">I remember, you know, when I came back from, when I escaped from captivity and we were living in the apartment block, during the war people became  very close to each other. </sentence><sentence id="100">We were no longer neighbors who didn't know what the other neighbor was doing. </sentence><sentence id="101">They were very close. </sentence><sentence id="102">And there was Antoni living in our block of houses. </sentence><sentence id="103">A very nice man who was Jewish, and then they were all requested to leave the so-called Aryan district and to move to,to the Jewish district. </sentence><sentence id="104">And he was struggling with himself. </sentence><sentence id="105">Should he go to the Jewish district to move there or buy the, or get the legal papers and stay outside, which he felt was much more risky because this was a violation of law and every Jew that was caught outside the district would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="106">So, I, I remember how this man was fighting with each other, with, with himself. </sentence><sentence id="107">Should he and his family move to the Jewish ghetto or pretend he was, he was a Christian, and he finally decided to go there and probably that was his, his end eventually. </sentence><sentence id="108">Q. Would there have been support among the Polish community for Jewish people who needed to, who wanted to stay outside of the ghetto and hide? </sentence><sentence id="109">A. Well, they, they, the best way it was described was by Jan Karski (?) </sentence><sentence id="110">who just said there were people of bad will. </sentence><sentence id="111">There were people of good will and there were indifferent people. </sentence><sentence id="112">And this is exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="113">The bad people who were denouncing Jews very often for, for gain, for money, and people who were risking their lives to save Jews. </sentence><sentence id="114">Both were in minority. </sentence><sentence id="115">The great majority were indifferent people. </sentence><sentence id="116">You know, people who were, cared only how to survive, how to survive with their families. </sentence><sentence id="117">And this was not just something in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="118">I mean, the world was indifferent. </sentence><sentence id="119">Even the Jews in U.S. we knew were indifferent. </sentence><sentence id="120">But unfortunately most of the people cared about themselves. </sentence><sentence id="121">They were indifferent, but they were a great force to save the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="122">For instance, I know somebody who was active in some organization that dealt with the Germans and he was trying to get from the Germans special kind of permits for Christians of Jewish background. </sentence><sentence id="123">And the Germans said of course, give us the list we will give them special immunity. </sentence><sentence id="124">They will be able to move out and you know what happened? </sentence><sentence id="125">In the best of faith, he offered them the list. </sentence><sentence id="126">All of them were arrested and sent to, to jail and probably executed. </sentence><sentence id="127">But there were efforts to, to rescue. </sentence><sentence id="128">It was not easy, I will tell you. </sentence><sentence id="129">I remember my own experience. </sentence><sentence id="130">In the first year of war, we had to now livings and there was a tremendous shortage of food so everybody was smuggling food from the countryside, from peasants. </sentence><sentence id="131">And I was one of them, so I traveled to the estate of my uncle which was east from Poland and was getting some butter or some, even vodka which I would change for something else. </sentence><sentence id="132">And there were trains that were full of smugglers. </sentence><sentence id="133">This was, as I say, first months of war. </sentence><sentence id="134">This trains were dilapidated without, you know, windows where, where the glass was smashed. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was cold and all that, and I was alone in my compartment, but in the next compartment was a Jewish girl and there was some typical Warsaw hooligans who started to be aggressive. </sentence><sentence id="136">And instinctively she came to me and said, "Protect me. </sentence><sentence id="137">They are hooligans." </sentence><sentence id="138">I scolded them and they let her alone. </sentence><sentence id="139">She was sitting next to me. </sentence><sentence id="140">Now, at that time, the Jews were not yet in closed ghettos, but using of the public transport was forbidden and any Jew caught in the train, in the bus, would be executed. </sentence><sentence id="141">And she was a beautiful girl, maybe 19, 20, but with very characteristic Jewish features. </sentence><sentence id="142">You could, one look is enough to know she is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="143">She was very thankful. </sentence><sentence id="144">We talked and said, "But, you know, I have to ask you one more favor." </sentence><sentence id="145">I said, "What is it?" " </sentence><sentence id="146">Well, when we come  to , to the station, we have to go through the schpera (ph)," in other words, exit. </sentence><sentence id="147">And always there was a German policeman, schutzpolizi (ph), who was checking passengers and documents and all that. </sentence><sentence id="148">Not everybody but sporadically. </sentence><sentence id="149">Said, "I would like to take you under arm so that we go together." </sentence><sentence id="150">Now, frankly, you know, I couldn't refuse, but I knew I am accepting risk of life because she would be recognized. </sentence><sentence id="151">If she was with me, they would take us to the next police station and, and shoot, but I couldn't refuse really. </sentence><sentence id="152">So she took me under arm and I didn't look at this German policeman but I could sense that he was looking at her. </sentence><sentence id="153">And it was a moment of terrific fear. </sentence><sentence id="154">When we passed, well she thanked me and she kissed me on both my checks and I, my, my knees were trembling under me. </sentence><sentence id="155">And later I smuggled compromising materials. </sentence><sentence id="156">I crossed the border with false documents. </sentence><sentence id="157">I was never so much afraid because it was not written on my forehead that I am a member of the resistance movement, but here it was enough to look at her. </sentence><sentence id="158">So, I very much appreciate the people who really were heroic enough to risk, not only their own lives, but that of families, of their wives, children and kept, and were offering hiding to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="159">It was an act of outstanding heroism and, and frankly many of them were, lost their lives. </sentence><sentence id="160">They, we, I remember, you know, posters with the names of Poles who were executed because they were hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="161">And I don't wonder that they were in minority, but there were many of them. </sentence><sentence id="162">I mean the, there are at least 6,000 names, Polish names, in Yad Vashem. </sentence><sentence id="163">In, only in Poland people were executed, in Russia and in Poland people who were hiding Jews were executed. </sentence><sentence id="164">They were not executed in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="165">They may have been jailed, but never executed. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was only in Poland that anybody hiding Jews was executed. </sentence><sentence id="167">Q. Tell me a little bit about the beginning of the war in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="168">What you were doing, what Warsaw was like during occupation. </sentence><sentence id="169">I know that you were in a battle initially. </sentence><sentence id="170">A. Well I was in the battle initially but I was taken prisoner escaped got back to the city and lived in the city. </sentence><sentence id="171">Well, you know, first of all it was a city of unemployed because all people were employed by the state lost their jobs, and they had to find some means of living. </sentence><sentence id="172">The rations, the coupons were totally inadequate. </sentence><sentence id="173">Nobody could live just from, you know, the bread and butter and so on that was, you could buy from coupon. </sentence><sentence id="174">So initially the main preoccupation was how to get food, how to, you know, -- the winter was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="175">What about heating, you know. </sentence><sentence id="176">There was no coal, so that this elementary needs of people were occupying us. </sentence><sentence id="177">But I was trying to get in touch with some underground organization. </sentence><sentence id="178">We did all had a great need to fight on with the Nazis after our defeat in September, but it was only in "41 really, that, the Spring of "41 that I joined the Polish Home Army. </sentence><sentence id="179">It was a matter of accident because you had to find somebody in the underground who would trust you and who would get you in touch with some people. </sentence><sentence id="180">And as far as I'm concerned it happened in, in the Spring of "41. </sentence><sentence id="181">We all lived with, you know, nobody knew if he will live to the end of the day because there was a German terror. </sentence><sentence id="182">And it was a blind terror. </sentence><sentence id="183">The Germans would take, arrest one hundred people  because of what? </sentence><sentence id="184">Because some German was killed or something happened and they would be executed. </sentence><sentence id="185">So, that people came to a conclusion very soon that it doesn't matter if you are in the underground or not if you are passive or if you are active in the anti-German movement. </sentence><sentence id="186">It's a matter of accident. </sentence><sentence id="187">You may be surrounded on the streets, there were this, and either deported to Germany as a forced labor, or to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="188">Auschwitz was established in 1940 as a camp for Polish inmates. </sentence><sentence id="189">The first 700 inmates of Auschwitz were Poles, mostly Polish intelligencia, but we got used to the terror. </sentence><sentence id="190">Very few people were really afraid because it was daily bread. </sentence><sentence id="191">You simply had to co exist with, with, with the possibility that you may be arrested, killed and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="192">It became something, part of life. </sentence><sentence id="193">Q. Was there much evidence of brutality? </sentence><sentence id="194">A. There was. </sentence><sentence id="195">There was people who were beaten on the street and the police, the gestapo would come to the house. </sentence><sentence id="196">They would start by beating people. </sentence><sentence id="197">Of course the worst of it all was the treatment of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="198">It was gradual. </sentence><sentence id="199">You see, they were, first they were requested to wear David Stars, yellow band. </sentence><sentence id="200">Then they were requested to move to the Jewish district. </sentence><sentence id="201">But the Jewish district was not yet closed, so they lived there but they could move around. </sentence><sentence id="202">Later it was closed. </sentence><sentence id="203">The wall was built around the ghetto and initially Christians were not allowed without special pass to go into ghetto, but the street cars were crossing the ghetto in a transit to other districts of the city. </sentence><sentence id="204">And Ido remember. </sentence><sentence id="205">You know this was the time probably "41 when ghetto was isolated and people in the ghetto were simply hungry. </sentence><sentence id="206">They were starving. </sentence><sentence id="207">And the streets were covered by corpses, covered by newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="208">People who died from spotted fever mostly or from starvation and the family had no means to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="209">They would just put the body on the pavement and cover it with the newspaper and the car would come simply from, from municipal. </sentence><sentence id="210">So it was--piles of these bodies were put on the car and taken to some common grave. </sentence><sentence id="211">But the, the view was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="212">People were like skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="213">Young, young Jews who really looked awful, I mean, living skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="214">You could see that the people were starving. </sentence><sentence id="215">Q. When you went through the ghetto on a street car, did people ever try to call out for help?A. Very, no, because street cars were going pretty fast. </sentence><sentence id="216">There was no chance to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="217">But, some Jews were, in spite of the great risk of losing life, they were coming for help. </sentence><sentence id="218">I remember, I will never forget it, I will never forget it, you know, probably it was "41 when we were living in a good residential area and the girl, Jewish girl who was no more than 10 came with a small brother who was five and said, "We are very hungry." </sentence><sentence id="219">And it was something I will never forget, to see the child who say, "I am hungry." </sentence><sentence id="220">Q.

My mother gave her bread, soup and said, "Come whenever you want, whenever you are hungry." </sentence><sentence id="222">They never came back. </sentence><sentence id="223">Nobody knows what happened. </sentence><sentence id="224"> Q. Did you have any other experiences in seeing what was happening in the ghetto or knowing about it? </sentence><sentence id="225">A. Well, we know, we knew, but later we were isolated. </sentence><sentence id="226">I mean you could see the groups of Jews who were under, mostly under the escort of the police going to work and of course they were trying to get food and they were getting food, potatoes and bread and all that. </sentence><sentence id="227">But the police, German police, would take away everything from them and beat them when they were coming back. </sentence><sentence id="228">Still, they were trying to get food, coming back. </sentence><sentence id="229">But what was inside the ghetto, we didn't know because it was a wall, total isolation. </sentence><sentence id="230">Q. Now, your family was able to stay together? </sentence><sentence id="231">A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="232">Q. Was there semblance of normal life for you? </sentence><sentence id="233">A.

Generally, in the community not so much when you chose to go in the underground, was there any support for the German occupation? </sentence><sentence id="243">A. Very few. </sentence><sentence id="244">There were always, you know, in every community you have people who will cooperate and collaborate and denounce people, but frankly you know it was the Germans who united people. </sentence><sentence id="245">Since the, every Pole was, you know, also condemned. </sentence><sentence id="246">People because of this terror, they really became very, they got used to it, but they were united. </sentence><sentence id="247">There was a common anti-German front, no question. </sentence><sentence id="248">And we had no questling (?) </sentence><sentence id="249">government, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="250">And collaborators were shot. </sentence><sentence id="251">I mean, the people who collaborated with Germans were killed. </sentence><sentence id="252">By, they got sentences of death and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="253">The underground was very ruthless with collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="254">It was a risky thing to collaborate with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="255">Q.

There was, of course, administration was German. </sentence><sentence id="257">They were some offices for instance, city offices Poles were employed. </sentence><sentence id="258">Germans had no manpower. </sentence><sentence id="259">They had used their manpower for war industry and, and in the front. </sentence><sentence id="260">So, they did use Poles but it was different thing to work in the, in the administration. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was not collaboration. </sentence><sentence id="262">It was not considered--as long as you were not used as an instrument to persecute others. </sentence><sentence id="263">So, of course they were, they were offices, labor offices or municipal authorities. </sentence><sentence id="264">The same was in ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="265">The Jews were employed by the, by the German authorities in all kinds of organizations. </sentence><sentence id="266">Q. In your prewar government? </sentence><sentence id="267">A. Was in London, but we did have an underground authority. </sentence><sentence id="268">It was a kind of underground state which was kind of moral authority, you know. </sentence><sentence id="269">People did obey the orders that came from our underground government. </sentence><sentence id="270">Commander and chief of the Polish Home army of the military  underground and there was so called delegation of the government in London. </sentence><sentence id="271">And they did have considerable authority. </sentence><sentence id="272">Q.

Can you tell me a little bit about the circumstances how you got involved with the underground? </sentence><sentence id="281">A. Well first I established some contact with some underground paper, but it was sort of a conservative paper which I didn't like very much, but there was no choice. </sentence><sentence id="282">I mean, I had no other contacts. </sentence><sentence id="283">But in "41 I did, I met somebody who really introduced me into the underground and I joined so called Action Ann which was psychological warfare against the Nazis, against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="284">We produced German underground press, by, which was prepared by excellent experts. </sentence><sentence id="285">Mostly by Poles, who were bilingual, spoke as good German as Polish. </sentence><sentence id="286">And this was, we were pretending to be German newspapers which did create a sensation in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="287">And it was never distributed from hands to hands because it would betray Polish souls. </sentence><sentence id="288">It was distributed by dropping on the floor or inside the book, inside the parcels that were sent to the soldiers in the front, in the restaurants, in the trains. </sentence><sentence id="289">And my, my function was to organize distribution of this black propaganda press. </sentence><sentence id="290">In Germany, I didn't know German very well, very, just a few words, but there were so many Poles who became German, so-called volksdeutsch who didn't speak good German that it was not so bad as you may think. </sentence><sentence id="291">SO, I had to cross the border of so called Generalgouvernement, which was central Poland, isolated from the rest of, of Germany, of occupied Poland. </sentence><sentence id="292">And I had to find agents inside Germany who were distributing this, this subversive literature. </sentence><sentence id="293">Which was a fascinating job. </sentence><sentence id="294">I traveled under disguise of Polish railway man and then German railway man which was the safest way to travel with forged documents of course. </sentence><sentence id="295">And that lasted until the spring of "43. </sentence><sentence id="296">In "43 I discovered the possibility to go to Sweden hidden in the Swedish ship. </sentence><sentence id="297">Swedes were importing iron ore to Germans and were taking coal from, from Poland, from Polish territories and I was put in touch with some people from the underground who could place a blind passenger in the bunker of coal. </sentence><sentence id="298">So, I reported to my authorities and volunteered to go in this manner. </sentence><sentence id="299">And I became a courier. </sentence><sentence id="300">I was traveling with intelligence reports hidden in the microfilms and all kinds of objects. </sentence><sentence id="301">And after some adventures I did reach Stockholm and that was just at the time of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="302"> And I learned about it by listening to the Polish radio in London which was in touch with the secret radio in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="303">So, they were getting daily reports and I was very impressed by this and I remember I wrote a report about genocide of Jews to a Polish commander and chief and Prime Minister General Chicovsky (?), </sentence><sentence id="304">and were urging him that the allies must make some kind of threats of reprisals to Germans to stop it. </sentence><sentence id="305">And if they will not do anything, well Poles will be next. </sentence><sentence id="306">I used this, this argument, that if Germans will be completely, could, without any penalty, murder three million Jews then next after them will be Poles. </sentence><sentence id="307">And I know that report did reach the addressee and was passed over, passed on to Churchill. </sentence><sentence id="308">And I was told after the war that it did have some influence. </sentence><sentence id="309">I think the, this decision to bring war criminals before the international tribunal was done more or less at that time. </sentence><sentence id="310">What I was really asking for was to have a kind of bombing which would be declared as a reprisal for mass murders of Jews, and I remember I used the argument you, you, the Americans and British are going to bomb the Germans anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="311">Why not to say this is an act of reprisal. </sentence><sentence id="312">No, nothing like that ever happened. </sentence><sentence id="313">So, I came back from Stockholm and I was immediately commissioned to go this same route but to London. </sentence><sentence id="314">And at that time they put me in touch with a man in the underground who was in a contact man with the Jewish military organization in the ghetto, by the name of Henry Valinsky (2). </sentence><sentence id="315">And I was under instructions to get as much briefing about the Holocaust as it is called now. </sentence><sentence id="316">We didn't use this word at that time, about the Jewish uprising and to consider it a sort of a priority in my mission to London. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I did spend much time with Volinsky who told me all about the problems with even names of some militants, and I got microfilms and I was the man who brought to London a report , a Jewish Militant Organization, written after the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="318">I remember when I was boarding train on my way to port Gdansk to go to Sweden, the messenger came and gave me, I believe it was a battery or something, you know, battery for a torch and said, "You have to take it, this is a report, the story of the extermination of Jews and of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising." </sentence><sentence id="319">And it was -- I didn't know really exactly what it was until I reached London and the film was developed and it was a very impressive story written by the woman writer called Kahn, K-A-H-N. "P , Before the Eyes of the World," which was translated but I don't believe it was published, you know, because it was very little interesting the kind of atrocity stories at that time. </sentence><sentence id="320">So, this was my mission. </sentence><sentence id="321">I already knew that people in the west do not believe in the genocide on the scale that it took place. </sentence><sentence id="322">So, I approached a British NCO by the name of Ronnie Jeffrey who is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="323">He's in New Zealand. </sentence><sentence id="324">He escaped from the camp, POW camp in Woodje (?). </sentence><sentence id="325">Q. You were talking about Mr. Jeffrey? </sentence><sentence id="326">A. Yes, so I didn't know that the credibility of a Pole with the British may be questionable so I approached a friend of mine, a British NCO by the name of Ronald Jeffrey, an extremely brave young man who escaped from a POW camp in Woodje (?). </sentence><sentence id="327">He lived in Warsaw in hiding and was very active in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="328">He was a man of considerable courage, spoke fluent German and learned Polish and I told him, "Ronnie, write the letter to London Times about the  0 Jews, about the atrocities and all that's going on and identify yourself. </sentence><sentence id="329">Give your number, your regiment and all that and I will ask that it's microfilmed and we'll send it to London Times." </sentence><sentence id="330">And it was developed, the microfilm was developed, and the Polish government sent it to London Times. </sentence><sentence id="331">They never published it. </sentence><sentence id="332">So when I met archbishop Temple who was the archbishop of Canterbury, head of the underground church, he was really a good man and he was just not asking what can I do for you in the sense which implied, I can do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="333">He just asked the question. </sentence><sentence id="334">In the good sense, "Can I do something?," </sentence><sentence id="335">and I said, "Well, you know, use your influence you are the second person after the king." </sentence><sentence id="336">Send my letter to the Times and ask why they didn't publish it. </sentence><sentence id="337">Use your influence to, with the Times to have this letter published. </sentence><sentence id="338">And I have his answer. </sentence><sentence id="339">I have his answer here in Washington, the original letter. </sentence><sentence id="340">He says, "Mr.Nowak, I am sorry. </sentence><sentence id="341">Nothing to be done. </sentence><sentence id="342">London Times say they can not publish the letter because it could endanger the man in Warsaw and the British POWs," which was nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="343">I mean he was one of I don't know how many thousand people living with the forged documents. </sentence><sentence id="344">Nobody could, how could the Germans find him? </sentence><sentence id="345">And I told about it Walter Laquer (?) </sentence><sentence id="346">when he was writing his books, and he approached London, London Times and said, "Do you have this letter in your archives?" </sentence><sentence id="347">They said, "No, the letter was destroyed," which is not true. </sentence><sentence id="348">I mean a letter smuggled from the occupied Poland from a British prisoner of war was a curiosity. </sentence><sentence id="349">I'm sure they would keep it. </sentence><sentence id="350">They didn't want to admit they had this kind of letter and then publish it. </sentence><sentence id="351">Q. Now, I want to back track a little bit and learn more about the underground, the Polish underground. </sentence><sentence id="352">What motivated you to get involved? </sentence><sentence id="353">A. Patriotic duty. </sentence><sentence id="354">I mean, I was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="355">I was the officer. </sentence><sentence id="356">I mean, it was my duty to fight on. </sentence><sentence id="357">That was the motivation of people who joined the underground. </sentence><sentence id="358">Q. From where did all these people come? </sentence><sentence id="359">A. All walks of life, absolutely all walks of life. </sentence><sentence id="360">The countryside--the peasants were extremely well-organized. </sentence><sentence id="361">For instance you know parachuting, parachutes, they got special committees by the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="362">They were peasant battalions, partisan units, guerrilla, intelligencia, they, they, everybody. </sentence><sentence id="363">If somebody was not in the underground he was at least trying to help in some way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="364">But it was a conspiracy of the entire nation I would say. </sentence><sentence id="365">There were very few people who were not involved in this or other way. </sentence><sentence id="366">Which does not mean that organization itself probably would be no more than 100,000 but it had tremendous hinterland (?) </sentence><sentence id="367">of people supporting it, whether by offering hiding place or helping in any way they could. </sentence><sentence id="368">So, that even if I didn't know a passerby I could approach him and say, "Look, help me." </sentence><sentence id="369">And it was a fantastic experience. </sentence><sentence id="370">I remember when German closed the street because there was some attempt on the, attack on the SA unit, marching, this, hand grenade was thrown. </sentence><sentence id="371">I was inside the apartment house with some other people on the conspiracy. </sentence><sentence id="372">We were  1 told that everything is quiet. </sentence><sentence id="373">We can leave. </sentence><sentence id="374">I was the first one who left and when I was leaving the house the gestapo man stopped me and he said, "Where did you come from?" </sentence><sentence id="375">I knew if I say which apartment the rest of my colleagues including my finance were there. </sentence><sentence id="376">So over his shoulder I saw the name of a dentist and I said I left the dentist's room and I gave her name. </sentence><sentence id="377">He took me to the nearest pharmacy, picked up the phone and called the dentist with my identity card and said, "Was a man by this name in your room?" </sentence><sentence id="378">I thought that's the end. </sentence><sentence id="379">He put down the received you can go. </sentence><sentence id="380">She said yes of course he was. </sentence><sentence id="381">He, I never saw the lady. </sentence><sentence id="382">She never saw me, but she was in this house. </sentence><sentence id="383">She knew what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="384">So, yes, of course he was in, he was my patient. </sentence><sentence id="385">He was in my room. </sentence><sentence id="386">This was the kind of conspiracy where everybody was trying to help and assist. </sentence><sentence id="387">I lost ticket, a ticket when I was with my compromising material. </sentence><sentence id="388">I approached a worker who had a season railway ticket and I asked him could you please buy me a ticket because I cannot go through the schpera (?) </sentence><sentence id="389">without the ticket. </sentence><sentence id="390">Of course he didn't know who I was. </sentence><sentence id="391">He went, bought the ticket and brought me the ticket. </sentence><sentence id="392">I left the railway station safely. </sentence><sentence id="393">So everywhere there was some kind assistance. </sentence><sentence id="394">That's why we would act. </sentence><sentence id="395">Q. Did the organization of the underground evolve out of prewar political organizations? </sentence><sentence id="396">A. It evolved spontaneously. </sentence><sentence id="397">They were really secret organizations which were mushrooming after the defeat of Poland everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="398">At the same time the commanding officers were appointed by our authorities in London and they were trying to unite this whole kind of spontaneous organization into one underground force and they managed to do so. </sentence><sentence id="399">But the initiative would come from grass roots. </sentence><sentence id="400">Q. Were there any Jews in the underground? </sentence><sentence id="401">A. Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="402">I mean, for instance my school mate, a little older Lucian 2 was in, in the, in my, very close to me in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="403">Jusak (?) </sentence><sentence id="404">Handelsman, he's, he's, professor Handelsman, who was killed by the Germans later. </sentence><sentence id="405">I could name several other people. </sentence><sentence id="406">Yes, there were some Jews in the underground movement. </sentence><sentence id="407">Q. Not a lot? </sentence><sentence id="408">A. Not many because, because you know there was, this was a terrific danger. </sentence><sentence id="409">You know, the man Lucian ? </sentence><sentence id="410">for instance, was, had very Jewish features. </sentence><sentence id="411">Now if he would be caught with some compromising material and tortured, he would betray others, so it was dangerous to have a Jew who could be recognized as a Jew in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="412">But, there were some. </sentence><sentence id="413">Q. Was there any coordination between the Polish underground and the Ghetto underground? </sentence><sentence id="414">A. Yes, but not from the very beginning because at the beginning Jews like Dr. Jenokov (?), </sentence><sentence id="415">for instance, they took the position that if we resist, I mean if Jews we resist, all will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="416">If  2 we don't resist, if we simply carry out orders, some will be killed and some will survive. </sentence><sentence id="417">This was a wrong philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="418">And the first really Jewish militant units were formed only after this big wave of extermination at the end of "42. </sentence><sentence id="419">And then they were trying to establish contact with us and to get weapons. </sentence><sentence id="420">Now, initially the Polish military were reluctant because they were not sure if they will fight but later they have shown tremendous determination and they did get weapons. </sentence><sentence id="421">Not enough, not sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="422">They were always complaining they don't get enough. </sentence><sentence id="423">But also not only weapons because we were very short of weapons until British started really to throw a lot of weapons since April "44. </sentence><sentence id="424">But we were for instance, I know that the Poles were giving them contacts to the, where they could buy weapons from Germans. </sentence><sentence id="425">It was a possibility. </sentence><sentence id="426">There were many German soldiers who were selling their weapons. </sentence><sentence id="427">So whatever they had they got from us, but this was very poor equipment. </sentence><sentence id="428">They were poorly equipped. </sentence><sentence id="429">Some pistols, some few guns. </sentence><sentence id="430">It was very small, very poorly equipped insurgence army. </sentence><sentence id="431">Q. Was there any coordination in terms of information? </sentence><sentence id="432">A. There were, there were liaison people who were coming from the ghetto, mostly by sewers or other ways. </sentence><sentence id="433">I don't know what. </sentence><sentence id="434">One of them was Antec Zuckerman (?), </sentence><sentence id="435">for instance. </sentence><sentence id="436">He was the one that was kind of a liaison between the ghetto and the underground. </sentence><sentence id="437">There were some others. </sentence><sentence id="438">And there was an organized transport of arms. </sentence><sentence id="439">The men who were really in touch with them was was among others. </sentence><sentence id="440">He was the one who was assigned to be a kind of a liaison with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="441">Q. What were the primary goals of the underground? </sentence><sentence id="442">A. Fight for independence, for freedom. </sentence><sentence id="443">Fight with the enemy, fight with the Germans for freedom. </sentence><sentence id="444">That was the goal, as in France as in every occupied country. </sentence><sentence id="445">Q. Did the ways in which you hoped to achieve that change or evolve as the war went on. </sentence><sentence id="446">A. I didn't get your question. </sentence><sentence id="447">Q. When you say fight with the enemy obviously you worked in a more political or propagandist end for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="448">A. It was also kind of a struggle, a very important one, psychological warfare. </sentence><sentence id="449">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="450">Q. I'm just wondering if the ways in which you wanted to achieve this freedom or independence evolved or if you always had kind of a full scale strategy in place of how to do this both militarily and politically. </sentence><sentence id="451">A. Well, of course it developed gradually, but the concept was clear. </sentence><sentence id="452">It was all out fight on every sector. </sentence><sentence id="453">Psychological warfare was only one of many but there was urban guerrilla. </sentence><sentence id="454">There were partisan units in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="455">There was sabotage of all kind. </sentence><sentence id="456">It was all out fight with many directions. </sentence><sentence id="457">There were the units that were trying to terrorize the Germans, who were executing Germans. </sentence><sentence id="458">It was a very broad front to inflict as much on them as possible. </sentence><sentence id="459">And to contribute to the victory. </sentence><sentence id="460">Q. How much information did you have about other operations working in the underground? </sentence><sentence id="461"> 3 A. Not much, whatever, only what was published in the underground papers, because the tule was that if you belong to one cell, or one unit, you are not allowed to get, involve yourself in any other. </sentence><sentence id="462">This was the rule to protect organization. </sentence><sentence id="463">You, you shouldn't try to know more than you have to know because if you are arrested you never know how you will, you know, will you, if you will not under tortures, if you will not break down and will not betray others. </sentence><sentence id="464">It was assumed that the man who is arrested and tortured may tell the Germans under, you know, tortures, things about others. </sentence><sentence id="465">So the policy was that everybody had to limit, to have his knowledge as limited as possible. </sentence><sentence id="466">End of Tape 1  4 Tape 2 Q. How extensive was the Polish underground? </sentence><sentence id="467">A. It was very extensive because in addition to people who were organized, and I believe people who were organized were probably no more than 400,000. </sentence><sentence id="468">There was a hinterland, the people who were supporting by offering hiding places or any kind of help so that frankly we could operate mainly because of this kind of spontaneous assistance from people who were not themselves organized but who were ready to accept the risks and to help. </sentence><sentence id="469">Q. Had this whole state essentially gone underground? </sentence><sentence id="470">I mean, what kind of services were-- A. Well, it was really an underground state. </sentence><sentence id="471">There were court, underground courts, underground justice. </sentence><sentence id="472">There was, there were underground universities. </sentence><sentence id="473">There was a whole underground life really, and it comprised the entire society really. </sentence><sentence id="474">So Jan Karski (?) </sentence><sentence id="475">called his book published in United States during the war "The Story of the Underground State," and it was the underground state. </sentence><sentence id="476">Q. Who was getting prosecuted in these courts? </sentence><sentence id="477">A. Oh, the traitors, collaborators with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="478">This was the court to sentence the people who were guilty of collaboration with the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="479">Also the people who, for instance, denouncing Jews were, were also put before this court and executed. </sentence><sentence id="480">But, Gestapo people, particularly cruel Germans and it was also a kind of psychological warfare because the man who was sentenced would first get the sentence and then he would be killed or he would get a warning that he's going to be put before this kind of underground court. </sentence><sentence id="481">But this was a regular court with the attorneys. </sentence><sentence id="482">They were mostly professional judges or professional lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="483">So, there were regular courts and they were using the Polish penal code. </sentence><sentence id="484">Q. In all these spontaneous organizations and prewar political organizations they all came together and supported this unified system? </sentence><sentence id="485">A. Correct. </sentence><sentence id="486">There were some groups that did not belong to it. </sentence><sentence id="487">Extreme right wing groups were, did not belong to the, this underground state and communists. </sentence><sentence id="488">Otherwise there were people of all possible outlooks. </sentence><sentence id="489">There were nationalists, there were social democrats, there were catholics, all kinds of groups--peasants. </sentence><sentence id="490">The whole spector of political views with the exception of extreme rightist and communists. </sentence><sentence id="491">Q. Were they a problem? </sentence><sentence id="492">A. They were a problem, particularly communists but also the extreme right wing were problems. </sentence><sentence id="493">Q. How did you get your supplies and what supplies were especially important to you? </sentence><sentence id="494">A. What? </sentence><sentence id="495">Q. How did you get the supplies the underground needed? </sentence><sentence id="496"> 5 A. Well you know, the money and the weapons did come from, from London. </sentence><sentence id="497">They were parachuted. </sentence><sentence id="498">There were some weapons that were bought from Germans or we simply attacked the German units and took the weapons. </sentence><sentence id="499">But supply of money would come mainly from first Paris and then London. </sentence><sentence id="500">From outside. </sentence><sentence id="501">Q. What other supplies were really crucial to your efforts? </sentence><sentence id="502">A. Mostly weapons, but money as well because people had to live from something. </sentence><sentence id="503">If somebody could, lost his legal life, so to speak, he had to live with false documents, he couldn't work, so he had to be put on the payroll. </sentence><sentence id="504">So, money was extremely important. </sentence><sentence id="505">The underground press had to buy papers. </sentence><sentence id="506">Q. So if you had the money you could get any of the other things you needed? </sentence><sentence id="507">A. Yes, including even weapons but one could buy weapons from some German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="508">Weapons and ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="509">Q. What sort of risk did you, did you personally have to take a lot of high risk? </sentence><sentence id="510">A. Oh, yes, I had to risk my life very often. </sentence><sentence id="511">I mean any crossing of the border with forged documents and with compromising material was very risky. </sentence><sentence id="512">Moving around in the, Germany, being a Pole, was very risky even considering that I didn't speak good German. </sentence><sentence id="513">Crossing from Warsaw to Stockholm was not an easy matter. </sentence><sentence id="514">I don't want to advertise myself because people were taking considerable risks. </sentence><sentence id="515">Many people died. </sentence><sentence id="516">Many people were arrested and died. </sentence><sentence id="517">I was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="518">Q. How afraid were you at the time? </sentence><sentence id="519">A. I was, I really had probably no imagination. </sentence><sentence id="520">Because as I told you before I was once scared to death when a Jewish girl with very characteristic Jewish features asked me that I, that she should take me under arm to cross the so called schpera (?), </sentence><sentence id="521">you know, where Germans were checking. </sentence><sentence id="522">I knew that if they would arrest her I would be executed as well, so I was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="523">I was very much afraid before the parachute training. </sentence><sentence id="524">It was a kind of suicide really to jump out of the plane. </sentence><sentence id="525">It was a, but otherwise I got used to it. </sentence><sentence id="526">I never thought about dangers and risks and I was not very much afraid simply because I was not thinking about what may happen. </sentence><sentence id="527">This was the best thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="528">Q. How much initiative did you have to take versus systems that were in place for you? </sentence><sentence id="529">A. Every day, every step. </sentence><sentence id="530">It all depended on my initiative, on my concepts, my ideas, how to act, what to do, how to avoid dangers, how to find the people who can help. </sentence><sentence id="531">You were left to your own resources mostly. </sentence><sentence id="532">Q. What prepared you for this? </sentence><sentence id="533">A. What? </sentence><sentence id="534">Q. What do you think prepared you for this kind of activity? </sentence><sentence id="535">A. I had the motivation I think. </sentence><sentence id="536">I did want to serve my country and to help to, to defeat the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="537">Q. Tell me a little bit more about the propaganda campaign, its action end. </sentence><sentence id="538">A. Well it was a psychological warfare with the main purpose was to demoralize the Germans by all kinds of tricks. </sentence><sentence id="539">For instance, instruction, "How to behave to avoid, you know,  6 frost at the east front," which was so terrible, the instructions, that would frighten anybody going to the east front, to the, to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="540">That's just one example. </sentence><sentence id="541">For instance, the Germans in Warsaw, yes, would get a secret instructions that the gas attack, chemical weapon attack by Russians is expected in Warsaw and that they should go to the such and such office to collect gas masks. </sentence><sentence id="542">You see? </sentence><sentence id="543">But they are not allowed to tell Poles about it because there are not enough gas masks. </sentence><sentence id="544">We knew there were no gas masks at all. </sentence><sentence id="545">So, the Germans would make queues, would come for gas masks and were told we don't have any gas masks for you which would spread panic of course. </sentence><sentence id="546">There were for instance we would send the secret instructions--no, not secret, open instructions that there is such and such anniversary in the Nazi movement and today is free from work. </sentence><sentence id="547">It was not, but if every worker and every engineer in a big factory producing weapons they would not come to work and it would be a terrific waste of manpower, you see. </sentence><sentence id="548">We were forging secret forms of all kind of Nazi documents and, you know, all kinds of managers, directors, important people would get an order. </sentence><sentence id="549">For instance the important engineer in Munich would get an order to go the party meeting in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="550">So, he would put his SA uniform on him and he would go to Hamburg to say that you are a victim of a joke. </sentence><sentence id="551">Okay but he would not be at work. </sentence><sentence id="552">It would inflict considerable damage to war machinery. </sentence><sentence id="553">So, it was a kind of a psychological sabotage which was extremely effective. </sentence><sentence id="554">And above all, to give the Germans the impression that there is an anti-Nazi resistance movement which in fact did not exist. </sentence><sentence id="555">That there is anti-Hitler plots. </sentence><sentence id="556">All this had certain psychological impact on Germans and I think we were pretty effective in this. </sentence><sentence id="557">Q. Were you thinking up a lot of these schemes? </sentence><sentence id="558">A. No. </sentence><sentence id="559">My job really was to organize the network and distribution and the others were thinking about, you know, were finding the ideas how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="560">Q. Did you have any sense of how effective it was? </sentence><sentence id="561">A. We did, because we did have all kinds of secret German documents how to fight it, how to -- and Germans went out of their way to find us, to arrest us and so on. </sentence><sentence id="562">And then we had the report from the British Intelligence Service which found that this was a very effective job. </sentence><sentence id="563">We got a lot of praise from the British for this kind of propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="564">They did have their own black propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="565">We were trying -- one of my jobs was to establish cooperation between British black propaganda which was mostly, mostly for, by radio, you know. </sentence><sentence id="566">But radio which were posing as the German underground radios and the man who was conducting it was a genius by the name of Sefton Delmer (?). </sentence><sentence id="567">I met him and he praised our effort very highly. </sentence><sentence id="568">He respected what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="569">Q. What was your biggest challenge in setting up this distribution network? </sentence><sentence id="570">A. Well, to travel, travel with the forged documents with the compromising material under, with the uniform of a railway man without good knowledge of German. </sentence><sentence id="571">There was a considerable risk in it but it was fun. </sentence><sentence id="572">It was, I considered it the most fascinating part of my life. </sentence><sentence id="573">Q. Was it easy to recruit people for this? </sentence><sentence id="574"> 7 A. It was easy. </sentence><sentence id="575">Too many people. </sentence><sentence id="576">There were too many volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="577">You had to be selective, but people did want to work for us and were really contemptuous of the, of the risk of life. </sentence><sentence id="578">Q. Now when you were in London, you were there doing what? </sentence><sentence id="579">A. Well, I arrived right after the on 11th of December "43 and I left on I believe the 14th of July, or maybe, no maybe on 11th of July "44. </sentence><sentence id="580">And I was in Richt (ph), Poland on the 25th of July, just before the Warsaw uprising and I was sent after the collapse of the uprising back and we reached, it was a long journey. </sentence><sentence id="581">We reached London on 22nd of January "45. </sentence><sentence id="582">This was the last trip. </sentence><sentence id="583">Q. On your first trip to London, why were you sent there. </sentence><sentence id="584">What was your role? </sentence><sentence id="585">A. Emissary, a man who were bringing some very important messages, oral, briefing. </sentence><sentence id="586">I had a mission. </sentence><sentence id="587">And also of course I had my microfilms with me. </sentence><sentence id="588">But, but it was, they were important reports from the commander in chief in Poland to the Polish commander and chief in London and to the Polish government. </sentence><sentence id="589">My main mission was to brief and to tell people. </sentence><sentence id="590">I mean, I met Anthony Eden. </sentence><sentence id="591">I met at least five other members of the war cabinet. </sentence><sentence id="592">It was Annis Bevin (2), Archibold Singer (?) </sentence><sentence id="593">who was the minister of the airforce. </sentence><sentence id="594">Lord Selbourne, psychological warfare, Morrison (?). </sentence><sentence id="595">Annis Bevin was labor and at the end I met Churchill. </sentence><sentence id="596">This was my last meeting. </sentence><sentence id="597">I met many parliamentarians, many journalists. </sentence><sentence id="598">Q. What kind of information were you taking? </sentence><sentence id="599">A. About the underground activities, about the situation there. </sentence><sentence id="600">About our plans of action, and above all we were trying to really get support in view of the coming danger from the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="601">I mean it was not only the fight against the Germans, we were then already facing great danger of the Russians, of the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="602">My mission was really to convince the British and the Americans that they should in some way help us resist Soviet designs to subjugate Poland and the rest of the area. </sentence><sentence id="603">This was one of my most important missions. </sentence><sentence id="604">One of my missions was also to report about genocide of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="605">This was a high priority mission. </sentence><sentence id="606">I got instructions, to consider it a very high priority. </sentence><sentence id="607">Q. When you met with Mr. Eden and some of these other ministers, did you, what kind of response did you get from them? </sentence><sentence id="608">A. Well, it was friendly. </sentence><sentence id="609">There was interest because it was an unusual thing to have an emissary from occupied country. </sentence><sentence id="610">And at the same time the attitude, "Well, what can we do for you? </sentence><sentence id="611">Do you want us to make a war with Russia to defend Poland? </sentence><sentence id="612">What can we, how can we help you?" </sentence><sentence id="613">I was right in the middle of the game between, between Joseph Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt with Poland in the middle and I was trying to use this influence. </sentence><sentence id="614">I also was telling everybody I could about the genocide, about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="615">I met with disbelief with, when I talked to the Jews from joint organization with some rabbi from York. </sentence><sentence id="616"> 8 I was in the presence of Ignace Schwartzbart (?) </sentence><sentence id="617">who was a Polish zionist an important political figure. </sentence><sentence id="618">I sensed that they don't believe me and only one high level British intellengence officer was really moved by my story about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="619">And he told me, in the same, I was told the same story by Ignace Schwartzbart (?). </sentence><sentence id="620">Don't tell people that two and half million Jews were killed. </sentence><sentence id="621">Nobody is going to believe you. </sentence><sentence id="622">It's something beyond imagination. </sentence><sentence id="623">They will say you exaggerate. </sentence><sentence id="624">Tell individual stories. </sentence><sentence id="625">Tell what you saw. </sentence><sentence id="626">Use examples but don't use statistics because you will, they will not believe you. </sentence><sentence id="627">And I was trying to use it, but when I and my wife, after the war in "76, when I was writing my war memoirs, we both went to London, to the archives, to Her Majesty's records office. </sentence><sentence id="628">Plenty of documents were already declassified and I found a lot of documents concerning myself. </sentence><sentence id="629">The report that Antony Eden wrote after meeting me addressed to Churchill. </sentence><sentence id="630">In all this reports, nothing about what I said about the Jews, at not one word I spoke to the intelligence officers. </sentence><sentence id="631">I spoke to the, to Eden, to others. </sentence><sentence id="632">In all their reporting any reference to the Jews were not repeated. </sentence><sentence id="633">Then I was interested to find if the same story was with Jan Karski (?), </sentence><sentence id="634">who was one year before me. </sentence><sentence id="635">And I found a report of Antony Eden on his conversation with Karski in the documents of the British war cabinet. </sentence><sentence id="636">It was printed and distributed. </sentence><sentence id="637">Not one word about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="638">So, I sent it to Karski and he wrote me back, saying, "Look, I mean, I told Eden, when I was describing the situation in Poland, I told about what's going on with the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="639">Not one word. </sentence><sentence id="640">Not one word, and the main reason I think, you know, you had to differentiate between two categories of people. </sentence><sentence id="641">There are people who simply didn't believe because this was something beyond their imagination. </sentence><sentence id="642">And there were Jews, Jews from United States I talked to and British Jews who simply didn't believe. </sentence><sentence id="643">They didn't believe that there is a possibility of mass killing in a sort of conveyor belt method, you know, like in a factory, or in a butchery. </sentence><sentence id="644">You just mechanically kill people one after the other. </sentence><sentence id="645">They didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="646">And they, they were suspecting me of some kind of ulterior motive. </sentence><sentence id="647">They said, "Why a Pole should exaggerate?Well, because he's anti-German and he would like to have as harsh terms imposed on the Germans after that defeat as possible. </sentence><sentence id="648">That's why he's exaggerating." </sentence><sentence id="649">And they were, but, as far as such people as Eden is concerned or members of the cabinet, they were very well informed because after, discovered it after the war, that for instance, a very high level Nazi official, whose name is known, was passing to a Polish intelligence officer in Berne, in Switzerland, information about the plans of final solution well before it was they started to implement it. </sentence><sentence id="650">And I know that this report was passed on to British and to Americans. </sentence><sentence id="651">They knew but they didn't -- they were afraid that if this would become known publicly it would generate the pressure from the Jewish communities and general public for some kind of action that would divert limited military resources from the military targets to the targets that are in their view irrelevant from the military point of view, and that may prolong the war. </sentence><sentence id="652">I don't remember if it was Eden or Beven. </sentence><sentence id="653">Bevine (?), </sentence><sentence id="654">rather, Annis Bevine who said, "Well the only way we can really save the Jews is to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="655">And the more we can focus on military targets, strategic military, the better to the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="656">I think they refused to bomb the railway track to Auschwitz because they believed that they would be repaired in a matter of days or hours, but the planes  9 may be lost. </sentence><sentence id="657">The planes which could be used to bomb the important target in Germany would be diverted from the target. </sentence><sentence id="658">And they were wrong because the greatest tragedy of Jews was not just their deaths. </sentence><sentence id="659">Indifference of the world. </sentence><sentence id="660">That absolut--They were absolutely lonely in the face of their death. </sentence><sentence id="661">It was in the, they realized the world doesn't care about them. </sentence><sentence id="662">That's what killed them, about the dimension of the crime, we are lonely, you see, and this was, in my view, it was a crime, really, not to do something. </sentence><sentence id="663">The kind of a moral relief that we tried to do something to save you, you know. </sentence><sentence id="664">Q. What was your impression of Eden and Churchill? </sentence><sentence id="665">A. Well, Churchill was not very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="666">It was, really, I had only ten minutes and I was so intimidated by his appearance and some kind of, you know, impression. " </sentence><sentence id="667">Well why really this young man is taking my time?" </sentence><sentence id="668">This kind of thing, that I lost my self, I was not good, my performance was not good because I was so nervous that I didn't perform well with Churchill. </sentence><sentence id="669">But with Eden I was pretty lucid and, as I say, he was very, very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="670">When I showed him the photographs of Warsaw with the, some underground inscriptions of the war on the walls and all that, he said to himself, "Poor Warsaw," and all that, but there was the attitude well, we cannot do anything for you. </sentence><sentence id="671">I mean, you have to accommodate yourself with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="672">You know, we cannot save you. </sentence><sentence id="673">We cannot save Poland. </sentence><sentence id="674">You have to make your war effort to contribute and to try to find some kind of compromise with Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="675">That was the message basically. </sentence><sentence id="676">Q. Discouraging? </sentence><sentence id="677">A. Discouraging! </sentence><sentence id="678">It was the worst time of my entire life. </sentence><sentence id="679">Appeasement, total appeasement. </sentence><sentence id="680">Q. When you returned to Warsaw, was right before the uprising, the Polish uprising, what were you doing during the uprising? </sentence><sentence id="681">A. I was in charge of the insurgent radio station called , Lightening, which was broadcasting literally from the front line because we were trying to be as close to the Germans as possible because then they couldn't bomb us from fear they would hid their own soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="682">And we were broadcasting. </sentence><sentence id="683">I was in charge of broadcasting in English. </sentence><sentence id="684">My own English was not good enough at that time and I had a man who was bilingual. </sentence><sentence id="685">He was half British, half Polish. </sentence><sentence id="686">I wrote. </sentence><sentence id="687">He would translate it and he was the announcer. </sentence><sentence id="688">And we knew we were monitored by extremely sophisticated equipment in Cavicham (?) </sentence><sentence id="689">in London and monitoring bulletins would land on the desk of all high level people, decision making people, editorial offices. </sentence><sentence id="690">So it was an effort worthwhile. </sentence><sentence id="691">Even now the old quote that we're saying, would get through in German or that, is still there on the record. </sentence><sentence id="692">Q. During the uprising, did the home army have the support of or instructions from London? </sentence><sentence id="693"> 0 A. No, we had, we had some parachute, you know, some weapons and ammunition and food parachuted. </sentence><sentence id="694">It was not enough but even without this kind of help the uprising would not last 63 days. </sentence><sentence id="695">Then we had one at the very end when the uprising was in it's agony on the 18th of September there was a mass daylight raid by American so called fortresses so that the sky was covered by American planes and they dropped thousands of parachutes with weapons, ammunition and food. </sentence><sentence id="696">But this were the last days of the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="697">We were holding the very small parts of the city so most of it went into the Germans hands because they couldn't hit the small areas we were still holding. </sentence><sentence id="698">Q. Was there Russian support during the uprising? </sentence><sentence id="699">A. Only appearances of it. </sentence><sentence id="700">No, they wanted us. </sentence><sentence id="701">They wanted Germans to finish us. </sentence><sentence id="702">They, I could see them with my eyes, I mean, on the other side of the river, cities separated by, you know, the, divided by the River Vistula. </sentence><sentence id="703">They were on the other side waiting until Hitler finished us. </sentence><sentence id="704">Q. Was London supportive of what you were doing at this point? </sentence><sentence id="705">A. Who? </sentence><sentence id="706">Q. Your London government? </sentence><sentence id="707">A. Of course, I mean, they, they were supporting, but they were helpless, I mean it was a government in exile. </sentence><sentence id="708">All they could do was to beg British to, and Americans, to give us, send us ammunition, weapons, food, medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="709">Q. How organized was the uprising? </sentence><sentence id="710">A. It was well organized. </sentence><sentence id="711">It was, otherwise we would not hold for 63 days. </sentence><sentence id="712">Again, it was a kind of, of liberated city, really, with its own life but communication was very well organized. </sentence><sentence id="713">They were, for instance, we were using sewers because the areas of the city were isolated and communication between the areas we were holding were mostly through the sewers. </sentence><sentence id="714">Q. What kind of messages were you sending to London? </sentence><sentence id="715">A. Well, information about the fighting, about our needs. </sentence><sentence id="716">This was our daily reports of what's, what was going on in the city. </sentence><sentence id="717">Q. Were you in your radio tower when the under, under whatever it is, started? </sentence><sentence id="718">A. No, the studio was, was on the very, either in the underground, in the cellars or on the first floor. </sentence><sentence id="719">We moved from place to place. </sentence><sentence id="720">We couldn't be in the same place all the time. </sentence><sentence id="721">The normal transmitter was outside. </sentence><sentence id="722">Q. But you weren't really in the streets when all of this activity--- A. Well, we had to move through the streets. </sentence><sentence id="723">Q. What was happening? </sentence><sentence id="724">A. We were under the bombs, under, under fire all the time. </sentence><sentence id="725">We had a kind of tunnels or we were... To avoid the streets which were under fire, there were corridors, I mean the walls were, you know, so that you travel from cellars to cellars under the houses to avoid the streets. </sentence><sentence id="726">It's the whole underground labrynth of, of, of communication. </sentence><sentence id="727">Q. Did everything happen in a synchronized fashion? </sentence><sentence id="728">Did all of a sudden one day at an appointed hour the city --  1 A. Well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="729">This was 5 p.m. August 1. </sentence><sentence id="730">There was so called zero hour when it started. </sentence><sentence id="731">We have 13 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="732">I don't think I really told you all about the Jewish aspect because you are mainly interested in non-Jewish aspects, but this is the Holocaust Museum. </sentence><sentence id="733">Q. Well, what else... A. Well, what kinds of--it depends on you, what questions. </sentence><sentence id="734">Q. Ihave asked you a number of questions and I think you have talked about your relationship with Jewish people, your mission to go tell London about what was happening to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="735">If there are areas that you feel I haven't asked you about, because I, maybe I don't even know, to please-- A. Only my personal experiences which I describe in my book for instance when I was going to, to -- it was the time of the agony of ghetto when really I mean people were starving. </sentence><sentence id="736">And although it meant a sentence of death for any Jew to go outside of ghetto because he would he would killed on the spot by any German patron. </sentence><sentence id="737">People were made so desperate by starvation that they would take any risk to go outside through their own means and ways to beg for food or for money, buy food and I, this is, this is something that I will never forget in my life. </sentence><sentence id="738">When I was going to a town hall and to do some business there and this was probably the spring of "43 or maybe earlier. </sentence><sentence id="739">Earlier. </sentence><sentence id="740">And I saw a young Jew who was sitting on the pavement with his back on the wall and his head was just on, like this, you know, and there was a cap on the pavement full of money. </sentence><sentence id="741">People were dropping, you know, some notes and some money. </sentence><sentence id="742">He was just sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="743">So I came to him and said to him, "Look, I mean, if you will sit here, the first German patron will kill you. </sentence><sentence id="744">Take your money, buy your bread and disappear." </sentence><sentence id="745">And I remember he just raised his head and very, looked at me very intensely and he was really a living skeleton but had beautiful black eyes. </sentence><sentence id="746">The boy was no more than 16 maybe 17 and I saw that he wants to tell me something. </sentence><sentence id="747">He couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="748">So I said to him, "Look, I mean, I have to leave but I'll be back. </sentence><sentence id="749">Go to this church." </sentence><sentence id="750">There was a church nearby. " </sentence><sentence id="751">Go inside and wait for me I'll be back." </sentence><sentence id="752">And I left him. </sentence><sentence id="753">Twenty minutes later I left the office where I had some business and I saw a small crowd around this place, so I came there and the boy was still there with his head like this, you know, sitting in the same position but he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="754">He had no force, you know, to really stood, go, buy something and escape. </sentence><sentence id="755">He didn't want to tell me probably, "I wish I could follow your advice but [have no strength to go." </sentence><sentence id="756">So, I will remember it always this intense looking and this black eyes, you know, of the young fellow who just wanted to tell me something and he couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="757">And also, I remember and I described it, when I went to a court and this was some problem. </sentence><sentence id="758">In my civil life I was manager of a house and collector of rent, and I had some question I had to go to court. </sentence><sentence id="759">Now, the building of the courts, some windows were to the Aryan side, to the Christian side, the other to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="760">And this was probably the beginning of "43 when there were only 70,000 Jews left in the Jewish district. </sentence><sentence id="761"> 2 On that day the Germans started to get into transports to the death camps. </sentence><sentence id="762">And I was in the court room. </sentence><sentence id="763">There was some trivial case of, against somebody who was probably was, you know, was, stole a sack with wheat or something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="764">Trivial. </sentence><sentence id="765">No problem. </sentence><sentence id="766">Outside on the street, there was this terrible drama of Jews who were herded that and they were running towards this, you know, place where they were boarded on the train. </sentence><sentence id="767">There were children. </sentence><sentence id="768">There were women. </sentence><sentence id="769">There were men. </sentence><sentence id="770">I remember the, the, somebody was pushing a cart with the sick Jews who were, you know, limping, they were, you know, almost dying people and these Germans were drunk with their, you know, whips beating these people and pushing them, "schnell, schnell, schnell, quicker, quicker, quicker," and all that. </sentence><sentence id="771">There was some lady who was well dressed and she was holding money in her hands and had a child, a small child and she probably wanted to bribe her way out. </sentence><sentence id="772">So she stretched this money towards the gestapo man and he just beat her with his whip so that she lost balance and the child was dropped on the pavement. </sentence><sentence id="773">And there was an old Jewish woman who was so desperate that she stretched her hands toward the sky and said, "Hitler that the grass should" -- how did she say this -- "that the grass should cover your house," or something of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="774">I was told later this was kind of an old Jewish saying and I didn't want to see what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="775">I knew that she would be shot or killed in some way so I turned from the window. </sentence><sentence id="776">There was a silence in the court room. </sentence><sentence id="777">The judge was speechless. </sentence><sentence id="778">He was just, couldn't concentrate because of these terrible shouts from outside and all that. </sentence><sentence id="779">I remember that years later I was stationed in Munich as director of the Polish service of radio free Europe and my wife and I went to Berchtesgaden and looked at the house of Hitler which was blown up by Americans and believe it or not there was in these ruins there was bathroom, you know, and grass was everywhere between the, this, you know, how you call it, bricks and everywhere was grass. </sentence><sentence id="780">So this terrible shout of grass cover your house became true. </sentence><sentence id="781">Q. Anything else you want to say? </sentence><sentence id="782">A. Well, that's more or less all, more or less all. </sentence><sentence id="783">It was an unspeakable misery of human beings, and I didn't care whether they were Poles, Jews or Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="784">It was unspeakable tragedy and no words can really convey. </sentence><sentence id="785">The people who were condemned to death only for one crime, they were alive, and total destruction of people of their race, their religion, their heritage, and above all this process of wives who were losing first their husband then their children and in the end they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="786">This was unspeakable tragedy with no precedent. </sentence><sentence id="787">I mean Poles suffered. </sentence><sentence id="788">There were martyrs. </sentence><sentence id="789">I mean, there was not one single Polish family without some victims, but a Pole had a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="790">Jews had no hope, no chance. </sentence><sentence id="791">I mean it was a miracle if you would survive. </sentence><sentence id="792">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="793">Q. Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="794">A. That's all. </sentence><sentence id="795">End of Interview. </sentence><sentence id="796"> </sentence></p></dialogue>
