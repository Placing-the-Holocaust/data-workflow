<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: What other -- what other sort of official actions were taken that affected the Jewish community under Romania at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="247">The idea of using the synagogue shorter and living in this town, which was -- had quite a Jewish population, the idea was that we had to obey these laws. </sentence><sentence id="248">And we knew very well that if we don't obey it will be something bad. </sentence><sentence id="249">But we knew it that they who didn't obey these laws, they have also 25. </sentence><sentence id="250">It was called . </sentence><sentence id="251">Those that they changed, it means 25. </sentence><sentence id="252">And this you will suffer yourself. </sentence><sentence id="253">And they, especially the Jews, didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="254">But not many got beaten 25 times on their behind. </sentence><sentence id="255">So it was an example for the whole population. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Why did they moderate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Why? </sentence><sentence id="289">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="290">Life became, all of the sudden, easier for the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: They were friends which were not Jewish and which I appreciate very much because they like to play soccer with me, because I was a very good goalkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="311">And therefore, I became their equal. </sentence><sentence id="312">They even didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="313">The younger boys didn't know what to do with anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="314">They were told, "Hate the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="315">So they thought, "Yes, I hate the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="316">But that was all that they did. </sentence><sentence id="317">But there were no beating up Jews, boys to boys, because we were on the same team, the football team. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: So, who were the kids that -- that made anti-Jewish comments to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Anti-Jewish comments were very few. </sentence><sentence id="329">There were the Romanian that choose to shit in your hat and tell the mother this is good. </sentence><sentence id="330">They made a rhyme and had it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: So is there anything else that you can think of that really changed when Romania took over, for you and your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="343">It was very clear it had to do with our so-called profession; watchmaker. </sentence><sentence id="344">One bought the watch and said, "I don't know what to do, my watch goes and all of the sudden doesn't go. </sentence><sentence id="345">Then I shake it, it goes. </sentence><sentence id="346">Then I don't shake it, it doesn't go. </sentence><sentence id="347">So I have to shake it all the time and I cannot go shaking my watch all over the time. </sentence><sentence id="348">So therefore, it's a dirty Jew sold me this watch and he knew it wasn't good." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: Were there any other laws that pertained? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: I went to Austria and I studied music. </sentence><sentence id="413">And I got it right away. </sentence><sentence id="414">And I was accepted right away because I was a good violin player. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="426">Q: So you studied throughout school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: All of the time. </sentence><sentence id="429">Because the school system there is from 8 to 12. </sentence><sentence id="430">And 8 to 12 you learn the violin. </sentence><sentence id="431">After 12 you go home and you have the lesson. </sentence><sentence id="432">And -- and this was very pleasant because it's only four hours. </sentence><sentence id="433">So it was all right. </sentence><sentence id="434">Sure you learned other disciplines like arithmetic and what you have to learn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="442">Q: You were taking the violin in addition to your -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: Oh, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: This experience starts, . " </sentence><sentence id="751">My German brothers, I'm here only to help you to be alive. </sentence><sentence id="752">Because this misery of those infiltrated sickness, which I mean the Jewish sickness, this we cannot take very long. </sentence><sentence id="753">Because if you don't fight it, then it is our end. </sentence><sentence id="754">So we have to stand up and fight against them." </sentence><sentence id="755">And the people yell, "Bravo, hooray." </sentence><sentence id="756">And so what did he say? </sentence><sentence id="757">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="758">Yeah, but see we don't agree or we don't realize that this is nothing. </sentence><sentence id="759">For us this is the biggest and the loudest. </sentence><sentence id="760">And then all of the sudden he cries. </sentence><sentence id="761">I saw my dear mother going to the food market and she wanted to buy a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="762">And they say, "I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="763">We don't have any more bread. </sentence><sentence id="764">And this poor woman stood there and we didn't have anymore bread. </sentence><sentence id="765">And I thought it's very sad to realize how the people had to take it without any -- how do you call it -- they didn't have any anything putting against it, which is so easy and very bad. </sentence><sentence id="766">They heard all these things and Hitler speaks again. </sentence><sentence id="767">So all of the sudden, they tell us that he's attacked by Poland. " </sentence><sentence id="768">Oh, they attacked." </sentence><sentence id="769">And all of the sudden you can see soldiers in German uniform lying dead. </sentence><sentence id="770">And people who look closer saw the image of the concentration camp, Jews dressed in uniform. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="796">Q: I'm getting confused. </sentence><sentence id="797">Where are we now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="800">A: We are in Gleiwitz, where they started the war. </sentence><sentence id="801">And they said, "German soldiers were killed by Polish soldiers and look what happened." </sentence><sentence id="802">And there was not true, not a word. </sentence><sentence id="803">So here the war started. </sentence><sentence id="804">But it is very interesting that we here in America don't talk very much about this, possibly not. </sentence><sentence id="805">Because this is not a story I tell you, this is printed in the papers and you can read it. </sentence><sentence id="806">But then the other thing, which was really tragic, here comes Hitler to Stalin and said, "Stalin, we have to be friends." </sentence><sentence id="807">And Stalin said, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="808">I'm the biggest fascist and you're the biggest communist. </sentence><sentence id="809">How can we be friends?" " </sentence><sentence id="810">Look, I have to start the war against Poland and if you don't help me as a good friend, then the whole thing is for not." </sentence><sentence id="811">So they became good friends and Stalin helped Hitler two full years. </sentence><sentence id="812">Send him armorment, send him food. </sentence><sentence id="813">And so Hitler could take all the countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia -- which he took before, but never mind. </sentence><sentence id="814">In the war he took them now. </sentence><sentence id="815">And then he could take France and Belgium and all these countries. </sentence><sentence id="816">And Stalin send him armorment and food and so on because the agreement was signed on the 23rd of August 1939. </sentence><sentence id="817">And the 1st of September 1939, the war started. </sentence><sentence id="818">Who started the war? </sentence><sentence id="819">Stalin started the war. </sentence><sentence id="820">People here said Hitler started the war. </sentence><sentence id="821">This is stupidity because they don't want to read in the library, the agreement between Stalin and Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="822">Exactly eight days after they signed the contract. </sentence><sentence id="823">a bargain between the two foreign ministers. </sentence><sentence id="824">Eight days afterwards, the war started. </sentence><sentence id="825">So now who started the war? </sentence><sentence id="826">Stalin because he said, "Okay, yeah, my friend. </sentence><sentence id="827">Now we  have to be friendly." </sentence><sentence id="828">And the railroad line that we went on the Russia now, going through was Chernivtsi was blocked. </sentence><sentence id="829">It couldn't be used anymore because it was only for armorment for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="830">No passenger, no freight trains, nothing went, only this for armorment for Russia -- for Germany -- Russia send it to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="831">Now what -- why are we today still afraid? </sentence><sentence id="832">But it's not a story I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="833">It's a story you can read in the library. </sentence><sentence id="834">And so therefore, I hope that people will get their mind straight and see the broader history is here. </sentence><sentence id="835">Otherwise, they are afraid to do anything and this is false. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="872">Q: Let's talk a little bit about Chernivtsi. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="874">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="876">Q: What the city was it like, what was happening about that time in 1938? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="878">A: In 1938, Chernivtsi had the biggest, greatest German alters. </sentence><sentence id="879">They were all Jews. </sentence><sentence id="880">And the alters were and then -- I forget seven or more -- and they are painted in Germany and in German. </sentence><sentence id="881">And he's the greatest German author. </sentence><sentence id="882">He's a Jew from Chernivtsi. </sentence><sentence id="883">So the life of an intellectual life, you cannot suppress. </sentence><sentence id="884">It went on all the time. </sentence><sentence id="885">The was just like Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="886">The trumpets were on all of the time. </sentence><sentence id="887">I played very often there. </sentence><sentence id="888">And we were very happy there we could do this. </sentence><sentence id="889">What would happen to this -- also it was on the Russia. </sentence><sentence id="890">But here in a short time, the Russia suppressed the German activity. </sentence><sentence id="891">I mean, the Germans literary activity and it sank down a little. </sentence><sentence id="892">But they say if you want to hear on the handgushes (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="893">it means the hand street, you call a doctor and the whole street turns around, because everybody has a Ph. </sentence><sentence id="894">D. that agrees there. </sentence><sentence id="895">And then all turn around. </sentence><sentence id="896">So this is Chernivtsi on the highest intellectual level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="916">Q: Now, Chernivtsi was in Romania until 1940? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: Yeah, it went on and on but not very strong. </sentence><sentence id="927">But then all of the sudden the Dean at the University comes in and says, "Ladies and gentlemen, we are now awaiting our leader. </sentence><sentence id="928">We are liberated." </sentence><sentence id="929">And I thought, by the way, one more liberation and I wouldn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="930">And now we are liberated by Joseph Stalin (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="931">And he is the greatest humane person. </sentence><sentence id="932">And we have to realize because we are now really liberated. </sentence><sentence id="933">So we were liberated from our possessions, taken to Siberia and so -- now, this Russia has a funny habit. </sentence><sentence id="934">They have great alters. </sentence><sentence id="935">And if you can show me a book, which was printed before the colonies were there, and this book should not mention at least once the word "Siberia," I put down any price you want. </sentence><sentence id="936">Because Siberia is part of the pulsation of Russia. </sentence><sentence id="937">And what is Siberia? </sentence><sentence id="938">A lady said here, "I know Siberia is cold. </sentence><sentence id="939">But what else do they have?" </sentence><sentence id="940">No idea, a bunk (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="941">And Siberia is a very important basis of life in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="942">And so this Siberia goes on, even day and any day. </sentence><sentence id="943">So what can we say? </sentence><sentence id="944">This is very tragic. </sentence><sentence id="945">And  it's very tragic for 72 years, people believed the biggest bunk was their thought. </sentence><sentence id="946">And this is Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="947">And that you cannot hear what happens in a foreign country, there is a lot closed-up, that when they moved into Chernivtsi, the first question was, "Do you have relatives in a foreign country?" </sentence><sentence id="948">God forbid, say no. </sentence><sentence id="949">Because if you say yes, then you're a passenger for Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="950">And just what they did. </sentence><sentence id="951">So all of the sudden, my mother-in-law, a lady who never could miss opening of opera in Vienna or an exhibition in Paris, didn't have any idea of politic. </sentence><sentence id="952">What is politician?Didn't even know that we are in Romania, that we are in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="953">And she is taken for 17 years to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="954">Why? </sentence><sentence id="955">Because her husband was taken before, some half a year. </sentence><sentence id="956">And she was deported with her mother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="957">Her mother-in-law died in the transport. </sentence><sentence id="958">But she was not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="959">There were 39,000 people say. </sentence><sentence id="960">And these were not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="961">These were mostly Jews, but they are not. </sentence><sentence id="962">So therefore, we should be clear that all this is very clear in the mind of the life. </sentence><sentence id="963">And they're used to such a life. </sentence><sentence id="964">To put people in wagons, kettle cars, and take. </sentence><sentence id="965">And you don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="966">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1009">Q: What other changes happened when the Soviets occupied Chernivtsi? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1011">A: Oh, the changes which happened there, they were not visible because the people were not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1012">There were all nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="1013">But this was very sad that all of the sudden it became so people were taken away at night. </sentence><sentence id="1014">You never saw them. </sentence><sentence id="1015">When I came here, some people asked me, "What's the difference between the Germans and the Russians?" </sentence><sentence id="1016">I said, "The Germans arrest during the morning and the Russians during the late night, late evening." </sentence><sentence id="1017">And this was the whole difference. </sentence><sentence id="1018">You never know why, what. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And it was wonderful organized. </sentence><sentence id="1020">In Russia, when you take a person, arrest him, and you lead him, you also go with a loaded gun behind the person. </sentence><sentence id="1021">This is only in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1022">In Germany, there are -- I don't know -- the man -- how do you say this? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1041">Q: Were the Russians tougher on the Jews than the Romanians have been -- or the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1043">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1044">The Romanians were not tough on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1045">I cannot say it. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Not just because they are Jewish, but the Russians? </sentence><sentence id="1047">Oh, yeah, . </sentence><sentence id="1048">That means "dirty Jews." . </sentence><sentence id="1049">No. </sentence><sentence id="1050">But they deported a whole village. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1051">And so those peasants from the village, they were very smart. </sentence><sentence id="1052">They took cats in sacks and moved there with the cats. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And when the Russians come through the woods to chase them, they let the cats run and the cats climb the trees and the dog barked after cats. </sentence><sentence id="1054">So here we are quiet all of the sudden and our village went through because Russia was colorless and the Romania was a beautiful country with beautiful country with people. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And they are the fields you see when you fly, small fields, all color and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1056">But they were very proud to have this. </sentence><sentence id="1057">It was -- it was a nice thing. </sentence><sentence id="1058">That, "This is my field. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I do whatever I want. </sentence><sentence id="1060">I plant whatever I want, but I plant and I love it." </sentence><sentence id="1061">So what comes out here is instead is the misery that everyone buys his own field and is himself a big landowner. </sentence><sentence id="1062">It's a little landowner but never mind. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And therefore, he thinks to himself, he's a big planter. " </sentence><sentence id="1064">It's my land." </sentence><sentence id="1065">And I -- every summer I took my -- what are they -- hiking shoes, and I went to the mountains, always. </sentence><sentence id="1066">We stayed there a hay loft of a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="1067">They let us stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1068">It was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And they for dinner, all ate together and it was beautiful. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1070">Q: Now, so you're still at the conservatory and playing? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1071">A: That's right, in Vienna. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1515">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1517">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1518">The whole time was very crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1519">It was -- we knew of people get married for a pound of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="1520">People get married for a pair of shoes, a pair of soles, for fixing my shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And so people get married for getting married. </sentence><sentence id="1522">No reason. </sentence><sentence id="1523">So therefore, don't think for a minute there's a reason, if anybody can tell you why. </sentence><sentence id="1524">Philosophically, can you talk around it as much as you want, but in  reality, you cannot explain it. </sentence><sentence id="1525">So therefore, it is has nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1526">We just got married and now we sit here and wherever we go. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And nobody sit down next to you. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Everybody says, "No, no, where we go? </sentence><sentence id="1529">What is this." </sentence><sentence id="1530">And we did -- the most thing was that we were so mentally derooted here and there.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1565">Q: Tell me a little bit about what was happening in the town? </sentence><sentence id="1566">You didn't go on the first deportation, did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
