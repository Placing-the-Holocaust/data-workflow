<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz. </sentence><sentence id="36">I was named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka who was also born in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="37">And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon (ph). </sentence><sentence id="38">My family use to call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yum-fa-yetska (ph), a name which I like to be called. </sentence><sentence id="39">I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating . </sentence><sentence id="40">I was the oldest of three siblings. </sentence><sentence id="41">I was born in a small town, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland, located about 90 kilometers north of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="42">At the time when the Nazis came in, I was 13 years old and the population of our hometown, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland was about 15,000. </sentence><sentence id="43">A little less than half of that was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="44">My family consisted at that time of my parents, Hymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal widowed grandmother, . </sentence><sentence id="45">My ancestors on my mother's side came to Poland from Germany around the 16" century. </sentence><sentence id="46">Four generations were still alive and each one had a lot of children because they came from an orthodox background. </sentence><sentence id="47">So my grandmother was one of seven siblings. </sentence><sentence id="48">My mother was one of seven siblings. </sentence><sentence id="49">My Aunt who lived also in Chair-han-off (ph) had also seven children. </sentence><sentence id="50">My other Uncle had three children. </sentence><sentence id="51">They all had, the younger ones had less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children. </sentence><sentence id="52">So we had a very large family. </sentence><sentence id="53">I feel that both my parents and my grandmother were my first teachers and my first role models. </sentence><sentence id="54">I remember when I was a little girl, my grandmother used, who was an extremely religious woman, observant woman, at home we only spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="55">We observed the Jewish laws, customs and traditions. </sentence><sentence id="56">And my grandmother was wearing a shaytle (ph), in Yiddish its called, and it's called a wig in English, but not to beautify herself but for religious purposes. </sentence><sentence id="57">For my grandmother religion was not just a belief, it was a way of life which effected the way she behaved, the way she dressed, the way she taught us. </sentence><sentence id="58">And I remember that every morning when I would get up my grandmother would say with me the prayers and in the evening she would say with me the prayers. </sentence><sentence id="59">She used to give me coins to put in the push-ka (ph), which is called her charity box, and she would tell me, "Yit-cola (ph), to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our mitzvah (ph), our commandment." </sentence><sentence id="60">I remember one time I was still a preschooler, didn't know one coin from another, and a poor man came to our door and asked my grandmother for alms. </sentence><sentence id="61">And my grandmother gave me some change, some coins, I had no idea the value of it but I looked in my hand and I said, "Grandma, so much money?" </sentence><sentence id="62">And my grandmother said, "My child, you only have what you give away." </sentence><sentence id="63">I questioned my grandmother's proverb because I couldn't understand it, being so little, how can you give away something and still have it? </sentence><sentence id="64">So my grandma began with a smile and says, "Yit-cola (ph), I only give what God and my parents have given me. </sentence><sentence id="65">I'm not giving mine." </sentence><sentence id="66">This is how she felt. </sentence><sentence id="67">And she taught me lots of Yiddish songs, told me lots of stories. </sentence><sentence id="68">I came from a family of story-tellers. </sentence><sentence id="69">And since, at that time, technology was not developed so much so, and my grandmother had lots of children. </sentence><sentence id="70">In fact, when Germany invaded Poland, my grandmother had five married children, 21 great-children and one great-grandchild. </sentence><sentence id="71">Only one granddaughter, which I'm going to speak about a little later, her name was also Yit-cola (ph). </sentence><sentence id="72">I was eight years old when she emigrated to Palestine in 1934, to get married with somebody who was, without her boyfriend, that she met also in Poland, Check-han-off (ph), who was from the same city, the same, and he left a little earlier, so she went there to marry him. </sentence><sentence id="73">And I remember that the whole family was gathered and everybody was crying and saying, "God knows if we will see each other    again." </sentence><sentence id="74">And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), , don't cry. </sentence><sentence id="75">With God all things are possible." </sentence><sentence id="76">I always admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One. </sentence><sentence id="77">She lost a brother, she lost her husband, she lost two of her children, that was before the Holocaust, and she lost a granddaughter. </sentence><sentence id="78">But she never lost her unshakable faith in God. </sentence><sentence id="79">And she always believed and she never questioned. </sentence><sentence id="80">And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the kinder she was, so she was a wonderful role model for me. </sentence><sentence id="81">And she lived with us from the day I was born. </sentence><sentence id="82">And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to die a natural death shortly after Germany invaded Poland. </sentence><sentence id="83">From early childhood on my parents and grandmother stressed to us children the meaning and importance of , which in English means humanness. </sentence><sentence id="84">Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardstick of , they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's wrong, and usually they would say, "Yit-cola (ph), its not -" Luse to cringe when they said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself through that yardstick. </sentence><sentence id="85">You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve?But they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me. </sentence><sentence id="86">And I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift. </sentence><sentence id="87">But they were strict with me. </sentence><sentence id="88">When I was already a school girl, I remember in Poland was very cold winters and some of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even remember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like you know and the kids didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="89">So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to wear knee socks too. </sentence><sentence id="90">So I remember that I asked my parents, can I put on the knee socks? </sentence><sentence id="91">And they said, "Yit-cola (ph), its too cold". </sentence><sentence id="92">And I was naughty and I figured I'm not going to start to convince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, , so what did I do? </sentence><sentence id="93">I went in and I put the knee socks underneath my stockings and I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="94">My father often used to come to the school yard because he had actually two kinds of, first we were in the dairy business, like wholesale dairy business, but he was with a partner and obviously I don't know why, whether they, like the partnership dissolved, and then he started to work in photography and picture framing. </sentence><sentence id="95">So he used to travel sometimes and whenever he would come home, or before he left, if I wasn't home, the school wasn't far to drop in and sometimes even bring me some goodies or something, just to see me. </sentence><sentence id="96">So that particular morning, I went to school and it was recess and some of the kids started to say, "Yit-cola (ph), your father is here." </sentence><sentence id="97">And I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="98">I was wearing the knee socks. </sentence><sentence id="99">And my father looked at me, and I'll never forget for as long as I live, that look, and he said, "Yit-cola (ph), I feel very and disappointed in you. </sentence><sentence id="100">Because everybody can make a mistake, but when a person lies, he deliberately deceives you and this is not and I'm very disappointed." </sentence><sentence id="101">And I felt so terrible and I started to cry and ask forgiveness, so he fixed me up and said, I was still not so old yet, and he said to me, I'll never forget it, "Yit-cola (ph), everybody makes a mistake but only a fool makes twice the same. </sentence><sentence id="102">And in everything there is a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="103">So I hope that you have learned, that you cannot lie without becoming a liar and helping other people." </sentence><sentence id="104">The reason I am sharing this story is because I found out later when the Nazis came in, when everything was deception, how important it is to speak the truth and not to lie, and you know how justice is important. </sentence><sentence id="105">I remember one time I was walking home from school alone and a bunch of kids that I didn't know, and who did not know me, attacked me both verbally and physically. </sentence><sentence id="106">I tried to free myself but the circle closed around me and I felt punches coming all over. </sentence><sentence id="107">And I couldn't, it was both the physical pain and the emotional because that was my first encounter with an incident like this here, with anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="108">And I couldn't understand why. </sentence><sentence id="109">Why are they so angry with me? </sentence><sentence id="110">Why do they hate me so much? </sentence><sentence id="111">I was too young to understand it and I came home crying bitterly. </sentence><sentence id="112">Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must have happened, she was home. </sentence><sentence id="113">And she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), what's happened?" </sentence><sentence id="114">You'll see later why those things are important, because of the values. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: So your mother asked you what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: What happened. </sentence><sentence id="202">I related to her the whole story. </sentence><sentence id="203">And she did not say a single word, she just took me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comfort me. </sentence><sentence id="204">After I finally quieted down and stopped crying, she looked at me and she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?" </sentence><sentence id="205">And I was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="206">I said, "Nothing." </sentence><sentence id="207">And my mother looked , She said, "Well my child, then you have nothing to cry about. </sentence><sentence id="208">Your does not depend on how others treat you but on how you treat others." </sentence><sentence id="209">And I remember my family taught me that my does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, which had a tremendous impact on me up to this date. </sentence><sentence id="210">Because they taught me how never to held others, how not to shame or held others because its not . </sentence><sentence id="211">But they never taught me, what should I do when I am held, how should I respond? </sentence><sentence id="212">So what I used to do, I use to cry. </sentence><sentence id="213">Because I knew I cannot held anybody and I cannot, and another thing which they taught me, is that no one can break my spirit as long as I don't do something evil. </sentence><sentence id="214">As long as I don't do something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="215">So they actually very much stressed , Yiddish 3 . </sentence><sentence id="216">Lreceived both, like I said at home we spoke Yiddish but in school we spoke Polish and I had also, I went to Bant-tee-os-kov (ph), which was a Jewish and Hebrew school. </sentence><sentence id="217">My little brother actually started at age three. </sentence><sentence id="218">My parents were both culturally and religiously Jewish but they were not orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="219">But in those days, not orthodox was more than today, just like because we observed all the holidays, we had in our home, and we lived accordingly to the Jewish teachings and customs and traditions. </sentence><sentence id="220">Because my mother was the only one of my grandmother's children who didn't wear a shaytal (ph), who didn't wear a wig, because my mother was a very artistic person. </sentence><sentence id="221">She had a beautiful voice and I remember still how she used to sing to me, teach me Yiddish songs. </sentence><sentence id="222">Because before my mother was married, she belonged to a Jewish drama group and she use to play in the Yiddish Theater. </sentence><sentence id="223">And at that time, the Yiddish Theater used to be the , like a regular theater but they had that in the fire house, you know? </sentence><sentence id="224">Where the firemen lived, so they would allow them there. </sentence><sentence id="225">But after she was married and she had a family she would do it only for charity. </sentence><sentence id="226">So my parents very often used to take me to the theater and my mother belonged to a literary group. </sentence><sentence id="227">She was more, she was very artistic. </sentence><sentence id="228">If she would have had the opportunity then she would have done much more, but unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="229">And I think that she instilled in me a love for literature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, because as I said, my grandmother had lots of grandchildren and children. </sentence><sentence id="230">Except for one son and one cousin, you know the cousin that left in 1934, my cousin Yitle Pash-o-vick (ph), and one of my Uncles who left when he was 18 years old, I never knew him. </sentence><sentence id="231">I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to get from England, London. </sentence><sentence id="232">Because that's where he married and he lived. </sentence><sentence id="233">So the whole family lived in Poland and we used to be a very close-knit family. </sentence><sentence id="234">So we got together and because there was not, as I had mentioned before, technology, so parts of, when we would get together they used to, the family used to sit and tell stories, reminisce, you know? </sentence><sentence id="235">And everybody thought that I don't even pay attention and I was just sitting in a corner and listen and take in all these stories. </sentence><sentence id="236">Another time also that I heard a lot of stories is that in Poland, Chair-han-off (ph), where we lived, there was only one Synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="237">But there was the , like they call it, like the study house and a lot of the boys who came to study there, to the Yit-shiva (ph), some of them were from other cities so they used to be on Friday or on holidays, my father would always bring home, in the Hebrew its called , or guests. </sentence><sentence id="238">And then there would be conversation at the table and they used to ask him questions and he would tell adventures and stories. </sentence><sentence id="239">So it was, and one thing also, that after my mother was married she didn't work so I always had my mother and my grandmother home, which was a great influence. </sentence><sentence id="240">I remember another story which also had a very great influence on me, is that we didn't have running water or electricity in our home. </sentence><sentence id="241">And winter, to heat the house, we cooked on an iron stove, and to heat the house it used to be a tile oven, which reached from the floor, most people in Poland had those, and they used to, they were able to open wells, you put the wood to heat it, to bake potatoes and bake apple in there sometimes, but mostly the winter time this would be the source of heat, that heated the house. </sentence><sentence id="242">So when they came on the holidays and , they would sit around the oven and tell these stories. </sentence><sentence id="243">And so I heard a lot of stories and I knew a lot about Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="244">And I was always, when I started to go to school, one of my worst subjects was history. </sentence><sentence id="245">Because the way it was presented, it was just to me a bunch of dates, long ago, and a lot of places. </sentence><sentence id="246">But it was not presented as relevant to our life and I had no idea before the Holocaust how history effects our lives, because history is made by people and it effects people. </sentence><sentence id="247">And I was a creative child. </sentence><sentence id="248">I loved to sing, I loved to write and to read, I was forever doing this. </sentence><sentence id="249">And I was dreaming that when I, after I finished public school, that I going to continue to have more formal education, that I'm going to become a writer. </sentence><sentence id="250">Even as a young girl I used to write a lot. </sentence><sentence id="251">And I remember my father always was so proud of me, my parents, my grandmother, and my father used to take me a lot with him so when we went someplace he always said, "Yit-cola (ph), recite a poem." </sentence><sentence id="252">And I was blessed until this day to God with a good memory and I've learned the poems and I learned lots of songs, both at home. </sentence><sentence id="253">And another source of, I remember that it's almost funny, that there used to people who would go in the courtyard and sing and play instruments and some had wonderful voices and played well, and people would throw them down money. </sentence><sentence id="254">So I remember once I was going home, it was on a Friday, I was going home from school. </sentence><sentence id="255">And those people played in our yard and I always wanted to learn all the songs, so they sung a new song. </sentence><sentence id="256">I caught most of it but not all the words for the first time, so I figured they probably will not sing it again in the same courtyard so I followed them. </sentence><sentence id="257">And I got so involved that I completely forgot that its Friday and the family is going to be ready, the sha-bot (ph) was observed very strictly. </sentence><sentence id="258">And I remember I came home, the candles were lit already, and my father was sitting because the sha-bot (ph) was very strictly observed, and here I came in and my mother looked at me, and she said, "Yit- cola (ph), quickly. </sentence><sentence id="259">Go in and wash up. </sentence><sentence id="260">Come to sha-bot (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="261">And I was so grateful that she didn't scream at me or anything. </sentence><sentence id="262">And I remember the holidays and sha-bot (ph), but like I mentioned before, I was born during Passover, so Passover was my birthday and we always faithfully, every year, we observed Passover. </sentence><sentence id="263">And it was so different than it is now because every single object of the house was taken out in the courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="264">Dishes were changed. </sentence><sentence id="265">And at that time, I remember, we didn't have regular mattresses like today, we had some burlap sacks and it was with straw, it was put in the, they changed the straw. </sentence><sentence id="266">And paint the house and wash every object. </sentence><sentence id="267">It was more for cleanliness, it was also because of the holiday, so Passover was both a physical and spiritual cleansing and I remember, the reason why I speak about Passover, is because it is very, it is coincidental, because I was born on Passover and I was liberated on Passover, during Passover, the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I was thinking that before, when we sat at the , and we're talking about slavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery, about the plagues, about starvation, I couldn't understand this here. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because up until then, I was never starved. </sentence><sentence id="270">I never had any personal tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="271">My faith in God was not tested, it wasn't a , and I couldn't understand all those things. </sentence><sentence id="272">And I remember, now when I think back, I said, I'm not surprised that people do not understand what we suffered because only somebody who suffered can, maybe they can understand but not the same way. </sentence><sentence id="273">They cannot relate because, to give you an example, if someone, God forbid, has a terrible illness then when he talks with somebody who is healthy at that time, the healthy person could talk about the future and relates different to life, sees life differently, and this is here. </sentence><sentence id="274">So, in my, it never entered my mind that one day I will suffer like this here. </sentence><sentence id="275">That my people will suffer like this here. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I remember also another incident, its like I started to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't have running water and we didn't have electricity in our home, so we... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Let me just ask here, you didn't have these but that was normal? </sentence><sentence id="358">You were fairly middle income? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Yeah, that was not because we were of poverty. </sentence><sentence id="362">This was because in the small 5 nobody in the small had it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="363">So, in fact, when I went now back to Poland, they still have, some people have outhouses and things, you know? </sentence><sentence id="364">But its so much more moder, its more in the larger city. </sentence><sentence id="365">But at that time it was common, you didn't know anything different because I remember, my Aunt lived, my mother's sister, lived in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="366">When my family took me I came home and told all my friends, I was excited, she had a toilet and you pulled the string from the ceiling and I said, "It was like a miracle to me." </sentence><sentence id="367">So it was because this was, I'm describing the world the way I knew it and this all influenced, you know? </sentence><sentence id="368">Because when there was not water in the house, so we had a water carrier who would bring in water. </sentence><sentence id="369">We didn't have like today ready-made foods and, or you could go into the kosher butcher like today and buy a chicken. </sentence><sentence id="370">At that time we used to go to the market which was the market place was the place where Jews and Gentiles had the most relations, was the most involved, because they would bring livestock, chickens, turkey and cows and they would bring vegetable and fruits. </sentence><sentence id="371">The Jewish people would bring what they made, shoes and boots and clothes. </sentence><sentence id="372">So that was the exchange because that was the most time when Jewish people intermingled with the Gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="373">And so those things were, the life was different and it influenced differently also. </sentence><sentence id="374">But going back now to the not having electricity, even though we didn't have electricity we had a light, from a nuft (ph) its called in Polish, petroleum, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="604">Q: Did she impress you at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="606">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="607">She was a very happy person and from what everybody told me a tremendous leader. </sentence><sentence id="608">Very, very much for Israel. </sentence><sentence id="609">She was very much involved in Zionist and she was hoping that, very much involved. </sentence><sentence id="610">You know, the older children, because I was and I think because of my grandmother I didn't, I was more in the religious influence, but I also was lucky because I had all other influence from my parents who took me to the theaters, who took me to Jewish plays and every summer we would go to the country and , cousins, from Warsaw, because I had cousins there, I had cousins, the , SO we would get together. </sentence><sentence id="611">And I remember like today, I used to be so happy to go with my mother and she was very affectionate, she was very warm. </sentence><sentence id="612">And I remember, I'm not a thinker, but my mother, which also made a great influence, that she instilled in me a love for literature and for singing and everything. </sentence><sentence id="613">Is that when we lived in Poland, we didn't have closets like we have now. </sentence><sentence id="614">We had what they called a French amour" (ph) and it was a wooden chest that reached almost from the floor to the ceiling and it had two doors. </sentence><sentence id="615">Facing the chest, the right-hand side was wider, it was used for the wardrobe, and the left side was for linen and the very highest it had hats of my grandmother's and my mother's, hats lying there. </sentence><sentence id="616">And for some reason, when I was younger, this was still a pre-schooler, this was always locked, this side of the wardrobe. </sentence><sentence id="617">And I couldn't understand why, I was so curious and I used to try to play all kinds of games to try to guess what is in that chest. </sentence><sentence id="618">And I used to think, maybe a treasure, maybe a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to think that maybe I am adopted and they don't want me to know that I am adopted and they are hiding the papers. </sentence><sentence id="619">It was a whole source of curiosity for me. </sentence><sentence id="620">And I remember one day my mother said, "Yit-cola (ph), please come. </sentence><sentence id="621">Come here. </sentence><sentence id="622">I want to show you something." </sentence><sentence id="623">She took out the key and she opened the chest. </sentence><sentence id="624">And I had like two kinds of emotions. </sentence><sentence id="625">In one way, I was burning with curiosity to see what is in the chest that was constantly closed. </sentence><sentence id="626">And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?What is there? </sentence><sentence id="627">And she opened the chest and she said, "Look Yit-cola (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="628">And it was a whole chest full of books, all leather-bound books. </sentence><sentence id="629">And she took out a book, pointed to the closet, she said, "Yit-cola (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds. </sentence><sentence id="630">You can sit right here in Chair-hon-off (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you will travel all over the world." </sentence><sentence id="631">And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to read. </sentence><sentence id="632">And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward. </sentence><sentence id="633">And I was quite young when I knew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me little children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff. </sentence><sentence id="634">And one story that I wanted to relate, which was written by , a Yiddish writer, it was called , Bunchos (ph) of the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="635">I remember many stories, but this story I'm relating to you because I've been thinking about it most of the time when I was in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="636">And the story is about a young child, about a man actually who was called Bunchos (ph), which means silent. </sentence><sentence id="637">And this man, when he was a little child, lost his mother and became an orphan, only had his father. </sentence><sentence id="638">At the age of 13, the father remarried and took a very cruel woman who abused the little boy. </sentence><sentence id="639">She would eat well but she would starve him. </sentence><sentence id="640">She made him chop wood barefoot in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="641">He never had a new change of clothes. </sentence><sentence id="642">They didn't send him to school. </sentence><sentence id="643">Didn't have a friend. </sentence><sentence id="644">But no matter what she, he was constantly lonely, but he never complained, not even to his father. </sentence><sentence id="645">And one time, in the middle of the winter, in a drunken stupor, his father threw him out in the middle of the night, dragged him out by the hair. </sentence><sentence id="646">He picked himself up and he left and he was going from place to place. </sentence><sentence id="647">He wandered into a big city and for no reason known to him he was put in jail. </sentence><sentence id="648">And then he was, for the same unknown reason to him, he was let go. </sentence><sentence id="649">But he was still silent. </sentence><sentence id="650">Never complained. </sentence><sentence id="651">Then the story relates how he suffered also, starvation, looking for job, and worse than the job was looking for the job, and then people wouldn't pay him. </sentence><sentence id="652">He was constantly abused but Buncho (ph) was always silent. </sentence><sentence id="653">And then he married a woman who already had a child. </sentence><sentence id="654">And it was a little boy, a baby. </sentence><sentence id="655">And she left him with the child and he raised the child, when the boy was 15 years old, he threw him out from the house. </sentence><sentence id="656">But Buncho (ph) was again silent. </sentence><sentence id="657">And it relates the whole story, a beautiful story. </sentence><sentence id="658">It kept me so in suspense. </sentence><sentence id="659">I remember it today. </sentence><sentence id="660">Actually when I learned to read Yiddish, which I learned to read well, I read many of the books which my mother had in that chest. </sentence><sentence id="661">And the reason why she kept it locked is because I was the oldest child and she was afraid that the little children might damage her books. </sentence><sentence id="662">Later, when we were older, the chest was open when we learned to respect it. </sentence><sentence id="663">But its just the values that she had. </sentence><sentence id="664">So this man was constantly abused and later somebody run him over with a horse and wagon. </sentence><sentence id="665">And even in the hospital where people are allowed to complain, he was still silent. </sentence><sentence id="666">And in silence he lived and in silence he died. </sentence><sentence id="667">And after he was buried they put a piece of wood and a marker on his grave and the wind blew away the marker and the gravedigger's wife found it and used it to light the, to heat the stove. </sentence><sentence id="668">So he didn't even have a grave or anything. </sentence><sentence id="669">And then, but it was different, the writer says, in the other world, the world where there is justice. </sentence><sentence id="670">And when he came up, they told him, "Buncho (ph), here in heaven everything is yours. </sentence><sentence id="671">Whatever you want. </sentence><sentence id="672">Pick, choose." </sentence><sentence id="673">And he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="674">Why would somebody be so good to him in the other world where they were so cruel to him here? </sentence><sentence id="675">And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain. </sentence><sentence id="676">Not to man, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more. </sentence><sentence id="677">So finally they said, "Buncho (ph), what would you like?" </sentence><sentence id="678">And he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="679">And finally he said, "Well, your Excellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter." </sentence><sentence id="680">And when I was, later during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was silent. </sentence><sentence id="681">He had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="682">And also, what would we give for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="683">So the literature, and also another thing which I often think about this story, is that Paris (ph) who was a great Yiddish writer, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic. </sentence><sentence id="684">This book is in English still and its beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="685">I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing is, the cruelty. </sentence><sentence id="686">And when he says here that they look, why was he silent? </sentence><sentence id="687">He didn't have to be silent, he should have cried out. </sentence><sentence id="688">But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho (ph) the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="689">When Germany invaded Poland, the first thing of the hometown, the first thing I remember, because at that time we lived in the other house already. </sentence><sentence id="690">And our house was strict , which was near Warsaw Street, which was the main street. </sentence><sentence id="691">And as soon as we came out, this was almost in the corner, was a large house and they had a cellar, they had like big cellars. </sentence><sentence id="692">So when the air raids was, we went to hiding, into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="693">And even there, sitting there, my mother tried to calm us down with telling us stories. </sentence><sentence id="694">She was such a wonderful story-teller and she knew so much literature and so many plays. </sentence><sentence id="695">And then, when they just came in, we were still allowed to move from place to place, so people started to run. </sentence><sentence id="696">People from Warsaw came to small towns. </sentence><sentence id="697">Other people came to different places. </sentence><sentence id="698">And my father's entire family, his sisters, three sisters, one natural sister and two half-sisters, because his father died when he was a young boy, and my father was born in Pull-tos (ph), Poland. </sentence><sentence id="699">So they still lived with the children and, I think, their nieces and nephews, they lived in Pull-tos (ph). </sentence><sentence id="700">And we didn't know what's happened to them because, so my father was going to go, I remember today the conversation between my parents, he said, "Let's go to Pull-tos (ph). </sentence><sentence id="701">My sisters are gone." </sentence><sentence id="702">Because both parents, like, I never knew my grandparents on my father's side, so he held the responsibilities being the oldest child, to take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="703">But we didn't know, we didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="704">And then, when they took Warsaw, we could no longer go from place to place. </sentence><sentence id="705">That's when the Nazis begun their systematic destruction. </sentence></p></dialogue>

you have to have 10 people to have for the prayers. </sentence><sentence id="895">So all those things were, actually religious people suffered the most. </sentence><sentence id="896">They started to, when they saw elderly men, most of the people, my father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did. </sentence><sentence id="897">So they laughed, they started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard. </sentence><sentence id="898">They started to torture, to mock. </sentence><sentence id="899">Because to, they did whatever they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="900">They had all legal rights to do those things. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="901">And then they confiscated the business, they looted the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="902">They started to ration the food and started starvation. </sentence><sentence id="903">And also we had to, they would grab people to do the work in the street. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="904">And after a whole day's work, they would come home and would have to stay in long lines to get a small ration, a very small ration. </sentence><sentence id="905">So right away we started to starve. </sentence><sentence id="906">Couldn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="907">And in other country the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up. </sentence><sentence id="908">But you couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="909">So that's when I was thinking a lot about starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="910">That we had to be silent, you know, in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="911">And then something happened which effected me very much personally, and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="912">They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and valuables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="913">So one day, and also there was a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was </sentence></p><p><sentence id="914"> because they singled us out as an inferior race. </sentence><sentence id="915">And we were not allowed to have any transactions, not business, not social, not sexual, because for the Nazi and the Jew, if this would happen, it would be punished. </sentence><sentence id="916">And we had a big and one time a man, a civilian, until this day I don't know his name, but I remember the incident very clearly because I was also involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="917">A man came in and he was selling household articles. </sentence><sentence id="918">Since people, most people gave up the money because they didn't want to risk, if they are caught for whatever you did against the law, it was punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="919">And even without any reason they shot and they killed and they tortured. </sentence><sentence id="920">But anyhow, so when he came in a lot of people, just for curiosity, came and looked. </sentence><sentence id="921">And one man walked by, his name was Cal-fus (ph). </sentence><sentence id="922">He was the owner of the building where I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="923">And he walked by too and he came in. </sentence><sentence id="924">And my mother all of a sudden realized that if somebody is going to see us standing and having any business transaction with somebody who is not Jewish, and we didn't know whether he was Polish or whether he was German, because there was a lot of , that is somebody who is of German descent but he didn't live in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="925">So she said, she was afraid, so she said, "Please come into my house." </sentence><sentence id="926">She invited everybody. </sentence><sentence id="927">And Cal-fus (ph) obviously took a risk and he didn't give away all the money. </sentence><sentence id="928">So he </sentence></p><p><sentence id="929"> bought maybe 90 percent of the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="930">My mother didn't buy anything. </sentence><sentence id="931">We gave up the merchandise, you know? </sentence><sentence id="932">Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but before we came to the ghetto I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing corsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled this out and she made rolls of money and she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them, so they must have saved some money but maybe she didn't want to spend it or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="933">But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the people left and this man, who was selling the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="934">But it didn't take long, this same man brought the Gestapo into our house and denounced my mother. </sentence><sentence id="935">And they asked my mother, "Who is the man who brought the merchandise, because he told us." </sentence><sentence id="936">And that is the first time in my life that I heard my mother lie. </sentence><sentence id="937">She said she didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="938">But she did know who he was. </sentence><sentence id="939">He was not a personal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we knew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew him very well because, like I said, I went to school there. </sentence><sentence id="940">So after... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="941"> End of Tape 1. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="942"> Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="943">A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we didn't know brought the Gestapo to our house and they interrogated my mother. </sentence><sentence id="944">They wanted her to tell who Cal-fus (ph) was. </sentence><sentence id="945">And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I heard my mother lying. </sentence><sentence id="946">That she said she didn't know, she denied it. </sentence><sentence id="947">So after interrogated for quite a while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything. </sentence><sentence id="948">They took her away. </sentence><sentence id="949">The Gestapo took her away. </sentence><sentence id="950">I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they started many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured. </sentence><sentence id="951">So I was afraid to be separated from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="952">So I run after her. </sentence><sentence id="953">And I was determined, no matter what's going to happen, I'm not going to leave her alone. </sentence><sentence id="954">So they kept on chasing me away. </sentence><sentence id="955">And finally, one of them said, "Take her too." </sentence><sentence id="956">And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that whatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="957">And they brought us to the Gestapo, the station, and they separated us. </sentence><sentence id="958">They took my mother in to a separate room. </sentence><sentence id="959">This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness. </sentence><sentence id="960">And, what I heard, it sounded like they were beating her and she was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="961">The shouts got louder and louder and after a while it was silent. </sentence><sentence id="962">That's when my heart almost stopped too, because as long as she was screaming, I knew that she's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="963">But when it was silent, I had no longer any knowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious. </sentence><sentence id="964">And what seemed to me like an eternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the doors swung open. </sentence><sentence id="965">Two Gestapos, each holding her under the armpit, dragging her across the floor. </sentence><sentence id="966">And took me in, to be next. </sentence><sentence id="967">And I wanted to see whether my mother, I saw she was bleeding, and I wanted to see whether she is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="968">So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same place. </sentence><sentence id="969">And she didn't say anything, but she gave me a sign not to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="970">And I loved my mother because she always loved me so much and I knew what kind of a person she was. </sentence><sentence id="971">So I was, when they started to ask me questions I said, "I don't know it." </sentence><sentence id="972">I lied too. </sentence><sentence id="973">Deliberately. </sentence><sentence id="974">And they started to beat me and I was screaming, and my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="975">And after I was beaten quite well, they, because we spoke Yiddish at home, and Yiddish is similar to German, they understood, that they said, "Gin-nook (ph)". </sentence><sentence id="976">Enough. , </sentence><sentence id="977">which means maybe we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="978">Maybe we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="979">And that's when they released us. </sentence><sentence id="980">This story begun in 1939, shortly after Germany invaded Poland. </sentence><sentence id="981">I didn't see anymore Cal-fus (ph). </sentence><sentence id="982">I didn't know what's happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="983">At that time, the Nazis used all kinds of techniques. </sentence><sentence id="984">They reversed, you see, Hitler's laws were a reversal of all the Jewish laws. </sentence><sentence id="985">We, in Judaism, in home and in Hebrew school, they taught us that we are all responsible for one another. </sentence><sentence id="986">What they did is that if one person did something wrong, they punished us all. </sentence><sentence id="987">Group punishment for individual action. </sentence><sentence id="988">So, and ironically, what was legally ours they took away by force and we were punished for trying to keep it or to have it. </sentence><sentence id="989">So I didn't know what's happened to the Cal-fus (ph) family but what we knew, both my mother and I, is that if we would have told they would have killed the whole family, not just the father. </sentence><sentence id="990">And I'm going to stop here because I don't want to lose the end of this story because this story had a tremendous impact on me. </sentence><sentence id="991">And I'm going to skip and come back later to 1939. </sentence><sentence id="992">I'm going now to 1981 when I went to the world gathering of Jewish Holocaust survivors, okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1043">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1045">A: And when we came, only Jewish survivors, there was some people before I left that they wanted me to be in a documentary, to be a witness in a documentary. </sentence><sentence id="1046">And I told them that story. </sentence><sentence id="1047">Anyhow, when we came there, each of us, I'm not going to go into the whole, direct to the story, each of us got a badge and it says, on mine it says, Itka Zygmuntowicz USA. </sentence><sentence id="1048">That was all. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And as I was standing, this was the last date when we were marched into the courtyard, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1050">And Menachem Bacon was the President there. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And I was overwhelmed with emotion to think from the gates of Auschwitz, to come now to the gates of Jerusalem and after so many, more than 2,000 years, to have our homeland, and then I understood already what it means to have our homeland, then people cannot tell you, "The houses are yours but the streets are ours." </sentence><sentence id="1052">And I was overwhelmed. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And I was so eager to go to march, and that march as a free person, as a proud Jew, but they asked me not to because they needed me to bear testimony in case I see something or to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And as the people are marching and I'm standing there, all of a sudden I said to myself, "Can I have a marker or a pen?" </sentence><sentence id="1055">And I wrote on my badge, Fri-mand (ph), Check-hon-off (ph), Poland and Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1056">I figured in case somebody recognized, you know, walks by, they do not recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="1057">I was 13 when the war broke out and now I am an adult. </sentence><sentence id="1058">My name has changed. </sentence><sentence id="1059">Who will know me? </sentence><sentence id="1060">And as I stand there, Kentel Vee-che-nya (ph) from Lindstrom, Pennsylvania (ph) was bringing the American flag as a gift to Menachem Bacon. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And he looked at my badge, he said, "You're from Chair-hon-off (ph)?" </sentence><sentence id="1062">And I said, "Yes, Chair-hon-off (ph).". </sentence><sentence id="1063">And with him walked another man and he said, "I'm from Chair-hon-off (ph) too." </sentence><sentence id="1064">And I said, "Who are you?" </sentence><sentence id="1065">And he said, "Cal-hus (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="1066">And I went berserk. </sentence><sentence id="1067">I started to cry and to laugh and I was so excited and he had the matches, holding the cup, and the people who were interviewing him said, "Ask him for the address." </sentence><sentence id="1068">So I asked him for the address and before he gave I said, "Are you the son or the father?" </sentence><sentence id="1069">Because he looked too young to be the father. </sentence><sentence id="1070">He said, "I'm Cal-hus's (ph) son." </sentence><sentence id="1071">And he gave us a card, he lives in Natan-alia (ph), Israel because after the war he went to Israel, and he married an Israeli-Jewish . </sentence><sentence id="1072">And we went there to interview him too. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And I found out his father, unfortunately, died in Auschwitz, was murdered in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1074">But he and another brother survived. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And both are married and have children and grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And that's when I was understood, my grandmother's saying, that you only have what you give away. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And that you don't have to be rich or famous and you can give away , good deed and your , and three generations. </sentence><sentence id="1078">When I was in 1981, alive because of our sacrifice. </sentence><sentence id="1079">And that's when I learned spiritual resistance, from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And I learned what is. </sentence><sentence id="1081">What to do with humanness. </sentence><sentence id="1082">And now you understand why I was sharing with you the lessons, what my mother said. </sentence><sentence id="1083">doesn't depend, and then I'm going back to 1939, but I felt, I wanted to finish and complete the story so that you will know. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Actually, Cal-fus (ph) invited us, our family, and there was a tremendous reunion. </sentence><sentence id="1085">They took him and made him a part of the, you know, the interview. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Anyhow, we are back in Chair-hon-off (ph) in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1087">After they took away from us all our freedom, they took away from us all our possessions. </sentence><sentence id="1088">In the meantime, my grandmother died. </sentence><sentence id="1089">That was before we went to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1090">My grandmother was no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="1091">And I was heartbroken because, except for my parents, I have never had as a close relationship with anyone as I had with my parents and with my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="1092">And she had such a great influence in this, I was heartbroken. </sentence><sentence id="1093">But looking back, I am grateful that she did not have to go to what we went through and she died in her own bed and she was buried in Chair-hon-off (ph) and is there still. </sentence><sentence id="1094">That was already, it was not as open, another kind of funeral that would be otherwise. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1160">Q: Were you able to try to observe holidays and things like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1162">A: We couldn't observe holidays anymore because, first of all, Jews were not allowed often to pray or to go among the Synagogues. </sentence><sentence id="1163">We couldn't make a traditional sha-but (ph), there was no food. </sentence><sentence id="1164">We lived in constant fear. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And I saw, for instance, I think that I mentioned it, the religious people suffered more because they couldn't often and there was starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1166">When you, we tried as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="1167">I still knew what day it is and we tried as much as we could to keep the sha-but (ph), but that was when we were still living in Chair-hon-off (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1168">And I actually didn't say good-bye to any of my relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1169">Only, from all the family, from all the members, the only person on my mother's side that I said good-bye was to my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Because my mother and I was at her bed side when she died. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And she was clear, her mind was so clear. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And I remember that I was terribly upset and my mother said something that also was to be a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="1173">She said, "Yit-cola (ph), (she said that in Yiddish, of course, because as I said I spoke Yiddish), death teaches us not to take for granted life." </sentence><sentence id="1174">And we still had, usually you know, according to tradition, the Jewish burial was very important. </sentence><sentence id="1175">But later we couldn't have, people couldn't ultimately go and bury so we still, she was still buried in Chair-hon-off (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1190">Q: You were able to bury her properly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1192">A: We did, we were able to bury her properly but it was not like a big funeral that she would have had because the children from Warsaw, the children from and all of them, they couldn't come. </sentence><sentence id="1193">We just, our family, and the people who were involved. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Because from everything, from birth to death, our lives was different than it is now, how it was during the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Because, for instance, there was not funeral pyres. </sentence><sentence id="1196">There was not, you didn't bury people the same way that is here. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And everything was different, on the way the customs were done. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Our whole lives changed. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Before the Nazis came in, the longest that I ever didn't eat was from one meal to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1200">And being that we have a kosher home and familiar, after meat, eating, you wait six hours. </sentence><sentence id="1201">So the religion taught me a lot of discipline too. </sentence><sentence id="1202">And later the people who kept kosher could not keep kosher, they didn't have food at all. </sentence><sentence id="1203">They were starving. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So then in the middle of the night. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1218">Q: Did you break those rules? </sentence><sentence id="1219">Did you eat whatever you could at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1222">A: At that point there was no meat. </sentence><sentence id="1223">There was no meat and we tried as much to keep as we could. </sentence><sentence id="1224">But eventually when the hunger tool over you no longer could do it anymore because I remember a young pupil once of a Rabbi, when I was in Chair-hon-off (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1225">Somebody was sick so he said that you're allowed, you don't have to fast if you don't feel good because to preserve your health, that was the first obligation. </sentence><sentence id="1226">So all the laws, all the rules that applied before into other times that no longer could be applied here. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Because here was just one thing, survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1873">A: Oh, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1874">They immediately had the selections. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Mangelia sent them to the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And I remember they were holding hands, you know, my little brother and sister. </sentence><sentence id="1877">My brother was protecting my little sister, they took them away. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And then my mother saw them going away. </sentence><sentence id="1879">I don't know how much she know, what she knew, but again her , she made a fatal choice and she went with the children. </sentence><sentence id="1880">She said she cannot leave them alone, you are a big girl. </sentence><sentence id="1881">So that was the last time I ever saw them. </sentence><sentence id="1882">The whole family for four generations. </sentence><sentence id="1883">And I had no idea where my Aunt, who lived in Warsaw, she was married with children, my Aunt in the . </sentence><sentence id="1884">Another , all the relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1885">I never said good-bye, I don't know what's happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="1886">Whether my Aunt in Warsaw died in the Warsaw ghetto, whether she was, this we will never know. </sentence><sentence id="1887">We don't even have, you understand why this story of Buncho (ph) the Silent, I was thinking. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Because, I don't know whether it was just coincidental that this story had such an effect on me and why I remembered because Buncho (ph) the Silent in the story was 13 years old, when the step- mother came. </sentence><sentence id="1889">And also I was many times thinking that we live for so long, since about the 1600 century my ancestors came to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And yet, we had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="1891">Everything that was ours they inherited, they took away everything. </sentence><sentence id="1892">Nothing was ours. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1894">And then when we came there, they shaved our heads, everybody had shaved heads. </sentence><sentence id="1895">The guys, it was done too. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And then we were the fortunate ones, at that time we didn't know because good and bad fortune can only be understood in retrospect. </sentence><sentence id="1897">So I didn't realize that I was still lucky, that I got the number. </sentence><sentence id="1898">At least I'm alive with the number. </sentence><sentence id="1899">And then we really got a bath, we didn't get gassed, but obviously, or I wouldn't be here to tell you this. </sentence><sentence id="1900">But we got a bath, which we welcomed because a shower was, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1901">And then we went out for, a whole full of the floor was laying uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And they were striped, the same thing as we saw with the ones who came to the train. </sentence><sentence id="1903">And, not from the Nazis, this was also hefflinger (ph), which means Jewish people who were interred there. </sentence><sentence id="1904">And then they gave us those uniforms and they took away our shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1905">Everything was taken. </sentence><sentence id="1906">Our clothes, our shoes, our hair, our name. </sentence><sentence id="1907">Everything. </sentence><sentence id="1908">And all of a sudden, I realized that to them I was just a number. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And I remember that at the time, when they called, you know they never called us by name but number, in order to dehumanize us, that we should give in and give up. </sentence><sentence id="1910">They always would call my number, which was 2-5-6-7-3 [in German], and whenever they say that I always would say under my breath, "Yit-cola (ph)". </sentence><sentence id="1911">Because I thought to myself, how can I be a number? </sentence><sentence id="1912">I can feel, I can think, I can laugh. </sentence><sentence id="1913">Of course I didn't have freedom but I had freedom of mind, freedom of thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="1914">And so I, this was my spiritual form of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1915">That I refused to see myself through their minds. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And after they gave us the, instead of my shoes, which was a nice pair of shoes too, they gave us wooden clogs. </sentence><sentence id="1917">And mine, unfortunately, were not matching. </sentence><sentence id="1918">And we got an enamel bowl. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And this was all our worldly possessions. </sentence><sentence id="1920">In one day our entire past was wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And we had no future. </sentence><sentence id="1922">We didn't know it then yet. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I didn't know about gas chambers yet. </sentence><sentence id="1924">And they marched us into a barrack. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1992">Q: Well, older meaning three years older, or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1994">A: In the ghetto, I mean, in the concentration camp there was pretty much solidarity. </sentence><sentence id="1995">However, I had one bad experience. </sentence><sentence id="1996">And I'll come to it. </sentence><sentence id="1997">So when they gave us, and we always had to march to line up, never, since I came in on November 22, 1942, until Auschwitz was resolved, until January 18, 1945, I had no longer freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1998">No freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1999">We were, everything, because from the morning we woke up, we came in the barrack, it was a real big, long barracks. </sentence><sentence id="2000">And was three layer bunk beds. </sentence><sentence id="2001">And crowded on the bunk beds with one blanket. </sentence><sentence id="2002">And they were so low that you couldn't sit up. </sentence><sentence id="2003">We couldn't sit up. </sentence><sentence id="2004">The same clothes, the shift that we got, with this I slept. </sentence><sentence id="2005">There was no night clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2006">From 1942 to 1945 I never brushed my teeth. </sentence><sentence id="2007">I never saw myself in a mirror. </sentence><sentence id="2008">Nobody ever embraced me. </sentence><sentence id="2009">Nobody ever said, after having so much love. </sentence><sentence id="2010">So when I'm looking back from an environment where I was free like a bird, to come to a place where I felt like in a cage. </sentence><sentence id="2011">And you know, you can put a bird in a cage but you cannot deprive them of their desire to fly. </sentence><sentence id="2012">They took away my freedom but they couldn't take away my desire to be free. </sentence><sentence id="2013">They took away my loved ones but they could not take away my desire to live. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And I guess there were many horrible things    but probably the most horrible was losing everyone I loved. </sentence><sentence id="2015">And not only experiencing my own suffering, but witnessing the suffering of others and have to be silent like Buncho (ph) the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="2016">And I couldn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2017">And in the barracks, where I could say something when the Nazis were not there at night, it was like the Tower of Babel. </sentence><sentence id="2018">Because everyone spoke a different language. </sentence><sentence id="2019">And we were too tired, too grieved in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2020">So when we came in, so many people were crowded in this barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2021">And all of a sudden, from a happy sheltered loving home to be thrown into an environment like this. </sentence><sentence id="2022">And everybody was suffering. </sentence><sentence id="2023">My first concern was, when is our family going to come? </sentence><sentence id="2024">But I still was naive enough to believe what the Nazis told us, that we are going to get united. </sentence><sentence id="2025">So I'm waiting. </sentence><sentence id="2026">And I don't see them. </sentence><sentence id="2027">So I start asking questions. </sentence><sentence id="2028">And there is a conspiracy almost like, so silent. </sentence><sentence id="2029">Whether they didn't want to tell us because they didn't want to break my heart, or whether they were not allowed to? </sentence><sentence id="2030">This I don't know, but whoever I asked nobody answered anything. </sentence><sentence id="2031">They didn't say yes or no, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2032">Finally, after constantly badgering and repeating, one of the girls said, "You might as well tell her. </sentence><sentence id="2033">We are all here condemned to die." </sentence><sentence id="2034">And she points at the smoke and she said, "You see that chimney? </sentence><sentence id="2035">This is where your parents are." </sentence><sentence id="2036">And tells me the story about the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="2037">She said, "This is where we're all going to be." </sentence><sentence id="2038">Remember I related a story, it was when I was a child, I went to the funeral, my parents took me to the funeral and they told me that, to take your own life is a sin. </sentence><sentence id="2039">It's like spitting God and your parents in their face because they gave you a gift and its against the Jewish law. </sentence><sentence id="2040">So I did not for once think about committing suicide. </sentence><sentence id="2041">But at that moment, if I would have been able to die when I found this out, that's how horrible my grief was. </sentence><sentence id="2042">And I just was ready to give up. </sentence><sentence id="2043">I was not trying to think about committing suicide, but I became oblivious. </sentence><sentence id="2044">I didn't care what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="2045">And anyhow... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2099">Q: Can I ask you a question here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2101">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2103">Q: How long do you think you were there before you realized this? </sentence><sentence id="2104">Or before you were told this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2107">A: I didn't know the first day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2109">Q: Was it a few months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2111">A: No, no, not months. </sentence><sentence id="2112">It was in a few days. </sentence><sentence id="2113">The exact day I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2114">Not very long, not very long. </sentence><sentence id="2115">Because I was constantly asking and badgering the girls. </sentence><sentence id="2116">And I'm going to go in later to describe what a day in Auschwitz was, but for now, they gave us the ration bread and I felt like, its like a funeral for me. </sentence><sentence id="2117">I lost everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2118">So I didn't, couldn't, I was starved but I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="2119">So I took the bread and left it. </sentence><sentence id="2120">In the morning my bread was gone. </sentence><sentence id="2121">And one of the girls there, I don't remember her last name any longer, Esther I know was her first name, she was from Chair-ta-hoff (ph) and she actually came from a prison. </sentence><sentence id="2122">I don't know whether the prison was during the war because from what I know she was not a criminal, so maybe she, the Nazi laws were different than our laws. </sentence><sentence id="2123">For keeping on, for wanting to practice our religion, for wanting to live. </sentence><sentence id="2124">To kill you was legal. </sentence><sentence id="2125">But to save a Jewish child or a Jewish adult was illegal and punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="2126">To survive was to them, everything that was our they have taken away, if we would try to keep something, we were treated like criminals. </sentence><sentence id="2127">So anyhow, in the morning Esther says to me, "Oh poo Yit-ka (ph), somebody stole your bread." </sentence><sentence id="2128">And I said, "My gosh, what place is this? </sentence><sentence id="2129">Stealing somebody's piece of bread." </sentence><sentence id="2130">And when I got the next day my bread, I couldn't eat again. </sentence><sentence id="2131">Even though I was, like my throat was locked. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And I left the bread. </sentence><sentence id="2133">In the night for some reason we slept so many people on one bunk, so if one had to turn, so we slept on our sides like sardines, the other, we had to wake the others, so somebody woke up. </sentence><sentence id="2134">And as I wake up, the girl, Esther, who pitied me was eating my bread. </sentence><sentence id="2135">And that was almost like the last straw for me. </sentence><sentence id="2136">And at that point I just didn't care what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="2137">And I was sitting and crying. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And I didn't know it at the time, in Auschwitz    if you didn't get up for the or the counting, if you didn't obey the law for anything, you would right away be killed, taken to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="2139">So a girl walks over and she ask me, "Why are you crying?" </sentence><sentence id="2140">And I didn't care at all, I was so, so heartbroken, that I just started crying. </sentence><sentence id="2141">I just didn't even want to answer. </sentence><sentence id="2142">Finally she, it was something in her voice, that I felt that like she's caring, which I started to understand and I remembered what my grandmother use to say, "Yes my child, but kindness and caring cannot be little things." </sentence><sentence id="2143">Like when I did the . </sentence><sentence id="2144">And what's happened? </sentence><sentence id="2145">And finally I tell her. </sentence><sentence id="2146">And she said, she thought that I cried because of the bread, I cried of the whole situation, of losing the family and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2147">So she took a piece of her bread and she broke it off and she said, "Take it." </sentence><sentence id="2148">And I didn't want to take it. </sentence><sentence id="2149">Because I already knew that we are all there to be killed, that it's just a matter of time. </sentence><sentence id="2150">So I figured I cannot afford to get involved with anybody, to care for someone, to have a relationship, because in case one of us goes, there's going to be additional pain, to protect myself from the pain. </sentence><sentence id="2151">But there was something in her voice and her face and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2152">Her name is Benack (ph), at the time, was Binna Gold-cut (ph), Yanka Gold-cut (ph), because she use to call herself Yanka. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And finally I took the bread and I said, "No, I cannot alone, no matter how long I'm going to live, alone. </sentence><sentence id="2154">It's not even worth living. </sentence><sentence id="2155">I'm all alone." </sentence><sentence id="2156">I took the bread and Binna became my dearest friend. </sentence><sentence id="2157">And from that day on, she became like my sister. </sentence><sentence id="2158">We cared for each other. </sentence><sentence id="2159">We cared deeply for each other and we helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="2160">In Auschwitz, a piece of bread meant life. </sentence><sentence id="2161">Meant winning in the game of survival. </sentence><sentence id="2162">So I just felt that she was so kind, that she was able to break up, and the contrast. </sentence><sentence id="2163">Here, Esther stole my piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2164">And this girl gave away a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2165">I didn't even know until this day, I don't know when she came, I didn't know at that time anything. </sentence><sentence id="2166">Now I know that she was born in Warsaw, but I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2167">At that time we didn't think of it. </sentence><sentence id="2168">And I took the bread and with it something in my spirit started to soar again and we made a commitment, Binna and I. We didn't know if we were going to get out of there, but to live or to die with , with humanness. </sentence><sentence id="2169">Not to lose our dignity. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And this is important to know, that in Auschwitz there were two kinds of laws. </sentence><sentence id="2171">If somebody was hungry and while they were carrying the cauldron with soup, people would lift up the lid and put in their bowl and grab and run. </sentence><sentence id="2172">If they were lucky they could run away. </sentence><sentence id="2173">If they caught them, they would get 25 on their bare behind. </sentence><sentence id="2174">And sometimes even worse. </sentence><sentence id="2175">But one inmate from the other, that was a no law. </sentence><sentence id="2176">Would not take, because we know this meant survival. </sentence><sentence id="2177">And from 1942 to 1945 I was in Auschwitz, nobody ever stole from me anything. </sentence><sentence id="2178">You know? </sentence><sentence id="2179">And we felt like we had no freedom at all. </sentence><sentence id="2180">No freedom of movement, only in our soul and our mind could we be free. </sentence><sentence id="2181">And just to feel that I had some kind of choices yet to make. </sentence><sentence id="2182">We use to switch, you know, like to share. </sentence><sentence id="2183">I would give Binna a little bit of my soup and she would give me a piece of bread, or vis-a-versa. </sentence><sentence id="2184">One day when she had the . </sentence><sentence id="2185">And even sisters and mothers, sometimes, if they were lucky to be together, they kept separate the plate, everybody would, they would measure when they divided. </sentence><sentence id="2186">You shouldn't be a hair bigger than the other because the starvation was so great. </sentence><sentence id="2187">Binna and I trusted each other and we kept together our bread. </sentence><sentence id="2188">We didn't keep it separate and she never betrayed me, or vice-a-versa. </sentence><sentence id="2189">And somehow knowing, she became the, next to my family, she became the friend that I kept with. </sentence><sentence id="2190">When other friends in concentration, but Binna and I were more like friends, under such circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="2191">And when the day that they usually begun, when the whistle would blow, get up. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And we would always, it was still dark. </sentence><sentence id="2193">I didn't have a clock because as I said, my only worldly possession was the shift, the wooden clog and the bowl. </sentence><sentence id="2194">Nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="2195">So I didn't have a watch, I didn't know what day it is, I didn't have a calendar. </sentence><sentence id="2196">We didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="2197">People say, did you have this? </sentence><sentence id="2198">So that's why I'm pointing out, I didn't have more than this... End of Tape 2. </sentence><sentence id="2199">Tape 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2291">Q: You were beginning to tell me what an average day or a typical day in Auschwitz was like for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2293">A: We didn't wake up by the clock. </sentence><sentence id="2294">We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it was still dark. </sentence><sentence id="2295">We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift that we wore during the day. </sentence><sentence id="2296">We didn't have any extra clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2297">This was all that we had. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And there was water but we were told that this is not good drinking water. </sentence><sentence id="2299">So water was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="2300">We didn't have, we couldn't go to the bathroom when we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2301">It was like a collective bathroom, like the latrines you know? </sentence><sentence id="2302">And it was just a wooden board and in it like cut out a piece. </sentence><sentence id="2303">So we couldn't go where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there was such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or drink. </sentence><sentence id="2304">And therefore they got diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="2305">And because the conditions, we couldn't wash up. </sentence><sentence id="2306">We didn't have anywhere to wash. </sentence><sentence id="2307">So it wasn't clean. </sentence><sentence id="2308">And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end of you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and work. </sentence><sentence id="2309">And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the selections, then you would go now. </sentence><sentence id="2310">So it was important. </sentence><sentence id="2311">And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go through the movements of pretending that I'm washing myself, just to have some, to feel some freedom. </sentence><sentence id="2312">So when I got up in the morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was cold, and out of habit I was still saying the , | would still say the prayers, even in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2313">And we would start, go to the where we are counted. </sentence><sentence id="2314">Alive or dead, we had to be . </sentence><sentence id="2315">And they used the matter that one was responsible for all. </sentence><sentence id="2316">So if one person would not be found because he's sick or wouldn't come out, or whatever, we all had to stand no matter how long. </sentence><sentence id="2317">Rain, in the biggest rain and the frost without a coat, without anything. </sentence><sentence id="2318">If we didn't have, and we would stay, freeze. </sentence><sentence id="2319">So we used to try to warm each other, one in the back, you know somebody would stand, you stay in the front and somebody in the back and embrace each other. </sentence><sentence id="2320">And one day we couldn't do it ultimately because the Nazis, they counted. </sentence><sentence id="2321">And sometimes we would be lucky, that everybody was accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="2322">Other times we would stay for hours. </sentence><sentence id="2323">And then they would give us something, even though we didn't have enough of it and we wish we would have had more, but its suppose to be coffee, it resembled muddy water. </sentence><sentence id="2324">A little beet. </sentence><sentence id="2325">A piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2326">Some kind of smelly cheese, its like Limburger cheese, it was smelly. </sentence><sentence id="2327">But we didn't get enough of it. </sentence><sentence id="2328">We were grateful that we had this here because we were so hungry that we would eat anything almost. </sentence><sentence id="2329">In fact we had to restrain ourselves, sometimes not to eat things which could harm us. </sentence><sentence id="2330">And in the winter, because there was lack of water and no place to wash, we would pick up the snow. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And if a Nazi would see us or the one who was watching us, we would get beaten for that. </sentence><sentence id="2332">They tried to torture us. </sentence><sentence id="2333">And then after we got our ration, we had to line up, and I can still hear, "Links." </sentence><sentence id="2334">Line up and go march. </sentence><sentence id="2335">And on both sides big, long lines with the prisoners marching, with the inmates marching. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And I don't know how to call ourselves because when they talk about slavery in Egypt or was not as bad as what we had, yet they don't call them slaves. </sentence><sentence id="2337">So prisoners, I don't know what, but I feel we were worse than slaves because slaves are not condemned to die, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2338">Not that way, they used them for something. </sentence><sentence id="2339">And we started to walk and on both sides were guards and the Nazis with the dogs, that went with us to work. </sentence><sentence id="2340">And then we had to go through the gates, and at the gates many times was a dren-dall (ph), they would take out somebody who didn't walk too good or didn't look to good. </sentence><sentence id="2341">Other times we were just called, 1-2-3, 5-6-7, the 8" out, sometimes the 10" out, we never know. </sentence><sentence id="2342">So you could not plan from one second to the other because you don't know whether you come back, would you be alive the next day. </sentence><sentence id="2343">That's when I realized how a person was condemned to death, you know, who has a family illness must feel. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And I found out pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the outside line so we tried to be in the inside line and not to be the very first or the very last. </sentence><sentence id="2345">The less visible you could make yourself. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And we marched. </sentence><sentence id="2347">When I came I was assigned to Block 8 and a Turkish woman was our Block Elster (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2348">A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she didn't have to go out to work but she was responsible. </sentence><sentence id="2349">And then we went out to work and I cannot estimate how long of time or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we worked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2350">And then we came to work. </sentence><sentence id="2351">And we always worked outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2352">And, outer-commando (ph) it was called, when you worked outside, outer-commando (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2353">And what I started to realize is that the work we were doing at that time was not usual work. </sentence><sentence id="2354">We would take stones or gravel and carry it from place to place and the Nazis used to mock us. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And point to the gas chambers and they said, "See? </sentence><sentence id="2356">That's where you're all going to come out." </sentence><sentence id="2357">And then he said, "Where is your God now?" </sentence><sentence id="2358">And that's when I remembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the root cellar. " </sentence><sentence id="2359">Go, Yit-cola (ph), go. </sentence><sentence id="2360">God is in the root cellar too." </sentence><sentence id="2361">And I said to myself, "Go, Yit-cola (ph), go. </sentence><sentence id="2362">You're the last one of your family. </sentence><sentence id="2363">If you don't survive, the world will not know and it will be the last. </sentence><sentence id="2364">It's like your family will not have existed. </sentence><sentence id="2365">Go. </sentence><sentence id="2366">God is here too. </sentence><sentence id="2367">But man is not here. [ </sentence><sentence id="2368">humanness] is not here." </sentence><sentence id="2369">And I started to understand what means, why my parents stressed it so much. </sentence><sentence id="2370">And I never for once felt like God has failed me. </sentence><sentence id="2371">I felt the people failed me. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Because God gives men choices to do good or evil. </sentence><sentence id="2373">But they have chosen and they were the educated people. </sentence><sentence id="2374">My family always stressed education. . </sentence><sentence id="2375">In fact, my family used to say that is the highest form of religion, science and achievement. </sentence><sentence id="2376">And in Auschwitz, I had a chance to find out that this was true. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Because Mengelia has doctoral degrees. </sentence><sentence id="2378">And he's responsible for the death of 400,000 people including my own family. </sentence><sentence id="2379">So I did not doubt God. </sentence><sentence id="2380">In spite of what was happening, that I still pray to God and I still believed in God and I remembered other things, which I didn't mentioned this story and I think I will now because I thought of that story often. </sentence><sentence id="2381">You know, for Passover and Rash-sha-shona (ph) every year, regardless of how poor you were, or rich, people would get new clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2382">It didn't matter whether you had a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2383">And most, and there was not big department stores like this here, so mostly we would go to the dressmaker to make a dress. </sentence><sentence id="2384">That particular summer, I was like in my pre-teens, and I remember my mother ordered for me navy blue . </sentence><sentence id="2385">And the dressmaker made me a dress, a two- piece dress, a sailor dress, a pleated skirt with the collar like this. </sentence><sentence id="2386">And when we went to try on first the measurements and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2387">And then when the dress was ready I would try it on again and look in the mirror and it fit well. </sentence><sentence id="2388">And I felt so proud, so happy with this dress. </sentence><sentence id="2389">The sailor dress. </sentence><sentence id="2390">And I came home and it was early Passover, before Passover. </sentence><sentence id="2391">So, like a child, I wanted to put on the dress and to show my girlfriends what a pretty dress, I was so proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="2392">And when I was going to put on the dress, my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), please don't put on the dress now." </sentence><sentence id="2393">I said, "Oh Mom, it's gonna..." She said, "It might get tore and it might get stains and then you won't have it for Passover." </sentence><sentence id="2394">And I said, "Oh Mom, its going to be okay." </sentence><sentence id="2395">So I remember my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), please. </sentence><sentence id="2396">Don't take chances on something you can't afford to lose." </sentence><sentence id="2397">But as a child I started to nudge, oh please and please and please. </sentence><sentence id="2398">So finally my mother said, she says, "Well, you learn about responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="2399">That's the only way you're going to learn." </sentence><sentence id="2400">And I promised I won't, I'll be careful. </sentence><sentence id="2401">And I had every intentions of doing it, it was not out of mischief or not caring. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And I put on the dress and I came out. </sentence><sentence id="2403">And I was very, a combination. </sentence><sentence id="2404">In one way I could be very serious and I was very playful and a little tomboy and I remember I mentioned to you that we had the , the river. </sentence><sentence id="2405">And we use to go there, it had beautiful trees. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And the kids came and somebody challenged, they said, "Who can climb up highest on the tree?" </sentence><sentence id="2407">And I was pretty good at that, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2408">I was never heavy, which actually in Poland that was not looked at favorably. </sentence><sentence id="2409">They use to say that she has consumption if you were thin. </sentence><sentence id="2410">People were more, so anyhow, in no time I climbed up this tree, the tree, and I was, I dissed the person who was challenging me. </sentence><sentence id="2411">And all of a sudden I hear somebody say, "Yit-cola (ph), Yit-cola (ph) your mother is coming." </sentence><sentence id="2412">And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wearing the good dress. </sentence><sentence id="2413">And I went to get off the tree fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a branch and I tore the skirt. </sentence><sentence id="2414">I came down. </sentence><sentence id="2415">My mother wasn't even there, it was just a prank they played on me. </sentence><sentence id="2416">And I was in tears. </sentence><sentence id="2417">And I said, "My God. </sentence><sentence id="2418">My mother begged me not to take chances. </sentence><sentence id="2419">Not to take a chance to lose something and now my dress is torn." </sentence><sentence id="2420">And I remember like today, I took the pleats and I folded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a big tear. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And when I came into the house with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much. </sentence><sentence id="2422">All she said, "Take of the skirt." </sentence><sentence id="2423">Because she saw the way I held it with tears in my eyes, so she put two and two together. " </sentence><sentence id="2424">And I'll fix it for you." </sentence><sentence id="2425">But she said, "Remember one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2426">It's up to you. </sentence><sentence id="2427">You can wear your old dress or the dress that I'll fix for you. </sentence><sentence id="2428">But you're going to go to services." </sentence><sentence id="2429">I was crying my eyes out because I didn't want to wear my old dress and I didn't want everybody to see that, what I did with this dress. </sentence><sentence id="2430">But I remembered the lesson. </sentence><sentence id="2431">Because my father always pointed out, in everything there is a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="2432">In every experience. </sentence><sentence id="2433">And what I remembered from that lesson is not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose. </sentence><sentence id="2434">And this was for me a terrific lesson because I knew one thing I cannot afford in Auschwitz, is to lose my life. </sentence><sentence id="2435">So what I tried to do, many think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved, I said no. </sentence><sentence id="2436">I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so badly and if I cannot work they'll take me away. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And I started to realize there how important it is, the upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had. </sentence><sentence id="2438">And mostly I saw, you see before the Holocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the things, the values, and the things or the blessings that I had. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without a Jewish community, without the , we were always Jewish there, but we were not, Jewish people were not the only people who were in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2440">There were Gypsies, there were Jehovah Witness, there were the Polish people, they were from all countries. </sentence><sentence id="2441">However, the Jewish, we, the Jewish girls, we were not together with the men in the same camp. </sentence><sentence id="2442">The Polish girls were not together in the same barracks with us. </sentence><sentence id="2443">We were separated. </sentence><sentence id="2444">So in all the years that I was there, I never had any contact with a man. </sentence><sentence id="2445">I'm not talking in a sexual way, but I mean even to be friends or to be in the company of men. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And here, this is my teen-age years. </sentence><sentence id="2447">The price of going to 5 the price of higher education that I was dreaming, to get a good, formal education. </sentence><sentence id="2448">The price of all the things, of liberty, which I started to realize how important freedom is. </sentence><sentence id="2449">Our liberty. </sentence><sentence id="2450">And this is when, when I felt all this here, then I felt, oh I wish I had a pencil and paper so I could write down how I feel. </sentence><sentence id="2451">But I didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="2452">And at that time, I wrote in my head to past time, to forget, to run away from the harsh reality. </sentence><sentence id="2453">So I remembered that I wrote a poem in my mind and it was what I felt and it was, I feel like a bird with clipped wings, tied to this earth by invisible strings, chained to a destiny I did not chose, I feel like a prisoner that cannot break loose, I look at the sky with a heavy sigh, but my wings have been clipped and I no longer can fly. </sentence><sentence id="2454">And I was looking out and seeing the physical surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="2455">Around us was the barbed wires, the watch towers, the crematories. </sentence><sentence id="2456">The smoke constantly above our heads and beneath us was mud. </sentence><sentence id="2457">There was so much mud there that when we wore those wooden clogs, sometimes they got stuck in the mud and the feet got wet and on cold, winter days they, for a long time you couldn't even take them off, if the feet got frozen, the bite, frost bite, and then after a day like this of suffering and on the job they would mock us, they would beat us. </sentence><sentence id="2458">We could not, we were not allowed to help each other. </sentence><sentence id="2459">And the useless words. </sentence><sentence id="2460">And I was thinking to myself, my gosh, if this is, if this is our , 1 don't even have the word to express it, its like a different planet. </sentence><sentence id="2461">It's in the same world like a different planet, a planet of destruction, of death. </sentence><sentence id="2462">The dead were not buried and was mountains, everything was mountains. </sentence><sentence id="2463">Mountains of dead bodies until they buried them. </sentence><sentence id="2464">And constant living under the fear of maybe today they are going to take you away, and if you got sick you had no luck, there was no medication. </sentence><sentence id="2465">Everything that they promised was not. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And once I found out what they do with the people who come, that they take away, and I heard music playing. </sentence><sentence id="2467">And I asked somebody, "Where is the music?" </sentence><sentence id="2468">And that's when I found out that they have a live orchestra playing. </sentence><sentence id="2469">When the transport was coming and they made selections, sending away people to the gas chamber, the music was playing. </sentence><sentence id="2470">Classical music. </sentence><sentence id="2471">And later, when I heard the music, I always started to cry because I knew that my people are burning, the music is playing. </sentence><sentence id="2472">And you know, even after the Holocaust I always loved music and singing, but for a long time whenever I start to hear music, I started to cry because the visions of the little children, of everything separated and how they tore apart. </sentence><sentence id="2473">And then, after a long day, again, walking through the gate, the selections. </sentence><sentence id="2474">Some people got beaten to death. </sentence><sentence id="2475">Other people from working were injured, some people got sick. </sentence><sentence id="2476">And every day there became lesser and lesser of us. </sentence><sentence id="2477">And the bodies, more skeletal. </sentence><sentence id="2478">And we didn't, couldn't take a shower or anything and we started to accumulate lice. </sentence><sentence id="2479">So a big treat was when we could take off that dress and try to to expose of the lice. </sentence><sentence id="2480">And people with diarrhea, and it was just Dante's Inferno is a comedy comparing to what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2481">That's what I say because you ask me, did I, it's impossible to describe everything. </sentence><sentence id="2482">So we came back tired, frozen, cold, over heated from the heat in the whole day, we came back, again the appeal (ph), say appeal (ph) and check there, there to alive, we are there. </sentence><sentence id="2483">And then we had to wait, after they count again they give us a little soup, a little bread. </sentence><sentence id="2484">It wasn't enough to live and not enough to die. </sentence><sentence id="2485">And many people, many, constantly people died. </sentence><sentence id="2486">And seeing, here you was with somebody, a few minutes later they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And constantly new transports, and you couldn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="2488">So, and the filth, the starvation, the loneliness. </sentence><sentence id="2489">Like I started before to tell you, is all this time not seeing yourself in a mirror, not having a toothbrush. </sentence><sentence id="2490">They tried to dehumanize us to the point where we didn't even, I'm embarrassed to talk about it, but when I remember what my parents taught me, that my does not depend on how other treat me but how I treat others, than I'm not ashamed because I haven't done anything to deserve it. </sentence><sentence id="2491">We didn't even have a piece of toilet tissue. </sentence><sentence id="2492">All the time I was in Auschwitz, I couldn't have a piece of toilet tissue. </sentence><sentence id="2493">This is how they deprived us. </sentence><sentence id="2494">Not a spoon, not a fork, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2495">You know, they tried to reduce us to be like non-humans. </sentence><sentence id="2496">And the mocking constantly and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2497">So again, each day the same thing, over and over, starting the and just hanging on another day. </sentence><sentence id="2498">Just if you could get through the day, not get beaten, not go to the gas chamber, go through the day and come home together with Binna, that's . </sentence><sentence id="2499">And many times, people would go in the evening and somebody would say, "Listen, I'm going to give you a little of my soup. </sentence><sentence id="2500">You want to give me a piece of your bread?" </sentence><sentence id="2501">Some people preferred the, a little soup to the bread. </sentence><sentence id="2502">And the starvation. </sentence><sentence id="2503">And then the Nazis would come and they would say that they are going to give us extra bread, who wants to have extra bread? </sentence><sentence id="2504">And I learned very quickly, whenever they called for volunteers for something, I never wanted to volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="2505">I felt, others suffered but I don't want to get involved to do something which wouldn't be , you know? </sentence><sentence id="2506">And what I found out one time, they took, they made a selection. </sentence><sentence id="2507">They gave, it was true, they did give this time a little more bread, but they took away the girls and not until after the war, one who was taken away and survived, I found out that they took them for experiments. </sentence><sentence id="2508">And they, the doctors experimented without anesthesia. </sentence><sentence id="2509">You know, they castrated some men and some women, the operations, so they could never bear children anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And some people, one woman, she is already dead now, but a few years ago she was still alive, I don't know what they did to her but hair was growing on her face so she had to go Electro- something, I forget how this is called, they had to take it off from her face. </sentence><sentence id="2511">Hair grew like a man, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2512">And different things. </sentence><sentence id="2513">There were plenty, I know certain people who I personally know who got married but never could have children because of those experiments. </sentence><sentence id="2514">And some got sick. </sentence><sentence id="2515">But the majority died, they didn't survive this here. </sentence><sentence id="2516">Yes, and another thing. </sentence><sentence id="2517">There was a , you know? </sentence><sentence id="2518">So, and they sometimes Mengelia or other doctors would come and we had to strip and, which is . </sentence><sentence id="2519">He would look us over and those who looked already skinny or they are too sick or, away to, but at that point, away to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="2520">There was a block where they would send away, and sometimes they didn't have enough time to get them out, so they would put them, put them in this block and they no longer gave them food or anything. </sentence><sentence id="2521">And then they take them away. </sentence><sentence id="2522">If you got sick, it was tough luck. </sentence><sentence id="2523">Then you were a goner. </sentence><sentence id="2524">Until this day, I cannot, I'm thinking and I'm amazed myself that I didn't, wasn't able to be clean there. </sentence><sentence id="2525">I didn't have medications, a few times I got sick. </sentence><sentence id="2526">Not like real serious. </sentence><sentence id="2527">Without an aspirin, without medication, everything else. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And yet to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2529">And then constantly transports. </sentence><sentence id="2530">And then was one day, we were called , they asked us to stay longer and there was a girl and her name was , something with a "Z" begins, I forget her last name, Zit-a-emir (ph), something like this here. </sentence><sentence id="2531">I didn't know her personally but I knew of her. </sentence><sentence id="2532">She was a messenger, you know?And I don't know the exact story because I don't, I'm not, I was not a witness when she run away, I didn't see her run away. </sentence><sentence id="2533">But I know that one day we were all called together and we were, they prepared a gallow and they were going to hang her because she run away and they brought her back, they found her. </sentence><sentence id="2534">And she, when they found her, I don't know from where because in Auschwitz I couldn't get anything more than what I got, the bowl and the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2535">She had a razor someplace hidden. </sentence><sentence id="2536">And before they hang her, she cut her wrists in my prescence. </sentence><sentence id="2537">Then there was another hanging. </sentence><sentence id="2538">This hanging I did not witness because Rosa Loberta (ph), my , the beautiful Rosa, this story I just know from my , the few to have survived. </sentence><sentence id="2539">That she was also hanged in Auschwitz because she wasn't dead and they destroyed one of the crematoriums. </sentence><sentence id="2540">And when the Nazis started to lose the war, of course I didn't know about it because we had no outside communication. </sentence><sentence id="2541">Completely cut off. </sentence><sentence id="2542">That's why I say, its in this world but a planet like a different world because we were isolated completely. </sentence><sentence id="2543">They started to speed up the gassing and they wanted to destroy everybody because even though he is losing the war but he still was carrying on with the plan of destroying the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2544">So the girls made to destroy the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="2545">And anyhow, there is somebody who's name is Noy-ia Zub-o-dal-vich (ph), he lives in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2546">And he was able, because they kept him in solitary, and they tortured her. </sentence><sentence id="2547">And from him I know this story. </sentence><sentence id="2548">That they hang her. </sentence><sentence id="2549">And before they hand her, she said, "Ha-zak viv-lots (ph)", the strong and brave. </sentence><sentence id="2550">And what they wanted from her is that she should denounce, they interrogated her too and they wanted her that she should tell who the others were. </sentence><sentence id="2551">The resistance, you know, she was involved with other people. </sentence><sentence id="2552">She, from the story that I've heard, that she was smuggling pieces of ammunition or something, but as I said, I'm not a witness to that but I heard. </sentence><sentence id="2553">So there was resistance but very, not speaking for the Warsaw ghetto we know that resistance, but this I'm not going to speak because I wasn't in those ghettos, I wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="2554">But the very fact, to want it to go on knowing that nobody is left anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2555">There is no place to go back or anything. </sentence><sentence id="2556">So surviving, and we didn't know how others, what's going on, what are they doing with the war or anything. </sentence><sentence id="2557">But I kept constantly asking myself, the German people at that time were the most educated people and yet they did the most horrible things. </sentence><sentence id="2558">A doctor who takes the Hippocratic oath to heal sick people is murdering healthy?And everything, it seemed to me like ironical. </sentence><sentence id="2559">The youngster he considered too young to live and the old were too old to live and the teen-agers, from teen-age years to older a little bit, they were just right to go to Hell and live and to suffer and to die there. </sentence><sentence id="2560">So it was extremely, constantly living with pain to see that everyday there is less and less. </sentence><sentence id="2561">And there was the son-day-commander (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2562">And the son-day-commander (ph) was a group of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz who were operating the involvement with gassing the people. </sentence><sentence id="2563">And I didn't know it then but now, afterwards I found out, and almost I was in there. </sentence><sentence id="2564">I returned to Poland and I went to the gas chambers now because I never saw a gas chamber inside. </sentence><sentence id="2565">And what I, so we saw, I have photographs and I saw it by myself. </sentence><sentence id="2566">The process that they had, that to tell the people that they are going to take a bath but instead to put on gas, this was out completely of my experience both historically and privately. </sentence><sentence id="2567">I never heard this. </sentence><sentence id="2568">And not only that, everything that they took away that was ours became theirs . . </sentence><sentence id="2569">.[end of side | of tape 3]... You know, all the values, all the many beliefs that I've been taught and many things, I had to tell them everything. </sentence><sentence id="2570">It was not just the physically, but to tell them because I started to ask questions of myself. </sentence><sentence id="2571">I said, what is education for if it leads to Auschwitz, to gas chambers?Imagine. </sentence><sentence id="2572">Not only did they took away our possessions, our homes, our traditions and everything, but a lot in Poland, gold teeth was our status symbol. </sentence><sentence id="2573">Plus people did it to fix their teeth, but those who were wealthier used to make the crowns for the teeth, they put in gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="2574">So when the people were dead, before they went in they cut their hair and this was used for German economy, it was for mattress stuffing and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2575">And I was thinking, we had straw mattresses. </sentence><sentence id="2576">My parents didn't go to college, and my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="2577">But how did they live? </sentence><sentence id="2578">I started to compare the values. </sentence><sentence id="2579">And then, is another thing, from the teeth they took away everything and they selected, the glasses, and every single thing they took away from every part of the body. </sentence><sentence id="2580">From the skin, lamp shades and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2581">So everything was, again, what is technology for? </sentence><sentence id="2582">And this is why, when I got out, I could no longer have the same values. </sentence><sentence id="2583">I had to tear down everything and to compare. </sentence><sentence id="2584">What did my parents teach me? </sentence><sentence id="2585">What did my grandmother teach me? </sentence><sentence id="2586">What does my religion teach me? </sentence><sentence id="2587">That the most important thing was a human life, to save one life, the Talmud teaches us, is like to save the whole world. </sentence><sentence id="2588">And here was my mother who didn't have college degrees, was a extremely intelligent woman, well-red and intelligent and very artistic, but she didn't have college degree. </sentence><sentence id="2589">And yet she resisted. </sentence><sentence id="2590">She resisted both physically and spiritually. </sentence><sentence id="2591">She did not give up Cal-fus (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2592">And from one person that is now several generations of people. </sentence><sentence id="2593">Can you imagine how many generations would be if they wouldn't have killed the six million? </sentence><sentence id="2594">How many people? </sentence><sentence id="2595">And one Mengelia could do so much damage. </sentence><sentence id="2596">And that's when I started to realize, by going back. </sentence><sentence id="2597">Not everything that I reflect while being there. </sentence><sentence id="2598">Many things I reflected upon until this day. </sentence><sentence id="2599">And I started to say, so I realized something very important. </sentence><sentence id="2600">That four groups of people actually influenced my destiny. </sentence><sentence id="2601">Because the Nazis, the only reason why the Nazis did this to us is because we were born Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2602">I did not choose my parents and my parents didn't choose to die in the gas chambers, to be murdered. </sentence><sentence id="2603">They didn't die. </sentence><sentence id="2604">They didn't die. </sentence><sentence id="2605">They were murdered. </sentence><sentence id="2606">Those who starved of starvation, those who were killed or those from diseases, they were murdered because they put us in those conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2607">And everything that was ours became their by brute force, by terror and by deception. </sentence><sentence id="2608">And this is why I start about honesty. </sentence><sentence id="2609">And then I started to realize, when I look back now, I realized also that there are some things you cannot buy without money but there are also some things we cannot buy for money. </sentence><sentence id="2610">And those are the things that I miss the most. </sentence><sentence id="2611">No money in the world can replace the six million Jewish people and five million non-Jewish people who were murdered by the Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4499">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="4500">Because on the 26" I was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="4501">On the 27" I was in Copenhagen. </sentence><sentence id="4502">The 28" J arrived. </sentence><sentence id="4503">And at that time, when I started to get healthy I started to examine and to re-evaluate everything. </sentence><sentence id="4504">What is it? </sentence><sentence id="4505">Who is responsible? </sentence><sentence id="4506">And basically what I was interested is, in the beginning, to regain my health. </sentence><sentence id="4507">I started concentrating on regaining my health because I realize that health is wealth, health is important because if you're sick and you are alone, you cannot do very much. </sentence><sentence id="4508">And I was very much aware that I no longer have anyone to love me, to protect me, to take care of me. </sentence><sentence id="4509">So I needed to become my own parent and start taking care of myself. </sentence><sentence id="4510">Of course, Binna and I were still very devoted and very loyal to each other and we were each other's family at the time. </sentence><sentence id="4511">And I was there in the hospital, I got very good care. </sentence><sentence id="4512">I also was always fortunately a good student and always loved language, words. </sentence><sentence id="4513">I always realized the power of words, so I was very eager to learn Swedish. </sentence><sentence id="4514">So while there, I started, they were very kind to me, they gave me a dictionary and I started to learn a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="4515">And to recover. </sentence><sentence id="4516">And I was in Lund, Sweden until May 7, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="4517">From there I was sent to Dod-ug-stup (ph) in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="4518">It's called Dod-ug-stup (ph), it's you know? </sentence><sentence id="4519">And this was DP Camp, which in Swedish is called . </sentence><sentence id="4520">On Rinks-vagen (ph) 20 B, that was the address. </sentence><sentence id="4521">Now there we were in a quarantine, we still couldn't go out because the people were afraid, if we are, if we don't carry any diseases or, so we were not treated badly, in fact we were treated very nice. </sentence><sentence id="4522">However, we only got 50 cents a week, it's 50 , which is like 50 cents here, for pocket money. </sentence><sentence id="4523">And we started, the people from the town came to the, there was also a fence, but was not barbed wires, it was not electrocuted wires, and we would come to the fence and they looked. </sentence><sentence id="4524">Some came and we would give them sometimes the money and ask them to buy little trinkets for us. </sentence><sentence id="4525">And there was a couple with a young son, must have been maybe early 20's, and with the few words that I could speak we made contact. </sentence><sentence id="4526">I already recovered a little bit, looked a little better. </sentence><sentence id="4527">And I didn't think of myself at that time as a woman yet, but obviously he thought of    me that way, and he asked me, and in the broken Swedish with the dictionary, I understood that when I get allowed, when I will be allowed to get out from the quarantine, will I go on a date with him. </sentence><sentence id="4528">And that was the first date of my life, okay? </sentence><sentence id="4529">So I was very excited and anxious. </sentence><sentence id="4530">I didn't know how I'm going to know how to behave with a man, I didn't see a man for all those years. </sentence><sentence id="4531">I didn't have any experience in dating and mating. </sentence><sentence id="4532">I went out with him. </sentence><sentence id="4533">It was a very, very painful experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="4534">Because as soon as we started to talk, and not very much, he paid me a compliment, you don't look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4535">And that was like a knife in my, twisted in my heart. </sentence><sentence id="4536">Here I suffered so much and I'm not Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="4537">And again, he doesn't see me as a human being. </sentence><sentence id="4538">Yes, I'm not denying my Jewishness, I'm proud to be who I am. </sentence><sentence id="4539">Would I be born a Gentile, I would be proud to be Gentile, but I'm born, I didn't make choices about this. </sentence><sentence id="4540">It hit me so hard, and I don't believe he meant it in a bad way, in a malicious way. </sentence><sentence id="4541">He was a kind person. </sentence><sentence id="4542">But for somehow he reminded me who I am, not that I ever forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="4543">And I said, "Good-bye." </sentence><sentence id="4544">Excuse myself with tears in my eyes and I left. </sentence><sentence id="4545">And I made a decision. </sentence><sentence id="4546">Never will I go out with somebody who is not Jewish because I'm the only link left, the only daughter left of my family. </sentence><sentence id="4547">I cannot do it to my family or to my people or to myself. </sentence><sentence id="4548">And in our camp there, in the DP Camp, was a woman which was called, we called her , means she was a Rabbi's wife, so the husband is a Rabbi, she is the Rabbi's wife. </sentence><sentence id="4549">So she was the Rabbi's wife and she was orthodox and she took a great interest, she wanted the children, those who are under 21, to remain Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4550">So she took us, she told us there is a camp that she wanted to take us. </sentence><sentence id="4551">Also, we were not still completely free to go. </sentence><sentence id="4552">A kosher, a camp. </sentence><sentence id="4553">It was no, it was, I prefer kosher to not kosher of course at that time, but it wasn't so much the kosher because in the concentration camp I ate not kosher, so, but it was that I felt I need to be with Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4610">Q: The DP Camp was mixed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4612">A: The DP Camp was only Jewish, but when I went out, and he tells me this here, I was too wounded yet from the whole experience. </sentence><sentence id="4613">Maybe if he would say today I would laugh it off, it wouldn't even have mattered to me this much. </sentence><sentence id="4614">But at that time, I wanted to be accepted for who I am because I realized by that time, if 1 cannot be accepted for who I am surely I will not be accepted for what I am not. </sentence><sentence id="4615">So I wanted somebody to accept me for, it's not that I had anything about a Gentile or anything, but I wanted to be, I needed to be among my people who are Jewish in order to know that I don't, shouldn't be told you don't look Jewish, or be accepted for who I am. </sentence><sentence id="4616">So I volunteered to go to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4617">And on July 10, 1945 I left and I went to Hel-shin- fel-hol-it (ph), this is what the place called. </sentence><sentence id="4618">However, there was something which was troubling me. </sentence><sentence id="4619">I wanted Binna to come too. </sentence><sentence id="4620">I didn't want to separate. </sentence><sentence id="4621">I thought of Binna as my extended family. </sentence><sentence id="4622">The Rabbi's wife said, "Itka, I don't want to separate you from your friend, but I can't take her. </sentence><sentence id="4623">Not now at least. </sentence><sentence id="4624">Because I cannot make exceptions." </sentence><sentence id="4625">And she was three years older so she could no longer go. </sentence><sentence id="4626">But she said, "I give you my word that after a few weeks, I will bring her too. </sentence><sentence id="4627">But not right now because then I cannot give about this." </sentence><sentence id="4628">So I decided to go and I told Binna that I'm going to try to make sure that she comes later. </sentence><sentence id="4629">And the Rabbi's wife certainly kept her promise and she brought Binna there too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6175">A: First of all, I couldn't make friends with other people until I learned the language. </sentence><sentence id="6176">And we formed already 1956, we already had here the organization. </sentence><sentence id="6177">So we shared a lot together. </sentence><sentence id="6178">And we realized that this cannot be just a social organization. </sentence><sentence id="6179">We have to work for Israel. </sentence><sentence id="6180">We have to remember the Holocaust and to share with others and to teach. </sentence><sentence id="6181">But for me, I had and I still have, all kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="6182">If I would show you my telephone book, you will say how can you keep up?Because I made, I didn't discriminate. </sentence><sentence id="6183">I feel one thing, the only criteria that I, that is important to me, is not how much somebody has, who he knows, what he knows, but how much he cares. </sentence><sentence id="6184">And when a person is caring, and he is a good, decent human being, than I can be their friend and they can be mine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6196">Q: Was it easy for you in the early days here? </sentence><sentence id="6197">Before you were going around and speaking about the Holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="6198">To talk about your experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6202">A: It was difficult then, it's difficult still. </sentence><sentence id="6203">However, I don't do only the things which are easy. </sentence><sentence id="6204">I do many things which are difficult but they are necessary. </sentence><sentence id="6205">And when I was asked, there was here a professor , the late , I mentioned to you before. </sentence><sentence id="6206">And she is from . </sentence><sentence id="6207">And she wrote a book of the Holocaust and she, once a friend of ours from the organization invited about 20 survivors. </sentence><sentence id="6208">I didn't know what the purpose was, it wasn't like a social thing. </sentence><sentence id="6209">And I found out that she wanted to organize, that people should speak on the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="6210">And I went there and that was the first time that different survivors among ourselves started to share a little feelings. </sentence><sentence id="6211">And I realized that there is not, we realized that there is very little in the text books about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6224">Q: Actually what I'm trying to understand is, not so much in a formal way, speaking about it, but you had friends from all walks of life, talking in the earlier days here. </sentence><sentence id="6225">Was this something that you could talk about? </sentence><sentence id="6226">That you could share? </sentence><sentence id="6227">Did people want to hear about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6232">A: I never went around and volunteered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6234">Q: Just on a personal basis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6236">A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me questions. </sentence><sentence id="6237">And I answered. </sentence><sentence id="6238">I always, I did the same thing like I did with my children when they asked about sex. </sentence><sentence id="6239">Short question, short answer. </sentence><sentence id="6240">They asked me so I answered. </sentence><sentence id="6241">And people, not too many people were so interested, they didn't know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="6242">And then, a little later, when people started to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there is very little about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="6243">They speak about World War One but not about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="6244">So we started to form an organization and be involved with this here. </sentence><sentence id="6245">So it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="6246">Because, to give you one example, with some people it was easier. </sentence><sentence id="6247">Some are more compassionate, some are more understanding and more curious. </sentence><sentence id="6248">Others are more involved with their own life. </sentence><sentence id="6249">So it depends who it was. </sentence><sentence id="6250">I had my late friend told me that someone asked her once about the Holocaust and she started to tell a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="6251">She said, "Well, we had that in America hard too. </sentence><sentence id="6252">We didn't have any steak." </sentence><sentence id="6253">And after that she decided never to talk about the Holocaust to her. </sentence><sentence id="6254">The Holocaust has taught me many lessons. </sentence><sentence id="6255">Because before the Holocaust I only had positive experiences. </sentence><sentence id="6256">I had no frame of reference with which to compare all the blessings that I have. </sentence><sentence id="6257">The blessing of a loving family. </sentence><sentence id="6258">The blessing of good health. </sentence><sentence id="6259">The blessing of having my home. </sentence><sentence id="6260">Not to be called all different names. </sentence><sentence id="6261">Because I've been called all kinds of names. </sentence><sentence id="6262">I've been called no name at all. </sentence><sentence id="6263">I've been called, derogatory now, Jewess, which was anti-Semitic name. </sentence><sentence id="6264">I was called you refugee. </sentence><sentence id="6265">You foreigner. </sentence><sentence id="6266">All kinds of name. </sentence><sentence id="6267">And I feel one thing, that its very important. </sentence><sentence id="6268">Respect for one another. </sentence><sentence id="6269">Respect for differences. </sentence><sentence id="6270">That we cannot expect everybody to be alike. </sentence><sentence id="6271">And that we must, I don't want to use the word must because that sounds dictatorial. </sentence><sentence id="6272">It's important to protect our human rights. </sentence><sentence id="6273">And just, in the very beginning, with even the smallest incident that's happened. </sentence><sentence id="6274">When somebody does not treat you right. </sentence><sentence id="6275">I have learned to become a . </sentence><sentence id="6276">I want to give you an example because that's going to be more. </sentence><sentence id="6277">I was invited several years ago to an open house, a barbecue. </sentence><sentence id="6278">And the barbecue started because there was some people who were suppose to come from other cities too, it was like a big gathering. </sentence><sentence id="6279">They started to come on Friday until Sunday evening. </sentence><sentence id="6280">We came Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="6281">We live, it wasn't in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="6282">And when we arrived, not the owner but one of the guests greeting me with anger. " </sentence><sentence id="6283">What's the matter? </sentence><sentence id="6284">Why so late?" </sentence><sentence id="6285">At that time I realized, I had a chance to sort out my emotions, and I realized that if I answer in anger he is controlling me emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="6286">So I looked at him very calmly and I said, "Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="6287">I am so glad that you missed me." </sentence><sentence id="6288">And he answered, "You know I like you Yit-cola (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="6289">And I said, "Thank you" again. </sentence><sentence id="6290">This man, may he rest in peace, is no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="6291">He was otherwise a good man, but he had a habit of putting some people down. </sentence><sentence id="6292">And I have noticed that volubility illicits aggression in the group, compassion in the kind, and silence in the indifferent. </sentence><sentence id="6293">And this is nothing to do with race, color or religion. </sentence><sentence id="6294">It has to do with the ability of self image, of confidence, of the ability to love yourself because you cannot love others if you don't love yourself. </sentence><sentence id="6295">And to care. </sentence><sentence id="6296">To know that what we do effects not only us, it effects others too. </sentence><sentence id="6297">Because after the Holocaust, I was thinking many times, you know I told you I like to write, and I was thinking up to age 13 most decisions my parents and grandmother made for me. </sentence><sentence id="6298">You know children don't make where to live and what to do, of course I had some. </sentence><sentence id="6299">During the Holocaust I couldn't make choices about my life. </sentence><sentence id="6300">Even after    the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="6301">Okay, I could have said no, I don't want to come here. </sentence><sentence id="6302">But I didn't have many choices. </sentence><sentence id="6303">I could say, I come, I don't come, but I couldn't say I want to go someplace else because the . </sentence><sentence id="6304">So I felt that so much in my life I had to live and to do by choices which others made that effected me. </sentence><sentence id="6305">And I sat down once and I wrote just a few words. </sentence><sentence id="6306">And it goes like this: Four groups of people Dramatically influence my destiny. </sentence><sentence id="6307">My late, beloved family in Check-hon-off (ph), Poland Who knew me and loved me and empowered me with positive energy. </sentence><sentence id="6308">Hitler's Nazis who didn't know me But hated me merely for being born Jewish and in one, single day Murdered in Auschwitz my entire family. </sentence><sentence id="6309">The bystanders, who knew but didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="6310">And the Swedish Red Cross, who didn't know me but liberated me From Nazi tyranny and brought me to a hospital in , Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="6311">Iam one and the same person. </sentence><sentence id="6312">If four different groups of people viewed me differently, And treated me differently, I was loved for who I am And I was hated and starved and tortured for who I am. </sentence><sentence id="6313">The more the Nazis tortured me for who I am The more I was determined never to become like them, But to view myself through their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="6314">To the Nazis, I was just a number, sub-human, a vermin. </sentence><sentence id="6315">But I am not a number. </sentence><sentence id="6316">My number is my badge of honor. </sentence><sentence id="6317">Let those responsible for the number feel ashamed, or whatever they want.lam a proud Jewish daughter. </sentence><sentence id="6318">To be born Jewish is neither a crime nor a disgrace, But to starve, torture and murder innocent people For being born Jewish is a crime against God and humanity. </sentence><sentence id="6319">A crime that has influenced the entire world. </sentence><sentence id="6320">Because whatever we choose to say and do We are becoming partners too. </sentence><sentence id="6321">But others are becoming the beneficiaries of our good deeds Or the victims of our evil deeds. </sentence><sentence id="6322">We each can make a difference. </sentence><sentence id="6323">One person can save many people And one person can destroy many people. </sentence><sentence id="6324">Mengelia is responsible for the dead, over 400,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="6325">On the other hand, Wahlenberg and even Shindler is responsible for so many lives. </sentence><sentence id="6326">From the 1,100 Jews that Shindler saved, 6,000 descendents are now alive. </sentence><sentence id="6327">Can you imagine how many would be if the others had survived?Therefore, I feel that my first responsibility Is to God To live by the commandments    And not to transgress them Because I cannot do evil without becoming evil. </sentence><sentence id="6328">The lessons that my father taught me, whatever I do I become, if I lie I'm going to become a liar and I'll help him and others. </sentence><sentence id="6329">And I know one thing, we live in this world We are responsible for one another. </sentence><sentence id="6330">But not in a way to punish each other. </sentence><sentence id="6331">So whenever there is injustice and cruelty We need to be, to speak out, no matter where it is. </sentence><sentence id="6332">And to stand in solidarity with those who are repressed And not with the oppressor. </sentence><sentence id="6333">In the final analysis, without , all , religion and education fails. </sentence><sentence id="6334">So we need first to improve ourselves because then we make a better world. </sentence><sentence id="6335">If you wish I can share with you a few of the poems if there is still time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6440">Q: [have a question. </sentence><sentence id="6441">Because you do feel responsible, a sense of responsibility for your world . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6446">Q: Right, but it's the same. </sentence><sentence id="6447">Are there certain events, historical events, in the last forty years or so that had a really strong impact on you other than, you've mentioned the birth of the Israeli State. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="6450">Are there other things that have effected you in this country, like the Civil Rights Movement or wars or anything? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6451">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6452">I feel, do you remember there was a who came and he wanted to, here in Philadelphia, to speak in the movies about the Nazis? </sentence><sentence id="6453">We went and marched. </sentence><sentence id="6454">When there was, we went to speak. </sentence><sentence id="6455">Then there was suppose to be a rally here, Nazis wanted to march here. </sentence><sentence id="6456">We went to court, I was among them, and we fought against it. </sentence><sentence id="6457">When I hear in private life, it doesn't only have to be in big things, in private life, when I was, when I hear that somebody is making a joke or on somebody else's expense, or an ethnic group, generalizations, I stand up and I speak up. </sentence><sentence id="6458">I said, "I don't appreciate what you said." </sentence><sentence id="6459">In fact, one of my dear friends who is non-Jewish, who I met through such occasion. </sentence><sentence id="6460">Because we were in the , it was a meeting and somebody said something negative about another group. </sentence><sentence id="6461">And I said, "I really don't appreciate because I know how it feels when people do that." </sentence><sentence id="6462">So in small thing. </sentence><sentence id="6463">You know, prejudice is very easy because you don't have to give accounts for it. </sentence><sentence id="6464">You just say it but you don't have to give, you know? </sentence><sentence id="6465">And the point is one thing, it's like fire. </sentence><sentence id="6466">When there is only one spark, you can erase it. </sentence><sentence id="6467">But if there is a big fire, you have no control any longer. </sentence><sentence id="6468">So in the little thing and the inter-relationship, in our daily life, in the personal, how we do people. </sentence><sentence id="6469">Because usually when a person from one group offends another, sometimes he starts hating or being angry towards the whole group. </sentence><sentence id="6470">So its important to respect each other. </sentence><sentence id="6471">It's important to speak up when there is a cause, when the Russian people worked, you know, when there was Iron Curtain, and we were fighting to release them, I was marching. </sentence><sentence id="6472">So when there is something, a special cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I write a letter, I speak up. </sentence><sentence id="6473">That's my contribution. </sentence><sentence id="6474">Those are the things which I do. </sentence><sentence id="6475">I cannot say, it doesn't bother because it effects. </sentence><sentence id="6476">You know, I just wanted to add, the Holocaust effected not just me, because the point is one thing, six million Jewish people and about 5 million non-Jewish people have lost. </sentence><sentence id="6477">They will never become what they had the potential of becoming. </sentence><sentence id="6478">The world will never know how many wonderful people we have lost. </sentence><sentence id="6479">Nor how many Nazi war criminals we have gained. </sentence><sentence id="6480">Because some of them still live in hiding . </sentence><sentence id="6481">So what did the world gain?Lose good people and gained criminals? </sentence><sentence id="6482">Whenever there is a crime we lose a good person, we gain    a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="6483">What trade-off is that? </sentence><sentence id="6484">So it's important. </sentence><sentence id="6485">Even to, in my own home, to my own husband, I once told my husband, in sickness and in poverty and in riches and poor and everything, I will always stand by you . </sentence><sentence id="6486">But you commit a crime and I don't want to be any part of it. </sentence><sentence id="6487">Then you have to trade yourself in. </sentence><sentence id="6488">So there are certain loyalties. </sentence><sentence id="6489">In life we need to make choices. </sentence><sentence id="6490">We need to say to bring up decent children we have to learn to say no. </sentence><sentence id="6491">Because you know, in the commandments there is the ten commandments. </sentence><sentence id="6492">It says you shall, you shall not. </sentence><sentence id="6493">And another thing how you can put out, you cannot hatred with hatred, anger with anger. </sentence><sentence id="6494">Somebody once said in anger to me, I hate you. </sentence><sentence id="6495">Because I wouldn't give in to something that was not moral or ethical. </sentence><sentence id="6496">I said, it's okay I love you for both of us. </sentence><sentence id="6497">And the person apologized, she said, I really don't hate you it's just that I was angry with you, I couldn't, you are stubborn. </sentence><sentence id="6498">I said, what you call stubborn, that stubborn is what saved me from. </sentence><sentence id="6499">Because, in fact, I always felt what my family taught me. </sentence><sentence id="6500">That no power in the world can break my spirit as long as I don't collaborate with people in my own destruction. </sentence><sentence id="6501">Because what we do, this is what we become. </sentence><sentence id="6502">You kill you become a killer. </sentence><sentence id="6503">You cheat you become a cheat. </sentence><sentence id="6504">You save somebody so you, so the final analysis, it's not how much we know or how much we have, how much we care. </sentence><sentence id="6505">Caring is what life is all about. </sentence><sentence id="6506">And we have a wonderful group in Philadelphia now, that was in the museum last week. </sentence><sentence id="6507">They are called Champions of Caring. </sentence><sentence id="6508">High School students. </sentence><sentence id="6509">And this is sponsored by the Holocaust Museum in the Washington. </sentence><sentence id="6510">And by the Jewish Relations Counsel in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="6511">And the , also in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="6512">And those kids, what do they do? </sentence><sentence id="6513">They go and help those who are less fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="6514">The sick, the elderly, the disabled. </sentence><sentence id="6515">This is what we need to do. </sentence><sentence id="6516">You know, the strongest message I can give, what I've learned, if we are not our brother's keeper, by omission we become our brother's killers. </sentence><sentence id="6517">Because there are sins by omission and sins by commission. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6601">A: This was written May 8, 1978. </sentence><sentence id="6602">A long time ago because the Holocaust, I've been living and breathing it, it's effected so deeply my life. </sentence><sentence id="6603">Just like a leaf tossed to the wind Separated from its branches and tree Not belonging anymore Liberated but not free Carrying the pain of separation Memories so painful and dear Memories of our world, it use to be A world that is no longer here I still see the Sabbath candles And my mother's gentle face My father is chanting the prayers My grandmother with her white shawl of lace I see my little sister and brother So young and so full of cheer Not yet understanding tragedies and hatred But sensing uncertainty and fear    The Nazi boots are marching My world with terror is filled The Holy Scriptures are burning Children are starved, tortured and killed The ghettos are closing us in What is there for us in store?My world is going slower and slower Nothing is like it was before. </sentence><sentence id="6604">The freight trains are taking us on a journey For most it is the last ride My brothers and sisters are burning There is no more place to hide Hitler's final solution is sealed We are trapped in a world of Hell Iam amazed that I have survived The horrors from the Holocaust to tell And there is another poem, which is called "I Am Not A Number", and I wrote it May 13, 1994.I was trapped in the killing center of Auschwitz Surrounded by barbed wires, gas chambers, smoke and flame The Nazis tattooed a number on my arm 2-5-6-7-3 became my new name They tried to reduce me to a number Dehumanize me day by day But regardless of all their efforts The could not take my self worth away They murdered in the gas chambers my entire family In one single day All my earthly possessions were so brutally taken away They treated me worse than a hardened criminal Even though I did not commit any crime They hated me merely for being born Jewish And starved and tortured me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="6605">I was only 13 years old when they took away from me my right to life But they could not take away my will to live and to survive For nearly six nightmarish years I have endured a living Hell Nevertheless, I have outlived Hitler and the Third Reich And lived my story to tell The third one is my conversations with my late son, Michael. </sentence><sentence id="6606">When he asked me the first time about the number. </sentence><sentence id="6607">And this was written May 14, 1979.Who wrote on your arm, Mom?Asked curiously my little boy one day I looked sadly at my innocent child and thought Very carefully what to say    The Nazis tattooed this number on my arm I told my son short and plain Why did they do it, Mom? </sentence><sentence id="6608">He asked further My God, I thought, how can I explain?You see my child, there was a man Adolph Hitler was his name He was very cruel and hateful And inflicted on people suffering and pain Oh, said he, and ran out to play And I signed with great relief I wanted to protect him for as long as I could From knowing my deep sore and grief He grew and I could not protect him forever So I answered his questions one at a time He wanted to know why we Jews are hated Did we commit some kind of a crime?No, my child, I told my son, We have not committed any crime Yet we Jews have been victimized and slaughtered By 5 and Hitlers all the time Do you hate the Nazis for what they did to us?Now [ have no grandparents and relatives like my friends The Nazi murdered all our loved ones They have blood on their hands I know, my child, that you too are hurting But hatred and revenge can never restore The lives of those who perished in the Holocaust And the precious things we had once before You and I who know what pain is Must never inflict hurt and pain We must try to build a better world So the death of the victims shall not be in vain This is my message. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6628">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6629">But I spoke to them, I told them, but I spoke to them more about my experiences before the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="6630">I wanted them to know their grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="6631">Because I felt its important. </sentence><sentence id="6632">And as a result, my oldest son , a couple of years, two or three years ago and maybe a little longer, came here to visit. </sentence><sentence id="6633">He lives in New York. </sentence><sentence id="6634">And afterwards he calls me up and he said, "Ma, I had a very traumatic experience." </sentence><sentence id="6635">I said, "What's happened?" </sentence><sentence id="6636">He said, "I was waiting for the train and I saw a man laying face down across the tracks. </sentence><sentence id="6637">And I saw from nearby that the train is coming. </sentence><sentence id="6638">I didn't know whether he was drunk, dead, sick, pushed, or wanted to commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="6639">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="6640">And I was thinking, what should I do?
