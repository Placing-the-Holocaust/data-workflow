<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="687">Q: Yes, okay. </sentence><sentence id="688">Did you see them? </sentence><sentence id="689">Those Jews who went out and th -- you didn't -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="690">A: No, no, no. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="691">Q: -- you didn't go there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="693">A: No, I didn't go there, no. </sentence><sentence id="694">But you see, this is a very complicated question, this Jewish and Lithuanian reaction to those times, because it was quite clear after, that we are trapped between two super powers. </sentence><sentence id="695">And it is also absolutely obvious, and it couldn't be different, that for Lithuanians, maybe still the ger -- e-e-especially after the deportation, that for the Lithuanians still, the Germans are better, and for the Jews are still the Soviets better. </sentence><sentence id="696">And I learned now recently, I was calling our institute of resistance on genocide, and I ask them how many people were deported, and how many people came back from Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="697">So I was told that in "41, the last    information is 17,000. </sentence><sentence id="698">After the war it was hundred -- about 130,000. </sentence><sentence id="699">So -- including the Jews, who were also deported. </sentence><sentence id="700">So, as a whole, about 150,000. </sentence><sentence id="701">Now, from the people who were deported in 1941, only about 20 percent came back, but from the people -- but these are so not very precise figures. </sentence><sentence id="702">And fa -- from the people who were deported in -- after the war, until deg51 or deg50 -- I don't know how long, think un-until "51, or maybe "53, I don't remember now exactly, the deportation -- 70 percent came back. </sentence><sentence id="703">From the Holocaust very few people came back, so it was still even better in -- in the -- for -- for Jews it's a paradox, but in some way they were saved. </sentence><sentence id="704">And for instance our -- such a Jewish writer, Josade, he saved his parents from deportation and he could -- he suffered his whole life. </sentence><sentence id="705">Actually, you made a film about him, he suffered his whole life, that he really killed his parents because he saved them from the Soviet deportation. </sentence><sentence id="706">They got killed in -- in the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="707">So it is -- yeah. </sentence><sentence id="708">But, also among the Lithuanian, I would say, intellige -- intelligentsia, among the loudeninke, this was the m-m -- the Volkspartei, the -- no, they were not socialists, but close to socialists. </sentence><sentence id="709">So they were thinking, what's better, the Germans or the Soviets? </sentence><sentence id="710">And they decided better the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="711">Why? </sentence><sentence id="712">Because under Germany, under the German governance, for instance, Prussia disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="713">No -- no -- no traces of Prussia any more. </sentence><sentence id="714">And under the Tsarist time, which was 200 years, we not only didn't disappear, but we developed our, in Lithuania, the resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="715">The -- the -- re-revival of the nation. </sentence><sentence id="716">So, that e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet, and better not to deal with the -- with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="717">Then also, some people, they're fascinated, like for instance, Paletskis, or -- or Vanslovar, or Kemontite or Gregorouskas, or other people, they were fascinated by the official [indecipherable], and they thought that even if we join the Soviet Union, we will still stay a Lithuanian republic, and we will have our national culture and rights. </sentence><sentence id="718">So it was, you know -- but after the deportations, then of course, the -- the Wehrmacht, the German army was met by Lithuanians with flowers. </sentence><sentence id="719">So -- but that's also understandable, because it was like saving from the deportation to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="720">Was a very complicated situation, and is very interesting that in Poland -- you know the story with the [indecipherable] where Poles killed, not -- not -- not Nazis, but Poles killed. </sentence><sentence id="721">So it is also in the region where the Soviets were before, where the deportations took place, and so on, you see? </sentence><sentence id="722">Then there is also another such moment, which can't be forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="723">Of course in -- in -- in Lithuania, the Jews had cultural autonomy and -- autonomy and so on, but it was not such an absolutely equal situation for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="724">Jews couldn't take government positions, high up positions in the army. </sentence><sentence id="725">They served in the army, but not on high -- or very few of them became officers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="726">And they didn't feel like equal citizens of Lithuania, but the in -- the independence times was only 20 years, that's a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="727">And when the Soviets came, so they declared that everybody's equal, and quite a few Jews got into the administration, got into, you know, official positions. </sentence><sentence id="728">I -- I -- sorry -- and -- and it was like an illusion that now we are equal. </sentence><sentence id="729">But this was absolutely illusion. </sentence><sentence id="730">And i -- and I must say ma -- but I came now -- come now a little bit back, my uncle, the brother of my mother, Jorge Stromas is -- was a very, very educated person, he got his education in France and he came back and he had an official position in the -- in -- in the Ministry of Finance, and was very, of course, helpful, but then he had to leave it, because he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="731">So, you see, he was still a -- a very much -- he was a [indecipherable] because he lacked very much the language and so on. </sentence><sentence id="732">But -- but still, he was not completely equal, even such a person as he, who was a -- so, it was very complicated. </sentence><sentence id="733">I don't know if I expressed myself clearly now. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2670">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2672">A: Who were the Jewish neighbors of my grand and grand-grand parents. </sentence><sentence id="2673">So the children are coming out through all Lithuania, to the little cities and finding out who lived here. </sentence><sentence id="2674">And so they go back to history [indecipherable] and -- and learning from -- from this terrible history. </sentence><sentence id="2675">And I must say that we made now about 700 schools -- 700 teachers are working with the Holoto-caust topics. </sentence><sentence id="2676">Holocaust is told in the military s -- academy, and in military schools and the military academy. </sentence><sentence id="2677">A lot i -- we have a lot of educational centers who are dealing with that -- with that issue. </sentence><sentence id="2678">And really hundred, hundred of schools and pupils. </sentence><sentence id="2679">We have now, you know, that Adamkus created the commission to investigate crimes of Nazi times and gu -- Nazi crimes and the gulag. </sentence><sentence id="2680">And we have their commission which also published and found out a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2681">I must say that our genocide center, which was first of all like dealing only with the anti-Soviet movement is now more and more facing also the Holocaust situation. </sentence><sentence id="2682">So I would say that on the academic level it is -- and such educational level, there is already a breakthrough and a dialog. </sentence><sentence id="2683">A lot is really done. </sentence><sentence id="2684">I must also say that when Respublika, for instance, published the article of the chief editor of the newspaper, a terrible article, "Who rules the world?" </sentence><sentence id="2685">And the answer was the Jews and the gays. </sentence><sentence id="2686">You heard, probably, about this article. </sentence><sentence id="2687">So what -- not everybody remembers, but you should remember that the first protest was done by the Lithuanian NGOs, Lithuanian organizations and Lithuanian individuals. </sentence><sentence id="2688">And during two days, this protest against Tomkus's writing was signed by about a hundred organizations, about a hundred individual peoples and much more would sign it if it would -- we would keep -- not me, we -- I didn't, they didn't even allowed me to sign because I am Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2689">Only Lithuanians signed it, really. </sentence><sentence id="2690">So that on -- organizations, not only individual peoples. </sentence><sentence id="2691">So it is really a breakthrough and sometimes you should not forget that it takes time to -- to -- but -- but anti-Semitism is still there and still -- it -- you can't say that it's all over. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2761">A: But they were organized. </sentence><sentence id="2762">No, not 15,000, it's less now. </sentence><sentence id="2763">Vu -- vu-vu -- but I don't want to argue about figures, but I want to say that Lithuanians -- Lithuanians were in a terrible situation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2764">In a terrible situation. </sentence><sentence id="2765">Here deported, it was a shock to the whole nation. </sentence><sentence id="2766">Influenced by a terrible Nazi propaganda, which was also taken as a tool by Luff and by some Lithuanian officials, yeah. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2767">Then, I must say that the past, the -- the antagonistic past which existed between Christians and Jews also had some role to play. </sentence><sentence id="2768">So I -- but -- but the nation was really in a shocking -- ina terrible -- in a terrible state at this very moment. </sentence><sentence id="2769">And it was really, in some way in the beginning [indecipherable] and then it came, of course it's dirty business. </sentence><sentence id="2770">But -- but I can't -- I can't blame -- I will never blame a nation because I know that people were absolutely shocked by what happened [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2771">Q: But I'm not talking about the nation. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2772">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
