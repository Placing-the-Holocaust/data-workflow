<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="460">My family, at that time, we had too much to eat, because we had access to everything at much lower prices than the real Black Market. </sentence><sentence id="461">Those items were on the Black Market, but we were going directly from the Poles to us as I guess going to some middle man in the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="462">So, we did have enough to eat. </sentence><sentence id="463">Grandma again, had a little girl who helped run this place, and as a result my mother was supporting that family, and the tutor's family, and she had two aunts and one uncle. </sentence><sentence id="464">She was supporting them, giving them money so they could buy their food. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: No, it wasn't too severed. </sentence><sentence id="474">But it was, like those two women who were teaching me, there were two sisters that lived with their mother, and they had absolutely no way of getting any money. </sentence><sentence id="475">They were tutoring me and they were tutoring my other friends, so that was their main way of making money. </sentence><sentence id="476">My mother gave orders that when they came in the afternoon, we served a little snack. </sentence><sentence id="477">I didn't need a snack, but by serving some little sandwiches or something the tutor could eat and she didn't have to eat home. </sentence><sentence id="478">So, there were ways of helping people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="521">Q: So, you were still doing all of those things? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1940">A: Sometimes, like I said with the hair. </sentence><sentence id="1941">They couldn't stand the fact that I had hair. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I mean I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1943">I had short hair, but they couldn't stand that. </sentence><sentence id="1944">They didn't have a razor, so they clipped it and said that's to prevent lice. </sentence><sentence id="1945">Because they saw some workers working on the roof, again Polish workers. </sentence><sentence id="1946">I talked to them once. </sentence><sentence id="1947">I don't know how I managed to say something, and I said I could use a stick, and he said fine, tomorrow we'll work on the  6 roof and I'll make you a stick for the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1948">It's like a tongue depressor and he dropped that stick for me, so I could dig into the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1949">They didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="1950">So, the following day, they called me down to the bottom of the thing and said, "We have to cut the hair." </sentence><sentence id="1951">So, they cut some more. </sentence><sentence id="1952">I had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1953">Because except for the block elders and their assistants the rest of them had shaved heads. </sentence><sentence id="1954">How they got there, how they became them, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1955">There was a woman who came along, she was a dentist from Poland, and she kind of asked my mother and said, you know, I can get you a job and so on and she was hinting that my mother has anything she should give it to her and she could arrange for her to get a job as a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="1956">At that time we didn't have anything, and my mother was upset. </sentence><sentence id="1957">She said, if I had the diamond, I could have given her the diamond. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I could have gotten a job. </sentence><sentence id="1959">Lucky for us, we didn't have the diamonds and they sent us out to Bergen- Belsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1980">Q: Why don't you tell me how that came about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1982">A: About two weeks after we were in Auschwitz, they lined up, had another selection. </sentence><sentence id="1983">They took us to the showers, gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1984">I mean if I had a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away. </sentence><sentence id="1985">The tank top was so short, I had a ribbon in the tank top and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my whole behind was showing. </sentence><sentence id="1986">And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they were supposed to send us out. </sentence><sentence id="1987">Then something happened, the trains were not there, and they put us in some temporary barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1988">The following day, they ran another selection. </sentence><sentence id="1989">They gave us a bath, and they put us on the train. </sentence><sentence id="1990">This was the time I really don't know if Auschwitz had two stations or not because this is the only time and I went back to Auschwitz, I remember, we went through the main camp of Auschwitz, because we were in and this was, I saw the red buildings, the permanent buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1991">I saw the band playing. </sentence><sentence id="1992">So, I had a feeling they had some other station in Auschwitz proper which they loaded us. </sentence><sentence id="1993">They unloaded the cars somewhere else, and they put us there. </sentence><sentence id="1994">They put us in cattle cars again. </sentence><sentence id="1995">They give us a piece a bread and a piece of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="1996">There was one water bucket with water, and there was one slop bucket, and they put us on the trains. </sentence><sentence id="1997">I think we were there either two nights or three nights, and one night they stopped somewhere and they brought a fresh bucket of water, and assigned someone to distribute the water. </sentence><sentence id="1998">Brought a little cup and we were supposed to have a sip. </sentence><sentence id="1999">One woman got so frenzied, she grabbed her shoe and dipped it in there and drank from the shoe. </sentence><sentence id="2000">When they give us the clothes, by that time, I've got those laced up shoes with wooden soles. </sentence><sentence id="2001">One was white and one was black, and I had this men's shirt, long flannel thing, blue satin, significant later, I'll tell you about that story. </sentence><sentence id="2002">We stayed, and as I said the train was on and off and on and off. </sentence><sentence id="2003">At night it would stop. </sentence><sentence id="2004">I remember once we were next side there were real cattle making cattle noises. </sentence><sentence id="2005">This was an absolute nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="2006">Later on when I had my typhous fever, all I had I kept on saying, take the train out of my head, get the train out of my head. </sentence><sentence id="2007">That's all I could hear is that. </sentence><sentence id="2008">It took me years before I wanted to take a train anyplace, because even when I was in Europe and we traveled later, I was very reluctant to take a train. </sentence><sentence id="2009">We finally arrived at Bergen-Belsen about maybe the third day. </sentence><sentence id="2010">All the passing and stopping we passed, I think, Dresden. </sentence><sentence id="2011">We saw someone tried to  7 climb up. </sentence><sentence id="2012">We could see the bombed out cities and we were very happy to see those bombed out cities. </sentence><sentence id="2013">I think it must have been the third day. </sentence><sentence id="2014">We felt that another night on the train we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing. </sentence><sentence id="2015">We were getting confused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing where we were going, what we're doing. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Anyway, they took us, we came to Bergen- Belsen, and until that time Bergen-Belsen was not a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2017">They had various camps of various entities, prisoner of war camp, but there was no camp concentration camp as such. </sentence><sentence id="2018">Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to go by truck, and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went. </sentence><sentence id="2019">Otherwise, my mother with the bad leg, she would not go on the truck. </sentence><sentence id="2020">She was afraid, because we knew by now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="2021">We finally got into the main camp. </sentence><sentence id="2022">It was a long, long street. </sentence><sentence id="2023">The front of the street, the beginning of the street, there was administration places, there was a bath, there was a little crematorium which they could burn two bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2024">But this was done for bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2025">It was never done to use it for killing people. </sentence><sentence id="2026">If people died, they would use it. </sentence><sentence id="2027">They gave us a bath and we put our clothes in a little basket, and when we walked out from the other side of the bath, we got the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2028">They marched us down to the end of the street of the town, the very end of the camp, and there was this big tent that could accommodate about 1,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="2029">It was clean. </sentence><sentence id="2030">We all got a blanket each. </sentence><sentence id="2031">On the floor of the tent was wooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used. </sentence><sentence id="2032">There as a latrine in the back right under the guards tower, big pits and there was a couple pieces of wood where you could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2033">There was a wooden trough with pipe. </sentence><sentence id="2034">We could use the water any time we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2035">They nominated one lady, she was from Germany, she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant, she was originally from Germany, so they spoke fluently German. </sentence><sentence id="2036">They counted us once a day. </sentence><sentence id="2037">This camp is located on the , SO it's like heather. </sentence><sentence id="2038">At that time there was fields in back of us, later on they build more and more and more but at that time it was just us and the fields. </sentence><sentence id="2039">So, we could sit in the sun. </sentence><sentence id="2040">We could drink when we wanted, we could go to the toilet when we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2041">Even at night, if you wanted to go to the toilet, -- if the guards heard something going on, he would put the light on, the spot light on, if he heard a movement. </sentence><sentence id="2042">So, maybe they eliminated you when you were using the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="2043">When the girls were sitting there, they would just look. </sentence><sentence id="2044">After a while, you lose all inhibitions, and if they want to look, let them look. </sentence><sentence id="2045">That's what we're going to do. </sentence><sentence id="2046">At that time we didn't have any doctors so the first day, the second day, they brought a big chest with some first aid things and some pills, some equipment. </sentence><sentence id="2047">Mom became the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2048">There was a head dentist, I don't know his name, but he was until the very end, a very, very decent guy. </sentence><sentence id="2049">So, one of the first questions he asked me is "How come your head is shaved?" </sentence><sentence id="2050">They couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="2051">There were SS but they had no idea about the horrors of Auschwitz or the other camps. </sentence><sentence id="2052">They were just half way decent people in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2053">The food we got was paradise next to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2054">Fairly decent soup, we got some kind of coffee in the morning and a nice piece of bread and at night very often they had something, a piece of cheese or some artificial jam or something and Sundays we'd get red cabbage and there was some meat in it and potatoes with jackets and this was the first few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2055">The next few days they put another tent up. </sentence><sentence id="2056">We got a big group of  8 Hungarian women another tent up. </sentence><sentence id="2057">So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that compound, because there were other groups.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2134">Q: All coming from Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2136">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="2137">I think they were coming from Auschwitz because the other ones were Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="2138">Can I tell you something interesting about -- by that time, we didn't have a doctor and they brought a bunch of women from the Warsaw uprising, gentile women. </sentence><sentence id="2139">They were not with us, but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one of the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people were coming in with various ailments, there was one lady who was from Germany, had lost her husband and child. </sentence><sentence id="2140">She was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2141">Her husband was Jewish, and she kind of started becoming administrator to the very end. </sentence><sentence id="2142">She was the administrator of the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2143">As a matter of fact, we saw her in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2144">She survived. </sentence><sentence id="2145">So, we would sleep -- it was so cold, but we would sleep, this Polish doctor, and Lisa and my mother and I would take one blanket and put it underneath us on the shavings and would cover ourselves with the three other blankets. </sentence><sentence id="2146">It was much warmer. </sentence><sentence id="2147">And the body head kept us going. </sentence><sentence id="2148">It was getting cold. </sentence><sentence id="2149">By that time, I think my mother started looking at some teeth. </sentence><sentence id="2150">I mean, checking, also everything on the floor, we had no place to do but, one day we got notified and some people approached Mom and the other women and a few other ones that this is Yom Kippur and the Hungarians are going to have a service and we are invited. </sentence><sentence id="2151">After dark come in one by one and come in, sneak in. </sentence><sentence id="2152">So, one by one, it was very dark, and you know they closed the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2153">Except for the towers, there was no one in camp. </sentence><sentence id="2154">They would close it up, all the Germans would just disappear at darkness. </sentence><sentence id="2155">And we all hide under the blankets. </sentence><sentence id="2156">We wrapped ourselves in blankets and quietly walked into the tent. </sentence><sentence id="2157">They lined up the shavings in such a way they were like benches. </sentence><sentence id="2158">In the very front they made a out of the shavings covered with blanket. </sentence><sentence id="2159">How they got a candle, I do not know, but they had a tiny little candle. </sentence><sentence id="2160">There as a young girl and an elderly woman and they sang the whole out of memory. </sentence><sentence id="2161">And they sung, and they warned us please do not cry, please do not wail, please do not make a sound. </sentence><sentence id="2162">Don't sing, don't do anything, just be quiet, because the Germans would have shot all of us. </sentence><sentence id="2163">I tell you, this was one, even the Polish woman, she was sitting there with the tears running down her eyes, this Polish doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2164">We all sat, and until today I go to services and when I hear the chant, I see that scene because it was eerie. </sentence><sentence id="2165">Can you imagine, by that time there must have been 1,500 women there, like ghosts sitting in the gray blankets listening to the service, and then again, they let us out one by one, two by two, please don't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2166">Don't talk when you walk, just sneak into your own tent. </sentence><sentence id="2167">This was unbelievable, the faith, and as I said we all took chances by attending that service. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2201">Q: Since you were not particularly religious growing up, how did the part of that service make you feel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2203">A: Unbelievable because I knew -- let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="2204">We had a record of one of the  9 famous cantors home so I have heard I don't think I ever went to services, because this was such an Orthodox synagogue, so I couldn't go maybe when I was little kid they took me, Grandfather took me, but I never went. </sentence><sentence id="2205">But I always heard this record, because my father liked that cantor and he had this record. </sentence><sentence id="2206">And I used to play with the record player, so I was very much aware of that chant, and I knew it. </sentence><sentence id="2207">I knew the melody, and I knew that this was something very, very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2213">Q: Was there a special sense of solidarity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2215">A: Solidarity, feeling of something, hope. </sentence><sentence id="2216">To do something like this in such circumstances was unbelievable, especially after Auschwitz where we were so controlled and here we could attend this service. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2219">Q: About the camp, were you isolated from all these other groups? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2221">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2222">Well, the way the camp was done was like I said, wa one long street and there were various sub camps on various sides. </sentence><sentence id="2223">We were aware of several of them, and later on I was aware of more of them. </sentence><sentence id="2224">One was called the stern camp and one was called the diamond camp, and those were the people from Holland and Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="2225">The rumor --they lived with the families at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2226">That's when the children came in. </sentence><sentence id="2227">Rumor was that they paid a lot of money to the Germans to bribe them in terms of giving them diamonds and gold and money, so when they evacuated them, they promised that they'll be kept separate and they'll be kept with the families, and they'll not be destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="2228">Eventually, they separated them. </sentence><sentence id="2229">They sent the parents out and the children were kept and I'll tell you about the children camp a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="2230">They started bringing more and more people to our section, our compound. </sentence><sentence id="2231">It's getting crowded. </sentence><sentence id="2232">One day the tents blew off. </sentence><sentence id="2233">There was a big storm and wind and just the tents collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="2234">So, they put us somewhere temporary, and for a so called hospital they build a little tent in a corner and the rest of the people were in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="2235">And that's the first time I saw myself. </sentence><sentence id="2236">Those barracks had windows. </sentence><sentence id="2237">It was just a temporary measure until they could build some more places for us. </sentence><sentence id="2238">I walked one day, and I saw this person walking without hair and wearing this crazy blue striped dress, and I knew that this original model, there's only one. </sentence><sentence id="2239">No one else has this copy of that. </sentence><sentence id="2240">And I couldn't believe that this was me, and I stood there and I looked at my reflection an I touched my face and I touched my hair. </sentence><sentence id="2241">I couldn't believe -- I mean I was like a little baby, like you show a baby a picture and he says that's me. </sentence><sentence id="2242">That's the way I was. </sentence><sentence id="2243">I couldn't believe that's me. </sentence><sentence id="2244">I looked at the dress and said no there's no other one, that's me. </sentence><sentence id="2245">I'm the only one. </sentence><sentence id="2246">It was a shocking experience to see yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2273">Q: How long had it been since you had seen yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2275">A: This was after Yom Kippur, probably two months or so. </sentence><sentence id="2276">It had to be in October because I don't know exactly when Yom Kippur took place, but this was shortly afterward when the tents were blown down. </sentence><sentence id="2277">So, then one of the people who one of the tasks was one of my friend Alena who went to school with me, her mother was a pediatrician before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2278"> 0 During the war, the beginning of a war, she was run over by a truck, so her face -- she was never a pretty women, but her face was damaged, crooked and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="2279">Well, she became a doctor, and they sent another one, Doctor Annie. </sentence><sentence id="2280">She was a woman born in Russian, went to medical school in Russia, married a French diplomat and she lived in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2281">She was Jewish, but she lived in Germany before Hitler, because he was a French diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="2282">She was a socialite. </sentence><sentence id="2283">She never practiced medicine, but this was our other doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2284">By that time they moved us again. </sentence><sentence id="2285">They build some barracks and they built a so-called hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2286">We were moved like three times. </sentence><sentence id="2287">So, this was when Schnabbles (ph) started coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2288">We had one big room where the patients stayed in the bunk, and one corner we had the staff, and by that time they brought more nurses, must have been about six nurses, seven nurses and two doctors, my girlfriend Alena was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="2289">My mother was there. </sentence><sentence id="2290">On the one window we had this out patient clinic and in the back was a little tiny room and it was a dental office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2307">Q: Excuse me, this is completely separate from the barracks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2309">A: They had access to it. </sentence><sentence id="2310">It was part of the camp, but this was a separate little building. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2311">That's when we started seeing the two I don't know what you call it, the German -- they were like medial corps men, or something. </sentence><sentence id="2312">One was a decent guy, his name was Fisher. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2313">And he liked to grab the girls" boobs. </sentence><sentence id="2314">So, we gave him a name of Fisher Tapper. </sentence><sentence id="2315">Tapper in Jewish is to tap, to grab it, and he liked to grab whenever he could when no one else was looking. </sentence><sentence id="2316">The other one was obnoxious. </sentence><sentence id="2317">He was a young fellow and we called him the pig, so I don't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="2318">And Doctor Schnabbles started coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2319">He was an elderly man, according to rumors again, he was a nose and ear man. </sentence><sentence id="2320">He was checking what patients and what cases we have. </sentence><sentence id="2321">One of the first patients which he started doing something with, was a woman came on the transport, had a compound fracture of her tibia. </sentence><sentence id="2322">The skin was broken, the bone was sticking out. </sentence><sentence id="2323">It was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="2324">They put some kind of a metal frame around it and she had to be operated on. </sentence><sentence id="2325">So, he decided -- first of all, it was cool. </sentence><sentence id="2326">He never would take off his coat. </sentence><sentence id="2327">He did all his surgeries in his coat. </sentence><sentence id="2328">He decided to set the leg. </sentence><sentence id="2329">Well, he was not very successful. </sentence><sentence id="2330">So, the pediatrician opened up her mouth and said, "Doctor, don't you think you should do this and that?" </sentence><sentence id="2331">Well, that was the end of her. </sentence><sentence id="2332">She was ugly as it is, he didn't like it with the scars and all on her face, but that put her in disfavor. </sentence><sentence id="2333">We had two guys were watching, he tried to set the leg. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2334">He never did. </sentence><sentence id="2335">The woman was crippled. </sentence><sentence id="2336">She survived the war, I think, but she was in the hospital with us all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2337"> 1 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2338">A: So, the first time he started setting that leg, it never took. </sentence><sentence id="2339">Well, Schnabble was looking always for patients, what he could operate on. </sentence><sentence id="2340">He was always checking what we have. </sentence><sentence id="2341">At that time, our staff consisted of Lisa, who the director of the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2342">We had a scribe because they wanted reports. </sentence><sentence id="2343">How many patients were admitted, what they were coming in for, what sicknesses we had and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="2344">There must have been six or seven nurses, and then we had two orderly ladies. </sentence><sentence id="2345">We even had like a little toilet in the back. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Those two women had to take the stuff out, but we had like a little outhouse attached to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2347">I don't remember what we had later, but that one I knew we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2550">Q: Were people coming in for all kinds of conditions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2552">A: Everything, and I can tell you, describe the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2553">There was one thing, dental condition, which I think it's called , where pieces of gums and lips would rot, decompose, and they would come in sometimes with a whole mouth missing, lips missing. </sentence><sentence id="2554">I remember once three sisters came. </sentence><sentence id="2555">One was completely gone. </sentence><sentence id="2556">The other one had quite an advanced case. </sentence><sentence id="2557">The third one had just started, and every once in a while we got vitamins. </sentence><sentence id="2558">I mean we got all kinds of crazy things, which were odds and ends from various shipments, because the rest of the supplies -- oh yes, they used to give us once in a while paper bandages, and peroxide and some vitamins maybe and some aspirins. </sentence><sentence id="2559">We did get some stuff, but it was little odds and ends like vitamin C. You had to use ; the one who got the shot of vitamin C was the one who had the least advanced case of that cancer of the mouth, because we felt one or two shots may prevent that thing to spread further and maybe we could save. </sentence><sentence id="2560">The oldest one, there was no way of saving. </sentence><sentence id="2561">She was, for all practical -- maybe here in the United States with heavy doses of vitamins and heavy doses of medication, maybe one could save her, maybe, maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="2562">But certainly you couldn't save her. </sentence><sentence id="2563">This was what we had to do. </sentence><sentence id="2564">There was another thing which later came up, much later. </sentence><sentence id="2565">A patient would come in with a little blister and the blister would get bigger and bigger and bigger. </sentence><sentence id="2566">Unless that blister was opened and drained very often half of the body was covered with the blister. </sentence><sentence id="2567">What did this? </sentence><sentence id="2568">I don't know, because I'll tell you later about the British doctors who were there and we used to tell them what to do with it, because they had no idea what to do with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2586">Q: How did you figure it out? </sentence><sentence id="2587"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2590">A: We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and drained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever we had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if it wasn't too advanced case of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2592">Q: Did you have enough supplies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2594">A: No, I'll tell you about that later. </sentence><sentence id="2595">Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid stories I ever saw. </sentence><sentence id="2596">A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix inflamed. </sentence><sentence id="2597">It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2598">What do you have. </sentence><sentence id="2599">See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical guy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the stairs. </sentence><sentence id="2600">When he comes in in the morning to pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="2601">You had to hand him that while he was on the run. </sentence><sentence id="2602">He was awful, screaming, yelling. </sentence><sentence id="2603">Anyway, Schnabble came in and found out that girl is complaining about appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2604">He decided he is going to operate. </sentence><sentence id="2605">Felt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he wearing his coat. </sentence><sentence id="2606">We set up the surgery in the dental office. </sentence><sentence id="2607">He ordered his help, the Russian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood. </sentence><sentence id="2608">It was raining. </sentence><sentence id="2609">It was sleeting, so I started a fire in that little wooden stove. </sentence><sentence id="2610">He assigned my mother to the anesthesia. </sentence><sentence id="2611">She was his favorite anesthetist. </sentence><sentence id="2612">The anesthesia consisted of a little mask, a little cage that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the bottle. </sentence><sentence id="2613">No other support, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2614">Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one other girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2615">He opened her up, couldn't find her appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2616">He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks suspicious, he was ready to cut this out. </sentence><sentence id="2617">This was the bladder. </sentence><sentence id="2618">It looks like a fish bladder. </sentence><sentence id="2619">He poked around. </sentence><sentence id="2620">He decided he can't find the appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2621">He took all the intestines out. </sentence><sentence id="2622">And the conditions are not sterile exactly. </sentence><sentence id="2623">I mean the fire which was going there, it's full of soot and he can't find it. </sentence><sentence id="2624">Put everything back together, took everything out again. </sentence><sentence id="2625">He still can't find her appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2626">At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring Alenluf (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2627">Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main compound or where he was, but he was in the men's camp, and I understand he was a very known surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="2628">Well, a guy went on the bicycle and Doctor Alenluf was running after him. </sentence><sentence id="2629">In the meantime, we kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2630">I grab Alenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him. </sentence><sentence id="2631">That's what I manage because by now he's very impatient. </sentence><sentence id="2632">Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not infected at all, and closed her up. </sentence><sentence id="2633">She developed peritonitis. </sentence><sentence id="2634">For three days that woman was in a coma screaming and he was coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2635">He sent morphine. </sentence><sentence id="2636">He sent painkillers. </sentence><sentence id="2637">He also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything. </sentence><sentence id="2638">It lasted three days, and she died. </sentence><sentence id="2639">But this was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="2640">And you can't say anything, and he's pulling out all of her intestines out on the table and back into the cavity and back on the table and back in the cavity. </sentence><sentence id="2641">It was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And you have to stand there with a poker face and don't say a word, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2643">You can't react. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And even this Doctor Alenluf, very gingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2645">He just did his job and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2646">This was one of the worst things which I witnessed. </sentence><sentence id="2647">Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women. </sentence><sentence id="2648">We had a bunch of  5 syringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that we need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would cut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And we had some pain killers and we had something if someone had an attack of something. </sentence><sentence id="2650">We also had babies. </sentence><sentence id="2651">There were babies born. </sentence><sentence id="2652">We had one woman once who knocked on the door in the middle of the night and said she's in labor, and our administrator went over, Doctor Annie went over to the tower and said, look we have a woman in labor. </sentence><sentence id="2653">None of us is a midwife. </sentence><sentence id="2654">So, they came in. </sentence><sentence id="2655">The two guys, and they went from barrack to barrack and they found a midwife and the baby was delivered. </sentence><sentence id="2656">I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von Jordan, because there was a ditch over there and he said this is River Jordan. </sentence><sentence id="2657">And the following day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the baby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not survive. </sentence><sentence id="2658">But, they didn't take away the babies. </sentence><sentence id="2659">They didn't kill the babies. </sentence><sentence id="2660">They didn't do any harm to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3376">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3377">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3378">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3379">We had lines every day. </sentence><sentence id="3380">As a matter of fact, after we were liberated they took everybody to Bergen, but in the meantime the British helped us clean up some of -- they whitewashed some of the buildings, and I stayed another month or so, maybe another few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3381">No, we liberated the 15th of April, the 8th of May I was still in the old place and they gave us new blankets and we were still admitting people and still taking care of it because the healthy ones they could process and take to Bergen, which was a military camp, and they placed them there. </sentence><sentence id="3382">The sick ones, they had a whole procedure they had to -- and they were magnificent. </sentence><sentence id="3383">They would take them in and they would bathe them on stretches and they would shower them and they cleaned their heads. </sentence><sentence id="3384">And they were basically British soldiers and dress the wounds and place them in hospital barracks. </sentence><sentence id="3385">This was a very slow process. </sentence><sentence id="3386">In the meantime, people were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="3387">They needed help now, and by that time we had some supplies. </sentence><sentence id="3388">So, we were admitting some of them and we were treating some of them on an outpatient basis, but at least we had some bandages and supplies. </sentence><sentence id="3389">We had some medications. </sentence><sentence id="3390">If they had a headache, we could give them aspirin. </sentence><sentence id="3391">I mean things like this, and they were still getting sick. </sentence><sentence id="3392">They were still getting typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3393">That thing was still raging, and the British soldiers were all inoculated and toward the end there was a rumor they were going to evacuate the camp, like they did in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3394">There was a march. </sentence><sentence id="3395">There was a group that went on trains, and I think the trains were bombed, and I think some of the Dutch Jews perished that way. </sentence><sentence id="3396">Anyway, there was a rumor that the camp is mine and they are going to evacuate the camp and whoever can walk and the rest of the people will go, and the girls came over to me, the nurses that wanted to distribute some of the medicine what you have and the syringes and everything and they said, "Are you going to walk?" </sentence><sentence id="3397">I said, "No, I'm not leaving Mom, and she can't walk. </sentence><sentence id="3398">I'm staying no matter what happened." </sentence><sentence id="3399">Well, that night we had bombs and they bombed this was Lindenberg, the Allies bombed a nearby town and a day or two later we saw all the Germans walking -- the British didn't come in yet, but they were walking with the white arm bands and for some reason I was sent out to either get the soup or get some supplies and I was passing the baths, the sauna and our favorite the guy, the pig, this German, he was burning paper in this sauna, in the furnace. </sentence><sentence id="3400">They were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3401">They were still in charge, and they came in and they wore the arm bands, didn't discuss anything, but at the same time the day the British came in there was a cook, a German cook in one of the kitchens, and they were supposed to be working. </sentence><sentence id="3402">He said, I have another few bullets and I'm going to shoot all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3403">He killed a girl, wounded one, and the British were not in, the Germans were half way in and out. </sentence><sentence id="3404">By that time we were guarded by Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="3405">The guards were all released, outside guards. </sentence><sentence id="3406">And there  4 was a group of Hungarians and they were guarding the camp with the guns. </sentence><sentence id="3407">This was a German, and they felt, they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3408">One of the girls was brought in. </sentence><sentence id="3409">She walked out, she said, "We are free. </sentence><sentence id="3410">We are liberated." </sentence><sentence id="3411">Bang, and she was gone. </sentence><sentence id="3412">What has happened, when the British came in the 15th of April the tank went through, waved the flag, everybody say hooray and they went out and we are still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking. </sentence><sentence id="3413">Well, it was in the afternoon, they just went in until they could organize themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3414">Then they discovered the bodies so they called all the officers and the soldiers and they had to remove the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="3415">Some of the girls were nuts. </sentence><sentence id="3416">They were distributing the food in metal cans and they were rusting. </sentence><sentence id="3417">One of the girls saved the rations which was pretty awful and rotten and become spoiled and she wanted one of the Germans to eat it. </sentence><sentence id="3418">And the Germans were guarded by the British because otherwise the mob would have torn them apart. </sentence><sentence id="3419">There was a language problem, but this one somehow managed to convey to the British soldier that she doesn't want to do any harm. </sentence><sentence id="3420">She just wants that German to eat that food, and he made him eat it. </sentence><sentence id="3421">The funny thing is, I went once to see this removal of the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="3422">It was a frantic scene. </sentence><sentence id="3423">The girls were screaming and yelling and hollering and they wanted to pull on the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3424">I went once to see it, but I just couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="3425">I also went out, I think one day after they liberated us and I went out -- the gates between the compounds were open. </sentence><sentence id="3426">The main street was open. </sentence><sentence id="3427">That's where you saw this unbelievable mob of people walking with all kinds of clothing because they broke into the depots and whatever they could wear, the funniest outfits and funny things, and people were milling, looking for friends and that's how I went to the men's place, the men's camp to look for people from my town and people who I knew, and I found this one boy who had a very bad eye infection and got him doctors and got him to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="3428">He lost his eye but he survived. </sentence><sentence id="3429">He's alive. </sentence><sentence id="3430">He lives in California. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3492">A: Well, once the bombing took place nearby, a couple of days before the British came in, and that's where the German headquarters surrendered and therefore the Germans were wearing the white armbands. </sentence><sentence id="3493">They were ready for take over and by that time, except the crazy shooters, the ones we were in contact with, they were okay. </sentence><sentence id="3494">Even the one that was screaming, he was always quiet. </sentence><sentence id="3495">I saw him burn the papers and I don't remember why I went out, either to pick up some supplies because we still could not walk between the compounds on the main street, but for some reason I was sent for something, I think we were sent to the kitchen for soups. </sentence><sentence id="3496">By that time they were not delivering and that's why I went with a group of girls, and that's when I saw him burning those papers frantically. </sentence><sentence id="3497">They were packing and he didn't even see us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3504">Q: They weren't trying to convince you how nice they were or anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3518">A: Unbelievable feeling of relief. </sentence><sentence id="3519">Just went out to see them and we all went out to see them. </sentence><sentence id="3520">First the people came in and said the British tank went in. </sentence><sentence id="3521">I think I've seen the British tank. </sentence><sentence id="3522">They were shooting, so we were afraid to walk around. </sentence><sentence id="3523">The Germans were still shooting and the Hungarians were still watching. </sentence><sentence id="3524">You couldn't go outside of the camp and after they finally took all the guns from those Germans, then you went out. </sentence><sentence id="3525">That's when I went to the main, on the main street and I saw this unbelievable motley crew of people. </sentence><sentence id="3526">Some of them were still dying. </sentence><sentence id="3527">Some of them were hardly moving. </sentence><sentence id="3528">There were bodies around, but whoever could move, they were moving. </sentence><sentence id="3529">They were walking, and they were smiling. </sentence><sentence id="3530">And unfortunately, there were so many people who died still after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="3531">It was incredible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3546">Q: How did the British treat you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3548">A: The liberators treated us very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3549">The first day they decided we are starving so they brought soup, and the soup was very rich, and we all ate the soup and all got deathly ill. </sentence><sentence id="3550">Our bodies could not absorb this fat, so everybody got sick. </sentence><sentence id="3551">We overate that soup. </sentence><sentence id="3552">It was a thick, I remember, with a coat of fat on top. </sentence><sentence id="3553">They were very anxious to help us. </sentence><sentence id="3554">The British would as I aid the British soldiers as such they were beautiful towards the patients. </sentence><sentence id="3555">The British officers they were just -- later on they were funny, we had to fight  6 them, but in the beginning they were just very compassionate it. </sentence><sentence id="3556">Then they realized that the food they were giving us we can not take this very rich food, so they started giving us like a diet food for a while until we could adjust. </sentence><sentence id="3557">They were giving us those little K rations. </sentence><sentence id="3558">They were giving us cigarettes and chewing gum and some lemonade and some cookies and were giving some tins of those cookies. </sentence><sentence id="3559">I decided to smoke a cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="3560">Mom said, I don't want you to smoke until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3561">The war was still on, so the 8th of May and I was sitting and the cannons and you could hear the war was over and there were announcements and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="3562">I took a package of those -- I had a whole bunch of those little player cigarettes and I was smoking one after another. </sentence><sentence id="3563">She said, I told you not to smoke. </sentence><sentence id="3564">She was so sick, she said I told you not to smoke. </sentence><sentence id="3565">I said, "Mom, the war is over. </sentence><sentence id="3566">I'm smoking." </sentence><sentence id="3567">This was like an act of rebellion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3588">Q: How come you remained in the camp for a while after the British liberated you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3590">A: They needed some people to be still there because as I said, the transfer of the patients was such a slow one they needed us. </sentence><sentence id="3591">It took them a while, maybe a week, ten days, two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3592">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3593">And she was so sick, so I stayed. </sentence><sentence id="3594">I couldn't move her. </sentence><sentence id="3595">By the time we got to Bergen, they didn't have any more room, so there was this huge officers" casino and they converted this to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="3596">This was the end of everybody in Bergen. </sentence><sentence id="3597">And they had this huge ballroom, it held about 170 beds. </sentence><sentence id="3598">The place was gorgeous. </sentence><sentence id="3599">It was a round building. </sentence><sentence id="3600">They called it the round house. </sentence><sentence id="3601">Out of the ballroom, there was a magnificent terrace. </sentence><sentence id="3602">And Rhododendron blooming around, it was just gorgeous. </sentence><sentence id="3603">There were a couple rooms where they had the casino, but they removed all the tables and they patients there. </sentence><sentence id="3604">I think the paper I gave you was signed by this doctor who became the head of this thing. </sentence><sentence id="3605">At that time our staff consisted of British doctors. </sentence><sentence id="3606">They were volunteers, second or third year medical students. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3624">Q: Your hospital was transferred to the town of Bergen? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3630">Q: Did they burn down or do anything with the old quarters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3632">A: I'll tell you that. </sentence><sentence id="3633">So, we had rooms there. </sentence><sentence id="3634">Mom started working a little bit there was a dental office there, but she had swollen legs. </sentence><sentence id="3635">She was just working a few hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="3636">They had the most beautifully equipped kitchen I have ever seen. </sentence><sentence id="3637">I don't know if many fancy restaurants here have kitchens, fully electric, they could cook a few hundred eggs at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="3638">They had frying pans they could turn upside down by touching a button. </sentence><sentence id="3639">It was just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="3640">There were naturally, a couple of elderly Germans running that kitchen for us. </sentence><sentence id="3641">They claimed that they never knew anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="3642">As I started telling you there was the British doctor who was the head. </sentence><sentence id="3643">A few British nurses, we had British volunteer students at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3644">A bunch of us, a few French nuns came from France and  7 they brought in a bunch of German nurses, and there was one ward with people with t.b., </sentence><sentence id="3645">diarrhea, as sick as they come. </sentence><sentence id="3646">The British assigned our girls to that room, and the room that had 170 beds they were basically convalescing, and they gave the German nurses this. </sentence><sentence id="3647">And we went on strike. </sentence><sentence id="3648">The rationale was that since some of the very sick people cannot don't know what's going on and the Germans may harm them and we will be much more compassionate to them. </sentence><sentence id="3649">Our argument was that we all went through typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3650">We are all very weak, and there's no reason for us to be exposed at this point to t.b. </sentence><sentence id="3651">and diarrhea and we should be assigned the convalescent, which was a much lighter load and let the Germans work there. </sentence><sentence id="3652">So, we went on strike. </sentence><sentence id="3653">We had a translator girl who spoke English and finally got through his head that this was the right thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="3654">But he was very much afraid what will happen. </sentence><sentence id="3655">We said we will supervise. </sentence><sentence id="3656">We'll check, and the nurses were busting because they were all registered nurses. </sentence><sentence id="3657">We were all a motley crew. </sentence><sentence id="3658">We didn't have uniforms, I mean, like a butcher's apron. </sentence><sentence id="3659">We had nothing, and we were watching what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="3660">Another thing I was very happy to do, they would send the women from the town from Bergen to clean the hospital and we had this was the ballroom, it had a gorgeous parquet floor and we made them wash the floor twice a day. </sentence><sentence id="3661">They would come in the morning to clean, and they would come in the afternoon to clean, and God forbid that they left a dry spot. </sentence><sentence id="3662">Wash it, the German word was . [ </sentence><sentence id="3663">couldn't speak German very well, but this was a funny feeling, you know, I was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="3664">So, little by little our big ward would empty because they were getting better and getting out. </sentence><sentence id="3665">The British, I started telling you about the British soldiers even before when they had this blister disease. </sentence><sentence id="3666">Once, I remember one of the young fellows came and he was getting ready, he found a patient with a blister thing and he was getting ready for a serious surgery. </sentence><sentence id="3667">I took him on the side, I said you are the doctor, I'm not, but we have had such experience with it, you don't have to do serious surgery, just make sure you lance it and drain it and then if you have -- they didn't have antibiotics but I think sulfur or whatever they had, something to dress the wound and she'll be okay, because she didn't have tremendous blisters. </sentence><sentence id="3668">He did it. </sentence><sentence id="3669">They were still students. </sentence><sentence id="3670">A lot of them got sick. </sentence><sentence id="3671">They left and we had a group of Belgium medical students, volunteers and they were not treated by the British very well. </sentence><sentence id="3672">They used to mooch the cigarettes from us because we used to have all the cigarettes from the British. </sentence><sentence id="3673">We were getting those packets every day. </sentence><sentence id="3674">Somehow they resented that. </sentence><sentence id="3675">Those guys, I think they were older, and they were just very good, trying to help the people and take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="3676">The British burned Bergen-Belsen as they emptied it. </sentence><sentence id="3677">They left one building standing and I don't know when there was a ceremony and we were invited, taken in by trucks. </sentence><sentence id="3678">I think there is a picture at the Holocaust Museum of that ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="3679">This was when they raised the words of General Glen Hughes who was the Second British Army. </sentence><sentence id="3680">He said that now they can raise the British flag because this awful place doesn't exit any more and the ceremony was that they threw flame throwers burned the last barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3681">Whether the administration building still stands, I don't know, but this was the last thing and they raised the British flag over it because they never raise a British flag over a place as horrid as Bergen-Belsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
