<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Tell me about your family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: My father owned a pharmacy in Baden-Baden, and he and my mother had three children. </sentence><sentence id="20">I have one sister who lives here in New Jersey, and my older sister passed away a few years ago in Majorca. </sentence><sentence id="21">We had a good youth, a very nice up-bringing. </sentence><sentence id="22">I went to primary school for three years. </sentence><sentence id="23">I, after that I entered the Gymnasium for nine years and received baccalaureate. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="24">By that time, the political situa...the political situation in Germany wasn't too rosy and there was a lot of unemployment. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was supposed to enter a pharmacy in the province as an apprentice. </sentence><sentence id="26">But when I was ready, they were not in a position to accept me anymore. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="27">Because the uh Nazis, while not in power yet, had quite some influence and everybody was afraid to accept a Jewish apprentice. </sentence><sentence id="28">As far as my Jewish upbringing, there was none. </sentence><sentence id="29">My parents were quite assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="30">And Jewish religion, never. </sentence><sentence id="31">We just... nothing there was said. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="32">And I became more aware of my religion only through the Nazi revo...uh Nazi... Not revolution. </sentence><sentence id="33">I mean, when they came into power. </sentence><sentence id="34">In 1932, after matriculation, I left my home town for Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="35">We had had an exchange program with a family in the town of Nyon on the Lake of Geneva, and there were still about six weeks that they owed us. </sentence><sentence id="36">So I spent six weeks there. </sentence><sentence id="37">And after that, through some friends and through a office of the League of Nations, I got a job on a farm in uh Switzerland, on a...behind the city, the town, of Vevey, on Lake...on the Lake of Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was tough times there. </sentence><sentence id="39">If I had had the money to go back home after I had arrived there, I would probably have turned around and gone back home. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="40">Instead of that, I had to get up about five o'clock in the morning to start cleaning the pig's sty and then the cows and then the horses. </sentence><sentence id="41">And everybody spoke French and I didn't know that much French when I got there, but I quickly had to learn whether I liked it or not. </sentence><sentence id="42">I stayed there for about two months and then the farmer sent me with a...with one man and about twenty cows up in the Alps where he had meadows and I stayed there for another two months "til the beginning of September of "32. </sentence><sentence id="43">Yeah, 1932. </sentence><sentence id="44">By that time, uh my father had been able to get me an apprenticeship in a mechanical factory in the Black Forest which was owned by friends of his. </sentence><sentence id="45">I went through a two year apprenticeship, commercial apprenticeship, the end of which I had to go through an examination for commercial  assistance by the Chamber of Commerce. </sentence><sentence id="46">Fortunately, during that time, the after (ph)  mainly giving language lessons there, and after some weeks, I got various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="47">I had brought a typewriter with me and a pair of skis. </sentence><sentence id="48">Nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="49">The pair of skis was to show that I was a student. </sentence><sentence id="50">I was not apt to forget my favorite sport. </sentence><sentence id="51">And, believe it or not, I did go skiing in Greece--in the Peloponnese--which was nice. </sentence><sentence id="52">I got various jobs in Greece and the mentality there of the people who employed me was such that they would trust me more than any of their other employees which was to my advantage. </sentence><sentence id="53">I worked in a technical office where we imported all kinds of electrical equipment from the rest of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="54">They considered very small as outside of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="55">I think at that time I worked for them for three years. </sentence><sentence id="56">Then in, after working for him which was actually part-time, I went in the late afternoon to a newspaper distributing office to - whom I had been recommended to and uh the way I, my first impression of that job was quite interesting. </sentence><sentence id="57">The uh owner of the (ph), which means (ph) newspaper agency, took me to the office of the foreign newspaper  one foreign consulate to the other in Athens to try and get a place to uh go to. </sentence><sentence id="58">And this was quite difficult. </sentence><sentence id="59">We once thought we had a, we thought to go to Paraguay but when we went to buy steamship tickets, we found out that that consul was only an honorary consul, and wasn't supposed to give visas out and after some difficulty we got half our money back. </sentence><sentence id="60">Then thanks to my father's connection with the Free Masons - it's a masonic order in Athens - we found a man in the British Embassy who helped to get us out. </sentence><sentence id="61">His connection through the CID caused them to check our family tree. </sentence><sentence id="62">And they found--which we knew, which was correct--that my mother was related to Walter Rathenau, who had been the foreign secretary of the Weimar Republic after the First World War and who also was about the first victim of Nazi murder in 1923 already. </sentence><sentence id="63">They told us we could proceed any place in the British Empire we wanted to go to, provided we had the means to do so. </sentence><sentence id="64">Closest place was the island of Cyprus; but Cyprus required for anyone who came there one thousand pounds to show in cash. </sentence><sentence id="65">We didn't have that kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="66">So the British Ambassador in Athens caused them to reduce this amount to a thousand pounds for the whole family--for the four of us--which was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="67">The only drawback was we didn't have the thousand pounds. </sentence><sentence id="68">And I managed to go to the two main employers I had, and I borrowed from each one five hundred pounds in Greek money. </sentence><sentence id="69">So we put that on an account in Cyprus, and we were...we managed to go back to Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="70">Half a year later, I could send them the money back. </sentence><sentence id="71">But that was uh a break we got, because without this help from the British Ambassador I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="72">We arrived in Cyprus in the beginning of March of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="73">And in uh...in the town of Limassol, my father promptly got sick. </sentence><sentence id="74">We were stuck there in a small hotel for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="75">After that we moved to the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia. </sentence><sentence id="76">I got a job in an import office, and my sister got a job in another...in a technical office also. </sentence><sentence id="77">But in September of "39, when Italy entered the war, I came to my office and I found a note in the typewriter: "Do not come back." </sentence><sentence id="78">Because business was dead; and besides, that he told me after he was not to employee enemy aliens. </sentence><sentence id="79">I then got work in a small sausage factory which had been bought by a couple of Austrian Jewish refugees. </sentence><sentence id="80">They needed somebody who spoke Greek and English, because neither of one did...uh of them did. </sentence><sentence id="81">And for some weeks, I sold sausage-- much to the embarrassment of my parents, who would never come to the store but who liked to eat the sausage I brought home. </sentence><sentence id="82">After that, thanks to the Commissioner in Nicosia, the British Commissioner, I got a job in the asbestos mines. </sentence><sentence id="83">They didn't know anything about asbestos was dangerous, and thank God it didn't do any harm to me. </sentence><sentence id="84">But uh I went up there. </sentence><sentence id="85">I worked in the bookkeeping department for, I think, it's only about a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="86">And eventually the uh director of the mine put a house at my disposal, and my parents and my sister could come up there to stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="87">Because in the meantime, things had gotten worse politically. </sentence><sentence id="88">And uh when the Germans overrun Greece I think every refugee and every person who had arrived in...on Cyprus with German papers was interned. </sentence><sentence id="89">They opened an internment camp right next to the prison in Athens, for the men only. </sentence><sentence id="90">Women they left alone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">And in that camp were mostly Jews--maybe about twenty real Germans who were kept strictly to themselves. </sentence><sentence id="92">Was not a very good time, because that we were staying in tents. </sentence><sentence id="93">It was uh... whenever a wind came up there was a lot of dirt in the air and we had to work out what we were going to eat every day. </sentence><sentence id="94">I was more or less in charge of that, again because I knew the languages and somewhere . . . </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: They did not feed you? </sentence><sentence id="96">You had to... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: No, well they told us what... "Here's what you get every week. </sentence><sentence id="98">You make your own menu." </sentence><sentence id="99">And I still have somewhere menus or a menu. </sentence><sentence id="100">I don't have it with me, but if I find it I'll make a copy. </sentence><sentence id="101">So that kept me busy. </sentence><sentence id="102">Besides that, they gave us a couple of packets of cigarettes every day. </sentence><sentence id="103">And due to the fact that my father was a heavy smoker, I stopped smoking at that time. </sentence><sentence id="104">He got my cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh after about a month in that tent camp, the authorities realized that that was not a good place to leave us because people got sick. </sentence><sentence id="106">And they moved the camp to a hotel up in the mountains of Greece. </sentence><sentence id="107">Beautiful place called [Berengaria (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="108">And it was naturally behind fence, wire fence; but otherwise it was just like a vacation. </sentence><sentence id="109">What I mean is there was a village nearby, and all the ladies rented rooms there to come and visit. </sentence><sentence id="110">And at the same time, the government started checking the individual papers of the people they had caught up in their net of internment. </sentence><sentence id="111">My father was one of the first to be released. </sentence><sentence id="112">And about three weeks later, I was let go. </sentence><sentence id="113">And I went back to my work in the asbestos mine. </sentence><sentence id="114">We all went back there, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: What was Cyprus like...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Cyprus was a beautiful place, actually. </sentence><sentence id="136">At that time, the British had about two hundred troops on Cyprus--which kept the peace between Turkish and Greek inhabitants. </sentence><sentence id="137">I saw quite a bit of Cyprus while moving around. </sentence><sentence id="138">There have beautiful beaches, and the uh city or the town of Nicosia had some amazing Gothic architecture in their churches... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: I guess what I'm asking--excuse me--is not so much physically what the island is like, but what was it like in wartime--under war conditions--for a Jew living in Cyprus. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Things were rationed, for one thing. </sentence><sentence id="146">And uh the Jews, Jewish refugees--thanks also to the internship--they got to know each other, and they drew together. </sentence><sentence id="147">There was no organization yet at that time. </sentence><sentence id="148">But that came a little bit later with the uh evacuation. </sentence><sentence id="149">But we knew quite a few people, and uh we attended uh services which was to some extent a first for me at that time. </sentence><sentence id="150">Naturally, after moving up to the asbestos mine I had no connection ...we had no connection. </sentence><sentence id="151">We were the only Jews there with the exception of the uh mine physician, who was a Russian man who had come in 1905 due to the pogroms and who didn't admit to anybody that he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="152">Also did not come on the evacuations. </sentence><sentence id="153">But he and my father got friendly, so... And I had no time to be friendly. </sentence><sentence id="154">After all, there were also rules that after work, after sundown, none of us were allowed to leave the house. </sentence><sentence id="155">That was strict instructions, and uh it was known in community in the asbestos mine. </sentence><sentence id="156">So we stayed, and we had a radio. </sentence><sentence id="157">That was that. </sentence><sentence id="158">I only...there was only one store in the whole place, and I went there to buy our ration. </sentence><sentence id="159">Every week we had a half a pound of butter, which my father got because at that time nobody thought that there was anything wrong with eating butter. </sentence><sentence id="160">And we were quite lonely. </sentence><sentence id="161">I wrote during that time in German a treaty [NB: treatise] on my stay in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="162">One of these days, I might translate it. </sentence><sentence id="163">And we stayed there until June "41. </sentence><sentence id="164">We, naturally, knew what was going on in the world. </sentence><sentence id="165">But Cyprus, being away from everything, we did not pay too much attention until the Nazis invaded Crete. </sentence><sentence id="166">They got the island of Crete  without any difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="167">And then, suddenly, the good inhabitants of Cyprus became very anxious to learn German. </sentence><sentence id="168">Under the leadership of their bishop, a man Makarios--who afterwards what became President of the Greek part of Cyprus--they became very uh friendly towards the expected German invasion. </sentence><sentence id="169">And we were worried. </sentence><sentence id="170">Then uh in June of "41, my father got a wire that he should be ready for evacuation within four days in the capital, Nicosia. </sentence><sentence id="171">He had no money saved, because we were living from hand to mouth on whatever little money I made. </sentence><sentence id="172">So in this twen...within twenty-four hours, we had a big sale of all our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="173">We found that for evacuation we only...we are allowed to take two pieces of luggage each, and no more luggage than each one of us could carry. </sentence><sentence id="174">Now we...during the short hours, we had to decide what to pack. </sentence><sentence id="175">We had to try and buy some pieces of luggage from people there, and we had to be so that we had some money in  During these air raids we would meet. </sentence><sentence id="176">Because my father was staying with one family, my mother with another, my sister with another, and I with another. </sentence><sentence id="177">In the evening, everybody went downstairs in the air raid...air raid shelter, and everybody along came. </sentence><sentence id="178">That was when we met, at night. </sentence><sentence id="179">Was scary so...because we knew that people actually had died during the week or so before. </sentence><sentence id="180">We didn't stay with these people too long, because when my father discovered that his friend had been killed he also heard from the widow and who had immediately left Tel Aviv for Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="181">She sent my father the key to their apartment. </sentence><sentence id="182">And we stayed for the rest of our stay in Tel Aviv in a beautiful apartment on Gordon Street. </sentence><sentence id="183">The only...the drawback was that the lady during that time started selling off her furniture. </sentence><sentence id="184">So every day there was less there. </sentence><sentence id="185">Eventually we just had mattresses and our luggage. </sentence><sentence id="186">But from June through the end of November, to the middle of November, we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="187">During that time, the uh British government paid everyone who was a member of the Cyprus evacuation, paid them every two weeks enough money to live on. </sentence><sentence id="188">But they were not allowed to work. </sentence><sentence id="189">They had to present themselves every two weeks at an office in the Jewish Agency to get the money. </sentence><sentence id="190">Quite a few vanished. </sentence><sentence id="191">They had family in Palestine, as it was then, and decided, "Well, goodbye." </sentence><sentence id="192">They stayed there, and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="193">They...in the meantime, the English decided what to do with the rest. </sentence><sentence id="194">There were about three hundred and fifty or so left, and they divided us up into two main groups. </sentence><sentence id="195">One to go to what was then Nyasaland [Now: Malawi], and the other one Tanganyika [Now: Tanzania]. </sentence><sentence id="196">So we knew our destiny. </sentence><sentence id="197">And there again, we subdivided the Tanganyika group to those who were going to stay in a camp there, and others who would stay in a small group in a town--which was what we selected. </sentence><sentence id="198">And we were told that we would have to proceed to the town of Mwanza, M-W-A-N-Z - A, on the shore of Lake Victoria. </sentence><sentence id="199">That was a long way off, because the trip has to...had to be arranged. </sentence><sentence id="200">So in middle of November, finally, we were told everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="201">We got travel papers showing that we were...we had no other papers, and that we were to proceed to Tanganyika. </sentence><sentence id="202">And one hundred and seventy of us--that was the group to go to Tanganyika-- were put on a train from Tel Aviv to Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="203">At that time, there was a rail line. </sentence><sentence id="204">And they put us up in a hotel in Cairo... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Whoa. </sentence><sentence id="266">Let's not move quite so fast, OK? </sentence><sentence id="267">There are a hundred and seventy of you. </sentence><sentence id="268">Uh, you are put on a train at Tel Aviv. </sentence><sentence id="269">Uh, describe that train ride for us, would you, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Very comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="276">There were both enough room... I don't remember how many carriages, but it was a passenger train. </sentence><sentence id="277">And uh Cairo...in Cairo, they put us on buses to a hotel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: What was Cairo like at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Very busy. </sentence><sentence id="284">It was full of soldiers--Australians, New Zealanders, British. </sentence><sentence id="285">And uh the uh people who received us there tried to show us as much of Cairo as possible. </sentence><sentence id="286">We never knew whether this was a one-day stop there or two-day stop there. </sentence><sentence id="287">As it turned out, we were there for six or seven days. </sentence><sentence id="288">And we had an opportunity to visit the pyramids, to see the uh mosques, and to see the amazing traffic in Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="289">I recall the flat uh vehicles, drawn by horses or mules, where black-dressed women were sitting in rows just on the flat vehicle. </sentence><sentence id="290">That was some rich Egyptian, I guess, uh took his women for a ride. </sentence><sentence id="291">Otherwise, I don't recall  much of Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="292">It's a picturesque city. </sentence><sentence id="293">But we were constantly worried, "What next?" </sentence><sentence id="294">They finally took us to the railroad station again, and took us by train--passenger train. </sentence><sentence id="295">It was a special train, as far as I remember, to Port Taufiq, on the Red Sea, on the exit of the canal. </sentence><sentence id="296">And there, we were put on a Belgian passenger ship that was full of Australian and New Zealand troops on vacations. </sentence><sentence id="297">They were...we had one part of the ship; but naturally there was...we were mingled. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was...it was still blackout, which made it difficult to move around on that ship. </sentence><sentence id="299">It was big ship. </sentence><sentence id="300">And after one day, their captain, I guess, thought it was...we were far enough away from the German and Italian planes. </sentence><sentence id="301">So he lifted the blackout for a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="302">Because then came the news of the Japanese uh attack on Pearl Harbor." </sentence><sentence id="303">That was that day. </sentence><sentence id="304">And we were all shivering in our boots, because we expected that they had nothing better to do but on the way out of the Red Sea there would be some Japanese ship waiting to sink this boat. </sentence><sentence id="305">Because it was a military transport, after all. </sentence><sentence id="306">And we were scared. </sentence><sentence id="307">The blackout was enforced more than ever. </sentence><sentence id="308">We went through the Red Sea. </sentence><sentence id="309">We went past Mombasa [NB: in Kenya], and the boat stopped for one day to Dar-es-Salaam. </sentence><sentence id="310">From Dar-es- Salaam, right without stop on a train to uh...that train that goes through Tanganyika to Tabora, and from there to Mwanza. </sentence><sentence id="311">In Tabora, those members of the evacuation who were to stay in a camp left. </sentence><sentence id="312">They had established a camp in a former German prison in Tabora. </sentence><sentence id="313">Tanganyika, naturally, had been a German colony before the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="314">The rest of us went to Mwanza. </sentence><sentence id="315">We arrived there a few days before Christmas in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="316">And there were about twelve...between twelve and seventeen--I don't recall exactly how many--we were put up in a hotel there. </sentence><sentence id="317">There was only one hotel owned by a very nice and fat Greek man, who was glad find somebody who spoke Greek. </sentence><sentence id="318">And the District Commissioner of the Lake Province of Tanganyika showed up next day to assure everybody that they uh they would continue paying everybody for as long as the war lasted, if necessary, but urging us to see if we couldn't find some work. </sentence><sentence id="319">And there were indeed people, and I remember one couple that did not look for work. </sentence><sentence id="320">They stayed in that hotel for five years. </sentence><sentence id="321">They were paid for five years. </sentence><sentence id="322">And, naturally, when the war was over, the uh British government was obligated to bring everybody who wanted to back to Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="323">Now, I couldn't stand doing nothing. </sentence><sentence id="324">And thanks to the man who owned the hotel, I got some work in the recruiting office of a gold mine in Mwanza. </sentence><sentence id="325">They had...they sent recruiters out to the various chiefs and got people to work. </sentence><sentence id="326">And they came to the office where I was, and I had to give them tickets to go on a boat across Lake Victoria to the gold mine. </sentence><sentence id="327">That lasted about a month maybe, not much longer. </sentence><sentence id="328">After that one day I came back to, for lunch to the hotel and the Greek owner introduced me to a South African miner. </sentence><sentence id="329">He told me this man, this man has mining claims and he comes here every few weeks because he has to submit renewal applications for the claims to the Inspector of Mines who was located in Mwanza. </sentence><sentence id="330">But he told me the man had so much to drink he can't draw a straight line. </sentence><sentence id="331">Please help him. </sentence><sentence id="332">I helped him, drew him a map for as he told me of his mine, and before he left he told me I could come to the mine to work for him at I think it was ten pounds a month. </sentence><sentence id="333">Anyhow it was much more than I was earning at that other place. </sentence><sentence id="334">It was about a hundred miles south of Mwanza. </sentence><sentence id="335">And he gave me some money, which he thought at that time was payment for my efforts; but he didn't say that. </sentence><sentence id="336">He  said, "Here. </sentence><sentence id="337">Whatever you need, when you...when you are ready to come." </sentence><sentence id="338">And he was very surprised when I showed up at his mine. </sentence><sentence id="339">Before that, he had gotten so drunk not knowing what he did himself that I had to run away from him. </sentence><sentence id="340">He was, in his mind, under the impression that I was chasing his wife. </sentence><sentence id="341">And was quite an experience. </sentence><sentence id="342">I had to run away. </sentence><sentence id="343">And he was drunk, but he wasn't drunk enough to give up the chase. </sentence><sentence id="344">And...but finally, he did so. </sentence><sentence id="345">And uh the next day, he was all sorry and full of excuses. </sentence><sentence id="346">And I went to the District Commissioner and said, "Look here, what kind of man is that? </sentence><sentence id="347">He wants me to work for him. </sentence><sentence id="348">But if that's what happens, I'm scared." </sentence><sentence id="349">But the uh District Commissioner, whose name I have somewhere, uh assured me that I needn't worry. </sentence><sentence id="350">And the same of the Police Commissioner there. </sentence><sentence id="351">So I used the paper that that miner had given me to obtain a truck from the...from one of the Indian merchants in the town, and I set out for the mine. </sentence><sentence id="352">I stayed in the mining area for..."til September of 1946. </sentence><sentence id="353">I did about everything connected with diamond mining, except the actual digging. </sentence><sentence id="354">It sounds very interesting now, but was tough in the heat and long hours. </sentence><sentence id="355">Eventually I got malaria. </sentence><sentence id="356">I got Black Water Fever. </sentence><sentence id="357">Ended up in the hospital in Mwanza with Black Water Fever, and a friendly doctor told me only about twenty-five percent of Europeans who get Black Water Fever survive. </sentence><sentence id="358">Fortunately, I was amongst the twenty-five percent. </sentence><sentence id="359">In the meantime, my father had been able to get a job in his profession as pharmacist, in Mwanza, at the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="360">He was in charge of the pharmacy of the hospital, and he also was in charge of the distribution of medications for the whole province. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="439">Q: What was life like for the Jews as a group there? </sentence><sentence id="440">What was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: They were all by themselves, at least in Mwanza. </sentence><sentence id="444">There was no connection. </sentence><sentence id="445">There was one family we visited - a man who uh had lived there for many years, who was an archeologist. </sentence><sentence id="446">He studied the native tribes for the British government. </sentence><sentence id="447">And he showed me very proudly where he...he and his idiosyncracies are mentioned in a book by Hemingway. </sentence><sentence id="448">But otherwise, there was another...the financial officer of the province also was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="449">But he kept away from refugees, and he uh went on vacation whenever there was a Christian holiday. </sentence></p></dialogue>
