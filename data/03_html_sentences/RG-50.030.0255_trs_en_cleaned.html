Not revolution. </sentence><sentence id="33">I mean, when they came into power. </sentence><sentence id="34">In 1932, after matriculation, I left my home town for Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="35">We had had an exchange program with a family in the town of Nyon on the Lake of Geneva, and there were still about six weeks that they owed us. </sentence><sentence id="36">So I spent six weeks there. </sentence><sentence id="37">And after that, through some friends and through a office of the League of Nations, I got a job on a farm in uh Switzerland, on a...behind the city, the town, of Vevey, on Lake...on the Lake of Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was tough times there. </sentence><sentence id="39">If I had had the money to go back home after I had arrived there, I would probably have turned around and gone back home. </sentence><sentence id="40">Instead of that, I had to get up about five o'clock in the morning to start cleaning the pig's sty and then the cows and then the horses. </sentence><sentence id="41">And everybody spoke French and I didn't know that much French when I got there, but I quickly had to learn whether I liked it or not. </sentence><sentence id="42">I stayed there for about two months and then the farmer sent me with a...with one man and about twenty cows up in the Alps where he had meadows and I stayed there for another two months "til the beginning of September of "32. </sentence><sentence id="43">Yeah, 1932. </sentence><sentence id="44">By that time, uh my father had been able to get me an apprenticeship in a mechanical factory in the Black Forest which was owned by friends of his. </sentence><sentence id="45">I went through a two year apprenticeship, commercial apprenticeship, the end of which I had to go through an examination for commercial  assistance by the Chamber of Commerce. </sentence><sentence id="46">Fortunately, during that time, the after (ph) the Nazis were in command in 1934. </sentence><sentence id="47">But that examination took place during the time these people were not allowed to wear their uniforms due to the Rohm affair, when Hitler had his... one of his assistants killed and I passed, therefore I could pass that examination and I stayed for another year or so as an employee in that factory. </sentence><sentence id="48">Then in December 1935, I was informed that due to my status as a Jew they were not able to keep me. </sentence><sentence id="49">I had to leave by the end of the year. </sentence><sentence id="50">I went skiing the beginning of December, and hurt my hand; so I left three weeks early. </sentence><sentence id="51">Went to Frankfurt and tried to find some work there which was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="52">Even a friend of my father's who owned his own bank was not allowed to employ me even without pay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: Tell me what else it was like in 1935, in Frankfurt, for a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: Well, you couldn't go any place but to Jewish organizations. </sentence><sentence id="90">There were lots of young people who had not given up hope that things would change in Germany and we went out together. </sentence><sentence id="91">We had meetings together, and one of the things I recall is that on Mardi Gras of 1936, at a time when I already knew I was going to leave for Greece, I went out in the streets with some friends and the public was all heppped up and they were all in good humor and playing around and they were stopping cars on the main street and uh trying to lift them up. </sentence><sentence id="92">There was nothing bad involved "till suddenly a contingent of SS men came from the side streets with their swords out and just started hitting indiscriminately anybody who was in the street. </sentence><sentence id="93">I got a cut in my winter coat at that time because I wasn't running fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="94">Otherwise I did not spend much time in Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="95">Before that, in the little town of Hornburg (ph) in the Black Forest where I spent my working time in a factory where I was employed, things were different. </sentence><sentence id="96">During the winter when the only the people of that little town were there, I didn't have much trouble, but this was a place that had many guests came up in the Black Forest in the summer for vacations and so and I learned soon to keep by myself because on two occasions I was once thrown out of a coffee shop where I was sitting with people from the factory and once was just beaten uh up on the street which cost me fortunately only my glasses. </sentence><sentence id="97">I even was asked to apply to come, to enter the German Armed Forces because I was in the age group that was called up and the uh mayor of the town of Hornburg insisted that I go through the formalities because he thought I was such a good man that they needed me, but they after they had I had a physical examination and they got the uh information about my parents and ancestors I got the information that they could very well do without me. </sentence><sentence id="98">Then, to go back to Frankfurt, I had applied to leave for Greece as a student in archeology since I had had uh my background with the Humanistic Gymnasium, knew the ancient languages and in addition to this my older sister had gone, had had the opportunity to go to Greece even earlier. </sentence><sentence id="99">After about two and a half months of efforts and a number of very uh uneasy meetings with officials in Frankfurt, I indeed got a visa, got a passport to go to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="100">I found out afterwards that at the same time I left, the Greek police for foreigners was informed that this guy is not really a student - he is a Jewish refugee and due to this information I had quite a bit of difficulty staying in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="101">But I arrived there in 19.., in February, end of February of "36. </sentence><sentence id="102">Was met by my sister. </sentence><sentence id="103">After a nice journey, and I was quite elated to have left the Third Reich, my sister had made some friends in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="104">She was  mainly giving language lessons there, and after some weeks, I got various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="105">I had brought a typewriter with me and a pair of skis. </sentence><sentence id="106">Nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="107">The pair of skis was to show that I was a student. </sentence><sentence id="108">I was not apt to forget my favorite sport. </sentence><sentence id="109">And, believe it or not, I did go skiing in Greece--in the Peloponnese--which was nice. </sentence><sentence id="110">I got various jobs in Greece and the mentality there of the people who employed me was such that they would trust me more than any of their other employees which was to my advantage. </sentence><sentence id="111">I worked in a technical office where we imported all kinds of electrical equipment from the rest of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="112">They considered very small as outside of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="113">I think at that time I worked for them for three years. </sentence><sentence id="114">Then in, after working for him which was actually part-time, I went in the late afternoon to a newspaper distributing office to - whom I had been recommended to and uh the way I, my first impression of that job was quite interesting. </sentence><sentence id="115">The uh owner of the (ph), which means (ph) newspaper agency, took me to the office of the foreign newspaper department and there behind the desk uh was a young man with not one but uh three signs that he was a member of the Nazi party and he talked to me in French. </sentence><sentence id="116">He never knew that I was German. </sentence><sentence id="117">He was, and he handed the department over to me because he had been called back to Germany he told me. </sentence><sentence id="118">He was already gone the next day and the boss and I were left with quite a mess because there were quite a number of subscriptions to German Nazi papers in Athens for Germans who lived in Athens, and when I started sending somebody around to collect subscription monies that according to the books they owned us, they had all been paid and the predecessor of mine evidentially had pocketed the money. </sentence><sentence id="119">I started the work in that department with quite a uh debt, and the only way after, during the two and one-half years I worked there we could eradicate that debt was by ordering lots of newspapers from the various provinces in Germany, five copies from this one, five copies from that town. </sentence><sentence id="120">Naturally nobody would buy that stuff even, so we would distribute it to the various kiosks and when we got it back you cut the top off, send it back so that you didn't have to pay for it, and the rest of the paper was sold as uh, and we uh wegot credit for it and eventually we wiped out that debt which amounted in quite, to quite a - I think it was over 100,000 pounds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: How did you come to go Crete? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: To Greece. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: To Crete, you were... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="160">In Greece, in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="161">That was all in Athens. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Yes, alright. </sentence><sentence id="166">What happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: My parents came - we brought my parents to Athens one year after I came and we uh, my father had some representation from a chemical factory who thought they could sell their pills in Greece but after, by the end of 1938 the Greek government wouldn't allow us anymore to renew our permit of residence in the country. </sentence><sentence id="170">They informed us that they knew from the German uh authorities that they would be very happy to welcome us back in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="171">We were not anxious. </sentence><sentence id="172">The four of us, my parents, my sister and I, we went from  one foreign consulate to the other in Athens to try and get a place to uh go to. </sentence><sentence id="173">And this was quite difficult. </sentence><sentence id="174">We once thought we had a, we thought to go to Paraguay but when we went to buy steamship tickets, we found out that that consul was only an honorary consul, and wasn't supposed to give visas out and after some difficulty we got half our money back. </sentence><sentence id="175">Then thanks to my father's connection with the Free Masons - it's a masonic order in Athens - we found a man in the British Embassy who helped to get us out. </sentence><sentence id="176">His connection through the CID caused them to check our family tree. </sentence><sentence id="177">And they found--which we knew, which was correct--that my mother was related to Walter Rathenau, who had been the foreign secretary of the Weimar Republic after the First World War and who also was about the first victim of Nazi murder in 1923 already. </sentence><sentence id="178">They told us we could proceed any place in the British Empire we wanted to go to, provided we had the means to do so. </sentence><sentence id="179">Closest place was the island of Cyprus; but Cyprus required for anyone who came there one thousand pounds to show in cash. </sentence><sentence id="180">We didn't have that kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="181">So the British Ambassador in Athens caused them to reduce this amount to a thousand pounds for the whole family--for the four of us--which was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="182">The only drawback was we didn't have the thousand pounds. </sentence><sentence id="183">And I managed to go to the two main employers I had, and I borrowed from each one five hundred pounds in Greek money. </sentence><sentence id="184">So we put that on an account in Cyprus, and we were...we managed to go back to Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="185">Half a year later, I could send them the money back. </sentence><sentence id="186">But that was uh a break we got, because without this help from the British Ambassador I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="187">We arrived in Cyprus in the beginning of March of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="188">And in uh...in the town of Limassol, my father promptly got sick. </sentence><sentence id="189">We were stuck there in a small hotel for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="190">After that we moved to the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia. </sentence><sentence id="191">I got a job in an import office, and my sister got a job in another...in a technical office also. </sentence><sentence id="192">But in September of "39, when Italy entered the war, I came to my office and I found a note in the typewriter: "Do not come back." </sentence><sentence id="193">Because business was dead; and besides, that he told me after he was not to employee enemy aliens. </sentence><sentence id="194">I then got work in a small sausage factory which had been bought by a couple of Austrian Jewish refugees. </sentence><sentence id="195">They needed somebody who spoke Greek and English, because neither of one did...uh of them did. </sentence><sentence id="196">And for some weeks, I sold sausage-- much to the embarrassment of my parents, who would never come to the store but who liked to eat the sausage I brought home. </sentence><sentence id="197">After that, thanks to the Commissioner in Nicosia, the British Commissioner, I got a job in the asbestos mines. </sentence><sentence id="198">They didn't know anything about asbestos was dangerous, and thank God it didn't do any harm to me. </sentence><sentence id="199">But uh I went up there. </sentence><sentence id="200">I worked in the bookkeeping department for, I think, it's only about a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="201">And eventually the uh director of the mine put a house at my disposal, and my parents and my sister could come up there to stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="202">Because in the meantime, things had gotten worse politically. </sentence><sentence id="203">And uh when the Germans overrun Greece I think every refugee and every person who had arrived in...on Cyprus with German papers was interned. </sentence><sentence id="204">They opened an internment camp right next to the prison in Athens, for the men only. </sentence><sentence id="205">Women they left alone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="206">And in that camp were mostly Jews--maybe about twenty real Germans who were kept strictly to themselves. </sentence><sentence id="207">Was not a very good time, because that we were staying in tents. </sentence><sentence id="208">It was uh... whenever a wind came up there was a lot of dirt in the air and we had to work out what we were going to eat every day. </sentence><sentence id="209">I was more or less in charge of that, again because I knew the languages and somewhere . . . </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: They did not feed you? </sentence><sentence id="211">You had to... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: No, well they told us what... "Here's what you get every week. </sentence><sentence id="213">You make your own menu." </sentence><sentence id="214">And I still have somewhere menus or a menu. </sentence><sentence id="215">I don't have it with me, but if I find it I'll make a copy. </sentence><sentence id="216">So that kept me busy. </sentence><sentence id="217">Besides that, they gave us a couple of packets of cigarettes every day. </sentence><sentence id="218">And due to the fact that my father was a heavy smoker, I stopped smoking at that time. </sentence><sentence id="219">He got my cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh after about a month in that tent camp, the authorities realized that that was not a good place to leave us because people got sick. </sentence><sentence id="221">And they moved the camp to a hotel up in the mountains of Greece. </sentence><sentence id="222">Beautiful place called [Berengaria (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="223">And it was naturally behind fence, wire fence; but otherwise it was just like a vacation. </sentence><sentence id="224">What I mean is there was a village nearby, and all the ladies rented rooms there to come and visit. </sentence><sentence id="225">And at the same time, the government started checking the individual papers of the people they had caught up in their net of internment. </sentence><sentence id="226">My father was one of the first to be released. </sentence><sentence id="227">And about three weeks later, I was let go. </sentence><sentence id="228">And I went back to my work in the asbestos mine. </sentence><sentence id="229">We all went back there, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: What was Cyprus like...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Cyprus was a beautiful place, actually. </sentence><sentence id="251">At that time, the British had about two hundred troops on Cyprus--which kept the peace between Turkish and Greek inhabitants. </sentence><sentence id="252">I saw quite a bit of Cyprus while moving around. </sentence><sentence id="253">There have beautiful beaches, and the uh city or the town of Nicosia had some amazing Gothic architecture in their churches... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: I guess what I'm asking--excuse me--is not so much physically what the island is like, but what was it like in wartime--under war conditions--for a Jew living in Cyprus. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Things were rationed, for one thing. </sentence><sentence id="261">And uh the Jews, Jewish refugees--thanks also to the internship--they got to know each other, and they drew together. </sentence><sentence id="262">There was no organization yet at that time. </sentence><sentence id="263">But that came a little bit later with the uh evacuation. </sentence><sentence id="264">But we knew quite a few people, and uh we attended uh services which was to some extent a first for me at that time. </sentence><sentence id="265">Naturally, after moving up to the asbestos mine I had no connection ...we had no connection. </sentence><sentence id="266">We were the only Jews there with the exception of the uh mine physician, who was a Russian man who had come in 1905 due to the pogroms and who didn't admit to anybody that he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="267">Also did not come on the evacuations. </sentence><sentence id="268">But he and my father got friendly, so... And I had no time to be friendly. </sentence><sentence id="269">After all, there were also rules that after work, after sundown, none of us were allowed to leave the house. </sentence><sentence id="270">That was strict instructions, and uh it was known in community in the asbestos mine. </sentence><sentence id="271">So we stayed, and we had a radio. </sentence><sentence id="272">That was that. </sentence><sentence id="273">I only...there was only one store in the whole place, and I went there to buy our ration. </sentence><sentence id="274">Every week we had a half a pound of butter, which my father got because at that time nobody thought that there was anything wrong with eating butter. </sentence><sentence id="275">And we were quite lonely. </sentence><sentence id="276">I wrote during that time in German a treaty [NB: treatise] on my stay in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="277">One of these days, I might translate it. </sentence><sentence id="278">And we stayed there until June "41. </sentence><sentence id="279">We, naturally, knew what was going on in the world. </sentence><sentence id="280">But Cyprus, being away from everything, we did not pay too much attention until the Nazis invaded Crete. </sentence><sentence id="281">They got the island of Crete  without any difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="282">And then, suddenly, the good inhabitants of Cyprus became very anxious to learn German. </sentence><sentence id="283">Under the leadership of their bishop, a man Makarios--who afterwards what became President of the Greek part of Cyprus--they became very uh friendly towards the expected German invasion. </sentence><sentence id="284">And we were worried. </sentence><sentence id="285">Then uh in June of "41, my father got a wire that he should be ready for evacuation within four days in the capital, Nicosia. </sentence><sentence id="286">He had no money saved, because we were living from hand to mouth on whatever little money I made. </sentence><sentence id="287">So in this twen...within twenty-four hours, we had a big sale of all our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="288">We found that for evacuation we only...we are allowed to take two pieces of luggage each, and no more luggage than each one of us could carry. </sentence><sentence id="289">Now we...during the short hours, we had to decide what to pack. </sentence><sentence id="290">We had to try and buy some pieces of luggage from people there, and we had to be so that we had some money in our pockets. </sentence><sentence id="291">We then proceeded to Nicosia. </sentence><sentence id="292">And there, the government had accepted two or three--I don't recall whether it was two or three men--as officers, executive officers, of the Jewish evacuation of Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="293">With these people--and they were attorneys--started an organization. </sentence><sentence id="294">Since I had nothing better to do, I helped out there. </sentence><sentence id="295">They didn't, because they didn't speak Greek. </sentence><sentence id="296">And we had a little office, and registered everybody who was ready to be evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="297">And they had to come there with their pieces of luggage to show that what it was, and that they could actually carry it. </sentence><sentence id="298">And I recall one very sad episode, when a strong man came in there with rather heavy-looking pieces of luggage and the uh person behind the counter who registered him had some doubts whether he could really carry these pieces. </sentence><sentence id="299">And he uh...well, he was very uh brilliant man. </sentence><sentence id="300">He lifted both pieces. " </sentence><sentence id="301">Yeah, I can do it!" </sentence><sentence id="302">Dropped dead. </sentence><sentence id="303">That was quite a shock for all of us. </sentence><sentence id="304">And people were careful. </sentence><sentence id="305">We uh...we just managed the next day or two days later to bury him. </sentence><sentence id="306">And, even the afternoon of that day, we were all put on buses to Famagusta. </sentence><sentence id="307">The evacuation of the Jewish community of Cyprus had started. </sentence><sentence id="308">In Famagusta, they put us on a small boat. </sentence><sentence id="309">We were about five hundred people--men, women and children. </sentence><sentence id="310">There was a lot of complaining and crying. </sentence><sentence id="311">People had to leave their uh groves, orange groves. </sentence><sentence id="312">People had been living for many...not just since the Nazis came, but from even from earlier years on Cyprus. </sentence><sentence id="313">But we all had our lives even so we didn't have much else. </sentence><sentence id="314">And that small boat went in zig-zag through the Mediterranean at night to Jaffa [Arab: Yafa, or Heb: Yafo]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: What boat was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: It was an English...English boat. </sentence><sentence id="373">A British boat. </sentence><sentence id="374">It was probably...it was not a passenger ship. </sentence><sentence id="375">Just whatever boats they could find there for...where we were stacked like herring. </sentence><sentence id="376">Sardines is better. </sentence><sentence id="377">And we uh got to Jaffa. </sentence><sentence id="378">Made us disembark, and immediately put on buses and taken to Tel Aviv. </sentence><sentence id="379">It was strict curfew and blackout. </sentence><sentence id="380">In Tel Aviv, the uh Jewish Agency and the Histadrut had prepared for our arrival. </sentence><sentence id="381">They had set up a camp outside and there were tents and there were. </sentence><sentence id="382">The first time I saw that they had dug air shelter, zig-zag uh shelter, cut out. </sentence><sentence id="383">And we stayed there for a night. </sentence><sentence id="384">And the next night, they...my parents and my sister and I were among the groups that was taken to homes of individual Histadrut members. </sentence><sentence id="385">Right off Ben Yehuda Street in Tel Aviv. </sentence><sentence id="386">There were air raids nearly every night. </sentence><sentence id="387">One air raid, I think the only one where there were actually people uh caught - there were over two hundred and fifty people killed in Tel Aviv. </sentence><sentence id="388">Amongst them, a friend my father afterwards tried to find. </sentence><sentence id="389"> During these air raids we would meet. </sentence><sentence id="390">Because my father was staying with one family, my mother with another, my sister with another, and I with another. </sentence><sentence id="391">In the evening, everybody went downstairs in the air raid...air raid shelter, and everybody along came. </sentence><sentence id="392">That was when we met, at night. </sentence><sentence id="393">Was scary so...because we knew that people actually had died during the week or so before. </sentence><sentence id="394">We didn't stay with these people too long, because when my father discovered that his friend had been killed he also heard from the widow and who had immediately left Tel Aviv for Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="395">She sent my father the key to their apartment. </sentence><sentence id="396">And we stayed for the rest of our stay in Tel Aviv in a beautiful apartment on Gordon Street. </sentence><sentence id="397">The only...the drawback was that the lady during that time started selling off her furniture. </sentence><sentence id="398">So every day there was less there. </sentence><sentence id="399">Eventually we just had mattresses and our luggage. </sentence><sentence id="400">But from June through the end of November, to the middle of November, we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="401">During that time, the uh British government paid everyone who was a member of the Cyprus evacuation, paid them every two weeks enough money to live on. </sentence><sentence id="402">But they were not allowed to work. </sentence><sentence id="403">They had to present themselves every two weeks at an office in the Jewish Agency to get the money. </sentence><sentence id="404">Quite a few vanished. </sentence><sentence id="405">They had family in Palestine, as it was then, and decided, "Well, goodbye." </sentence><sentence id="406">They stayed there, and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="407">They...in the meantime, the English decided what to do with the rest. </sentence><sentence id="408">There were about three hundred and fifty or so left, and they divided us up into two main groups. </sentence><sentence id="409">One to go to what was then Nyasaland [Now: Malawi], and the other one Tanganyika [Now: Tanzania]. </sentence><sentence id="410">So we knew our destiny. </sentence><sentence id="411">And there again, we subdivided the Tanganyika group to those who were going to stay in a camp there, and others who would stay in a small group in a town--which was what we selected. </sentence><sentence id="412">And we were told that we would have to proceed to the town of Mwanza, M-W-A-N-Z - A, on the shore of Lake Victoria. </sentence><sentence id="413">That was a long way off, because the trip has to...had to be arranged. </sentence><sentence id="414">So in middle of November, finally, we were told everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="415">We got travel papers showing that we were...we had no other papers, and that we were to proceed to Tanganyika. </sentence><sentence id="416">And one hundred and seventy of us--that was the group to go to Tanganyika-- were put on a train from Tel Aviv to Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="417">At that time, there was a rail line. </sentence><sentence id="418">And they put us up in a hotel in Cairo... </sentence></p></dialogue>
