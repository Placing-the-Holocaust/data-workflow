<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="558">A: From the larger surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="559">The village and --. </sentence><sentence id="560">Because there was one doctor in which was seven kilometers away. </sentence><sentence id="561">That's the doctor that signed the papers. </sentence><sentence id="562">And then -- that's it. </sentence><sentence id="563">I think there was just those two for quite a large amount of people. </sentence><sentence id="564">Of course people didn't have transportation, you know, in those days. </sentence><sentence id="565">They had bicycles but cars were very rare. </sentence><sentence id="566">So my father went on all rounds, he was gone most of the day seeing people. </sentence><sentence id="567">He also spoke German so he spoke with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="568">They also treated Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
