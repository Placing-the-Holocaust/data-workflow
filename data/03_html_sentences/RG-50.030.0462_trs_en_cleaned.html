<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="605">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="607">A: If people were -- and -- and the prisoners who became, or who wanted to be in charge, they had no experience of handling people, or the -- not at schools, they were not teachers, there were no -- so they're just ordinary house girls, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="608">Never with an -- hardly professionals. </sentence><sentence id="609">Some of them had training in -- in office work, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="610">They succeeded because eventually the SS started to organize, together with the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="611">I mean, food -- food had to be distributed. </sentence><sentence id="612">They didn't know how to go about that. </sentence><sentence id="613">So they had to learn how to distribute food, they had to learn by -- by experience, day by day, how to go about everything. </sentence><sentence id="614">So, it was not easy, it was in horrible chaos for weeks, and weeks, and weeks. </sentence><sentence id="615">And eventually, after months, when the relocation of the women, in August "44 -- no, "42, occurred, th-the relocation to Birkenau, it was still cow -- chaotic, but people were already used to it. </sentence><sentence id="616">Roll call was -- lasted hours. </sentence><sentence id="617">The SS was never trained, they were not very intelligent people. </sentence><sentence id="618">Very simple, primitive people, and they s -- expected that the inmates will do the job, but the inmates were not trained for such an -- a bi -- big masses of people to handle. </sentence><sentence id="619">They -- I mean, if that would have been -- in the men's camp, in Auschwitz, it was different. </sentence><sentence id="620">See, you had the prisoners, the male prisoners, were all ex-Polish officers, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="621">They knew how to handle their troops, how to control. </sentence><sentence id="622">They were obey -- they obeyed commands, because they were treating each other still like in the army. </sentence><sentence id="623">But that was the difference of the Polish male, and the older German male, of prisoners, and the women, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="624">Not because they were more capable, but it was an different background, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="625">We had -- many of the Poles were soldiers, ex-soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="626">The Germans were ex-soldiers too, or had military training, or had the -- were -- for example, we had a lot of s -- people who were in the Spanish Civil War, amongst the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="627">So they had -- there wa -- th-there was no problem with the German male -- male pr -- with the -- the male prisoners in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="628">But the problem occurred only among the women, because they had no -- no military training. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="652">Q: So that when you were in Auschwitz one -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="653">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="654">Q: -- what's going on with the men is totally different from what's going on with the women? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: Yeah, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="657">And there was no contact, and that there was an policy from the first day on, that if there is any job which a woman can do, in the woman's camp, or the woman's section, than the woman had -- will have preference. </sentence><sentence id="658">But if they don't find a woman, then a male will be brought over to do the job, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="659">And that's how I got my job, because I had a male profession. </sentence><sentence id="660">I was the only male -- woman in -- in -- in my country, in my profession, and when they were looking for somebody who could mix paint out of raw material, and produce those red stripes on the clothing, which I explained in prior interviews with you, they preferred me, because I was a woman who worked with -- perform in the woman's camp. </sentence><sentence id="661">If they wouldn't have found anybody, then the male would have brought. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="668">Q: He would have done it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: They would have brought in a -- a man to do the work. </sentence><sentence id="671">So that was the difference. </sentence><sentence id="672">I -- now you understand why we had such an hard life in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: Not because we were women, we had -- we had no military training, that's what I want to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1484">A: Hard that you had -- that you have known the people are still alive, and they were registered already, had to be registered already for the next day's dead, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1485">It -- that is hard to explain, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1486">Just like I would say compare with you have in front of you, people who are dying, yeah?You only don't know when they are going to die, but they are in the stage of dying. </sentence><sentence id="1487">You feel very strange while you are still here in front of you the living body, and you know they may be dead tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but they are already in -- theoretically, in your mind, dead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1493">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6920">Q: Now why was that the case? </sentence><sentence id="6921">Why were there no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office? </sentence></p></dialogue>
