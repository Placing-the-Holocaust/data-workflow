<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: ... in Budapest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="559">A: Either in a school or the main temple, I'm not positive now. </sentence><sentence id="560">But it was a large, either a large synagogue or a large school. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: We were taken away from Kolozsvar together with my father's oldest brother, his wife, his son, and his daughter. </sentence><sentence id="574">And another sister who was single at the time. </sentence><sentence id="575">And we were all together, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="576">So the only children that were familiar to me at that time were my cousins -- my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="577">Now, she was two years older than me, and her brother was two years older than my brother. </sentence><sentence id="578">So they were sequentially older than us by two years. </sentence><sentence id="579">And they're the only ones, I know that there are lots of other children, because there was like 500 orphan children in this group that was deported out of Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="580">But I don't remember, I think I    clung very closely to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="581">There was too much chaos, too much fear, and my mother was the barometer. </sentence><sentence id="582">Like for all children, I think mothers are the barometer. </sentence><sentence id="583">You look at your mother's face, and if she's smiling, then you're smiling. </sentence><sentence id="584">And if she's afraid, then you're afraid. </sentence><sentence id="585">And I am sure that a lot of things I have seen through my mother's eyes, or just by looking at her face. </sentence><sentence id="586">A lot of my feelings were connected to this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="602">Q: Do you remember what you saw or what you were feeling? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: Probably just a lot of turmoil, a lot of unknown, a lot of fear of getting lost. </sentence><sentence id="605">A lot of that instability, that lack of confidence of what will happen. </sentence><sentence id="606">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="607">What's going to happen to us? </sentence><sentence id="608">That kind of a fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: Maybe what you left behind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="616">A: I don't even know if that entered my mind what we left behind. </sentence><sentence id="617">It's just, I think it's the fear of the unknown. </sentence><sentence id="618">It's the worry about what will happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="622">Q: Was there any communication with your grandparents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="624">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="626">Q: You just lost touch? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="628">A: Completely. </sentence><sentence id="629">We didn't know what happened to our grandparents until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="630">When the war ended and people started looking for each other, that's when we found out who is alive and who is dead, and who went back to Hungary and who did not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: Were you -- maybe not -- I don't know -- at the time, were you aware that this transport from the brickyard to Budapest was really a specially arranged transport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="636">A: I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="637">That is something that I learned about it later. </sentence><sentence id="638">I just later on learned that this was a special group, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="639">A privileged group, that was gathered together, and they supposedly -- this is something that I learned later on. </sentence><sentence id="640">That I had no knowledge of at all. </sentence><sentence id="641">That this group was gathered together, and they collected everybody's belongings and money and jewelry and whatever everybody could offer, because the Germans needed trucks. </sentence><sentence id="642">And Kastner, who was a lawyer, a Hungarian Jewish lawyer, dealt with Eichmann and pleaded with him to save this group of Jews to show to the world that what they are doing is not -- supposedly not happening. </sentence><sentence id="643">And because it was towards the end of the war, they were in such terrible need of money that they had accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="644">And this group supposedly was supposed to be transported to Turkey. </sentence><sentence id="645">But instead from Budapest in cattle cars, they took us to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="656">Q: Do you know how you became a part of this group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="658">A: Probably because twofold. </sentence><sentence id="659">First, my parents were always Zionists, and they were always active in the Zionist movement. </sentence><sentence id="660">Second, my uncle who was with us, he was a very important banker in Kolozsvar. </sentence><sentence id="661">He was wealthy, and he was well-to-do. </sentence><sentence id="662">And he had more connections, and he put us on the list, together with his family. </sentence><sentence id="663">And I think that was probably one of the most important things. </sentence><sentence id="664">But in this group, as I said before, not everyone had a connection, and not everyone was wealthy, it may seem. </sentence><sentence id="665">There was a good percentage of them who had the money, but they brought together with them 500 orphan children who did not have anybody to speak for them. </sentence><sentence id="666">And so there were many other people in the group, not just those who were privileged to be in the group. </sentence><sentence id="667">And in those days also, there were many movements. </sentence><sentence id="668">There were many organizations, Jewish organizations, that tried to save Jews in every which way they could. </sentence><sentence id="669">And like between all people, there are always differences of opinion. </sentence><sentence id="670">There were those who felt you should not deal with Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="671">There were those who felt you should do whatever you can to save the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="672">There were those who felt that just something bad will come out of it. </sentence><sentence id="673">There were those who felt that this is not the way to go. </sentence><sentence id="674">So even if they knew and they could go on with the group, they did not want to. </sentence><sentence id="675">It was a life that was unknown. </sentence><sentence id="676">Just like Kastner thought that we will all wind up in Turkey, and we wound up in concentration camps instead. </sentence><sentence id="677">And he himself, I think, put his life on the line every minute of the day when he entered this negotiations and traveled as a Jew all over the country for meetings and different things. </sentence><sentence id="678">His life was on the line constantly. </sentence><sentence id="679">His family was just in as much jeopardy as anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="680">And, you know, people claim he should have told everybody what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="681">He should have let the Hungarian Jewry know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="682">The documentation shows that there are some people that escaped concentration camps who came back, and who reported what's going on, who told them what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="683">And nobody would believe them. </sentence><sentence id="684">Nobody would listen. </sentence><sentence id="685">It's easy to be a good judge, you know, after the fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="714">Q: Now, you started to talk about how you went as a group in cattle cars, you were sent to Bergen- Belsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="716">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: A couple questions: Did everybody from this school or temple in Budapest go on this transport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="721">Everybody that was gathered there went on the transport. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: When was this, approximately? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: I tell you, about June. </sentence><sentence id="727">The beginning of June and of May, beginning of June, I would think, of 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="730">Q: Tell me a little bit about the journey. </sentence><sentence id="731">Your family all went together except for... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: I don't remember anybody but my mother and brother with me. </sentence><sentence id="735">I'm sure that my uncle and aunt were there, but I was aware only of them. </sentence><sentence id="736">It was terribly crowded. </sentence><sentence id="737">There were no seats. </sentence><sentence id="738">People were standing, hoarded in. </sentence><sentence id="739">The only thing you could do is stoop down. </sentence><sentence id="740">There was no room in the train. </sentence><sentence id="741">And they had a pail, like what you wash the floor with. </sentence><sentence id="742">That was the sanitation, that was the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="743">And it was terribly stifling hot. </sentence><sentence id="744">Cattle cars have small windows. </sentence><sentence id="745">It was just horrendous, and I don't remember how long it took, how many hours we rode in that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="758">Q: Do you have any remembrance of what the mood was? </sentence><sentence id="759">People thought they were going to Turkey? </sentence><sentence id="760">Did they have expectations what things were going to be... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: I have the feeling by the time they were hoarded into the cattle cars, that they feared the worst. </sentence><sentence id="765">I don't know what they thought really, because I was so young at the time that even if the conversation was going on around me, I think my mind was working in a different direction. </sentence><sentence id="766">Either in denial of what was going on, or my mind went through imagination, you know, what a child imagines or plays in their head. </sentence><sentence id="767">It's very hard to tell; I don't recall back that far as to what I had. </sentence><sentence id="768">On top of it, during this journey I came down with German measles, so I was one sick child by the time I arrived to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="769">And my mother wrapped me up in a blanket that she had for me, a little pink and white blanket. </sentence><sentence id="770">And she carried me with that blanket; I was very small, luckily. </sentence><sentence id="771">Not that my mother was tall, believe me. </sentence><sentence id="772">But I was a small child, and she picked me up in her arms and covered me totally with a blanket. </sentence><sentence id="773">And by the time we got to the gate and there was a walking, marching from the train to the gates of hell of Bergen-Belsen, and I remember -- I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="774">This is just stories that I remember that my mother was telling me. </sentence><sentence id="775">That they asked her if I am sick, and she said, "No, the child is only sleeping." </sentence><sentence id="776">They couldn't gauge how old I was, because I was small. </sentence><sentence id="777">Being totally covered, they couldn't gauge my age. </sentence><sentence id="778">And at that point as soon as we arrived to Bergen-Belsen, they separated the boys and the men from the women and the girls. </sentence><sentence id="779">So my brother was separated from us at that point, and he was taken -- he was 14 years old at that time. </sentence><sentence id="780">He was separated, he was with my uncle and his cousin. </sentence><sentence id="781">And I was with my mother and my aunt and my cousin, two aunts and a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="782">We were in these huge barracks with the wooden beds. </sentence><sentence id="783">Everybody sleeping next to everybody on a wooden slat, and barbed wires all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="784">No sooner did we arrive, I think we needed to march out of the barracks to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="785">And this counting went on day, noon and night. </sentence><sentence id="786">They were very meticulous, they constantly counted. </sentence><sentence id="787">I don't    know why it was so important for them, but I guess they wanted to make sure that no one is missing. </sentence><sentence id="788">And the war went on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: Were you able to see your brother and your uncle. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="824">Honestly, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="825">Maybe we were together as a group, I'm not sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="829">Q: Did they give you wear uniforms or you wore your own clothes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="831">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="832">Everybody wore whatever was on him. </sentence><sentence id="833">I don't remember -- I don't remember given uniforms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="837">Q: Do you remember what the conditions of life were like there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: The conditions of life were horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="840">I remember as a child they had what you see today, an outhouse. </sentence><sentence id="841">You know, how you have an outhouse and there is like a hole and everything goes in the hole? </sentence><sentence id="842">I remember like a semicircle, and these holes were there in the ground without any separation. </sentence><sentence id="843">Without any doors, without any privacy. </sentence><sentence id="844">Just like animals. </sentence><sentence id="845">And for some reason, I recall being there. </sentence><sentence id="846">It is so horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="847">I was brought up in such a modest way. </sentence><sentence id="848">My parents were such modest people, and I had never seen adults sitting on a toilet or doing their thing. </sentence><sentence id="849">And I remember somebody either bending down and his glasses fell off their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="850">I remember those glasses falling into the hole. </sentence><sentence id="851">And, you know, that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="852">Now, you know, in any person who -- this kind of stuck in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="853">And just understanding of what it means for someone who does not see to wear glasses and to lose them. </sentence><sentence id="854">And my mother glasses since she was a little child, so I know that this -- I know that she cannot -- she cannot exist without her glasses, you know. </sentence><sentence id="855">So that thought left such an impression on me. </sentence><sentence id="856">And the other big impression was when we were taken to the showers. </sentence><sentence id="857">We were taken to the showers, and if you can imagine a fence that is made out of wooden slats that are very tightly attached to each other. </sentence><sentence id="858">We were walking by this fence, and people were screaming. </sentence><sentence id="859">And I remember asking my mother, "Why are they screaming?" </sentence><sentence id="860">My mother said to me, "Because they recognize names that were written on the fence." </sentence><sentence id="861">Now, nobody    had pens or pencils with them, but people bent down and picked up a piece of rock or chalky substance that was on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="862">And they smeared their names in the fence. </sentence><sentence id="863">Or wrote down dates when they were there, in case somebody else will come and recognize them. </sentence><sentence id="864">It's that feeling or maybe that faith that knowing that you may be going to your death, that maybe somebody else will come and recognize your name. </sentence><sentence id="865">Because the entire fence was scribbled with names, and people obviously recognized some names on those fences. </sentence><sentence id="866">Or they didn't recognize, maybe they thought they did. </sentence><sentence id="867">You never know what went on in people's minds, but the fear was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="868">And we were taken into the showers where everybody had to get undressed. </sentence><sentence id="869">And I remember the horror for the first time in my life, that I have seen adults naked. </sentence><sentence id="870">I didn't even see children naked. </sentence><sentence id="871">I don't remember if I saw myself naked. </sentence><sentence id="872">I was just a little girl, and now I see children and mothers and grandmothers marching around naked into these showers. </sentence><sentence id="873">And people were screaming because they obviously did not think that those were showered. </sentence><sentence id="874">Obviously felt that this is the end of them, but we were showered. </sentence><sentence id="875">And we came out of it, which is so unbelievable that -- that that impression, that horrendous thing, it stays like a picture in your mind forever. </sentence><sentence id="876">And then we were taken back. </sentence><sentence id="877">And the other, of course, the counting that I already told you about, that they marched us out from the barracks constantly to stand in lines and count us, stand in rows. </sentence><sentence id="878">And the other horrendous impression was when they came with their leather boots and the German Shepherds with them. </sentence><sentence id="879">And bringing the food, which always looked to me like some kind of a dishwater with something floating in it that looked like some burgundy sausage or something. </sentence><sentence id="880">Something disgusting looking in it. </sentence><sentence id="881">That was the food, and a little bit of bread. </sentence><sentence id="882">I don't know, I really honestly I don't know how we survived. </sentence><sentence id="883">I really do not know how we survived. </sentence><sentence id="884">How we survived the hunger, how we survived the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="885">It's like it's hard, it's amazing. </sentence><sentence id="886">I remember also being marched out of Bergen-Belsen about eight months after being there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="970">Q: Imean, as kid, I'm trying to figure out what you did all day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="972">A: Just we were in the barracks all day long. </sentence><sentence id="973">In the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="974">We were crying, telling stories, trying to -- I don't even know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="978">Q: Do you know if there was any awareness of the Sabbath or of any holidays during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="980">A: I don't believe so. </sentence><sentence id="981">I don't believe so. </sentence><sentence id="982">Maybe quietly my mother sang something to me. </sentence><sentence id="983">I don't even know what day was following what day. </sentence><sentence id="984">There was such a loss of time. </sentence><sentence id="985">I don't know whether they knew really what day it was of the week. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="992">Q: Anything else you can remember about what your life was like there? </sentence><sentence id="993">Are there impressions, things that made you afraid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="996">A: Just the silence, the guards, the tower of the guards, you know. </sentence><sentence id="997">The barbed wires all around you. </sentence><sentence id="998">Everything is muddy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="999">It's -- that whole environment of a depressed environment, a depression on everybody's faces. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Everybody looked very skinny, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1001">Everyone lost their    healthy weight. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Everyone waiting around to die, basically. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I don't think at that point anyone thought that we'll survive or that we will come out of it alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1023">A: Eight months later, we were marched out of the camp all of a sudden. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I guess the deal was made. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And the payment, the final payment to the Germans was paid, I think, as we entered the Swiss borders in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And we were marched out of camp, and I remember that we were marched out by fours, which means they were marching in groups of fours. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And somebody in front, maybe there was a row that there were like three people. </sentence><sentence id="1028">So this Nazi bastard with his dog was standing there, and pulled somebody forward. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And from every line, he pulled somebody forward. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So you were feeling that missing person. </sentence><sentence id="1031">That happened in the front. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And I was on the edge, and I remember pulling my arm from my mother's arm and pushing me forward, one line forward. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I was horrified; I was a little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I was not next to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And with the force that he flung me forward, I started crying. </sentence><sentence id="1036">And it took a while for us to walk away a little bit before my mother asked the person next to her to switch places with me so that she can have me next to her. </sentence><sentence id="1037">I remember that horrified moment. </sentence><sentence id="1038">You know, you lose all the confidence -- the little confidence that you still have within you, you lose it because you are just thrown in front of your mother. </sentence><sentence id="1039">But it was done in such a brutal way that it totally shook me up as a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1134">Q: You can't recall the ride? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: I don't recall the ride. </sentence><sentence id="1137">What I do remember is arriving to a place that looked like a palace. </sentence><sentence id="1138">In my child's eye, I thought that we had arrived to the biggest palace, almost like in a dream. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And I remember coming there, and the children were given toys by the Red Cross and being fed and being taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And the name of the place was called Hotel Esplanade. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And very shortly after arriving and probably being checked physically and medically and checking for lice and checking to see if everybody who needs medical attention and so forth, very shortly afterwards, they took all the children away. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And we were brought to a -- up in the Alps, you know, like into like a farm area for recuperation. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And just to get us a little bit healthier after all the ordeal of being in concentration camp for so long. </sentence><sentence id="1144">At this point the Red Cross was there to help. </sentence><sentence id="1145">The Schlakim (ph) , which are messengers from Israel, from Palestine at the time came to our aid. </sentence><sentence id="1146">They were working very hard on receiving the proper certificates to enter Palestine, because we could not enter freely. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And some semblance of normal life wanted to return. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Now, that's what they wanted to achieve. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So they took us into a -- as I said, it was probably like a farm. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Almost like a kibbutz kind of a thing on the Alps. </sentence><sentence id="1151">And they started process, they started to try to teach us according to the level that we were at, what we were supposed to start. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And I don't even remember -- probably they tried to teach us in Hungarian, if I'm not wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1153">Now, in Switzerland we all learned a little bit of German because that was the spoken language in that area of the country. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And each and one of us kind of picked up some German language. </sentence><sentence id="1155">I remember sitting in the classroom, it was very frightening to me to some extent because here I was away from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1156">My mother was left in this big hotel with a lot of other women who were widowed, and all the children in all ages were gathered together. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And teachers were brought from all over to try to teach us, and they tried to conduct classes. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And I just remember me sitting in the classroom and totally gazing and not comprehending anything. </sentence><sentence id="1159">It was like in a dream, I remember sitting there saying to myself that "This is school," but my mind was totally on other things. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I could not concentrate. </sentence><sentence id="1161">I don't remember that -- I can't recall if I learned anything. </sentence><sentence id="1162">I probably remember just learning just a little bit of the ABCs, the lettering, the beginning of learning how to read. </sentence><sentence id="1163">But to tell you that this was a formal schooling that I could recall or I can retain anything, probably very little because of the emotional upheaval that probably I felt as a child. </sentence><sentence id="1164">The one thing for sure that none of us got was psychological counseling. </sentence><sentence id="1165">That was not in anybody's agenda or even in their -- in anybody's thought that that was needed at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I remember the older children putting up a play of David and Goliath. </sentence><sentence id="1167">I remember my brother playing the role of Goliath if I'm -- of David. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And -- but I don't remember anything else from area, just the fact that there was a lot of cheese, which I hated. </sentence><sentence id="1169">There was a lot of milk, which I didn't like to drink. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Most people were so happy so see cheese. </sentence><sentence id="1171">As a child, these were things that I did not like to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I did not like cheese, and I didn't like hard-boiled eggs, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I used to choke on them. </sentence><sentence id="1174">There are memories of things that I really could not -- I guess I could not tolerate them. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And other than that, really the time in Switzerland passed by, and before we knew it -- I also remember something that really stayed with me, is the fact that the Swiss people did not look upon us kindly. </sentence><sentence id="1176">They were not friendly. </sentence><sentence id="1177">They really did not like foreigners, and they -- I'm sure that this was very hard for them to get this many refugees in one of their hotels. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And from there we were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1179">I don't know what mode of transportation, in all honesty. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Probably by train again to Bari, Italy, and from Bari, Italy we were taken by a boat to Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1323">Q: It must have been quite nice to see your brother again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1325">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1326">But you have to understand that the relationship between me and my brother was not the same as siblings. </sentence><sentence id="1327">I would never go to my brother if I had a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Or if I had a fear, I could not talk to my brother at that age. </sentence><sentence id="1329">For me, he loomed larger than life. </sentence><sentence id="1330">He was a symbol, until I got married. </sentence><sentence id="1331">It's not just as a little child, a six-year-old child, there was this age difference between us. </sentence><sentence id="1332">We lived together for a very short period in our lives, and then we never lived together again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1341">Q: Just maybe because he was also at this farm, you felt a little bit more protected since your mother wasn't there"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1343">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Because he was busy with his age group. </sentence><sentence id="1345">He was busy with his own survival. </sentence><sentence id="1346">He had his friends from school. </sentence><sentence id="1347">It was different, and I don't know, he loved me very much, but I don't think that he understood or that I understood what I needed or what he needed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1355">A: We were never taught as children to communicate verbally and to express our emotions and our feelings or to speak up about them. </sentence><sentence id="1356">This is all many, many, many years later, you know, that one learns through life to speak up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1618">A: And my mother stayed in Haifa in a hotel for women. </sentence><sentence id="1619">So this time we were separated for good for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1620">I was taken to Halba, which is close to Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="1621">My mother stayed in Haifa. </sentence><sentence id="1622">My brother was taken to Neva-Tan (ph), and my two other cousins to the French kibbutzim. </sentence><sentence id="1623">And that was -- that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And at this time I found myself in a kibbutz, all by myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1632">Q: Were you scared? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1634">A: I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="1635">How comfortable could I have been? </sentence><sentence id="1636">At this point I was already seven and a half years old. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Think of it, I was seven and a half years old, so I missed first grade; I missed second grade. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And I just started first grade. </sentence><sentence id="1639">That was the first time that I remember going to school and starting to learn how to read and write. </sentence><sentence id="1640">On top of it I arrived to a kibbutz that nobody spoke Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="1641">I spoke very little German, and I definitely did not speak Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="1642">So the communication was very difficult, but like all children, you quickly learn -- you quickly learn a new language when you are forced to learn it. </sentence><sentence id="1643">But again, the communication with my mother and father was very difficult, because I didn't know how to read and write. </sentence><sentence id="1644">I just started to learn how to read and write in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="1645">My language skills could not have been great at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1646">And like all first graders, you can imagine how well I wrote and how many spelling mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="1647">My mother did not know how to read Hebrew, and I didn't -- I couldn't read her Hungarian letters to me. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And nobody could read them to me either. </sentence><sentence id="1649">So it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1650">My brother wrote to me in Hebrew, which I couldn't read either. </sentence><sentence id="1651">But that could -- at least somebody could read it. </sentence><sentence id="1652">So it's a little bit comical, but it was a quite difficult communication. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And I didn't see my mother very often because the circumstances in Israel were so difficult at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1654">These were the times of the uprising, this was pre-War of Independence. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Traveling was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="1656">People traveled with armored vehicles, and they traveled only in caravans. </sentence><sentence id="1657">You didn't see a car riding freely on the road, you were only safe if you traveled in caravans and in armored vehicles. </sentence><sentence id="1658">So really I think I saw my mother twice a year during this while period, and I was there for three years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1684">Q: What was your life like then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1686">A: The kibbutz life was okay. </sentence><sentence id="1687">I mean I'm sure it wasn't easy for me emotionally, but it was okay. </sentence><sentence id="1688">There was a lot of -- I think I can attribute there was a lot of caring. </sentence><sentence id="1689">I think we got something, somebody cared about us. </sentence><sentence id="1690">I think we got that sense -- that sense did come through. </sentence><sentence id="1691">I think going to school every day, and from very early young age they teach you to work a little bit to keep you busy, and to keep you a productive individual. </sentence><sentence id="1692">It kept us very busy and very active and not allowing too much, you know, for day dreaming. </sentence><sentence id="1693">And every child was assigned to a family. </sentence><sentence id="1694">Unfortunately for me, I was assigned to the shoemaker in the kibbutz, who came from Poland who was a widower, and who had a daughter a year older than me. </sentence><sentence id="1695">So I was not assigned to a family where there was a mother and a father. </sentence><sentence id="1696">I was assigned to a family that there was only a father, and since he had a daughter who was a year older than me, he just didn't know how to be a parent for both of us. </sentence><sentence id="1697">He was a good man, but, you know, if you have a choice between your own daughter and somebody's else's daughter, it's a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="1698">So, but that was the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="1699">But, generally speaking, I think there was lot of positive things in the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="1700">A lot of, you know, a lot of things that were taught that were very positive and very nice, and the holidays were always celebrated in a very nice manner. </sentence><sentence id="1701">This was not a religious kibbutz at all, but all the Biblical holidays were celebrated on -- in a freer way. </sentence><sentence id="1702">That you felt -- I felt very much that I belonged, so there was a lot of caring. </sentence><sentence id="1703">I know I missed my mother, I know I fantasized a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1704">I fantasized a lot about my brother, and that is strange, that's even more. </sentence><sentence id="1705">Because here he was already he went into the Navy, and I always worried whether he is going to get killed or is he going to be alive. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And so my brother, again, loomed larger than life in my eyes in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And I seldom saw him, very seldom. </sentence><sentence id="1708">So really with the exception of living together in Hungary, we never again lived together in the same house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1732">Q: Were there a lot of other children on this kibbutz who were essentially in your predicament? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1734">Who had come here, who had been separated from their... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1735">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1737">In fact, that's what I said to people, you know, at times when they asked me. </sentence><sentence id="1738">I was one of the fortunate ones, I had a brother; I had a mother. </sentence><sentence id="1739">My friends, the two brother and sister, they had a mother and they had each other. </sentence><sentence id="1740">Then the children from Tehran came. </sentence><sentence id="1741">These were children from Russia and from Poland, primarily Polish children, who came without a soul. </sentence><sentence id="1742">They lost their parents. </sentence><sentence id="1743">They lost their siblings. </sentence><sentence id="1744">They lost their uncles, their grandparents, everything in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1745">They were sole survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1746">So at that time, as much as one wanted to feel sorry for oneself, I think there was always somebody who was in a worse position than we were. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And these children came with no one, and the kibbutz absorbed them into families. </sentence><sentence id="1748">They became their families, literally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1763">Q: Were you conscious of that at the time? </sentence><sentence id="1764">What were you thinking about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1767">A: I was very conscious of it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1768">I was always very -- very, very sensitive to other people's feelings and other children's feelings as much as I was sensitive to my own. </sentence><sentence id="1769">I was very sensitive, very caring, and I think I also rationalized it was a very good way of protecting myself. </sentence><sentence id="1770">I rationalized, so -- there are people that have less than you, so it's okay. </sentence><sentence id="1771">It wasn't the end of the    world. </sentence><sentence id="1772">I think that's what kept my sanity, that I was able always to see maybe the better side of things instead of the worst side. </sentence><sentence id="1773">I just feel I was very fortunate as a child, because, in all honesty, when I think back that none of us ever, ever got any psychological counseling or help or group session or -- it wasn't even talked about. </sentence><sentence id="1774">Everybody just went about their lives going on, it really didn't come back to haunt me until I had children of my own. </sentence><sentence id="1775">I didn't realize the feelings that I stored inside until I had my own children. </sentence><sentence id="1776">Because, you see, as I saw them growing up and I realized the ages, the circumstances, that's when I had a difficult time to reconcile with what I went through. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Because you see your children, how vulnerable they are at such a young age and how needy they are, it's very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1778">On the other hand, it made me very strong. </sentence><sentence id="1779">It made me able to slough off a lot of things and be able to face life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1794">Q: Did you develop close relationships in that kibbutz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1796">A: I'm sure I had friends. </sentence><sentence id="1797">How close relationships, nothing that was overwhelmingly comfortable, you know, in hindsight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1800">Q: Did you have fun? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1802">A: [had a good time. </sentence><sentence id="1803">I had a pretty good time. </sentence><sentence id="1804">I had a good time, but I think I had -- I was also a very serious child. </sentence><sentence id="1805">I probably carried a lot of worry on my little shoulders, I'm sure of that. </sentence><sentence id="1806">I remember I always had a recurring nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="1807">It turned out that a siren was going on and everybody was rushing for the shelters, and I couldn't run and I couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="1808">My legs wouldn't carry me. </sentence><sentence id="1809">And I was crawling on all four in front of the dining room, and everybody was passing me by. </sentence><sentence id="1810">And I just -- my legs were paralyzed, I could not walk. </sentence><sentence id="1811">So I know where it comes from. </sentence><sentence id="1812">But for many years I had this recurring nightmare, same thing all over again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1824">Q: What do you think you were... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1826">A: It was my fears of survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1828">Q: Do you think that you generally felt safe finally in this kibbutz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: I felt safe, but I know that I also probably put up a good facade. </sentence><sentence id="1831">I remember when Israel was declared a free state, we were sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="1832">I must have been -- 1948, I was 11 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1833">And we were awakened, we were sleeping, we were awakened all to come out and dance, and everybody was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="1834">And they announced at the same time that Haifa was conquered, and I became hysterical. </sentence><sentence id="1835">Because I did not understand that it was conquered by the Israelis. </sentence><sentence id="1836">I was positive that my mother is finished with, because that's where she lived. </sentence><sentence id="1837">I was positive that if Haifa was conquered, my mother must be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1838">So that happy occasion where everybody came out and they were dancing, and they brought out from the freezers the little apples that they were saving for a special occasion, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And everybody was really in such a joyous mood. </sentence><sentence id="1840">It took me time from being awakened in the middle of the night to understand the consequences and the ramifications of this news. </sentence><sentence id="1841">So that wasn't easy either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1854">Q: Why don't you just kind of tell me briefly what happened after? </sentence><sentence id="1855">You were on the kibbutz for three and a half years. </sentence><sentence id="1856">Palestine became Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1860">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1862">Q: And you were at that point rejoined with your family or with your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1864">A: My mother remarried. </sentence><sentence id="1865">I never met the man that she remarried at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1866">My mother just announced to me in a letter that she has remarried, she has gotten remarried and that they would like me to come home. </sentence><sentence id="1867">And it was good news and bad news for me. </sentence><sentence id="1868">It was good news because finally I'm going to be with her. </sentence><sentence id="1869">It was bad news to me because in my little mind I probably conjured up this image that if my mother is going to remarry, I have decided in advance that I'm going to hate this individual, and I will not -- he cannot replace my father. </sentence><sentence id="1870">At that point my mother knew very well that my father is no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="1871">And she consulted with my brother, who was in the Navy, who was also closer. </sentence><sentence id="1872">The Navy was in Haifa, so they saw each other quite frequently. </sentence><sentence id="1873">And she introduced the man that she was going to marry to my brother, and my brother was all for it. </sentence><sentence id="1874">But nobody consulted me, and nobody introduced me. </sentence><sentence id="1875">I was far away, I was not near Haifa. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And so I was brought back to Haifa from the kibbutz, and I left the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And I came back to Haifa, swearing to myself that I'm going to really hate this man and I'm not going to obey him. </sentence><sentence id="1878">This was what went on in mind at that time, but really in no time at all I realized what a nice individual she married. </sentence><sentence id="1879">And he was a survivor also, who lost his wife and two children in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And his oldest daughter was my age, and she had my middle name, Suzannah (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1881">And so he was quite a nice father to me; I think he loved me dearly. </sentence><sentence id="1882">And that had a very good effect on my life. </sentence><sentence id="1883">He was a good family man. </sentence><sentence id="1884">He was extremely, extremely sensitive. </sentence><sentence id="1885">But at the time that I came back to Haifa, I felt estranged from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1886">I mean she was important to me, but I no longer felt that need to be that close. </sentence><sentence id="1887">Or I think I had also a lot of anger in me probably that was never verbalized. </sentence><sentence id="1888">But by the time I got back to Haifa, started school, and then things were done in very haphazard way. </sentence><sentence id="1889">I arrived to Haifa, I was at that time in the fourth grade. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And they decided since I was older -- and I was probably a fairly decent student. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I wasn't a super student, but I was good, average student. </sentence><sentence id="1892">They decided that oh, it's time to make up a grade. </sentence><sentence id="1893">So I went for half a year in the fourth grade, and in the middle of the year, I transferred to the fifth grade. </sentence><sentence id="1894">I think they would have done much better if they would skipped fourth grade altogether and put me in the fifth grade right in from the start, so I will have an equal opportunity to start at the same level. </sentence><sentence id="1895">But by the time I started fifth grade in the middle of the year, I was totally lost again. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And this time they lost me from math forever, I was not a big mathematician. </sentence><sentence id="1897">And I think from multiplying and dividing, I got into fractions. </sentence><sentence id="1898">And I never learned the basics of how to deal with fractions in the beginning of the year, and I think it was extremely difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1899">Extremely difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1900">I got into a very good grade. </sentence><sentence id="1901">I got into a good grade in terms socially, it was very compatible and terrific. </sentence><sentence id="1902">But academically, especially in math, I had a lot of difficulty that dragged on and on. </sentence><sentence id="1903">I always needed a private tutor. </sentence><sentence id="1904">Somehow I could never catch up to what I lost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1947">Q: So you finished school. </sentence><sentence id="1948">You grew up in Haifa with your newly constituted family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1951">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1952">I grew up in Haifa. </sentence><sentence id="1953">In the years that I was growing up, elementary school was through eighth grade. </sentence><sentence id="1954">There was only elementary school and high school. </sentence><sentence id="1955">There was no middle school. </sentence><sentence id="1956">So you went for eight years to elementary and four years of high school. </sentence><sentence id="1957">And when I finished elementary school, the eighth grade, it was by my mother's recommendation that I should maybe look into a technical high school, where I could learn a profession and I can finish my high school diploma. </sentence><sentence id="1958">At first I didn't want to hear about it, but then I decided that that's a very good idea. </sentence><sentence id="1959">And I went and I looked at a school, and I liked it very much. </sentence><sentence id="1960">It was very creative, and I was a very creative child. </sentence><sentence id="1961">I guess I had a lot of creativity in me that I didn't even know that existed. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And I went to the school, and that's where I really blossomed, because we learned a lot of things that were of interest. </sentence><sentence id="1963">You know, we learned how to sew and how to embroider and how to knit. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And a lot of the creative handwork and crafts -- excuse me -- and I succeeded quite nicely in the school, and that helped me a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1965">By the time I finished my high school diploma there, I had a profession also. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And I went back for an extra year for a teacher's seminary, so that I became an arts and crafts teacher. </sentence><sentence id="1967">And soon thereafter, I got married. </sentence><sentence id="1968">As soon as I finished really my teacher's seminary. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Finished it in late June, and in August I got married of that year. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2127">A: Maybe my mother wasn't -- you know, it took me a long time to grow up, to realize, to understand the circumstances of her life were not easy. </sentence><sentence id="2128">She was not the most communicative person. </sentence><sentence id="2129">And there were instances, I think, especially one that I recall that I was greatly disappointed by her. </sentence><sentence id="2130">She was supposed to come and visit me on a kibbutz, and there was only one bus a day that came with the caravans. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And I was waiting and waiting for her, and she never showed up. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And don't forget, there was no place to call. </sentence><sentence id="2133">I mean there no telephones. </sentence><sentence id="2134">There were no -- the grocer and some other -- the pharmacy had a telephone. </sentence><sentence id="2135">Nobody had phones at home. </sentence><sentence id="2136">So you couldn't pick up the phone and say, "Dear, I am sorry I couldn't come. </sentence><sentence id="2137">This and this happened." </sentence><sentence id="2138">So I had to wait for the mail to arrive as to why she didn't show up. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Well, she didn't show up because she traveled from Haifa to Tel Aviv, and she had a few hours to kill. </sentence><sentence id="2140">And she visited a friend, and she missed the bus. </sentence><sentence id="2141">And I couldn't get over it. </sentence><sentence id="2142">I couldn't get over it. </sentence><sentence id="2143">I'm not sure that I have gotten over it, because obviously I still mention it. </sentence><sentence id="2144">And my mother, may she rest in peace,    she's dead since "79. </sentence><sentence id="2145">That kind of a thing, it remained with me. </sentence><sentence id="2146">That maybe I felt it was more important for her to visit her friend. </sentence><sentence id="2147">I know it was not, and I'm sure that she was sorely disappointed that missed the bus. </sentence><sentence id="2148">I can imagine her feelings. </sentence><sentence id="2149">But in those days, you just did not communicate and say, "You have no idea how sorry I am or how upset I was, that I didn't -- and I'll make it up to you." </sentence><sentence id="2150">Whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2151">The facts were stated, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2152">My mother didn't -- she was a sensitive person, but she didn't know how to communicate in a sensitive way. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And so things like that and some other little episodes that caused, we had a good relationship with each other, but it wasn't a close, close warm relationship. </sentence><sentence id="2154">I hear sometimes people talk about their mothers, how much they miss them and how much -- how close they were. </sentence><sentence id="2155">How devastated they were. </sentence><sentence id="2156">Everything, you know, because their mother passed away. </sentence><sentence id="2157">I was very hurt when she passed away. </sentence><sentence id="2158">I loved her dearly. </sentence><sentence id="2159">I wasn't devastated, I hurt for her. </sentence><sentence id="2160">I hurt for the life that she had. </sentence><sentence id="2161">I understand her. </sentence><sentence id="2162">And ina way, I have forgiven for this or that little thing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2163">Our lives, the circumstances were horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="2164">I would not have wanted to be the mother in those years. </sentence><sentence id="2165">It was much easier to be a child. </sentence><sentence id="2166">Much, much easier. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q: Let's stop the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2210">End of Tape 2. </sentence><sentence id="2211">Tape 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2214">Q: You know, I think it seems that when your mother didn't show up on your kibbutz, it must have been very, very frightening because you had already lost one parent. </sentence><sentence id="2215">You had been separated from your mother from time to time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2218">A: What that meant in those days, it's not the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2219">It's not something that you can even comprehend in terms of your daily life today, because it wasn't the missing of the bus or the -- the pain that went with it was so overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="2220">The disappointment was so great, because you were a child alone in the kibbutz, and I probably have not seen my mother for six months. </sentence><sentence id="2221">And she just did not show up. </sentence><sentence id="2222">And it wasn't that she could come back with the next bus that will come the following day. </sentence><sentence id="2223">Because she had only that weekend, she had to go back to Haifa because she was working. </sentence><sentence id="2224">She was alone, she needed to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="2225">So the comprehension of nowadays where you could pick up a phone and you can call, and so what if she missed not coming? </sentence><sentence id="2226">So she will come next week. </sentence><sentence id="2227">That was not there. </sentence><sentence id="2228">When she missed that bus, there was this child that was still standing there waiting for her and conjuring up the imagination of being hugged and kissed and loved. </sentence><sentence id="2229">She just didn't show up. </sentence><sentence id="2230">And in the end, it took another six months, it wasn't so simple for me as a child. </sentence><sentence id="2231">I didn't have somebody to tuck me in and hug me every day. </sentence><sentence id="2232">So the disappointment was horrendous, and it obviously had to be horrendous if I still speak about it at 58 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2233">I should have gotten over it long ago, but this explains a little bit that I'm trying to think why was that little bit of estrangement between us. </sentence><sentence id="2234">It wasn't an estrangement, we were friends in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="2235">But in some ways, that warmth that we had for each other on my part changed. </sentence><sentence id="2236">Something changed in formula. </sentence><sentence id="2237">I guess she was needy in one way; I was needy in another way. </sentence><sentence id="2238">It's hard to explain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2260">Q: Maybe you could summarize for me what happened after high school. </sentence><sentence id="2261">You got married? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2264">A: I got married in 1957. </sentence><sentence id="2265">August "57. </sentence><sentence id="2266">To a young Israeli-born individual whose parents also came from Hungary, but they were in Israel before the war, in the "30s. </sentence><sentence id="2267">And so there was a sabra, and my husband right from the beginning spoke about the fact that he is -- he wants to come to America. </sentence><sentence id="2268">Because he felt that there was a future, there is something that he -- he felt the need to go. </sentence><sentence id="2269">That he needs to go, he needs to explore. </sentence><sentence id="2270">He needs to find himself. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And, of course, I never took him seriously, because neither one of us came from homes that could afford this luxury of going anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And I really didn't think we'll ever come to America, but so I let him talk. </sentence><sentence id="2273">But little did I know that at that time, I didn't know my husband well enough. </sentence><sentence id="2274">Now, I would believe him, but in those days, I did not. </sentence><sentence id="2275">And he really made arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="2276">He had an uncle in the United States in New York, and he made arrangements through a friend who was in New York to arrange for the papers and for his uncle to loan him the money to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2277">And once we'll get here, we'll work and we'll give him back the money. </sentence><sentence id="2278">And within six months, we were in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2279">So little did I know what I hit me. </sentence><sentence id="2280">We arrived in New York, and we worked in New York, the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="2281">I worked in a sweat shop sewing doll clothes, and my husband who finished the technical high school just like me, went to work as a tool and die maker in Brooklyn, New York. </sentence><sentence id="2282">And we were looking for a way of solving the situation. </sentence><sentence id="2283">Our friends talked us into teaching Hebrew school. </sentence><sentence id="2284">I had a teacher's certificate anyway as a teacher, and my husband decided to try it. </sentence><sentence id="2285">And we got a job as Hebrew school teachers in Schenectady, New York. </sentence><sentence id="2286">During the summertime, not to remain in New York for such a long time, we went to -- we got a job ina camp. </sentence><sentence id="2287">It's called Camp Ramah (ph), which is a Hebrew-speaking camp. </sentence><sentence id="2288">And really that was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2289">We spent the summer there, we    learned a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2290">And during the winter, we taught Hebrew school. </sentence><sentence id="2291">And at that point, we have decided that there has to be a purpose why we came. </sentence><sentence id="2292">We could not just leave Israel, leave our friends, leave our parents, leave the home, and spend some time teaching Hebrew school. </sentence><sentence id="2293">That wasn't enough. </sentence><sentence id="2294">So Simon started seriously studying for his SATs, and trying to learn by himself how to do -- how to take the tests and how to score. </sentence><sentence id="2295">And a year later, we felt that Schenectady, New York is too isolated a place for us. </sentence><sentence id="2296">This is just not -- wasn't the right place for two young people. </sentence><sentence id="2297">We were very, very lonely and alone there. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And after spending another summer in the summer camp, we got a job in Quincy, Massachusetts, which is south of Boston, 15 miles south of Boston. </sentence><sentence id="2299">And we went to teach there in a very lovely congregation, and Simon applied to BU and was accepted as an engineering student. </sentence><sentence id="2300">And so our life was set. </sentence><sentence id="2301">We both worked full-time as Hebrew school teachers, and Simon went to school. </sentence><sentence id="2302">And he graduated within four years, aeronautical engineering. </sentence><sentence id="2303">Then once that was done, we moved to New York. </sentence><sentence id="2304">At this stage of our lives in 1964, we were married about seven years or so, and we really -- already beforehand we really wanted to have children, start a family. </sentence><sentence id="2305">I couldn't have any children. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And so as a result, we started to look into adoption which was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="2307">In Boston they had the blue laws. </sentence><sentence id="2308">Only Jewish children can a Jewish couple adopt, and you could not adopt a child out of your faith. </sentence><sentence id="2309">We went to New York, we applied again for adoption. </sentence><sentence id="2310">The situation was very similar in those days and very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="2311">So Simon worked for Grumman Aircraft for two years, and I went back -- I left the Hebrew school teaching, which was a good job and wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2312">But I really desired a more creative job, and I wanted to design dresses. </sentence><sentence id="2313">Just really what. </sentence><sentence id="2314">I learned, and I was a dress designer for a children's manufacturer in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2315">When we realized that we will never be able to adopt a child in New York, two years later Simon looked for a job in California, Los Angeles. </sentence><sentence id="2316">Everybody told us that it's much easier to adopt children in Los Angeles, and that's the place for us to go. </sentence><sentence id="2317">And so we took off, literally took off. </sentence><sentence id="2318">Simon got a job through the Wall Street Journal with Litten Industries, and we arrived in Los Angeles, total strangers again. </sentence><sentence id="2319">The wandering Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2320">We arrived in Los Angeles, we did not know a soul. </sentence><sentence id="2321">I think we were in motel when we applied for adoption through the Los Angeles County of Adoption Agency. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And we started working: Simon at Litten; me as a dress designer. </sentence><sentence id="2323">Worked very hard, the two of us, to make end meet. </sentence><sentence id="2324">And nine months later we got our son, our first child. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And we named him Terrence, a nice Irish name. </sentence><sentence id="2326">And we gave him a Hebrew name, Alonim (ph) , which is an oak tree. </sentence><sentence id="2327">Nice and strong. </sentence><sentence id="2328">And actually we call him Terry or Alonim, depending on what the mood is. </sentence><sentence id="2329">And today he's 28 years old, he's married. </sentence><sentence id="2330">He lives up in Vermont with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And he has no children, and I don't think he desires to have any. </sentence><sentence id="2332">Later on, we adopted a little girl, and we named her Corey Tamar, but actually she's called Tammy. </sentence><sentence id="2333">So she's not using any of formal names. </sentence><sentence id="2334">Everybody calls her Tammy, and she's 24 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2335">And she's engaged to be married, and she's finishing her Master's Degree in social work at Boston University. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And a year from now in October, she'll get married to a wonderful young man who is at Yale Law School. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And the two children really -- the two children with us formed our little family. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And we raised them in California partially, and then Simon got a very good job over here in Washington and we moved. </sentence><sentence id="2339">Terry was four and a half years old, and Tammy was seven months old. </sentence><sentence id="2340">And we moved to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="2341">So I arrived with two little kids in a brand new area. </sentence><sentence id="2342">Again, not knowing almost anyone. </sentence><sentence id="2343">But before long, you know, we made friends, and we realized really that it doesn't matter where you live. </sentence><sentence id="2344">It's the friends that you make in the place that counts. </sentence><sentence id="2345">Every strange place is strange at first until you make some friends. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And now we have so many friends, we don't have time for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And we live out in Potomac. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2442">A: So many times. </sentence><sentence id="2443">I have moved so many times that it's really hard to count already. </sentence><sentence id="2444">Even within the city, you know, you live in one dwelling; then you move to another and you move to another. </sentence><sentence id="2445">And you go to summer and you come back and forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2450">Q: What were your biggest surprises when you arrived in New York? </sentence><sentence id="2451">Was it what you expected? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2454">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2455">No. </sentence><sentence id="2456">New York overwhelmed and scared me. </sentence><sentence id="2457">Number one, we arrived to New York in February, which is not the nicest month of the year to arrive. </sentence><sentence id="2458">Second, the dirty snow on the ground and the dark brick buildings which I was not -- my eyes were not used to. </sentence><sentence id="2459">All the buildings in Israel are painted white or off-white or, you know, they are light colors. </sentence><sentence id="2460">And I'm used to this tremendous sunshine shining on top of these bright buildings. </sentence><sentence id="2461">I felt closed in, it frightened me. </sentence><sentence id="2462">It really frightened me. </sentence><sentence id="2463">It took time. </sentence><sentence id="2464">Not a long time because we had to bounce on our feet, and we had to start going. </sentence><sentence id="2465">And we didn't have two pennies to rub together, two cents. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And if I tell you I used to go to work, I had ten cents to go on the subway one way. </sentence><sentence id="2467">In those days it was ten cents. </sentence><sentence id="2468">Ten cents to go down to work, and I had ten cents exactly to come back. </sentence><sentence id="2469">And on Saturdays, the train stopped somehow on a different avenue. </sentence><sentence id="2470">Same street, but different avenue. </sentence><sentence id="2471">It didn't stop -- the train didn't stop in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="2472">I remember being very confused and overwhelmed, and I was ready to leave the subway station. </sentence><sentence id="2473">But I wasn't sure where I was, and I -- in my little broken English, I spoke to the police officer. </sentence><sentence id="2474">And I said, "Are you sure that it's here? </sentence><sentence id="2475">Because if it's not here and I cannot get to work, I have only ten cents to go home. </sentence><sentence id="2476">And I won't be able to get there." </sentence><sentence id="2477">I remember him putting his hand in his pocket and giving me another ten cents, just in case. </sentence><sentence id="2478">Which was very nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2504">Q: Was a New York or the United States culturally shocking to you? </sentence><sentence id="2505">Just the way people lived -- or treated you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2508">A: I didn't go too much into the culture. </sentence><sentence id="2509">I just was overwhelmed, for instance, surprised. </sentence><sentence id="2510">We arrived to Simon's uncle, who was from Hungary, and his wife was also from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="2511">We arrived    and they were eating and watching television. </sentence><sentence id="2512">I found it terribly rude. </sentence><sentence id="2513">You know, I couldn't understand this. </sentence><sentence id="2514">I could not comprehend this. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Because, first of all, when we left Israel, they didn't have television so that's one detail. </sentence><sentence id="2516">But second, when guests or somebody -- stranger came to the house, then you sat and you talked to them around the table. </sentence><sentence id="2517">You didn't look at television. </sentence><sentence id="2518">I mean the cars and everything, everything was a bit overwhelming at first. </sentence><sentence id="2519">But in our own modest way, you know, we scaled things down. </sentence><sentence id="2520">We knew how to look inward and to know what we could afford and what we cannot afford. </sentence><sentence id="2521">I mean it wasn't that difficult for me to say -- we were not needy as much. </sentence><sentence id="2522">You know, we could easily say, "Well, we're not going to buy another skirt or another pair of pants or another shirt, because we just can't afford it this year. </sentence><sentence id="2523">It's okay, we'll do it next year." </sentence><sentence id="2524">And it next year came and we couldn't afford it, we'll say, "Well, that's okay, we'll do it the following year." </sentence><sentence id="2525">But both of us were very grounded, and we had very strong priorities. </sentence><sentence id="2526">We knew where it's at, we knew we had a goal. </sentence><sentence id="2527">Once we decided that we have a goal and Simon has to go to school and we are going to make it, not matter what, we always looked at the right things. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And to be very honest with you, we have many friends who came from Israel, and most of them got some help from home. </sentence><sentence id="2529">We really did it on our own. </sentence><sentence id="2530">Our parents could not afford to help us. </sentence><sentence id="2531">We helped our parents, we used to send money home, too. </sentence><sentence id="2532">Especially Simon's parents, because his father was ill, and he could no longer work. </sentence><sentence id="2533">Looking back then, we didn't think it was not fair. </sentence><sentence id="2534">We did not think that it is overwhelming -- we didn't think we were that unusual. </sentence><sentence id="2535">We really took it that this is fine, and everything that we did we felt, well, this is a step -- just a little step better than what we had before. </sentence><sentence id="2536">Every little success or every little achievement that we achieved, it was great. </sentence><sentence id="2537">Both of us are very optimistic people, and we really always felt that our cup is more than half full. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2569">Q: After fleeing Europe for Israel, did you ever feel conflicted about leaving Israel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2571">A: Very much so. </sentence><sentence id="2572">I felt so conflicted about leaving Israel, I never liked, for instance, my Hebrew name, Rifka, that I go by. </sentence><sentence id="2573">I felt so conflicted that I purposely did not use my Hungarian name, which I happen to like, Vera. </sentence><sentence id="2574">It's a much easier name to go by in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2575">My family calls me by that name. </sentence><sentence id="2576">But I was so proud that I came from Israel that I said no, I'm going to use my Hebrew name; I'm not going to use -- I totally eliminated my first name even as a middle name. </sentence><sentence id="2577">I felt very, very bad that we left Israel at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2585">Q: What -- is there anything that you can think of that really got you through all these early difficult experiences? </sentence><sentence id="2586">Any sort of survival skills? </sentence><sentence id="2587">Any special strengths or courage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2591">A: I think primarily it was the courage to bear, to try, to ask. </sentence><sentence id="2592">To -- not to be afraid. </sentence><sentence id="2593">To -- the worst could happen so somebody will say no to you. </sentence><sentence id="2594">I wasn't that afraid of rejection, or at least I thought that I may not take it that personally. </sentence><sentence id="2595">Especially on things that were not emotional. </sentence><sentence id="2596">You know, to dare a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2597">That's not to say that I was that courageous or that -- I'm sure that I had my fears, and I had my uncertainties and my feeling of not belonging in certain places. </sentence><sentence id="2598">It really takes time to belong to an area or to belong to a community, or to belong anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2599">A lot of people, a lot of Israelis are here for many, many years, and they love living here and so forth, but they feel a certain sense of not belonging. </sentence><sentence id="2600">I no longer have that. </sentence><sentence id="2601">I know that I have an accent. </sentence><sentence id="2602">I know that everybody can immediately detect that I was not born here, but I'm not afraid to speak my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2603">And I feel totally comfortable in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2604">I feel very much at home. </sentence><sentence id="2605">I don't have those conflicts anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2606">Because you have to make up your mind, it's either you belong or you don't belong. </sentence><sentence id="2607">If you don't belong, at least we have a free country. </sentence><sentence id="2608">Nobody's holding a gun to my head. </sentence><sentence id="2609">One can pick up and go back, and over there I speak without an accent. </sentence><sentence id="2610">But I feel totally comfortable here, and I must say that maybe with one or two exceptions that I don't even want to recall or I don't even remember, I feel that I have always been treated fairly in America. </sentence><sentence id="2611">I really    don't ever feel uncomfortable or not belonging or that somebody made me feel -- or was anti- Semitic to me. </sentence><sentence id="2612">I know it exists. </sentence><sentence id="2613">I mean nobody is blind to the facts of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2638">Q: Do you think that your strong grounding in religion was important to you throughout all of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
